Upgrade Now          NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Why Should You Buy This Growth Stock For The Next 5 Years?      Maham Fatima   January 19, 2025 5 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.16%       We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 5 Years.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other growth stocks. Kevin Mahn, President & CIO at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management, recently appeared on CNBC on January 6 to discuss the current market momentum and emphasize the need for investors to be selective in 2025 to find growth opportunities. He highlighted that while the MAG7 have led the market recently, their leadership may not continue. Mahn referenced historical data, noting that since 1950, there have been nine instances where the market rallied by 20% or more, with the market rising in eight of those cases. However, he pointed out that gains in the following year averaged only 3.6%, indicating a need for careful selection. He also acknowledged recent market trends, including a decline in the S&P 500's performance and a potential shift in investor sentiment following events like the Santa Claus Rally.  He predicted a path of lower interest rates, expecting 50 basis points of cuts this year instead of the previously anticipated 100 basis points. Mahn suggested that this environment would create favorable conditions for stocks and bonds but urged investors to diversify beyond mega-cap tech stocks into sectors like biotech and aerospace. Earlier on January 3 as well, Mahn noted that after two consecutive years of gains, a third year of strong performance appears unlikely. He remarked that it seems the Grinch got in the way of the Santa Claus rally this year. He also addressed concerns from investors tempted to time the market or sell their holdings. He warned against trying to time the market, describing it as often futile. Instead, he advocated for rebalancing portfolios to align with long-term goals and risk tolerance. He suggested that the economic landscape is changing, with lower interest rates and stagnant economic growth expected moving forward. Mahn advised investors to take profits from sectors that previously led the market and consider reallocating those funds into different areas poised for future growth. He highlighted biotech as a promising sector, noting bipartisan agreement on the need to lower drug prices. This shift could lead large-cap pharmaceutical companies to seek new revenue sources, making smaller biotech firms attractive.  Methodology We first sifted through online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years. We then selected the stocks with high 5-year revenue growth and high analysts' upside potential. From those we picked 15 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024.   Story Continues Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) The Stock That Will Go to the Moon According to Reddit?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 1935-Year Revenue CAGR: 62.43%Upside Potential as of January 15: 30.72%NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a technology company that designs and manufactures GPUs for gaming and professional markets. It also develops AI platforms, high-performance computing solutions, and self-driving car technologies to power industries like gaming, data centers, and automotive.Bank of America maintained its $190 price target for the company recently, suggesting a 27% upside potential. This optimism is driven by the release of Blackwell GPUs, which have already secured 12 months of orders. At CES 2025, the company unveiled Project DIGITS, a personal AI supercomputer powered by the new GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip. This compact system delivers petaflop-level AI performance while operating on standard household electricity. Project DIGITS is designed to empower researchers, data scientists, and students to develop and run large AI models locally. With 128GB of memory and up to 4TB of storage, the system is well-equipped to handle demanding AI workloads.In Q3 2024, NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) achieved record revenue of $35.1 billion, a 94% year-over-year surge. This was driven by a 112% increase in Data Center revenue to $30.8 billion. GPU revenue has demonstrated robust growth, surging 67% annually over the past three years. This performance is fueled by the demand for computing power necessitated by advancements in AI and ML.Manole Capital Management noted that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) more than tripled in value over the past year, due to strong AI-related demand and continued revenue growth that exceeds market expectations. Here's what it said in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\u201cAs of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date.\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.\u201d Overall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years. As we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Among the Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years?      Ashar Jawad   January 25, 2025 6 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.16%       We recently published a list of 15 Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years. 2024 was a stellar year for the US markets, driven by a strong performance in the technology sector. The broader market expanded by more than 23% during the year, marking two consecutive years of over 20% growth\u2014something that had not happened in nearly three decades.

The stock market benefited from a resilient economy that avoided recession, declining interest rates, and waning inflation. Analysts are projecting continued growth in 2025 amid strong economic data and optimism about a business-friendly Trump administration returning to power. In a note on December 30, Wedbush Securities analyst, Dan Ives, wrote that he expects a 25% surge in tech stocks as the new government focuses on slashing unnecessary regulations. On the other hand, Todd Rosenbluth, the head of research at VettaFi, anticipates that ETFs specializing in small-caps will make gains as investors broaden their market exposure with interest rates dropping. While the general outlook for 2025 is encouraging, analysts are also cautious about the potential downsides of the new administration\u2019s promised tariffs. Following his election victory, Trump has vowed to impose steep tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, which could increase manufacturers\u2019 costs. Ongoing geopolitical tensions in different parts of the world could also hurt the stock market. Can ChatGPT predict the stock market? A growing number of investors are turning to ChatGPT for stock suggestions. According to a 2023 survey, around 53% of the Millenials and 50% of Generation Z respondents had used the AI chatbot for investing advice. In contrast, older Americans were skeptical of the recommendations, with only 25% of the Baby Boomers saying they had used ChatGPT to buy stocks. While most financial analysts question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, Alejandro Lopez-Lira, a finance professor at the University of Florida, says that the chatbot may be able to predict stock movements. He used the platform to parse negative and positive headlines for stocks and predict returns for the following day. Lopez-Lira was surprised to find how good the results were. Whether or not tools like ChatGPT are effective in recommending stocks and predicting their trajectory remains a debate. However, they can be useful for investors researching the companies they want to invest in or when looking up definitions of financial terms they are unfamiliar with.

Upgrade Now          Jim Cramer Reveals the Next Best Time to Buy NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock      Fahad Saleem   January 13, 2025 6 min read        27   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.14%       We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top stocks from Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round. Jim Cramer in a recent program on CNBC recommended investors to avoid worrying when others are anxious or get too excited about something when others are also doing the same. Cramer said by the time an idea is common among investors, its price already reflects its potential. \u201cStocks don\u2019t quite travel at the speed of thought but they come pretty close. So the moment a preponderance of hedge fund and mutual fund managers decide that the economy is slowing, speeding up, or flatlining, stocks start trading like that\u2019s already the case. Usually, it takes some time to build that kind of consensus, which is why you rarely see these moves happening instantaneously. But once the big institutional portfolio managers are on the same page about something, you can be pretty darn confident that it\u2019s baked into the averages. This is some basic economics 101 stuff.\u201d  If every piece of news is priced in, does that mean it\u2019s meaningless to invest in stocks and you are better off putting your money in broader market funds? Cramer calls this idea \u201cbogus\u201d and says the market is pretty irrational at times and stocks are incorrectly priced, giving investors an opportunity. \u201cThe simple truth is that markets are not perfectly efficient. In fact, frankly, they\u2019re often irrational. They ignore things, make mistakes, misvalue information every day. And that\u2019s a major reason why anyone can make money picking individual stocks. These anomalies are everywhere, and they can be great for your portfolio,\u201d Cramer added.

With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).   Jim Cramer Reveals the Next Best Time to Buy NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock   NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Jim Cramer in a recent program said that there\u2019s \u201cnothing\u201d wrong with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and the company remains the market leader in the AI chips space. He also told investors when to buy NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares.   Story Continues \u201cNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is not being dethroned by any competitor. Even the companies trying to compete against it are faithful customers who have no choice but to develop alternatives because NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) can\u2019t supply enough chips to meet demand. I think it\u2019s just profit-taking after a monster run. It has been a monster run, hasn\u2019t it?On January 6, 2025, NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) founder and CEO Jensen Huang will present a keynote at CES, the largest tech expo in the world. He has previously used that podium to introduce many innovations that turned NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) into one of the most valuable companies on Earth.When will the stock bottom? I always let a stock tell me what to do. NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) bottoms when the stock rolls over at the open, then hits a level on big volume where it stops before working its way back up to well above where it opened. That, people, is called a crescendo bottom\u2014when everyone of size who wants to get out has done so. No need to jump the gun, but keep in mind that if you don\u2019t own any, you might want to wait until right ahead of the CES.\u201d Simply beating earnings estimates or announcing new products is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore, and the impact of high expectations will continue to weigh on the stock as growth cools.Nvidia\u2019s forward P/E ratio for the fiscal year ending January 2026 is around 31. An EPS surprise of 8.5% was not able to help the stock. A similar trend occurred following the second-quarter earnings after a 5.6% EPS surprise. It\u2019s difficult to see Nvidia maintaining a mid-70s gross margin by the end of 2026. Over the last two quarters, Nvidia has already reported a drop in its gross margin from 78% to 74.5%.Then there\u2019s competition. Amazon (AMZN) recently disclosed its Trainium 3 chip, which is set to be released by the end of 2025. The chip is expected to be twice as fast with 40% more power efficiency than the previous generation, manufactured on TSMC\u2019s (TSM) cutting-edge N3 technology. Reportedly, technology giant Apple (AAPL) will be a consumer of Amazon\u2019s new silicon.Manole Capital Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\u201cAs of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of top stocks from Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Analyst Says There\u2019s No \u2018Credible Competitor\u2019 to NVIDIA (NVDA)      Fahad Saleem   January 12, 2025 5 min read        4   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.13%       We recently published a list of 10 Latest AI News You Shouldn\u2019t Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other latest AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss. Anastasia Amoroso, iCapital chief investment officer, said in a latest program on CNBC that 2025 will be the year of AI software, data centers and power. She believes the AI rally is broadening out. \u201cArtificial intelligence, as I mentioned, is carrying itself over into 2025, and I think it\u2019s broadening. Last year, last two years, have been about semiconductors. I think this year has to be about AI software; it has to be about AI monetization, but it also has to be about AI power. And it\u2019s not just, you know, a number of headlines talking about data centers and how much they consume, and the fact that I think you need eight times the electricity to run an AI data center. It\u2019s an actual real trend, which I also think the Trump Administration is going to support as well.\u201d  The analyst also said investors should consider alternative investments or private markets as she believes private equity valuations are below the levels seen in public markets.

With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   Analyst Says There\u2019s No \u2018Credible Competitor\u2019 to NVIDIA (NVDA)   A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Will Rhind from GraniteShares said while talking to Schwab Network that he believes NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has almost no competition and the company has a bright future ahead. \u201cNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to be the market leader in AI. Its position really is so far out in front that it\u2019s difficult to foresee any credible competitor in the short to medium term.    Story Continues Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore, and the impact of high expectations will continue to weigh on the stock as growth cools.An EPS surprise of 8.5% was not able to help the stock in the most recent earnings. A similar trend occurred following the second-quarter earnings after a 5.6% EPS surprise. It\u2019s difficult to see Nvidia maintaining a mid-70s gross margin by the end of 2026. Over the last two quarters, Nvidia has already reported a drop in its gross margin from 78% to 74.5%.Then there\u2019s competition. Amazon (AMZN) recently disclosed its Trainium 3 chip, which is set to be released by the end of 2025. The chip is expected to be twice as fast with 40% more power efficiency than the previous generation, manufactured on TSMC\u2019s (TSM) cutting-edge N3 technology. Reportedly, technology giant Apple (AAPL) will be a consumer of Amazon\u2019s new silicon.Manole Capital Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\u201cAs of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date.\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations.

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) the Best Machine Learning Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?      Maham Fatima   January 15, 2025 5 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.97%       We recently published a list of 8 Best Machine Learning Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best machine learning stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Earlier this month, the president of Potomac Wealth Advisors, Mark Avallone, discussed the tech sector\u2019s investment potential. We talked about his sentiment in more detail in one of our other articles,\u00a012 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy in 2025. Here\u2019s an excerpt from it: \u201cHe noted that market rates have surged to all-time highs, with a significant increase of 1,800 points since October 2023. Avallone emphasizes that tech stocks, particularly cash-flowing mega-cap and large-cap companies, have shown resilience against rising rates, attributing this to improved operational efficiencies and ongoing technology spending even in a slowing economy.\u201d  Just like Avallone, several analysts hold a positive outlook for tech stocks as we go into 2025. Daniel Ives, Global Head of Technology Research at Wedbush Securities, thinks that the AI revolution is driving this strength in tech. On January 13, he appeared on CNBC and discussed the tech sector in light of rising interest rates and a strengthening dollar. He noted that the 10-year Treasury yield is currently at 4.75%, which is exerting pressure on tech stocks. Despite this, Ives expressed optimism about the sector\u2019s potential for growth and suggested that the current environment presents opportunities to invest in leading companies. He emphasized that capital expenditures are robust on the consumer side and indicate stronger-than-expected earnings ahead. Ives believes that we are only halfway through the bull market, which he views as a positive sign for tech stocks moving forward.  Ives discussed Palantir Technologies, which has faced selling pressure despite being a top S&P 500 performer last year. He warned that overlooking it due to high valuation could mean missing key market opportunities, similar to Oracle and Salesforce, especially with $2 trillion in expected AI capital expenditures. Ives also highlighted the impact of a rising dollar on tech, particularly Apple\u2019s vulnerability, while remaining bullish on the sector. He emphasized the need for diversification, citing Microsoft and NVIDIA as indicators for AI growth. His optimism about the tech sector highlights opportunities as investors navigate this landscape. Methodology We first sifted through ETFs, online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top ML stocks. We then selected the 8 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.   Story Continues Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) the Best Machine Learning Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a technology company that designs and manufactures graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets. It also develops AI platforms, high-performance computing solutions, and self-driving car technologies, and powers industries like gaming, data centers, and automotive.In Q3 2024, the company reported a record revenue of $35.1 billion, which marked a 94% year-over-year increase. The data center segment alone surged 112% to $30.8 billion. Its GPU revenue has surged 67% annually over the past three years, driven by the demand for computing power due to AI and ML advancements. The company holds a dominant 90% market share as a supplier of computing power.Bank of America recently highlighted NVIDIA Corp.\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) popularity among both institutional and retail investors. It maintains a $190 price target, which suggests a 27% upside. The release of Blackwell GPUs, with 12 months of orders already secured, is a key driver of this optimism. At CES 2025, the company also unveiled Project DIGITS, which is a personal AI supercomputer powered by the new GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip.This compact system delivers a petaflop of AI performance using a standard electrical outlet.

Upgrade Now          Citi Analyst Maintains Buy Rating on NVIDIA (NVDA) with $175 Price Target, Addresses Competition Concerns      Affan Mir   January 28, 2025 4 min read        5   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.14%       We recently compiled a list of the 10 Important AI News and Ratings for Today.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, claims to have developed a GPT-4-level model at a fraction of the usual cost, spending just around $6 million. It has emerged as a significant disruptor in the AI landscape, showing its ability to deliver high-performing models like R1 with remarkable efficiency in terms of time, cost, and hardware. Its open-source approach has contributed to its rapid adoption and has allowed developers worldwide to refine and expand its capabilities. The model\u2019s success raised questions about traditional AI development methods, especially the reliance on expensive, high-powered chips. DeepSeek's Impact on AI Chips Viewed as Limited by Experts On January 27, the tech stocks felt huge aftershocks from the news, and major tech indices fell significantly. However, many experts have a different opinion. BofA downplayed concerns about reduced AI semiconductor demand following DeepSeek's release of its R1 model, which reportedly outperforms leading Western AI models like GPT-4 while being developed with minimal resources.  While the model's efficiency could suggest a reduced need for high-end AI chips, BofA believes this worry is overstated. The R1 model likely relies on foundational models like Meta's Llama, where most infrastructure costs occur. Llama\u2019s parent\u2019s plans to increase 2025 capex by over 56% to $60-$65 billion highlight the rising demand for compute resources. BofA expects growing compute needs driven by foundational models, derivative techniques, and large-scale AI inference. Furthermore, Wedbush analyst, Dan Ives called it a buying opportunity for American tech stocks. He wrote in a post on X: \u201cDeepSeek is a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases\u2026launching broader AI infrastructure a whole other ballgame and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.\u00a0 It\u2019s about AGI for Big Tech and DeepSeek\u2019s noise. Also no US tech using this tech. Buying oppy.\u201d  For this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).   Story Continues   Jim Cramer Clears the Air on China, SK Hynix, and 'Owning NVIDIA (NVDA)'  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services.On January 27, Citi analyst Atif Malik maintained a Buy rating on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) with a price target of $175. The analyst discussed concerns raised by DeepSeek's LLM, R1, which reportedly achieved high performance at a fraction of the cost of U.S. competitors. While Malik acknowledged the potential of DeepSeek's achievement, he questioned whether its success was achieved without advanced GPUs, possibly using techniques like Distillation. Despite the possibility of global competition, Malik believes U.S. companies still have an edge due to access to advanced chips. He also pointed to recent AI capital expenditure announcements, such as Stargate, as signs of continued demand for cutting-edge GPUs.Overall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of the important AI stocks in news and ratings today. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) the Best NASDAQ Stock to Buy in 2025?      Maham Fatima   January 13, 2025 6 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.39%       We recently published a list of 12 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2025. As 2025 began, King Lip, chief strategist and partner at BakerAvenue Wealth Management expressed his bullish outlook for tech stocks in 2025 during a CNBC interview. He underscored a strong belief in the continued outperformance of tech stocks in 2025, driven by robust earnings growth and ongoing investments in AI infrastructure. Here\u2019s a short excerpt from our article on the\u00a012 Best Technology Stocks to Invest In for the Long Term\u00a0that covered this: \u201c\u2026Lip was against the prevailing sentiment among investors that big tech has peaked and that funds should rotate into smaller stocks or other themes. He argued that the recent weakness in the tech sector is largely due to technical rebalancing rather than a fundamental downturn. He emphasized that cash is likely to flow back into leading tech stocks, as they are projected to deliver the highest earnings growth in 2025, with an anticipated earnings increase of over 20%.\u201d  While acknowledging the high valuations of many tech stocks, he argued that they remain within acceptable historical norms. On January 9, Mark Avallone, president at Potomac Wealth Advisors, joined \u2018The Exchange\u2019 on CNBC to discuss why technology is the best sector to invest in right now. He asserts that above-target inflation will prevent the Fed from implementing further easing measures, countering the notion that higher rates are detrimental. He noted that market rates have surged to all-time highs, with a significant increase of 1,800 points since October 2023. Avallone emphasizes that tech stocks, particularly cash-flowing mega-cap and large-cap companies, have shown resilience against rising rates, attributing this to improved operational efficiencies and ongoing technology spending even in a slowing economy.  Avallone highlighted recent deal chatter in the tech sector, including Shutter Stock\u2019s potential acquisition in the uniform space, reflecting growing interest in technology-driven solutions. He is optimistic about the incoming administration\u2019s impact on economic efficiencies and stock performance, particularly for large-cap tech firms and mid-cap companies focused on innovation. He views Hilton favorably for its technological advancements in office management and cost efficiency. In the defense sector, he expressed confidence in Boeing\u2019s growth potential, emphasizing that significant cuts to defense spending are unlikely and that advancements in tech will enhance military capabilities.   Story Continues MethodologyWe first sifted through the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top 20 NASDAQ for 2025. We then selected the 12 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) The Best NASDAQ Stock To Buy in 2025?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). While its GPUs are well-known for gaming, they have become the driving force behind the AI revolution, as they power data centers, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.Strong demand for the company\u2019s Blackwell and Hopper platforms has driven data center growth, with H200 GPU sales reaching double-digit billions. In Q3 2024, the company reported a record revenue of $35.1 billion, marking a 94% year-over-year increase. The data center segment alone surged 112% to $30.8 billion. The company\u2019s GPU revenue has surged 67% annually over the past three years, driven by the demand for computing power due to AI advancements.NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) holds a dominant 90% market share as a supplier of computing power. It recently introduced its GeForce RTX 50 series graphics cards (including RTX 5090 and RTX 5080) which use the Blackwell architecture. These GPUs offer ~2x the performance of the previous generation and feature advanced AI technologies.Analysts believe that its stock surge is justified by many factors. Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives expects continued tech dominance driven by AI investments. Bank of America highlights the company\u2019s popularity among both institutional and retail investors. It maintains a $190 price target, which suggests a 27% upside. The release of Blackwell GPUs, with 12 months of orders already secured, is a key driver of this optimism.Manole Capital Management highlighted that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) more than tripled in value over the past year, driven by strong AI-related demand and continued revenue growth that exceeds market expectations. It stated the following in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\u201cAs of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date.\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year.

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Stock to Buy for High Returns in 2025?      Talha Qureshi   January 27, 2025 5 min read        1   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.69%       We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy for High Returns in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025. Market Outlook 2025 On December 17, 2024, J.P. Morgan released its market outlook 2025. The report expects the global economy to continue growing at a robust rate, however a sharp slowdown in China is expected. Regarding the equity market, the firm anticipates depressing trends across stocks, sectors, and themes. Analysts at the firm estimate the S&P 500 to be around 6,500 in 2025 with earnings per share of $270. The head of Global Market Research, Hussain Malik noted that the policies of the United States regarding trade, immigration, and regulatory policy will play a critical role in defining the year\u2019s outcome for the country and globally.  The report further elaborated on its anticipation of a depressed stock market by highlighting de-coupling central bank policies, uneven progress in disinflation, and ongoing technological innovation. Moreover, increased geopolitical tensions are also likely to add unusual complexity to the global stock market. Despite all this, the firm has bright expectations for the United States. It believes that the country will remain a key driver of growth due to factors such as an expanding business cycle, a robust labor market, increased capital spending related to AI, and active capital markets. On the other hand, Europe is expected to grapple with structural challenges, while emerging markets may face headwinds from persistent high interest rates, a strong US dollar, and trade policy issues. Lakos-Bujas, head of Global Markets Strategy at J.P. Morgan warned that a key risk to their base case involves disinflation stalling or reversing, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to consider interest rate hikes later in 2025 or early 2026. Such developments would necessitate a reassessment of their market outlook. Our Methodology To curate the list of the 10 best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s third-quarter hedge funds database. We checked the 25 most widely held stocks by hedge funds for 10-year growth rates from Seeking Alpha and ranked these stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).   Story Continues   Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Stock to Buy for High Returns in 2025?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)10-Year Revenue Growth: 37.84%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the key companies leading the development of AI with its semiconductors and highly powered AI GPUs. Its latest Blackwell GPU series, which is the successor to the H100 and H200 GPUs, is said to be the world\u2019s most powerful chip for AI workloads.On January 2, BofA maintained a Buy rating on NVDA, naming the stock to be one of their top picks for 2025. Vivek Arya, who is an analyst at BofA kept his price target of $190 stating that he believes the company\u2019s project valuations can grow up to $4 billion in the near future. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its fiscal fourth quarter of 2024 grew its revenue by 265% year-over-year to $22.1 billion, which easily surpassed the $20 billion outlook.Analysts expect that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) can be amongst the top gainers in 2025, particularly due to the recent announcement of a $500 billion AI project by newly inaugurated President Donald Trump. The President along with Oracle, SoftBank, and OpenAI has announced this project to assure the United States take leadership in this technology. This could be a potential opportunity for the company as OpenAI in its statements has named NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) to be one of the main technology partners for the project. It ranks 4th on our list of best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025.Infuse Asset Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q4 2024 investor letter:\u201cWe do still own some\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) as the forward multiple isn\u2019t egregious and it powers over 90% of AI workloads. This company is only becoming increasingly important though the hyperscalers are actively trying to save money through their own ASIC programs. The moat CUDA provides has been underestimated time and time again. While I don\u2019t think Nvidia has quite the upside as some of the other companies in the portfolio, it has a product that the best companies in the world literally can\u2019t get enough of.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Why Is Nvidia Corp (NVDA) Surging on Analyst Recommendations?      Jabran Kundi   January 15, 2025 3 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.69%       We recently published a list of 5 Stocks Surging On Analyst Recommendations. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks surging on analyst recommendations. The US market is green today, reflecting the optimism of the market participants. Some stocks are outperforming the broader market based on analyst recommendations. These recommendations pertain to the stock prospects in 2025 as the economy heads for recovery in a monetary easing environment.  Analyst recommendations often come with insights on the stock based on extensive research by the analysts involved. Even though this research has its limitations and biases, it gives investors an idea of which stocks to bet on to outperform the market. To come up with a list of stocks that are surging on analyst recommendations, we only considered stocks that received an analyst recommendation in the last 24 hours and have a market cap of at least $1 billion.   Why Nvidia Corp (NVDA) is Surging On Analyst Recommendations?   A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Nvidia stock doesn\u2019t really rely on analyst recommendations for a surge. But after a few bad days, Bernstein\u2019s positive outlook on the stock has helped soothe investors\u2019 nerves. Just yesterday, the White House introduced new rules to stop the sale of modern chips to China. Nvidia stands to lose business because of these restrictions, so the stock had a bad day. Investors are also keeping a close eye on Nvidia\u2019s troubles with the execution of its Blackwell GPUs. As much as the company keeps denying any issues, ramping up deliveries is a tough task, mainly because the equipment needed to support these GPUs is still not perfect.  Bernstein analysts believe these issues are only temporary. The sale of a certain type of Hopper GPUs to China, which the company introduced for the Chinese market by lowering the bandwidth available on the chips, is unlikely to be affected. So Nvidia\u2019s existing business is safe. Over the past few years, Nvidia\u2019s reliance on its China revenue has gone down from 25% to 15%, which means the country is now less likely to be affected by a trade war between the two countries. Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is 5th on our latest list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 193 hedge fund portfolios held NVDA at the end of the third quarter which was 179 in the previous quarter. Overall, NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of stocks surging on analyst recommendations. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.

Upgrade Now          Why Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD) Are Pulling Back Today      Larry Ramer   January 11, 2025 2 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.71%    QCOM   +0.48%       Chip makers Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) are falling about 3% and 5%, respectively today. Qualcomm (QCOM) indicated that it could look to compete with Nvidia in the PC graphics sector, while Goldman Sachs downgraded AMD stock.   Is Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Hottest Mega-Cap Stock of 2025?   Qualcomm Could Look to Take Market Share From Nvidia Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon told Yahoo Finance that his company was seeking to begin marketing top-notch PC graphics chips. The latter products are among Nvidia's core offerings, as the chip giant reportedly has an 88% share \"of the desktop graphics space.\"  Goldman Cuts Its Rating on AMD Goldman lowered its rating on AMD to Neutral from Buy and slashed its price target on the shares to $129 from $175. As reasons for the downgrade, Goldman cited lower demand for AMD's PC and server chips, along with its weaker-than-expected revenue from data centers. The bank wrote that it is \"increasingly concerned\" about the competition that AMD is facing from Arm-based chips, along with its generally tough competition. According to Goldman, these negative catalysts may weigh on the valuation of AMD stock. The Recent Price Action of Nvidia and AMD Nvidia is down 1.5% in the last month, while the shares are little changed in the past three months. As for AMD, it has sunk 11.5% and 30% during the same time periods. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Upgrade Now          Here\u2019s Why Jim Cramer Believes NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Is Redefining the AI Game      Ramish Cheema   January 14, 2025 8 min read        2   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.67%       We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 18 Stocks After Major AI Event. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed after major AI event. After the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Jim Cramer had a lot to talk about NVIDIA and other stocks. While you can take a look at what he had to say about Wall Street\u2019s favorite AI GPU stock by opening our full list, Cramer emphasized that there is a clear division in the stock market. He pointed out\u00a0 \u201cWell again I think that there\u2019s two markets. There\u2019s the healthcare market, the materials market, uh, the food and beverage market. David, that area is just wasteland.\u201d He shared that safety isn\u2019t on investors\u2019 minds when understanding the current stock market. I learned from my friend Michael Haley who is a demolition man that safety never takes a vacation,\u201d Cramer shared and added \u201cHe was not speaking about snacks. Because safety\u2019s last!\u201d  The CNBC host also commented on a recent report which shared that consumers might be able to save money by using GLP-1 weight loss drugs. According to him, \u201cIf you want to save some money, well, look it\u2019s four hundred dollars. That they\u2019re saving. And by the way, you know, the average person in this country, four hundred dollars, nice saving.\u201d Another segment that\u2019s caught his attention recently is the alcoholic beverages market. The Surgeon General\u2019s recent opinion of placing a cancer warning on these beverage bottles hasn\u2019t escaped Cramer\u2019s attention. However, he doesn\u2019t think a warning label will deter consumers. Cramer commented that in the aftermath of the Surgeon General\u2019s remarks, \u201cliquor\u2019s just being crushed.\u201d He recalled the Prohibition and shared \u201cAll I can tell you is that, we did this thing in prohibition, we had this thing called prohibition, it didn\u2019t work. That was a real way to wipe it out.\u201d Yet, even though the stocks are down, they might not have seen different performance had the warning not been issued. According to Cramer \u201cPeople don\u2019t wanna own these stocks anyways because of interest rates. It\u2019s just a double whammy.\u201d  Following a comprehensive press conference by President-elect Trump, bond yields soared as investors fretted about political stability. Cramer believes technology stocks are more resilient to rising bond yields but other sectors like healthcare suffer. Yet, according to him \u201cIf you were in healthcare right now you\u2019d be saying, what, if you\u2019re Rob Davis at Merck, you say like listen, things aren\u2019t that bad. But it doesn\u2019t matter because it\u2019s all caught up with bonds.\u201d   Story Continues One government official in Cramer\u2019s crosshairs was FTC chair Lina Khan. Cramer commented on the increased frequency of mergers and acquisitions in the US this year. \u201cI love these deals, David. They take out a competitor,\u201d he shared. \u201cYou can raise numbers. It\u2019s rationalizing the American industry. It\u2019s everything that a previous guest [Lina Khan] on this network, hated,\u201d according to Cramer. He also shared thoughts about Khan\u2019s actions against Jeff Bezos\u2019 eCommerce company. The case \u201cis about hurting small businesses,\u201d believes Cramer. However, he believes that it should have been about inflation instead. \u201cNever did she [Khan] ever say that it was about keeping prices down for the consumer. But inflation is the single biggest problem that we have in this country economically. And so she completely missed that boat. And then she injected Reagan into that,\u201d he opined.Finally, while materials, industrial, healthcare, and alcoholic beverage stocks are struggling, the \u201cMagnificent 7 is what moves things,\u201d said Cramer. He also believes that \u201cif Biden\u2019s legacy is that the Magnificent 7 did really well, well I mean given that I\u2019m a dollar sign represented by a man, I\u2019m thrilled.\u201dOur MethodologyTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on Tuesday.For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).  Here\u2019s Why Jim Cramer Believes NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Is Redefining the AI Game  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193Since these remarks were after NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s appearance at the CES in Las Vegas, Cramer went into quite a bit of depth about the company. At the CES, Huang explored a variety of AI applications in a keynote that appeared intent to shift the focus away from enterprise AI applications which have dominated the narrative so far. It covered industries such as robotics and automobiles, and an announcement that caught Cramer\u2019s attention was NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s plan to squeeze its Blackwell GPU into a laptop:\u201cFirst thing I\u2019m gonna say is that there\u2019s just a huge amount of people saying Amazon\u2019s gunning for NVIDIA. Well, Amazon, they play a good game of chess. No, they play checkers. After this, Amazon\u2019s a checker\u2019s play. Jensen\u2019s playing chess. Overall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed after major AI event. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): AI Revenue Soars with Data Center Growth      Usman Kabir   January 31, 2025 8 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.76%     ^GSPC   +0.63%      We recently published a list of Coatue\u2019s 35 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks. Artificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.  Investment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors. Companies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.  Read more about these developments by accessing\u00a010 Best AI Data Center Stocks\u00a0and\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Philippe Laffont of\u00a0Coatue Management\u00a0argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.   Story Continues Since the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.The growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.Read more about these developments by accessing\u00a030\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and\u00a0Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.Some investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.AI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.Some investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.As inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): AI Revenue Soars with Data Center Growth  NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. In the report for the fourth quarter of 2024, GAAP earnings per diluted share was $4.93, showing an increase of 33% from the previous quarter and up 765% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $5.16, showing an increase of 28% from the previous quarter and up 486% from a year ago. These metrics indicate strong financial performance driven by higher revenues and improved margins, positioning the company for continued success. Also, record quarterly data center revenue was $18.4 billion, showing an increase of 27% from the third quarter, indicating heightened demand for data center products or services, possibly driven by trends like cloud computing expansion. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has also launched AI foundation Models for RTX AI PCs. These models offered as NVIDIA NIM microservices, are accelerated by new GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, which feature up to 3,352 trillion operations per second of AI performance and 32GB of VRAM.Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Unstoppable Tech Stock to Buy Right Now?      Rizwan Siddiqui   January 31, 2025 5 min read        4   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.76%     ^GSPC   +0.63%      We recently published a list of 10 Unstoppable Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other unstoppable tech stocks to buy right now. The technology sector continues to be driven by rapid innovation and the adoption of cutting-edge technologies. Advances in technology are significantly impacting lives, industries, and economies worldwide, with the integration of AI and ML revolutionizing workflows, enhancing productivity, and creating new revenue opportunities. Organizations around the globe are undergoing digital transformation to stay competitive, streamline operations, improve customer engagement, and drive innovation in their products and services.  With substantial growth potential, the technology sector has consistently outperformed other sectors. In 2024, the S&P 500 Information Technology Sector Index rose by approximately 37%, outpacing the broader S&P 500 Index by an impressive 11.5%. This performance has led to skyrocketing market capitalizations for tech sector companies, prompting caution regarding high valuations. Following the market downturn triggered by DeepSeek\u2019s emergence, JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America, stated in an interview with BNN Bloomberg that while the market had reached incredibly high levels, macroeconomic concerns such as inflation and high interest rates persist. He also suggests that developments related to DeepSeek provided an excuse for profit-taking with a \u2018reset\u2019 occurring in tech stocks. Now the focus should shift to earnings and the actual benefits derived from those substantial investments. On a positive note, in his report on December 13, Adam Benjamin, Sector Portfolio Manager at Fidelity Investments, highlighted that the sector benefited in 2024 from outstanding results in the semiconductor industry, reflecting major corporate investments in AI infrastructure. He remains optimistic for 2025, as evident from his positive outlook: \u201cThe outlook for the sector in 2025 and beyond may be bright, as tech companies continue to innovate and digitization and automation become increasingly important in our lives. I believe the next phase of development could present opportunities for software firms, as the application layer begins to roll out generative AI agents across end markets, and as the full benefits of AI begin to be realized. Progress may not be linear, though, and investors must be mindful of stock valuations and the timing and potential impact of further technological advances in the field, as well as the broader macroeconomic environment.\u201d    Story Continues Our MethodologyTo identify the 10 best unstoppable stocks, we conducted extensive research to compile a list of fundamentally strong U.S.-listed companies that performed well in 2024 and are expected to continue their success in 2025. Our focus included technology companies with a market capitalization of $2 billion and above. We screened our coverage based on the following criteria: 1. Stock price should have outperformed the S&P 500 Index in 2024 (+22% rise in share price); 2. must have reported positive revenue growth over the last 5 years; 3. EPS growth for the next year is expected to be over 25%; 4. It should have a potential upside of at least 10%. Ultimately, the stocks were ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as per Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds, as of Q3 2024.Note: All pricing data is as of market close on January 28.At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) the Unstoppable Tech Stock to Buy Right Now?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Upside Potential: 36%Number of hedge funds: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) designs and manufactures graphics processing units (GPUs), system on a chip units (SoCs), and AI hardware and software. It primarily serves four major markets: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. For data centers, NVIDIA provides accelerated computing platforms and end-to-end networking solutions, including Quantum for InfiniBand and Spectrum for Ethernet, along with platforms for automated driving and AI Enterprise.NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) has evolved from a PC gaming GPU company to a dominant player in the accelerated computing space, offering full-stack computing infrastructure with data-center-scale solutions. The company\u2019s strength is evident in its commanding over 80% market share in GPUs. NVIDIA has greatly benefited from the growing adoption of AI and machine learning technologies, driving strong demand for its chips. The company\u2019s revenue, profitability, and market capitalization have surged since the introduction of GenAI models like ChatGPT.In the past year, NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock rose 109%, significantly outperforming the broader S&P 500 Index, which increased by only 24%. Despite a recent selloff triggered by news related to Deepseek, the stock remains a consensus Buy among analysts, who still see an upside of around 36%. Theo Mass, portfolio manager at Northcape Capital, recently remarked that the 17% overnight plunge in Nvidia shares was \u2018wildly overdone,\u2019 as it did not fundamentally change the growth outlook for NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA). Addressing concerns about Deepseek potentially hampering demand, Northcape Capital remains bullish on NVIDIA\u2019s outlook. As Mr. Mass stated:\u201cThe biggest game in town that these mega-cap tech companies and US chip suppliers are pursuing is still inference AI over the next five to 10 years. While training has been a significant start to the AI phenomenon, in five or 10 years, Deepseek will be a small start-up in the grand scheme of things. Nvidia has noted that 40% of their revenue is already related to inference AI, and they welcome some competition and optimization in these models. So, I\u2019m still bullish on Nvidia.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of\u00a0unstoppable tech stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Jim Cramer Says \u2018More Out Of China Means Less For NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)\u2019      Ramish Cheema   February 1, 2025 5 min read        9   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.83%       We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 10 Stocks & Says He's In Waiting For AI GPU Spending Clarity.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. In his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on whether the low AI development costs demonstrated by China's DeepSeek AI models would upend investor expectations of AI spending. Ever since the AI wave kicked off in November 2022, businesses have committed and spent hundreds of billions of dollars to procure AI GPUs and develop data centers to host them. The high spending requirements also led President Trump to announce a massive $500 billion Stargate project earlier this month.  However, data center stocks crashed on Monday and wiped out a trillion dollars of value as investors worried whether low AI development costs would mean that this spending would not materialize. Cramer is divided about the overall sentiment when it comes to AI spending after the DeepSeek selloff. He commented that the lower costs are \"the theme of the moment because some people saw it coming.\" Cramer added \"and yet they still ordered. That would be the Zuckerberg case, maybe the Musk piece.\" On the other hand, he outlined that others \"just say oh my, what am I in, I'm gonna go buy a double short NVIDIA.\" Finally, the CNBC host also shared a third category of people \"who think that it's [Wall Street's favorite AI GPU stock] a hand cream.\" While investors fretted about lower AI costs translating into weaker demand for items such as GPUs, another narrative questioned whether lower costs meant that AI development would open up to more firms and entities than the higher costs had previously permitted. Cramer admitted that this was possible, but added that it also meant that perhaps \"the monopoly rent that people feel that\" the premier GPU company \"was charging is gone.\" He added that he was in wait-and-watch mode when it came to AI spending.  Cramer noted several events that could signal to him that perhaps the narrative shift surrounding AI spending was permanent. One of his tests \"test would be, uh, is, Three Mile Island not going to be reopened? That would be one I need to hear.\" The second driver that might convince the CNBC TV show host of a paradigm shift for AI spending would be reports of \"any [GPU] order pullback. And I have not heard that yet.\" Cramer added \"But that's not, necessarily, what people are going to announce, 'listen, I've decided. . . If this thing only needs one-tenth of the power, one-tenth of the compute, well I'm going to cut my orders by nine-tenths.' I've not heard that yet, but this thing is. . . a steamroll.\"   Story Continues Our MethodologyTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 29th and mentioned in his Morning Take from his Investing Club morning meeting.For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Revolutionizing AI and High-Performance Computing  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193Cramer started his show once again by commenting on AI GPU giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The firm's shares have lost 12.6% this week after paring back some of their losses during the DeepSeek selloff. The tepid sentiment surrounding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is driven by investors' re-calibration of AI spending as they fear that lower costs demonstrated by China's DeepSeek might lead to significantly lower demand for the firm's GPUs. Here's what Cramer said about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA):On whether DeepSeek uncovers NVIDIA's liabilities \"Look I think that there's a perception that more is less. More chips, more people who know how to use them, more out of China means less for NVIDIA. NVIDIA's been quiet. But they may have advised people who look at CES, uh, post-interview. Not good enough. I think people have decided that we had a rebound. But the reality is that the order will decline. By the way therefore the power will decline. Because people are figuring out how to use more with less. And David, that's the big negative thesis. Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA (NVDA) the Stock That Will Go to the Moon According to Reddit?      Maleha Afzal   January 16, 2025 5 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.87%    RDDT   +0.74%     ^GSPC   +0.69%      We recently published a list of 11 Stocks That Will Go to the Moon According to Reddit. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that will go to the moon according to Reddit. Will the Market Broaden in 2025? The earnings season is upon us and the investors are excited to see how the market sets the pace for the rest of 2025. On January 14, Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments, appeared in an interview on\u00a0Wealth\u00a0at\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to share his outlook on the market and the sectors he expects to grow.  Martin shared that strategists have been putting out their target price for the S&P 500 since November 2024, which happens to be particularly wide. However, in 2025, the market is seeing one of the lowest rates of standard deviation in a while. In addition to that, the rate of return based on the targets in November is around 10% which is in line with the long-term average of the S&P 500. Based on this, Martin concluded that analysts are conservative with their estimates and are not willing to make bets on the outliers. With uncertain policies, inflation expectations, and interest rates, he believes that the market will either experience a \u201cdown market\u201d or a \u201cvery strong up-market\u201d by the end of 2025. Martin also added that he expects 15% overall earnings growth followed by a 10% rate of return, emphasizing that this combination may result in the contraction of multiples. He shared that the contraction may happen because of several factors, especially interest rates being higher than usual.  Martin is extremely bullish on the financials, information technology, and communication services industries. He also expects some growth in the healthcare sector as the market broadens out. He also suggested that an optimal product portfolio will include names with strong fundamentals and sound financial performance. He added that diversification is particularly important and emphasizes the need for cash in emergency situations. As Martin suggested, a safer portfolio is more diversified and involves names with stronger fundamentals. However, at the same time, some stocks are garnering immense traction from people on social media because of their growth potential and sound financial performance. Our Methodology To come up with the 11 stocks that will go to the moon we surfed through important threads and picked the 25 most popular stocks. We then examined the analyst upside for each stock and picked the top 11 with the highest upside as of January 14, 2025. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment as of Q3 2024 for each stock.   Story Continues Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) The Stock That Will Go to the Moon According to Reddit?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Analyst Upside as of January 14, 2025: 31%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading GPU maker driving innovation in artificial intelligence, gaming, creative design, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. Demand for NVDA\u2019s Blackwell AI chip grew significantly in the second half of 2024, which is expected to drive significant results in 2025. While the company is currently seeing delays in the shipment of its Blackwell chips, analysts continue to remain bullish on the stock.On January 3, the Bank of America revealed that NVDA remained a \u201csector top pick\u201d in 2025. Analyst, Vivek Arya, at BofA reiterated a buy rating on the stock and set a price target of $190. Arya also remains positive on NVDA\u2019s data center products lineup and projected upgrades to existing products in the second half of 2025.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is an AI powerhouse and there is no doubt about its position in the market. While analysts remain bullish, most investors are keen to see how the company handles shipment delays for its novel Blackwell chip in 2025.Infuse Asset Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q4 2024\u00a0investor letter:\u201cWe do still own some\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) as the forward multiple isn\u2019t egregious and it powers over 90% of AI workloads. This company is only becoming increasingly important though the hyperscalers are actively trying to save money through their own ASIC programs. The moat CUDA provides has been underestimated time and time again. While I don\u2019t think Nvidia has quite the upside as some of the other companies in the portfolio, it has a product that the best companies in the world literally can\u2019t get enough of.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 11th on our list of stocks that will go to the moon according to Reddit. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Reports 33% QoQ EPS Growth in Q3 2024, Driven by Exceptional Profitability and AI Innovation      Usman Kabir   January 30, 2025 6 min read        5   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.83%       We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs\u2019 35 AI Superstars. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. In September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.  Although the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.

Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.   Story Continues While dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom.Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.However, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector.Bruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.Our MethodologyFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs.

NVIDIA (NVDA): Is the DeepSeek Sell-Off a Wake-Up Call for AI Bulls? Here's Why  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. There are various reasons why this company makes an excellent investment. For instance, the report for the third quarter of year 2024 reflects the company's exceptional growth in profitability. For the quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share was $4.93, increasing 33% from the previous quarter and a 765% increase from a year ago. Additionally, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $5.16, increasing 28% from the previous quarter and 486% rise from the previous year. Moreover, the NVIDIA Cosmos platform plans to advance physical AI with new models and video data processing pipelines for robots, autonomous vehicles and vision AI. Lastly, the company aims to revolutionize graphics with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 GPU, the most powerful GeForce RTX GPU so far, with 92 billion transistors and delivering 3,352 trillion AI operations per second (TOPS).Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia stock plummets, loses record $589 billion as DeepSeek prompts questions over AI spending      Laura Bratton    Updated January 28, 2025 3 min read        370   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.89%    AVGO   +2.40%    AMD   +2.33%     ^SOX   +0.84%    MU   +0.33%      Nvidia (NVDA) stock dropped nearly 17% Monday, leading a sell-off across chip stocks and the broader market after a new AI model from China's DeepSeek raised questions about AI investment and the rise of more cost-efficient artificial intelligence agents. Nvidia's decline shaved $589 billion off the AI chipmaker's market cap, the largest single-day loss in stock market history.  Chinese startup DeepSeek released a new AI model on Jan. 20 viewed as a threat to OpenAI. American venture capitalist Marc Andreessen called the model \u201cone of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d The news came just a month after DeepSeek said one of its latest AI models cost just $5.6 million to train. OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 model cost more than $100 million to train.   The announcements spurred fears that AI models may begin to require fewer chips and energy than they currently use. Nvidia has become the world's largest company on the back of exploding demand for its high-end chips that help train and use AI models. \u201cIf DeepSeek\u2019s innovations are adopted broadly, an argument can be made that model training costs could come down significantly even at U.S. hyperscalers, potentially raising questions about the need for 1-million XPU/GPU clusters as projected by some,\u201d wrote Raymond James semiconductor analyst Srini Pajjuri in a note to investors Sunday evening. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    118.77 +3.34 (+2.89%)  As of 2:00:43 PM EDT. Market Open.     Advanced Chart    Chip stocks also dropped across the board Monday, with Broadcom (AVGO) down over 17%, Micron (MU) off almost 12%, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) down more than 6%. However, Pajjuri continued, \u201cA more logical implication is that DeepSeek will drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers to leverage their key advantage (access to GPUs) to distance themselves from cheaper alternatives.\u201d NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)   Follow    View Quote Details    105.92 +2.41 (+2.33%)  As of 2:00:43 PM EDT. Market Open.   AMD AVGO MU   Advanced Chart    Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon also called into question the $5.6 million training cost for DeepSeek\u2019s model, which \u201cdoes not include all the other costs associated with prior research and experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data.\u201d Rasgon believes DeepSeek's announcement was \"not really worthy of the hysteria that has taken over the Twitterverse over the last several days.\"   DeepSeek and Nvidia logos. (Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images)  \u00b7 NurPhoto via Getty Images Nvidia itself didn't seem too worried about the DeepSeek buzz, calling R1 \"an excellent AI advancement\" in a statement. Tightened US export restrictions announced in former President Joe Biden\u2019s final days in office could also add a threat to DeepSeek\u2019s ability to continue training new models. The new rules limit China\u2019s ability to buy Nvidia\u2019s AI chips through resellers and access chips in remote data centers. And China is restricted from importing the most advanced chipmaking machines required to make artificial intelligence semiconductors from the Dutch firm ASML (ASML).   Story Continues At the same time, the US is ramping up investment in its own AI infrastructure.President Trump last week announced the Stargate AI project, which plans to immediately invest $100 billion to build US data centers and other infrastructure \u2014 with funding from SoftBank, Oracle, OpenAI and UAE-based MGX \u2014 to power generative artificial intelligence. The project would include another $400 billion in spending over the next four years.Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Bluesky @laurabratton.bsky.social.

Following a blockbuster performance in 2024, the company now faces a new set of challenges that could influence its trajectory in 2025. Among these challenges are concerns raised by TF International Securities analyst Ming Chi-Kuo, who has flagged critical supply chain issues tied to Nvidia\u2019s highly anticipated GB200 NVL72 offering.The GB200 NVL72 is poised to be a game-changer for Nvidia, leveraging cutting-edge technology to deliver unprecedented computing power. Designed as a rack-scale solution with a 72-GPU NVLink domain, it promises up to 30x faster performance for real-time trillion-parameter language model inference, placing it at the forefront of generative AI capabilities. However, the advanced nature of this product has introduced complexity into its development and production timeline, leading to repeated delays that have raised red flags among investors and analysts alike.In this article, we\u2019ll take a closer look at the supply chain issues outlined in Kuo\u2019s report, the potential impact of these delays on Nvidia\u2019s growth story, and what this means for investors in 2025. Let\u2019s dive in.About Nvidia StockNvidia NVDA is a premier technology firm known for its expertise in graphics processing units and artificial intelligence solutions. The company is renowned for its pioneering contributions to gaming, data centers, and AI-driven applications. Its market capitalization currently stands at $3.23 trillion.After climbing nearly 179% last year, NVDA stock has shown subdued performance so far, with a slight increase of 1.6%\u00a0year-to-date. Analyst Raises Concerns Over GB200 NVL72 Mass ProductionOn Jan. 13, shares of Nvidia\u00a0dropped about 2% following comments from TF International Securities analyst Ming Chi-Kuo, who\u00a0raised concerns about the \u201clow\u201d visibility surrounding the mass production of the company\u2019s GB200 NVL72 offering. This uncertainty presents some short-term risks for the chipmaker and its supply chain.Notably, the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 is an exascale computer in a single rack. It incorporates 36 Grace CPUs and 72 Blackwell GPUs into a rack-scale design. The GB200 NVL72 is a liquid-cooled, rack-scale solution featuring a 72-GPU NVLink domain that functions as a single, vast GPU, providing real-time trillion-parameter LLM inference that is 30 times faster. The NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 includes the GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip, which integrates two high-performance NVIDIA Blackwell Tensor Core GPUs with an NVIDIA Grace CPU using the NVIDIA NVLink-C2C interconnect to the two Blackwell GPUs.\u00a0Kuo explained that the mass production schedule for the GB200 NVL72 has experienced multiple delays, with the latest postponement pushing it to the second quarter of 2025. Kuo predicts that shipments could total between 25,000 and 35,000 racks in 2025, significantly lower than the previous estimates of 50,000 to 80,000 racks. \u201cHowever, the biggest concern for market sentiment may not be the final shipment numbers themselves but rather the negative impact on market confidence from the repeated postponements,\u201d he stated in his blog.It\u2019s important to highlight that the GB200 NVL72 involves a more intricate development process than standard servers, owing to its cutting-edge technology. Despite Nvidia\u2019s strong supply chain, the complexity of this technology has extended the development timeline to between 1.5 and 2 years. Kuo said another postponement to the second half of 2025 wouldn\u2019t be surprising, warning that such a delay could \u201cundermine market confidence.\u201d Investor skepticism is growing as they seek \u201cclear evidence\u201d of mass shipments, including metrics such as supply-chain checks or revenue figures.Furthermore, the small shipments of the lower-spec GB200 and HGX models add to the uncertainty, providing limited reassurance to the market. Kuo mentioned that the forthcoming GB300 NVL72 might encounter similar production challenges, potentially delaying mass shipments until early 2026. However, the analyst highlighted that Nvidia\u2019s issues stem from supply constraints rather than weak demand, indicating that the company is unlikely to reduce orders unless further complications arise.\u00a0What to Expect from NVDA\u2019s Q4 Earnings ReportNvidia\u2019s\u00a0latest quarterly earnings were quite positive. The company posted record quarterly revenue of $35.1 billion, beating Wall Street\u2019s estimates by $1.95 billion. Notably, data center revenue, which comprised about 88% of total revenue, hit a record $30.8 billion in Q3, marking a 17% increase from the previous quarter and a 112% surge year-over-year. The growth was fueled by robust demand for the company\u2019s Hopper computing platform for training and inferencing of large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications. Its adjusted earnings per share stood at $0.81, topping expectations by $0.06. With that, the top and bottom line figures represent an annual growth rate of nearly 100%.However, the company\u2019s growth will likely decelerate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Analysts tracking the company forecast a 61% year-over-year increase in its adjusted EPS to $0.79 for Q4, with revenue expected to climb 72.09% year-over-year to $38.04 billion. These rates remain strong in absolute terms, of course. At the same time, they might not impress investors given the high expectations priced in NVDA\u2019s valuation multiples. Moreover, investors will keenly watch the company\u2019s outlook. Notably, the stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio (Non-GAAP) of 44.63x, which is roughly in line with its five-year average but remains 79.57% higher than the sector median of 24.85x. With that, any negative surprise in FQ4 results or guidance could trigger increased volatility in its stock price.\u00a0One cause for concern regarding the company\u2019s FQ4 revenue performance is\u00a0reports indicating\u00a0that orders for its Hopper GPUs were softer in November and December 2024. Consequently, this could hinder FQ4 revenue delivery.Another headwind for the company in 2025 is the ongoing U.S.-China chip war. This week, the White House\u00a0unveiled comprehensive new restrictions on the sale of advanced AI chips by Nvidia and its peers. The rules, scheduled to be implemented in one year, set limits on the amount of computing power that can be sold to most countries. In other words, those curbs limit the sale of AI chips from Nvidia and other leading manufacturers to data centers in the majority of countries.This rule \u201cthreatens to squander America\u2019s hard-won technological advantage\u201d by \u201cattempting to rig market outcomes and stifle competition,\u201d Ned Finkle, Nvidia\u2019s vice president of government affairs, said in a statement.What Do Analysts Expect for NVDA Stock?Overall, analysts maintain a positive outlook on Nvidia\u2019s long-term growth prospects, as reflected in their consensus \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating. Of the 43 analysts covering the stock, 36 recommend a \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d three suggest a \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d and four rate it as \u201cHold.\u201d The average price target for NVDA stock is $176.55, suggesting potential upside of 29.6% from current levels.

When securities fall below their 200-day moving average, it warns traders that the prior uptrend in a stock price could be on the verge of reversing course.Nvidia stock closed below its 200-day moving average on Monday, jumped back above it on Tuesday and Wednesday, but then fell back below it during Thursday's trading session.The stock traded at $119.70 on Thursday, below its 200-day moving average of $122.28.\n\nThe back-and-forth trading above and below the key threshold suggests that Nvidia is trading at make-or-break levels this week.Will Tamplin, a senior analyst at Fairlead Strategies, said the downside price action in Nvidia was a warning of more pain ahead.\"NVDA is seeing a hard test of its rising 200-day MA, near $122. We think the correction is likely to deepen further toward secondary support at roughly $110,\" Tamplin told Business Insider in an email.\n\nTamplin said momentum in Nvidia stock is to the downside in the intermediate term, defined as two to four months, adding that the stock had yet to hit oversold territory, which suggests more downside ahead.\"From a long-term perspective, momentum has fallen off since mid-2024, meaning that the primary uptrend is likely to become shallower or turn into a trading range environment for 2025,\" Tamplin wrote.David Keller, the chief strategist at Sierra Alpha Research, told BI that the breakdown in Nvidia was significant considering that the stock had been in a trading range since early November.\n\nKeller said it's a concerning sign that there had been no immediate \"buy the dip\" activity in Nvidia stock since Monday's sharp decline.\"Instead of an influx of buyers pushing NVDA back into the consolidation range, we've instead seen the price remain generally within the range of Monday's action,\" Keller wrote. \"Until and unless NVDA can regain the $130 level, we would consider this chart guilty until proven innocent.\"Ari Wald, the head of technical analysis research at Oppenheimer & Co., said Nvidia stock was unlikely to enter an immediate downtrend, nor likely to resume its two-year uptrend.\n\nInstead, Wald told BI that the stock should enter a sideways consolidation phase going forward.\"Typically, reversals out of a strong uptrend transition into a range rather than a downtrend meaning continued oscillations around the stock's flattening 200-day average would be reasonable over the coming weeks to months,\" Wald said via email.Wald is watching $140 as a resistance level for the stock, as well as $100 for a level of support.\n\nWhile he ultimately expects Nvidia to resume its uptrend in the long term \"based on what we see as middle-innings, growth-led, secular advance,\" Wald said, it makes sense for investors to wait for the uptrend to come back before buying the stock.\"A sidelines approach makes sense while the stock works off prior excesses through the balance of the current cycle,\" Wald said.And while Nvidia's decline this week has been significant, it's masking underlying strength in the broader market, Ryan Detrick, the chief market strategist at Carson Group, said.\n\n\"The bar is set quite high and these names need to report strong earnings to justify the current valuation,\" Detrick told BI, referring to Nvidia and some other chip-related stocks. \"But at the end of the day, rotation is the lifeblood of a bull market and to see rotation out of chips and into things like transports and financials\" might not be \"the worst thing,\" he added.Nvidia will get a chance to prove to investors that it's worthy of its premium valuation when it reports earnings after the market close on February 26.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Market\n\n\nMarkets\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\nYour Market View\n\n\nNAME / PRICE\n+ / -\n%\nDATE\n\n\n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n                          Disclaimer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n                See also:\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                    - Explore more categories\n                \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top stocks from Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round.Jim Cramer in a recent program on CNBC recommended investors to avoid worrying when others are anxious or get too excited about something when others are also doing the same. Cramer said by the time an idea is common among investors, its price already reflects its potential. \u201cStocks don\u2019t quite travel at the speed of thought but they come pretty close. So the moment a preponderance of hedge fund and mutual fund managers decide that the economy is slowing, speeding up, or flatlining, stocks start trading like that\u2019s already the case. Usually, it takes some time to build that kind of consensus, which is why you rarely see these moves happening instantaneously. But once the big institutional portfolio managers are on the same page about something, you can be pretty darn confident that it\u2019s baked into the averages. This is some basic economics 101 stuff.\u201d   If every piece of news is priced in, does that mean it\u2019s meaningless to invest in stocks and you are better off putting your money in broader market funds? Cramer calls this idea \u201cbogus\u201d and says the market is pretty irrational at times and stocks are incorrectly priced, giving investors an opportunity. \u201cThe simple truth is that markets are not perfectly efficient. In fact, frankly, they\u2019re often irrational. They ignore things, make mistakes, misvalue information every day. And that\u2019s a major reason why anyone can make money picking individual stocks. These anomalies are everywhere, and they can be great for your portfolio,\u201d Cramer added.

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193Jim Cramer in a recent program said that there\u2019s \u201cnothing\u201d wrong with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and the company remains the market leader in the AI chips space. He also told investors when to buy NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares. \u201cNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is not being dethroned by any competitor. Even the companies trying to compete against it are faithful customers who have no choice but to develop alternatives because NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) can\u2019t supply enough chips to meet demand. I think it\u2019s just profit-taking after a monster run. It has been a monster run, hasn\u2019t it? On January 6, 2025, NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) founder and CEO Jensen Huang will present a keynote at CES, the largest tech expo in the world. He has previously used that podium to introduce many innovations that turned NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) into one of the most valuable companies on Earth. When will the stock bottom? I always let a stock tell me what to do. NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) bottoms when the stock rolls over at the open, then hits a level on big volume where it stops before working its way back up to well above where it opened. That, people, is called a crescendo bottom\u2014when everyone of size who wants to get out has done so. No need to jump the gun, but keep in mind that if you don\u2019t own any, you might want to wait until right ahead of the CES.\u201d Simply beating earnings estimates or announcing new products is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore, and the impact of high expectations will continue to weigh on the stock as growth cools.Nvidia\u2019s forward P/E ratio for the fiscal year ending January 2026 is around 31. An EPS surprise of 8.5% was not able to help the stock. A similar trend occurred following the second-quarter earnings after a 5.6% EPS surprise. It\u2019s difficult to see Nvidia maintaining a mid-70s gross margin by the end of 2026. Over the last two quarters, Nvidia has already reported a drop in its gross margin from 78% to 74.5%.Then there\u2019s competition. Amazon (AMZN) recently disclosed its Trainium 3 chip, which is set to be released by the end of 2025. The chip is expected to be twice as fast with 40% more power efficiency than the previous generation, manufactured on TSMC\u2019s (TSM) cutting-edge N3 technology. Reportedly, technology giant Apple (AAPL) will be a consumer of Amazon\u2019s new silicon.Manole Capital Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter: \u201cAs of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date.\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of top stocks from Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockDisclosure: None.

While the chipmaker was falling head first to start the trading week, down 17%, or $589 billion, retail investors poured more than $560 million into the bruised shares.  After all, Nvidia is every retail trader\u2019s top stock, which explains why they were scooping up what institutional investors were dumping.  \ud83e\udd11 Retail Investors Get PaidThis strategy may have very well worked for the retail corner of the stock market. Nvidia jumped roughly 9% on Tuesday as concerns around DeepSeek\u2019s bombshell announcement eased. Now markets are eager to see whether DeepSeek could actually prove what they said (which caused investors to question their own choices).  Quick catch-up: China\u2019s AI startup DeepSeek unveiled its artificial intelligence model called R1. The company said it could pretty much do everything ChatGPT can do but at a fraction of the cost.  \ud83d\udd25 Nvidia ChallengedNvidia got hurt the most as it is the only company selling AI chips to big tech titans which then use these chips to build out their AI infrastructure. But if DeepSeek\u2019s claims are true, these tech titans would\u2019ve been overpaying by a lot.  Share price talk: with Tuesday\u2019s rise, Nvidia shares are underwater by nearly 7% on the year. And with January doing its final lap, the chipmaker is looking into a challenging year where it needs to go above and beyond if it wants to keep investors satisfied.

By spending more time \u2014 and thus compute \u2014 on a problem, the LLM can yield better results. This phenomenon is known as test-time scaling, where a model dynamically allocates compute resources during inference to reason through problems.\nReasoning models can enhance user experiences on PCs by deeply understanding a user\u2019s needs, taking actions on their behalf and allowing them to provide feedback on the model\u2019s thought process \u2014 unlocking agentic workflows for solving complex, multi-step tasks such as analyzing market research, performing complicated math problems, debugging code and more.\nThe DeepSeek Difference\nThe DeepSeek-R1 family of distilled models is based on a large 671-billion-parameter mixture-of-experts (MoE) model. MoE models consist of multiple smaller expert models for solving complex problems. DeepSeek models further divide the work and assign subtasks to smaller sets of experts.\nDeepSeek employed a technique called distillation to build a family of six smaller student models \u2014 ranging from 1.5-70 billion parameters \u2014 from the large DeepSeek 671-billion-parameter model. The reasoning capabilities of the larger DeepSeek-R1 671-billion-parameter model were taught to the smaller Llama and Qwen student models, resulting in powerful, smaller reasoning models that run locally on RTX AI PCs with fast performance.\nPeak Performance on RTX\nInference speed is critical for this new class of reasoning models. GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, built with dedicated fifth-generation Tensor Cores, are based on the same NVIDIA Blackwell GPU architecture that fuels world-leading AI innovation in the data center. RTX fully accelerates DeepSeek, offering maximum inference performance on PCs.\nThroughput performance of the Deepseek-R1 distilled family of models across GPUs on the PC.\nExperience DeepSeek on RTX in Popular Tools\nNVIDIA\u2019s RTX AI platform offers the broadest selection of AI tools, software development kits and models, opening access to the capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 on over 100 million NVIDIA RTX AI PCs worldwide, including those powered by GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs.\nHigh-performance RTX GPUs make AI capabilities always available \u2014 even without an internet connection \u2014 and offer low latency and increased privacy because users don\u2019t have to upload sensitive materials or expose their queries to an online service.\nExperience the power of DeepSeek-R1 and RTX AI PCs through a vast ecosystem of software, including Llama.cpp, Ollama, LM Studio, AnythingLLM, Jan.AI, GPT4All and OpenWebUI, for inference. Plus, use Unsloth to fine-tune the models with custom data.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA RTX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Honors Americas Partners Advancing Agentic and Physical AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Blackwell Powers Real-Time AI for Entertainment Workflows\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The federal government has wisely refrained from dictating the design, marketing and sale of mainstream computers and software \u2014 key drivers of innovation and economic growth.\nThe first Trump Administration laid the foundation for America\u2019s current strength and success in AI, fostering an environment where U.S. industry could compete and win on merit without compromising national security. As a result, mainstream AI has become an integral part of every new application, driving economic growth, promoting U.S. interests and ensuring American leadership in cutting-edge technology.\nToday, companies, startups and universities around the world are tapping mainstream AI to advance healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, education and countless other fields, driving economic growth and unlocking the potential of nations. Built on American technology, the adoption of AI around the world fuels growth and opportunity for industries at home and abroad.\nThat global progress is now in jeopardy. The Biden Administration now seeks to restrict access to mainstream computing applications with its unprecedented and misguided \u201cAI Diffusion\u201d rule, which threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide.\nIn its last days in office, the Biden Administration seeks to undermine America\u2019s leadership with a 200+ page regulatory morass, drafted in secret and without proper legislative review. This sweeping overreach would impose bureaucratic control over how America\u2019s leading semiconductors, computers, systems and even software are designed and marketed globally. And by attempting to rig market outcomes and stifle competition \u2014 the lifeblood of innovation \u2014 the Biden Administration\u2019s new rule threatens to squander America\u2019s hard-won technological advantage.\nWhile cloaked in the guise of an \u201canti-China\u201d measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance U.S. security. The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology that is already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware. Rather than mitigate any threat, the new Biden rules would only weaken America\u2019s global competitiveness, undermining the innovation that has kept the U.S. ahead.\nAlthough the rule is not enforceable for 120 days, it is already undercutting U.S. interests. As the first Trump Administration demonstrated, America wins through innovation, competition and by sharing our technologies with the world \u2014 not by retreating behind a wall of government overreach. We look forward to a return to policies that strengthen American leadership, bolster our economy and preserve our competitive edge in AI and beyond.\nNed Finkle is vice president of government affairs at NVIDIA.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Honors Americas Partners Advancing Agentic and Physical AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Blackwell Powers Real-Time AI for Entertainment Workflows\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Blackwell architecture innovations and DLSS 4 mean the GeForce RTX 5090 GPU outperforms the GeForce RTX 4090 GPU by up to 2x.\nGeForce Blackwell comes to laptops with all the features of desktop models, bringing a considerable upgrade to portable computing, including extraordinary graphics capabilities and remarkable efficiency. The Blackwell generation of NVIDIA Max-Q technology extends battery life by up to 40%, and includes thin and light laptops that maintain their sleek design without sacrificing power or performance.\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Boosts Performance by Up to 8x\nDLSS 4 debuts Multi Frame Generation to boost frame rates by using AI to generate up to three frames per rendered frame. It works in unison with the suite of DLSS technologies to increase performance by up to 8x over traditional rendering, while maintaining responsiveness with NVIDIA Reflex technology.\nDLSS 4 also introduces the graphics industry\u2019s first real-time application of the transformer model architecture. Transformer-based DLSS Ray Reconstruction and Super Resolution models use 2x more parameters and 4x more compute to provide greater stability, reduced ghosting, higher details and enhanced anti-aliasing in game scenes. DLSS 4 will be supported on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs in over 75 games and applications the day of launch.\nNVIDIA Reflex 2 introduces Frame Warp, an innovative technique to reduce latency in games by updating a rendered frame based on the latest mouse input just before it is sent to the display. Reflex 2 can reduce latency by up to 75%. This gives gamers a competitive edge in multiplayer games and makes single-player titles more responsive.\nBlackwell Brings AI to Shaders\r\nTwenty-five years ago, NVIDIA introduced GeForce 3 and programmable shaders, which set the stage for two decades of graphics innovation, from pixel shading to compute shading to real-time ray tracing. Alongside GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, NVIDIA is introducing RTX Neural Shaders, which brings small AI networks into programmable shaders, unlocking film-quality materials, lighting and more in real-time games.\nRendering game characters is one of the most challenging tasks in real-time graphics, as people are prone to notice the smallest errors or artifacts in digital humans. RTX Neural Faces takes a simple rasterized face and 3D pose data as input, and uses generative AI to render a temporally stable, high-quality digital face in real time.\nRTX Neural Faces is complemented by new RTX technologies for ray-traced hair and skin. Along with the new RTX Mega Geometry, which enables up to 100x more ray-traced triangles in a scene, these advancements are poised to deliver a massive leap in realism for game characters and environments.\nThe power of neural rendering, DLSS 4 and the new DLSS transformer model is showcased on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs with Zorah, a groundbreaking new technology demo from NVIDIA.\nAutonomous Game Characters\r\nGeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs bring industry-leading AI TOPS to power autonomous game characters in parallel with game rendering.\nNVIDIA is introducing a suite of new NVIDIA ACE technologies that enable game characters to perceive, plan and act like human players. ACE-powered autonomous characters are being integrated into KRAFTON\u2019s PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS and InZOI, the publisher\u2019s upcoming life simulation game, as well as Wemade Next\u2019s MIR5.\nIn PUBG, companions powered by NVIDIA ACE plan and execute strategic actions, dynamically working with human players to ensure survival. InZOI features Smart Zoi characters that autonomously adjust behaviors based on life goals and in-game events. In MIR5, large language model (LLM)-driven raid bosses adapt tactics based on player behavior, creating more dynamic, challenging encounters.\nAI Foundation Models for RTX AI PCs\r\nShowcasing how RTX enthusiasts and developers can use NVIDIA NIM microservices to build AI agents and assistants, NVIDIA will release a pipeline of NIM microservices and AI Blueprints for RTX AI PCs from top model developers such as Black Forest Labs, Meta, Mistral and Stability AI.\nUse cases span LLMs, vision language models, image generation, speech, embedding models for retrieval-augmented generation, PDF extraction and computer vision. The NIM microservices include all the necessary components for running AI on PCs and are optimized for deployment across all NVIDIA GPUs.\nTo demonstrate how enthusiasts and developers can use NIM to build AI agents and assistants, NVIDIA today previewed Project R2X, a vision-enabled PC avatar that can put information at a user\u2019s fingertips, assist with desktop apps and video conference calls, read and summarize documents, and more.\nAI-Powered Tools for Creators\r\nThe GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs supercharge creative workflows. RTX 50 Series GPUs are the first consumer GPUs to support FP4 precision, boosting AI image generation performance for models such as FLUX by 2x and enabling generative AI models to run locally in a smaller memory footprint, compared with previous-generation hardware.\nThe NVIDIA Broadcast app gains two AI-powered beta features for livestreamers: Studio Voice, which upgrades microphone audio, and Virtual Key Light, which relights faces for polished streams. Streamlabs is introducing the Intelligent Streaming Assistant, powered by NVIDIA ACE and Inworld AI, which acts as a cohost, producer and technical assistant to enhance livestreams.\nAvailability\r\nFor desktop users, the GeForce RTX 5090 GPU with 3,352 AI TOPS and the GeForce RTX 5080 GPU with 1,801 AI TOPS will be available on Jan. 30 at $1,999 and $999, respectively.\nThe GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU with 1,406 AI TOPS and GeForce RTX 5070 GPU with 988 AI TOPS will be available starting in February at $749 and $549, respectively.\nThe NVIDIA Founders Editions of the GeForce RTX 5090, RTX 5080 and RTX 5070 GPUs will be available directly from nvidia.com and select retailers worldwide.\nStock-clocked and factory-overclocked models will be available from top add-in card providers such as ASUS, Colorful, Gainward, GALAX, GIGABYTE, INNO3D, KFA2, MSI, Palit, PNY and ZOTAC, and in desktops from system builders including Falcon Northwest, Infiniarc, MAINGEAR, Mifcom, ORIGIN PC, PC Specialist and Scan Computers.\nLaptops with GeForce RTX 5090, RTX 5080 and RTX 5070 Ti Laptop GPUs will be available starting in March, and RTX 5070 Laptop GPUs will be available starting in April from the world\u2019s top manufacturers, including Acer, ASUS, Dell, GIGABYTE, HP, Lenovo, MECHREVO, MSI and Razer.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\n\r\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: the benefits, impact, performance and availability of NVIDIA\u2019s products, services, and technologies, including GeForce RTX 50 Series Desktop and Laptop\u00a0GPUs, NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, fifth-generation Tensor Cores, fourth-generation RT Cores, GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition GPU, NVIDIA DLSS 4, NVIDIA Reflex, DLSS Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction models, NVIDIA Reflex 2, RTX Neural Shaders, RTX Neural Faces,\u00a0RTX\u00a0Mega Geometry, ACE technologies, NVIDIA NIM\u00a0microservices, Project R2X, RTX 40 Series\u00a0GPUs, NVIDIA\u00a0RTX\u00a0Remix modding platform and D5 Render, NVIDIA Broadcast, Studio Voice, Virtual Key Light,\u00a0GeForce\u00a0Blackwell, NVIDIA Max-Q technology,\u00a0GeForce\u00a0RTX\u00a05090,\u00a0GeForce\u00a0RTX\u00a05080,\u00a0GeForce\u00a0RTX\u00a05070 Ti, and GeForce RTX 5070,\u00a0GeForce\u00a0RTX\u00a05090 Laptop GPU, GeForce RTX 5080 Laptop GPU, GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Laptop GPU, GeForce RTX 5070 Laptop GPU; and third parties adopting NVIDIA\u2019s products and technologies are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

With Project DIGITS, the Grace Blackwell Superchip comes to millions of developers,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cPlacing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist, AI researcher and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI.\u201d\nGB10 Superchip Provides a Petaflop of Power-Efficient AI Performance \r\nThe GB10 Superchip is a system-on-a-chip (SoC) based on the NVIDIA Grace Blackwell architecture and delivers up to 1 petaflop of AI performance at FP4 precision.\nGB10 features an NVIDIA Blackwell GPU with latest-generation CUDA\u00ae cores and fifth-generation Tensor Cores, connected via NVLink\u00ae-C2C chip-to-chip interconnect to a high-performance NVIDIA Grace\u2122 CPU, which includes 20 power-efficient cores built with the Arm architecture. MediaTek, a market leader in Arm-based SoC designs, collaborated on the design of GB10, contributing to its best-in-class power efficiency, performance and connectivity.\nThe GB10 Superchip enables Project DIGITS to deliver powerful performance using only a standard electrical outlet. Each Project DIGITS features 128GB of unified, coherent memory and up to 4TB of NVMe storage. With the supercomputer, developers can run up to 200-billion-parameter large language models to supercharge AI innovation. In addition, using NVIDIA ConnectX\u00ae networking, two Project DIGITS AI supercomputers can be linked to run up to 405-billion-parameter models.\nGrace Blackwell AI Supercomputing Within Reach\r\nWith the Grace Blackwell architecture, enterprises and researchers can prototype, fine-tune and test models on local Project DIGITS systems running Linux-based NVIDIA DGX OS, and then deploy them seamlessly on NVIDIA DGX Cloud\u2122, accelerated cloud instances or data center infrastructure.\nThis allows developers to prototype AI on Project DIGITS and then scale on cloud or data center infrastructure, using the same Grace Blackwell architecture and the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform.\nProject DIGITS users can access an extensive library of NVIDIA AI software for experimentation and prototyping, including software development kits, orchestration tools, frameworks and models available in the NVIDIA NGC catalog and on the NVIDIA Developer portal. Developers can fine-tune models with the NVIDIA NeMo\u2122 framework, accelerate data science with NVIDIA RAPIDS\u2122 libraries and run common frameworks such as PyTorch, Python and Jupyter notebooks.\nTo build agentic AI applications, users can also harness NVIDIA Blueprints and NVIDIA NIM\u2122 microservices, which are available for research, development and testing via the NVIDIA Developer Program. When AI applications are ready to move from experimentation to production environments, the NVIDIA AI Enterprise license provides enterprise-grade security, support and product releases of NVIDIA AI software.\u00a0\nAvailability\r\nProject DIGITS will be available in May from NVIDIA and top partners, starting at $3,000.

This massive performance improvement on GeForce RTX 5090 graphics cards unlocks stunning 4K 240 FPS fully ray-traced gaming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the GeForce RTX 5090, DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation multiplies performance by over 8X versus traditional brute force rendering in this Cyberpunk 2077 scene, PC latency is halved for more responsive gameplay, and image quality is further enhanced\nDLSS 4 also introduces the biggest upgrade to its AI models since the release of DLSS 2.0 in 2020.\nDLSS Ray Reconstruction, DLSS Super Resolution, and DLAA will now be powered by the graphics industry\u2019s first real-time application of \u2018transformers\u2019, the same advanced architecture powering frontier AI models like ChatGPT, Flux, and Gemini. DLSS transformer models improve image quality with improved temporal stability, less ghosting, and higher detail in motion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch NVIDIA\u2019s Bryan Catanzaro and Edward Liu walk through DLSS 4\nAlongside the availability of GeForce RTX 50 Series, NVIDIA app users will be able to upgrade games and apps to use these enhancements.\n75 DLSS games and apps featuring Frame Generation can be upgraded to Multi Frame Generation on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs.\nFor those same games, Frame Generation gets an upgrade for GeForce RTX 50 Series and GeForce 40 Series GPUs, boosting performance while reducing VRAM usage.\nAnd on all GeForce RTX GPUs, DLSS games with Ray Reconstruction, Super Resolution, and DLAA can be upgraded to the new DLSS transformer model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS Multi Frame Generation: Multiply Performance With GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs\nDLSS 3 Frame Generation\u2019s AI model uses game data such as motion vectors and depth, and an optical flow field from the GeForce RTX 40 Series Optical Flow Accelerator to generate one additional frame. Generating multiple frames was cost prohibitive since both the Optical Flow Accelerator and the AI model would be required for every new generated frame, and the performance cost would throttle the GPU, resulting in lower input frame rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation combines multiple Blackwell hardware, and DLSS software innovations to make generating multiple frames a reality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur new frame generation AI model is 40% faster, uses 30% less VRAM, and only needs to run once per rendered frame to generate multiple frames. For example, in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, this model provided a 10% faster frame rate, while using 400MB less memory at 4K, max settings, using DLSS Frame Generation.\nWe have also sped up the generation of the optical flow field by replacing hardware optical flow with a very efficient AI model. Together, the AI models significantly reduce the computational cost of generating additional frames.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaster frame rates and lower total VRAM consumption with the new frame generation model. Captured in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide on a GeForce RTX 5090, at 4K, with the highest in-game settings, and DLSS Frame Generation\nEven with these efficiencies, the GPU still needs to execute 5 AI models across Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, and Multi Frame Generation for each rendered frame, all within a few milliseconds, otherwise DLSS Multi Frame Generation could have become a decelerator. To achieve this, GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs include 5th Generation Tensor Cores with up to 2.5X more AI processing performance.\nOnce the new frames are generated, they are evenly paced to deliver a smooth experience. DLSS 3 Frame Generation used CPU-based pacing with variability that can compound with additional frames, leading to less consistent frame pacing between each frame, impacting smoothness.\nTo address the complexities of generating multiple frames, Blackwell uses hardware Flip Metering, which shifts the frame pacing logic to the display engine, enabling the GPU to more precisely manage display timing. The Blackwell display engine has also been enhanced with twice the pixel processing capability to support higher resolutions and refresh rates for hardware Flip Metering with DLSS 4.\nWorking in concert, our new hardware and software innovations enable DLSS 4 to generate 15 out of every 16 pixels with great image quality, smoothness, and latency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor games and apps, DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, Ray Reconstruction, and Super Resolution multiplies frame rates by up to 8X over brute-force rendering, and boosts frame rates by up to 1.7X when upgrading from Frame Generation to Multi Frame Generation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe New Transformer Model - Image Quality Improvements For All GeForce RTX Gamers\nDLSS 4 features a major architecture upgrade for DLSS Ray Reconstruction, DLSS Super Resolution, and DLAA with the graphics industry\u2019s first real-time use of a transformer-based model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviously, DLSS used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to generate new pixels by analyzing localized context and tracking changes in those regions over successive frames. After six years of continuous improvements, we\u2019ve reached the limits of what\u2019s possible with the DLSS CNN architecture.\nOur new DLSS transformer model uses a vision transformer, enabling self-attention operations to evaluate the relative importance of each pixel across the entire frame, and over multiple frames. Employing double the parameters of the CNN model to achieve a deeper understanding of scenes, the new model generates pixels that offer greater stability, reduced ghosting, higher detail in motion, and smoother edges in a scene.\nIn intensive ray-traced content, the new transformer model for Ray Reconstruction delivers a big uplift in image quality, especially in scenes with challenging lighting conditions. For example, in these scenes from Alan Wake 2, stability is increased on the highly-detailed chainlink fence, ghosting on the fan blades is reduced, and shimmering is eliminated on the power lines, improving the player\u2019s immersive experience in the third-person game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe transformer model for Super Resolution also shows promising results, and will be released as a beta to enable users to explore the improvements and provide feedback before official release. The model has demonstrated better temporal stability, less ghosting, and higher detail in motion.\nThe new transformer model architecture will provide years of headroom to deliver continuous image quality improvements, as we have done with the CNN architecture for the past 6 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Horizon Forbidden West\u2122 Complete Edition, the new beta Super Resolution DLSS transformer model increases texture detail on Aloy's clothes and accessories, as well as overall clarity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n75 Games & Apps With Multi Frame Generation On Day 0\nBoth Multi Frame Generation and the new transformer models are built to be backwards compatible with existing DLSS integrations.\nWhen GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards hit store shelves, GeForce RTX 50 Series gamers will be able to multiply performance with DLSS Multi Frame Generation in 75 games and apps, and all GeForce RTX users will be able to experience the new transformer-based DLSS Ray Reconstruction, DLSS Super Resolution, and DLAA in over 50 games and apps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle\u2122, and Star Wars Outlaws\u2122 will be updated with native in-game support for DLSS Multi Frame Generation when GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs are launched. Black Myth: Wukong, NARAKA: BLADEPOINT, Marvel Rivals, and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 are following suit in the near future. And Black State, DOOM: The Dark Ages, and Dune: Awakening are all launching with DLSS Multi Frame Generation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor many games that haven\u2019t updated yet to the latest DLSS models and features, NVIDIA app will enable support through a new DLSS Override feature. Alongside the launch of our GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, after installation of a new GeForce Game Ready Driver and the latest NVIDIA app update, the following DLSS override options will be available in the Graphics > Program Settings screen, under \u201cDriver Settings\u201d for each supported title. \n\nDLSS Override for Frame Generation - Enables Multi Frame Generation for GeForce RTX 50 Series users when Frame Generation is ON in-game.\nDLSS Override for Model Presets - Enables the latest Frame Generation model for GeForce RTX 50 Series and GeForce RTX 40 Series users, and the transformer model for Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction for all GeForce RTX users, when DLSS is ON in-game.\nDLSS Override for Super Resolution - Sets the internal rendering resolution for DLSS Super Resolution, enabling DLAA or Ultra Performance mode when Super Resolution is ON in-game.\n\nUpgrading and enhancing games takes just a few clicks in NVIDIA app:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA app DLSS Override game support will be expanded as we finish testing the new models in more titles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4: The Best Gets Better\nNVIDIA DLSS has revolutionized gaming with its ever-improving AI technologies, multiplying performance, increasing image quality, and enhancing ray-traced graphics further than anyone imagined possible when we first debuted RTX and DLSS back in 2018. With the launch of DLSS 4 alongside GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, all GeForce RTX desktop and laptop gamers will receive upgrades, making their games and apps even better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay tuned to GeForce.com to learn about future DLSS developments, and in the meantime, check out all of our other GeForce RTX 50 Series announcements to see how we\u2019re further improving your experiences in games and apps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

These match the charts we showed to press at CES last week during Editors Day, and we wanted to share with everyone. These results include additional testing with the latest hardware and driver revisions.\nJanuary 28th, 2025: The NVIDIA RTX Blackwell GPU Architecture whitepaper is now available for download here.\nPowered by the NVIDIA Blackwell RTX architecture, GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards and GeForce RTX 50 Series laptops accelerate frame rates by up to 8X using NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, reduce\u00a0latency by up to 75% using NVIDIA Reflex 2, enable next-level graphical fidelity for gamers and creators with NVIDIA RTX Neural Shaders, and much more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs and laptops deliver game-changing performance, power transformative AI experiences, and enable creators to complete workflows in record time. Rewatch the NVIDIA Keynote by NVIDIA CEO, Jensen Huang, below, and read on for all of the details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeural Rendering Is The Next Era Of Computer Graphics\nNeural rendering is the next era of computer graphics. By integrating neural networks into the rendering process, we can take dramatic leaps forward in performance, image quality, and interactivity to deliver new levels of immersion.\nThe very first example of neural rendering was DLSS. We used lower resolution rendered frames as an input to a neural network, which was trained to output a full resolution frame. DLSS has since evolved to the point where it can generate entire frames and understand the composition of a scene including shadows, reflections, and occlusion to generate images that are better than native rendering. With the invention of DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, working in unison with the complete suite of DLSS technologies, we can multiply frame rates by up to 8X over traditional brute-force rendering and provide image quality that is better than native rendering.\nBut DLSS is just the beginning.\nWe've integrated neural networks inside of programmable shaders to create neural shaders. RTX Neural Shaders will drive the next decade of graphics innovations. They can be used to compress textures by up to 7X, saving massive amounts of graphics memory. And be used to create cinematic-quality textures, and even more advanced lighting effects in games.\nRTX Neural Faces offers an innovative, new approach to improve face quality using generative AI. Instead of traditional rendering, Neural Faces takes a simple rasterized face plus 3D pose data as input and uses a real-time generative AI model to infer a more natural face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe power of neural rendering with DLSS 4 can be seen in our new Zorah tech demo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell Architecture Innovations\nThe NVIDIA RTX Blackwell architecture has been built and optimized for neural rendering. It has a massive amount of processing power, with new engines and features specifically designed to accelerate the next generation of neural rendering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith up to 92 billion transistors, Blackwell is the most powerful consumer GPU ever created. The Blackwell streaming multiprocessor (SM) has been updated with more processing throughput, and a tighter integration with the Tensor Cores in order to optimize the performance of neural shaders. Blackwell is enhanced by several hardware and software innovations to improve Shader Execution Reordering. The reorder logic is twice as efficient, increasing the speed and precision of reordering which accelerates the performance of neural shaders.\nNew Blackwell Tensor Cores have been built with a massive amount of AI processing horsepower, and support accelerated processing of FP4 precision models. With FP4, Blackwell Tensor Cores can not only process models faster, but can do so while using less graphics memory.\nTo help support the frame pacing requirements of next generation DLSS Multi Frame Generation, the Blackwell architecture was built with enhanced hardware flip metering capabilities to provide the speed and accuracy required for a smooth, high-quality experience.\nBlackwell also features brand new RT Cores designed to ray trace massive amounts of detailed geometry. The RT Cores have 2X the ray triangle intersection rate of the previous generation, and enhanced compression designed to reduce memory footprint. This allows Blackwell GPUs to ray trace levels of geometry that were never before possible.\nBlackwell has also been enhanced with PCIe Gen5 and DisplayPort 2.1b UHBR20, driving displays up to 8K 165Hz.\nFor GeForce RTX 50 Series laptops, new Max-Q technologies such as Advanced Power Gating, Low Latency Sleep, and Accelerated Frequency Switching increases battery life by up to 40%, compared to the previous generation.\nAnd in order to feed all this processing power, Blackwell is equipped with the world's fastest memory - GDDR7 with speeds up to 30Gbps. With G7 memory, Blackwell GPUs can deliver up to 1.8TB/s of memory bandwidth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 50 Series Graphics Cards\nOn January 30th, the GeForce RTX 5090 and GeForce RTX 5080 arrive on store shelves. The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and GeForce RTX 5070 will be available starting in February.\nLimited NVIDIA Founders Edition models of the GeForce RTX 5090, GeForce RTX 5080, and GeForce RTX 5070 graphics cards will be available worldwide.

These non-playable characters (NPCs) traditionally follow strict rules designed to mimic intelligence, adhere to a guided story, and provide a scripted interaction with the player. However, with the rise of intelligent language models, game AI is primed for a truly intelligent overhaul.\u00a0\nAt CES 2025, NVIDIA is redefining game AI with the introduction of NVIDIA ACE autonomous game characters.\nFirst introduced in 2023, NVIDIA ACE is a suite of RTX-accelerated digital human technologies that bring game characters to life with generative AI.\nNVIDIA is now expanding ACE from conversational NPCs to autonomous game characters that use AI to perceive, plan, and act like human players. Powered by generative AI, ACE will enable living, dynamic game worlds with companions that comprehend and support player goals, and enemies that adapt dynamically to player tactics.\nEnabling these autonomous characters are new ACE small language models (SLMs), capable of planning at human-like frequencies required for realistic decision making, and multi-modal SLMs for vision and audio that allow AI characters to hear audio cues and perceive their environment.\nNVIDIA is partnering with leading game developers to incorporate ACE autonomous game characters into their titles. Interact with human-like AI players and companions in PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS, inZOI, and NARAKA: BLADEPOINT MOBILE PC VERSION. Fight against ever-learning AI-powered bosses that adapt to your playstyle in MIR5. And experience new gameplay mechanics made possible with AI-powered NPCs in AI People, Dead Meat, and ZooPunk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreaking Down Human Decision Making\nLet\u2019s begin with a simple model of how humans make decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the core of decision making is an internal conversation with one\u2019s self, repeatedly asking the same question: \u201cWhat should I do next?\u201d\nTo answer that question well, we need a few key pieces of data:\n\nInformation from the world around us\nOur motivations and desires\nMemories of prior events and experiences\n\nTo illustrate, let\u2019s say you hear your phone ring - an external perception generated by your senses. Should you answer it?\nYou remember you are expecting a call and don\u2019t want to miss it. Your motivations and memories combine to provide everything you need to determine what to do next. This is cognition.\nYou choose to answer the phone - the action and result of one\u2019s cognitions.\nThese perceptions, cognitions, and actions are often stored in our memories to recall for later decision making.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew NVIDIA ACE AI Models For Autonomous Game Characters\nMimicking these human traits with a traditional rule based AI system is impossible for a developer to code \u2013 the number of potential scenarios are infinite. But with the help of generative AI, and large language models trained on trillions of sentences describing how humans react to the world, we can start to simulate human-like decision making.\nNVIDIA ACE autonomous game characters are powered by a suite of generative AI models for perception, cognition, action, and rendering that enable developers to create AI agents in games that think, feel, and act more like a human.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerception - Models To Sense The World\nIn order for our SLMs to make good decisions, there must be a high frequency stream of perception data provided to the autonomous game character. Several models and techniques are used to capture this sensory data:\n\nAudio\n\nNemoAudio-4B-Instruct - A new Audio+Text in and Text out SLM that is capable of describing a soundscape in a gaming environment\nParakeet-CTC-XXL-1.1B-Multilingual - Transcribes multilingual audio to text\n \nVision\n\nNemoVision-4B-128k-Instruct - A new Audio+Image in and Text out SLM capable of simple spatial understanding\n \nGame State\n\nOne of the best sources of information in the game world is the game itself. Game state can be transcribed into text so that a SLM can reason about the game world\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCognition - Models To Think About The World\nBased on our esports research, most gamers make about 8-13 micro decisions a second called \u201csub-movements\u201d. These could be simple tasks like correcting aim direction or deciding when to use a skill, or more complex tasks like deciding to start reassessing strategy.\nIn general, the task of cognition is very frequent, which requires a small language model to perform the task to meet both latency and throughput requirements. ACE SLMs for cognition include:\n\nMistral-Nemo-Minitron-8B-128k-Instruct - A state of the art small language model that tops the charts in terms of instruction following capabilities, a key competency for Autonomous Game Characters\nMistral-Nemo-Minitron-4B-128k-Instruct - Same model, just smaller\nMistral-Nemo-Minitron-2B-128k-Instruct - And even smaller! Fits in as little as 1.5GB of VRAM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction - Models To Act In The World\nTaking action comes in many forms - from speech, to game actions, to longer term planning. To effectively perform actions, developers can use a combination of models and strategies:\n\nAction Selection - Given the finite actions that can be taken in the game, the SLM can choose the best appropriate action (as in inZOI below)\nText-to-Speech - Great text to speech models like Elevenlabs.io or Cartesia can be used to convert a text response to an aural response\nStrategic Planning - When processing and reasoning about a large corpus of data, these agents can reach out to larger models that can provide a higher level, lower frequency strategy. Often this is a cloud LLM API or a CoT (Chain-of-Thought) series of prompts to the SLM\nReflection - One of the important actions is to reflect on the results of prior actions. \u201cDid I choose the right thing?\u201d This action can produce better future actions over time and allows the character to self correct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemory - Models To Remember The World\nMemory is crucial for Autonomous Game Characters to be able to recall their prior perceptions, actions, and cognitions. It\u2019s also useful for tracking long term goals and motivations that may be less relevant in the immediate context. Using a technique called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), developers can use similarity searches to \u201cremember\u201d relevant information to the current prompt:\n\nE5-Large-Unsupervised - Using the NVIDIA In-Game Inference SDK, developers can use our optimized embedding model for embeddings within the game process\n\nUsing a combination of the models and techniques above, our partners have crafted the first autonomous game character experiences. Let\u2019s take a glimpse into the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutonomous Characters Come To Games - From Smart AI Teammates To Constantly Evolving Enemies\nNVIDIA ACE characters act as autonomous squad members, following orders, collecting and sharing loot, and engaging enemies. They offer strategic suggestions by independently perceiving and understanding dynamic events occurring around them, and take the necessary steps to complete an action or order, without additional prompting or assistance from the player.\nWith the power of AI, leveraging everything mentioned earlier, their autonomy and capabilities create dynamic gameplay encounters typically only experienced with human teammates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPUBG: IP Franchise Introduces Co-Playable Character\nPUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS is the genre-defining battle royale where players compete to be the last one standing. Featuring intense tactical gameplay, realistic combat scenarios, and vast maps, PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS has become a cultural phenomenon since its launch in 2017, and it\u2019s still one of the top five most played games on Steam each and every day.\nIn 2025, PUBG IP Franchise is introducing Co-Playable Character (CPC) with PUBG Ally. Built with NVIDIA ACE, Ally utilizes the Mistral-Nemo-Minitron-8B-128k-instruct small language model that enables AI teammates to communicate using game-specific lingo, provide real-time strategic recommendations, find and share loot, drive vehicles, and fight other human players using the game\u2019s extensive arsenal of weapons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPUBG IP Franchise's PUBG Ally and inZOI's Smart Zoi, rising as the world's first CPC (Co-Playable Character) built with NVIDIA ACE, are unlocking new and unique experiences. At KRAFTON, we\u2019re excited by the possibilities of ACE autonomous game characters, and how AI will enhance the way we create games.\u201d- Kangwook Lee, Head of Deep Learning Division, KRAFTON\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNARAKA: BLADEPOINT PC AI Companions\nIn March 2025, NetEase will release a local inference AI Teammate feature built with NVIDIA ACE for NARAKA: BLADEPOINT MOBILE PC VERSION, with NARAKA: BLADEPOINT on PC also adding the feature later in 2025.

Developed using Unreal Engine 5, inZOI's realistic graphics allow players to freely visualize their imagination with the game\u2019s easy-to-use creation tools. Customize your character's appearance and outfit, and build your dream home using a wide selection of freely-movable furniture and structures.\nBuilt with NVIDIA ACE, inZOI introduces Smart Zoi, Co-Playable Characters (CPC) that are more reactive and realistic than anything you\u2019ve seen before. Players will experience a comprehensive community simulation, where every ZOI in the city acts autonomously, driven by their life goals, and reacting to their environments and the events happening around them, leading to deeper levels of immersion and complex social situations.\nThrough a compelling comparison of pre-LM (Language Model) and post-LM scenarios, the video below demonstrates the profound impact of cutting-edge on-device LM technology on character interactions and behaviors in inZOI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA ACE Powers First AI Boss In MIR5\nNVIDIA ACE characters can also act as antagonists in single-player, co-op, and multiplayer games.\nUnlike conventional scripted bosses, you can battle enemies that continuously learn from player behavior and actions, countering your most-used strategies, abilities, and spells, forcing you to adapt. Fight bosses with dynamically adjusting attacks, requiring you to level up your IRL skills instead of simply memorizing attack patterns. And enter massively multiplayer worlds with persistent enemy factions who adapt to player tactics. The possibilities are endless, and with dynamic AI no two fights should be the same, making gameplay more exciting and engaging.\nWemade Next\u2019s MIR5, the latest installment in the immensely popular Legend of Mir franchise, will use NVIDIA ACE to power boss encounters. With ACE technologies, bosses will learn from previous encounters against players, adapting to tactics, skills, and gear used by players in the MMORPG.\nMIR5\u2019s AI will evaluate the current loadout and setup of the humans it's currently facing, compare those to past encounters, and decide on the best course of action to attain victory. Using ACE technologies, boss fights are unique, and going back to farm an already-beaten boss results in the fight playing out differently, keeping players on their toes and making gameplay more engaging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTogether with NVIDIA, we have begun a new era of gaming with NVIDIA ACE autonomous game characters. MIR5\u2019s AI bosses are a milestone moment in gaming, enabling unique boss encounters with every play session. We\u2019re excited to see how this technology transforms games.\u201c - Jung Soo Park, CEO, Wemade Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA ACE Powers New Game Genres With Conversational AI\nUsing NVIDIA ACE, several developers are crafting entirely new types of gameplay, where conversations, confrontations and interactions are driven exclusively by player prompts and AI-generated responses. These characters are not only conversational, but take action in games giving players new immersive ways of interacting with the game.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDead Meat\nMeaning Machine\u2019s Dead Meat is an upcoming murder mystery game where players can ask the suspects absolutely anything, using their voice or keyboard. Want to discuss the suspect\u2019s alibi? Probe them on the meaning of life? Confess your love? Your words hold power, and anything goes. Persuade them, manipulate them, threaten them, or even charm them into spilling their secrets. The Interrogation room is your sandbox, and your imagination is the only limit. What will you ask to get to the truth?\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt CES 2025, Dead Meat was shown running in real-time on a GeForce RTX 50 Series GPU, generating dialogue locally for the very first time. Previously, the game utilized LLMs in the cloud, but by partnering with NVIDIA, Meaning Machine created a version of Dead Meat that runs locally \u201con device\u201d.\nUsing Meaning Machine\u2019s Game Conscious AI\u2122, built with NVIDIA ACE and NVIDIA Mistral-NeMo-Minitron-8B-128K small language model (SLM), Eleven Labs\u2019 Text To Speech (TTS), and Open AI's Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR), the new version of Dead Meat delivers the same character depth that was being achieved in the cloud, but now the dialogue text is generated locally, on a GPU.\nTo achieve this dialogue quality, Meaning Machine fine tuned the NVIDIA small language model, using their own dialogue data, then integrated that model with their Game Conscious\u2122 system. Get ready to unleash your inner detective later this year, and stay tuned to Dead Meat\u2019s Steam page for the upcoming demo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI People\nAI People is a unique sandbox game from GoodAI where players create and play out scenarios with AI-driven NPCs that autonomously interact with each other, their environment, and the player, creating a dynamic, AI-generated narrative.\nBuilt with large language and speech recognition models, running locally on a GeForce RTX GPU or in the cloud, each NPC autonomously interacts with the environment and the objects within it. These NPCs learn, experience emotions, pursue their goals, dream, talk, and create a dynamic story for you to live through.\nTake a first look at this brand new gameplay experience in the AI People video below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZooPunk Tech Demo\nF.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch was a well-received Metroidvania-esque game, featuring DLSS, Reflex, and Ray Tracing. Its developer, TiGames, has now unveiled ZooPunk, a tech demo for a future project.\nBuilt with NVIDIA ACE, Audio2Face, and the first use of on-device in-game Stable Diffusion image generation, TiGames\u2019 AI tech demo leads players through conversations and interactions on a floating kitchen above a sea of clouds.\nSpeak with allies about intel gathered on a mission, and head to the pier to design a new warship that\u2019ll aid Rayton in his war against the Mechanoid Empire. Using locally-hosted Stable Diffusion image generation, request new ship artwork, and adjust its paintjob via Text To Speech inputs, rather than the adjustment of dozens of sliders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay tuned to TiGames website to learn more about their upcoming project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Audio2Face Accelerates Game Creation\nIn addition to driving autonomous game characters, developers are also using ACE technologies to drive AI-powered facial animation and lip sync in games with NVIDIA Audio2Face. Using Audio2Face, developers can easily animate characters who previously featured only basic lip movement. Voice actors record their lines, then they are fed into Audio2Face where character faces, eyes, tongues, and lips are animated accordingly, saving developers considerable time and money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlien: Rogue Incursion\nSurvios\u2019 Alien: Rogue Incursion is available now on PCVR and PSVR2 with NVIDIA Audio2Face technology. An action-horror Virtual Reality game, Alien: Rogue Incursion features an original story that fully immerses players within the terrors of the Alien universe. This labor of love was designed by Alien fans for Alien fans.\nDuring players\u2019 journey for survival, they will encounter a few humanoid survivors, all of which are powered by Audio2Face, generating realistic facial animation based on voice actors\u2019 recorded dialog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld of Jade Dynasty\nPerfect World Games\u2019 World of Jade Dynasty is an Unreal Engine 5-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game, and sequel to the developer\u2019s incredibly popular Jade Dynasty. In the game, you can experience the thrill of massive 100-player battles, the excitement of dungeon exploration, and the freedom of soaring through the clouds on your sword. Whether you're into PVP, PVE, or PVX, there's a unique path to immortality waiting for you.\nA new video demonstrates the developer\u2019s progress in adding NVIDIA Audio2Face to a large cast of characters in both Chinese and English, and goes behind the scenes to show how animations are dynamically adjusted based on different variables detected in the recorded voice acting. And should adjustments be needed, developers can of course dive in and make tweaks as they see fit, tailoring dialogue for specific scenes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA ACE: Autonomous Game Characters\nWith generative AI, players will experience new forms of gameplay that will take gaming to the next level. Top game developers are already starting to showcase the state of the possible with marquee titles like PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS, inZOI, MIR5, and NARAKA: BLADEPOINT MOBILE PC VERSION.

Instead of offering direct responses, AI models like DeepSeek-R1 perform reasoning through the chain-of-thought method to generate the best answer.\nPerforming this sequence of inference passes \u2014 using reason to arrive at the best answer \u2014 is known as test-time scaling. DeepSeek-R1 is a perfect example of this scaling law, demonstrating why accelerated computing is critical for the demands of agentic AI inference.\nAs models are allowed to iteratively \u201cthink\u201d through the problem, they create more output tokens and longer generation cycles, so model quality continues to scale. Significant test-time compute is critical to enable both real-time inference and higher-quality responses from reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, requiring larger inference deployments.\nR1 delivers leading accuracy for tasks demanding logical inference, reasoning, math, coding and language understanding while also delivering high inference efficiency.\nTo help developers securely experiment with these capabilities and build their own specialized agents, the 671-billion-parameter DeepSeek-R1 model is now available as an NVIDIA NIM microservice on build.nvidia.com. The DeepSeek-R1 NIM microservice can deliver up to 3,872 tokens per second on a single NVIDIA HGX H200 system.\nDevelopers can test and experiment with the application programming interface (API), which is expected to be available soon as a downloadable NIM microservice, part of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform.\nThe DeepSeek-R1 NIM microservice simplifies deployments with support for industry-standard APIs. Enterprises can maximize security and data privacy by running the NIM microservice on their preferred accelerated computing infrastructure. Using NVIDIA AI Foundry with NVIDIA NeMo software, enterprises will also be able to create customized DeepSeek-R1 NIM microservices for specialized AI agents.\nDeepSeek-R1 \u2014 a Perfect Example of Test-Time Scaling\nDeepSeek-R1 is a large mixture-of-experts (MoE) model. It incorporates an impressive 671 billion parameters \u2014 10x more than many other popular open-source LLMs \u2014 supporting a large input context length of 128,000 tokens. The model also uses an extreme number of experts per layer. Each layer of R1 has 256 experts, with each token routed to eight separate experts in parallel for evaluation.\nDelivering real-time answers for R1 requires many GPUs with high compute performance, connected with high-bandwidth and low-latency communication to route prompt tokens to all the experts for inference. Combined with the software optimizations available in the NVIDIA NIM microservice, a single server with eight H200 GPUs connected using NVLink and NVLink Switch can run the full, 671-billion-parameter DeepSeek-R1 model at up to 3,872 tokens per second. This throughput is made possible by using the NVIDIA Hopper architecture\u2019s FP8 Transformer Engine at every layer \u2014 and the 900 GB/s of NVLink bandwidth for MoE expert communication.\nGetting every floating point operation per second (FLOPS) of performance out of a GPU is critical for real-time inference. The next-generation NVIDIA Blackwell architecture will give test-time scaling on reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 a giant boost with fifth-generation Tensor Cores that can deliver up to 20 petaflops of peak FP4 compute performance and a 72-GPU NVLink domain specifically optimized for inference.\nGet Started Now With the DeepSeek-R1 NIM Microservice\nDevelopers can experience and download the DeepSeek-R1 NIM microservice, now in general availability on build.nvidia.com. Watch how it works:\n\nWith NVIDIA NIM, enterprises can deploy DeepSeek-R1 with ease and ensure they get the high efficiency needed for agentic AI systems.\nSee notice regarding software product information.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: AI Agents | Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA NIM | NVLink \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Honors Americas Partners Advancing Agentic and Physical AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Blackwell Powers Real-Time AI for Entertainment Workflows\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Built on the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, RTX 50 Series are the first consumer GPUs to add support for FP4 compute, boosting AI inference performance by 2x and enabling generative AI models to run locally in a smaller memory footprint, compared with previous-generation hardware.\nGeForce\u2122 has long been a vital platform for AI developers. The first GPU-accelerated deep learning network, AlexNet, was trained on the GeForce GTX\u2122 580 in 2012 \u2014 and last year, over 30% of published AI research papers cited the use of GeForce RTX.\nNow, with generative AI and RTX AI PCs, anyone can be a developer. A new wave of low-code and no-code tools, such as AnythingLLM, ComfyUI, Langflow and LM Studio, enable enthusiasts to use AI models in complex workflows via simple graphical user interfaces.\nNIM microservices connected to these GUIs will make it effortless to access and deploy the latest generative AI models. NVIDIA AI Blueprints, built on NIM microservices, provide easy-to-use, preconfigured reference workflows for digital humans, content creation and more.\nTo meet the growing demand from AI developers and enthusiasts, every top PC manufacturer and system builder is launching NIM-ready RTX AI PCs with GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs.\n\u201cAI is advancing at light speed, from perception AI to generative AI and now agentic AI,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cNIM microservices and AI Blueprints give PC developers and enthusiasts the building blocks to explore the magic of AI.\u201d\nMaking AI NIMble\r\nFoundation models \u2014 neural networks trained on immense amounts of raw data \u2014 are the building blocks for generative AI.\nNVIDIA will release a pipeline of NIM microservices for RTX AI PCs from top model developers such as Black Forest Labs, Meta, Mistral and Stability AI. Use cases span large language models (LLMs), vision language models, image generation, speech, embedding models for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), PDF extraction and computer vision.\n\u201cGeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs with FP4 compute will unlock a massive range of models that can run on PC, which were previously limited to large data centers,\u201d said Robin Rombach, CEO of Black Forest Labs. \u201cMaking FLUX an NVIDIA NIM microservice increases the rate at which AI can be deployed and experienced by more users, while delivering incredible performance.\u201d\nNVIDIA today also announced the Llama Nemotron family of open models that provide high accuracy on a wide range of agentic tasks. The Llama Nemotron Nano model will be offered as a NIM microservice for RTX AI PCs and workstations, and excels at agentic AI tasks like instruction following, function calling, chat, coding and math.\nNIM microservices include the key components for running AI on PCs and are optimized for deployment across NVIDIA GPUs \u2014 whether in RTX PCs and workstations or in the cloud.\nDevelopers and enthusiasts will be able to quickly download, set up and run these NIM microservices on Windows 11 PCs with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).\n\u201cAI is driving Windows 11 PC innovation at a rapid rate, and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) offers a great cross-platform environment for AI development on Windows 11 alongside Windows Copilot Runtime,\u201d said Pavan Davuluri, corporate vice president of Windows at Microsoft. \u201cNVIDIA NIM microservices, optimized for Windows PCs, give developers and enthusiasts ready-to-integrate AI models for their Windows apps, further accelerating deployment of AI capabilities to Windows users.\u201d\nThe NIM microservices, running on RTX AI PCs, will be compatible with top AI development and agent frameworks, including AI Toolkit for VSCode, AnythingLLM, ComfyUI, CrewAI, Flowise AI, LangChain, Langflow and LM Studio. Developers can connect applications and workflows built on these frameworks to AI models running NIM microservices through industry-standard endpoints, enabling them to use the latest technology with a unified interface across the cloud, data centers, workstations and PCs.\nEnthusiasts will also be able to experience a range of NIM microservices using an upcoming release of the NVIDIA ChatRTX tech demo.\nPutting a Face on Agentic AI\r\nTo demonstrate how enthusiasts and developers can use NIM to build AI agents and assistants, NVIDIA today previewed Project R2X, a vision-enabled PC avatar that can put information at a user\u2019s fingertips, assist with desktop apps and video conference calls, read and summarize documents, and more.\nThe avatar is rendered using NVIDIA RTX Neural Faces, a new generative AI algorithm that augments traditional rasterization with entirely generated pixels. The face is then animated by a new diffusion-based NVIDIA Audio2Face\u2122-3D\u00a0model that improves lip and tongue movement. R2X can be connected to cloud AI services such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT4o and xAI\u2019s Grok, and NIM microservices and AI Blueprints, such as PDF retrievers or alternative LLMs, via developer frameworks such as CrewAI, Flowise AI and Langflow. Sign up for Project R2X updates.\nAI Blueprints Coming to PC\r\nNIM microservices are also available to PC users through AI Blueprints \u2014 reference AI workflows that can run locally on RTX PCs. With these blueprints, developers can create podcasts from PDF documents, generate stunning images guided by 3D scenes and more.\nThe blueprint for PDF to podcast extracts text, images and tables from a PDF to create a podcast script that can be edited by users. It can also generate a full audio recording from the script using voices available in the blueprint or based on a user\u2019s voice sample. In addition, users can have a real-time conversation with the AI podcast host to learn more about specific topics.\nThe blueprint uses NIM microservices like Mistral-Nemo-12B-Instruct for language, NVIDIA Riva for text-to-speech and automatic speech recognition, and the NeMo Retriever collection of microservices for PDF extraction.\nThe\u00a0AI Blueprint for 3D-guided generative AI gives artists finer control over image generation. While AI can generate amazing images from simple text prompts, controlling image composition using only words can be challenging. With this blueprint, creators can use simple 3D objects laid out in a 3D renderer like Blender to guide AI image generation. The artist can create 3D assets by hand or generate them using AI, place them in the scene and set the 3D viewport camera. Then, a prepackaged workflow powered by the FLUX NIM microservice will use the current composition to generate high-quality images that match the 3D scene.\nNVIDIA NIM microservices and AI Blueprints will be available starting in February with initial hardware support for GeForce RTX 50 Series, GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080, and NVIDIA RTX 6000 and 5000 professional GPUs. Additional GPUs will be supported in the future.\nNIM-ready RTX AI PCs will be available from Acer, ASUS, Dell, GIGABYTE, HP, Lenovo, MSI, Razer and Samsung, and from local system builders Corsair, Falcon Northwest, LDLC, Maingear, Mifcon, Origin PC, PCS and Scan.\nLearn more about how NIM microservices, AI Blueprints and NIM-ready RTX AI PCs are accelerating generative AI by joining NVIDIA at CES.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: the benefits, impact, performance, and availability of our products, services, and technologies, including NVIDIA\u00a0RTX\u00a0AI PCs,\u00a0GeForce\u00a0RTX\u00a050 Series\u00a0GPUs, NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, GeForce GTX 580, Project R2X, NVIDIA ACE and\u00a0NIM\u00a0microservices, NVIDIA AI Blueprints, NVIDIA Grace Blackwell platform, Llama\u00a0Nemotron, NVIDIA\u00a0ChatRTX, NVIDIA\u00a0RTX\u00a0Neural Faces, NVIDIA Audio2Face-3D model, Mistral-Nemo-12B-Instruct for language, NVIDIA Riva, NeMo Retriever, FLUX NIM\u00a0microservice, GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080, and NVIDIA RTX 6000 and 5000 professional\u00a0GPUs\u00a0third parties using or adopting NVIDIA\u2019s products and technologies, and the benefits and impact thereof; and AI advancing at light speed, from perception AI to generative AI and now\u00a0agentic\u00a0AI are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

Using new AI techniques such as tokenization and large language and diffusion models, developers and researchers can now address longstanding hurdles to autonomy.\nThese larger models require massive amounts of diverse data for training, fine-tuning and validation. But collecting such data \u2014 including from rare edge cases and potentially hazardous scenarios, like a pedestrian crossing in front of an autonomous vehicle (AV) at night or a human entering a welding robot work cell \u2014 can be incredibly difficult and resource-intensive.\nTo help developers fill this gap, NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX APIs enable physically accurate sensor simulation for generating datasets at scale. The application programming interfaces (APIs) are designed to support sensors commonly used for autonomy \u2014 including cameras, radar and lidar \u2014 and can integrate seamlessly into existing workflows to accelerate the development of autonomous vehicles and robots of every kind.\nOmniverse Sensor RTX APIs are now available to select developers in early access. Organizations such as Accenture, Foretellix, MITRE and Mcity are integrating these APIs via domain-specific blueprints to provide end customers with the tools they need to deploy the next generation of industrial manufacturing robots and self-driving cars.\nPowering Industrial AI With Omniverse Blueprints\nIn complex environments like factories and warehouses, robots must be orchestrated to safely and efficiently work alongside machinery and human workers. All those moving parts present a massive challenge when designing, testing or validating operations while avoiding disruptions.\nMega is an Omniverse Blueprint that offers enterprises a reference architecture of NVIDIA accelerated computing, AI, NVIDIA Isaac and NVIDIA Omniverse technologies. Enterprises can use it to develop digital twins and test AI-powered robot brains that drive robots, cameras, equipment and more to handle enormous complexity and scale.\nIntegrating Omniverse Sensor RTX, the blueprint lets robotics developers simultaneously render sensor data from any type of intelligent machine in a factory for high-fidelity, large-scale sensor simulation.\nWith the ability to test operations and workflows in simulation, manufacturers can save considerable time and investment, and improve efficiency in entirely new ways.\nInternational supply chain solutions company KION Group and Accenture are using the Mega blueprint to build Omniverse digital twins that serve as virtual training and testing environments for industrial AI\u2019s robot brains, tapping into data from smart cameras, forklifts, robotic equipment and digital humans.\nThe robot brains perceive the simulated environment with physically accurate sensor data rendered by the Omniverse Sensor RTX APIs. They use this data to plan and act, with each action precisely tracked with Mega, alongside the state and position of all the assets in the digital twin. With these capabilities, developers can continuously build and test new layouts before they\u2019re implemented in the physical world.\n\nDriving AV Development and Validation\nAutonomous vehicles have been under development for over a decade, but barriers in acquiring the right training and validation data and slow iteration cycles have hindered large-scale deployment.\nTo address this need for sensor data, companies are harnessing the NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint for AV simulation, a reference workflow that enables physically accurate sensor simulation. The workflow uses Omniverse Sensor RTX APIs to render the camera, radar and lidar data necessary for AV development and validation.\nAV toolchain provider Foretellix has integrated the blueprint into its Foretify AV development toolchain to transform object-level simulation into physically accurate sensor simulation.\nThe Foretify toolchain can generate any number of testing scenarios simultaneously. By adding sensor simulation capabilities to these scenarios, Foretify can now enable\u00a0 developers to evaluate the completeness of their AV development, as well as train and test at the levels of fidelity and scale needed to achieve large-scale and safe deployment. In addition, Foretellix will use the newly announced NVIDIA Cosmos platform to generate an even greater diversity of scenarios for verification and validation.\n\nNuro, an autonomous driving technology provider with one of the largest level 4 deployments in the U.S., is using the Foretify toolchain to train, test and validate its self-driving vehicles before deployment.\nIn addition, research organization MITRE is collaborating with the University of Michigan\u2019s Mcity testing facility to build a digital AV validation framework for regulatory use, including a digital twin of Mcity\u2019s 32-acre proving ground for autonomous vehicles. The project uses the AV simulation blueprint to render physically accurate sensor data at scale in the virtual environment, boosting training effectiveness.\nThe future of robotics and autonomy is coming into sharp focus, thanks to the power of high-fidelity sensor simulation.

Cosmos world foundation models, or WFMs, offer developers an easy way to generate massive amounts of photoreal, physics-based synthetic data to train and evaluate their existing models. Developers can also build custom models by fine-tuning Cosmos WFMs.\nCosmos models will be available under an open model license to accelerate the work of the robotics and AV community. Developers can preview the first models on the NVIDIA API catalog, or download the family of models and fine-tuning framework from the NVIDIA NGC\u2122 catalog or Hugging Face.\nLeading robotics and automotive companies, including 1X, Agile Robots, Agility, Figure AI, Foretellix, Fourier, Galbot, Hillbot, IntBot, Neura Robotics, Skild AI, Virtual Incision, Waabi and XPENG, along with ridesharing giant Uber, are among the first to adopt Cosmos.\n\u201cThe ChatGPT moment for robotics is coming. Like large language models, world foundation models are fundamental to advancing robot and AV development, yet not all developers have the expertise and resources to train their own,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cWe created Cosmos to democratize physical AI and put general robotics in reach of every developer.\u201d\nOpen World Foundation Models to Accelerate the Next Wave of AI\r\nNVIDIA Cosmos\u2019 suite of open models means developers can customize the WFMs with datasets, such as video recordings of AV trips or robots navigating a warehouse, according to the needs of their target application.\nCosmos WFMs are purpose-built for physical AI research and development, and can generate physics-based videos from a combination of inputs, like text, image and video, as well as robot sensor or motion data. The models are built for physically based interactions, object permanence, and high-quality generation of simulated industrial environments \u2014 like warehouses or factories \u2014 and of driving environments, including various road conditions.\nIn his opening keynote at CES, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang showcased ways physical AI developers can use Cosmos models, including for:\n\nVideo search and understanding, enabling developers to easily find specific training scenarios, like snowy road conditions or warehouse congestion, from video data.\nPhysics-based photoreal synthetic data generation, using Cosmos models to generate photoreal videos from controlled 3D scenarios developed in the NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122 platform.\nPhysical AI model development and evaluation, whether building a custom model on the foundation models, improving the models using Cosmos for reinforcement learning or testing how they perform given a specific simulated scenario.\nForesight and \u201cmultiverse\u201d simulation, using Cosmos and Omniverse to generate every possible future outcome an AI model could take to help it select the best and most accurate path.\n\nAdvanced World Model Development Tools\r\nBuilding physical AI models requires petabytes of video data and tens of thousands of compute hours to process, curate and label that data. To help save enormous costs in data curation, training and model customization, Cosmos features:\n\nAn NVIDIA AI and CUDA\u00ae-accelerated data processing pipeline, powered by NVIDIA NeMo\u2122 Curator, that enables developers to process, curate and label 20 million hours of videos in 14 days using the NVIDIA Blackwell platform, instead of over three years using a CPU-only pipeline.\nNVIDIA Cosmos Tokenizer, a state-of-the-art visual tokenizer for converting images and videos into tokens. It delivers 8x more total compression and 12x faster processing than today\u2019s leading tokenizers.\nThe NVIDIA NeMo framework for highly efficient model training, customization and optimization.\n\nWorld\u2019s Largest Physical AI Industries Adopt Cosmos \r\nPioneers across the physical AI industry are already adopting Cosmos technologies.\n1X, an AI and humanoid robot company, launched the 1X World Model Challenge dataset using Cosmos Tokenizer. XPENG will use Cosmos to accelerate the development of its humanoid robot. And Hillbot and Skild AI are using Cosmos to fast-track the development of their general-purpose robots.\n\u201cData scarcity and variability are key challenges to successful learning in robot environments,\u201d said Pras Velagapudi, chief technology officer at Agility. \u201cCosmos\u2019 text-, image- and video-to-world capabilities allow us to generate and augment photorealistic scenarios for a variety of tasks that we can use to train models without needing as much expensive, real-world data capture.\u201d\nTransportation leaders are also using Cosmos to build physical AI for AVs:\n\nWaabi, a company pioneering generative AI for the physical world starting with autonomous vehicles, is evaluating Cosmos in the context of data curation for AV software development and simulation.\nWayve, which is developing AI foundation models for autonomous driving, is evaluating Cosmos as a tool to search for edge and corner case driving scenarios used for safety and validation.\nAV toolchain provider Foretellix will use Cosmos, alongside NVIDIA Omniverse Sensor RTX APIs, to evaluate and generate high-fidelity testing scenarios and training data at scale.\nGlobal ridesharing giant Uber is partnering with NVIDIA to accelerate autonomous mobility. Rich driving datasets from Uber, combined with the features of the Cosmos platform and NVIDIA DGX Cloud\u2122, can help AV partners build stronger AI models even more efficiently.\n\n\u201cGenerative AI will power the future of mobility, requiring both rich data and very powerful compute,\u201d said Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber. \u201cBy working with NVIDIA, we are confident that we can help supercharge the timeline for safe and scalable autonomous driving solutions for the industry.\u201d\nDeveloping Open, Safe and Responsible AI\r\nNVIDIA Cosmos was developed in line with NVIDIA\u2019s trustworthy AI principles, which prioritize privacy, safety, security, transparency and reducing unwanted bias.\nTrustworthy AI is essential for fostering innovation within the developer community and maintaining user trust. NVIDIA is committed to safe and trustworthy AI, in line with the White House\u2019s voluntary AI commitments and other global AI safety initiatives.\nThe open Cosmos platform includes guardrails designed to mitigate harmful text and images, and features a tool to enhance text prompts for accuracy. Videos generated with Cosmos autoregressive and diffusion models on the NVIDIA API catalog include invisible watermarks to identify AI-generated content, helping reduce the chances of misinformation and misattribution.\nNVIDIA encourages developers to adopt trustworthy AI practices and further enhance guardrail and watermarking solutions for their applications.\nAvailability\nCosmos WFMs are now available under NVIDIA\u2019s open model license on Hugging Face and the NVIDIA NGC catalog. Cosmos models will soon be available as fully optimized NVIDIA NIM microservices.\nDevelopers can access NVIDIA NeMo Curator for accelerated video processing and customize their own world models with NVIDIA NeMo. NVIDIA DGX Cloud offers a fast and easy way to deploy these models, with enterprise support available through the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform.\nNVIDIA also announced new NVIDIA Llama Nemotron large language models and NVIDIA Cosmos Nemotron vision language models that developers can use for enterprise AI use cases in healthcare, financial services, manufacturing and more.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: the benefits, impact, performance and availability of NVIDIA\u2019s products, services, and technologies, including NVIDIA Cosmos, NVIDIA API catalog, NVIDIA\u00a0Omniverse\u00a0platform, NVIDIA AI, NVIDIA CUDA, NVIDIA NeMo Curator, NVIDIA Blackwell platform, NVIDIA Cosmos Tokenizer, NVIDIA NeMo framework, NVIDIA\u00a0DGX\u00a0Cloud, and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform; third parties adopting NVIDIA\u2019s products and technologies, and the benefit and impact thereof; and the ChatGPT moment for robotics coming are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

These digital assistants can deliver the expertise of a company\u2019s best sales associate, stylist or designer, elevating customer satisfaction and workforce efficiency.\nUsing NVIDIA NeMo\u2122 microservices provided within the blueprint, these highly skilled AI shopping assistants can understand text- and image-based prompts, search for multiple items simultaneously, complete complicated tasks such as creating a travel wardrobe, and answer contextual questions like whether a product is waterproof.\nDevelopers can use the Omniverse platform in conjunction with a spatial-scanning solution to enable AI agents to present products in physically accurate virtual environments. For example, customers looking to buy a couch could preview how the furniture would look in their own living room.\nAI agents with advanced capabilities like these are designed to enhance customer experiences, drive higher conversion rates, lower product return rates and increase the average size of orders through highly intelligent, personalized suggestions of complementary products or upgrades.\n\u201cAI agents can elevate shopping experiences, turning what can be impersonal transactions into smarter, more enjoyable interactions,\u201d said Azita Martin, vice president of AI for retail, consumer packaged goods and quick-service restaurants at NVIDIA. \u201cShoppers everywhere want intelligent product recommendations, personalized interactions and lightning-fast response times. AI agents built using the NVIDIA AI Blueprint for retail shopping assistants can deliver this kind of exceptional, always-on service to every customer.\u201d\nAccelerating Retail AI Assistant Development\r\nSoftServe, a leading IT advisor to some of the most recognizable brands worldwide, today announced its SoftServe Gen AI Shopping Assistant, developed using NVIDIA\u2019s shopping assistants blueprint in early access.\nThe assistant can help browse product catalogs, search for items and access detailed product information quickly. A standout feature is its virtual try-on capability, allowing customers to visualize how products look on them directly through an online chat before making a purchase.\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s online, offline or hybrid shopping, retailers face challenges like purchase hesitation, costly returns and the need for personalized customer experiences,\u201d said Ivan Leshko, executive vice president North America at SoftServe. \u201cThe NVIDIA AI Blueprint for retail shopping assistants enabled us to build a turnkey solution quickly so our retail customers can use AI to keep consumers engaged and drive higher conversion rates.\u201d\nNVIDIA AI Drives Business Impact, Enhanced Customer Experience\r\nWith AI shopping assistants, retailers can deliver more engaging customer interactions, around the clock and across the world.\nNVIDIA\u2019s retail shopping assistant blueprint features NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, including NVIDIA NIM\u2122 microservices for Meta Llama 3.3 70B and NVIDIA NeMo Retriever embedding and reranking microservices, to deliver AI performance at scale. It also includes NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails safety features, as well as NVIDIA Omniverse for design and visualization capabilities.\nKey features of the blueprint include:\n\nMultimodal and multi-query capabilities, enabling consumers to use text and images in queries.\nIntegration with large language models (LLMs) that bring reasoning capabilities to AI shopping assistants for natural, humanlike interactions. This includes NVIDIA Llama Nemotron LLMs, announced this week at the CES trade show, which will be available later this year.\nThe ability to ingest retailers\u2019 product catalog text and image data for accurate, context-aware responses.\nGuardrails that help ensure customer conversations with the shopping assistant remain safe and on-topic, protecting brand values.\nState-of-the-art simulation tools that can help customers visualize products in their own physically accurate spaces.\n\nThe shopping assistant blueprint is the latest addition to a growing repository of NVIDIA AI Blueprints, many announced at CES earlier this week. This includes a new version of the NVIDIA AI Blueprint for video search and summarization that helps retailers build video analytics AI agents that can analyze large volumes of live and archived content to boost operational efficiency and safety.\nBringing Retail Shopping Assistants to Retailers Worldwide \r\nNVIDIA\u2019s global network of partners is leveraging the fundamental technologies of the shopping assistant blueprint to develop and deploy innovative solutions for the $30 trillion retail industry. According to eMarketer, the industry is projected to grow to $35 trillion by 2028, representing significant opportunities for transformation and growth.\nIn addition to SoftServe, NVIDIA partners Dell Technologies and World Wide Technology (WWT) will use the blueprint in early access to make it easier for retailers to adopt AI.\n\u201cRetail leaders harnessing AI-powered personalization are creating unprecedented competitive advantages in today\u2019s digital-first marketplace,\u201d said Adam Dumey, global vice president of retail at WWT. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to leverage this new retail shopping assistant blueprint from NVIDIA to bring the full force of our nearly $1 billion investment in our Advanced Technology Center and AI Proving Ground \u2014 along with our expert team of data scientists, retail consultants and AI architects \u2014 to help our retail customers accelerate their AI transformation.\u201d\nAvailability \nThe NVIDIA AI Blueprint for retail shopping assistants is now available in early access. Developers can sign up to be notified when the blueprint is generally available.\nJoin NVIDIA at NRF: Retail\u2019s Big Show, running Jan. 12-14, to learn more about how retailers are using AI shopping assistants to advance the industry.

NeMo Guardrails helps developers integrate and manage AI guardrails in large language model (LLM) applications. Industry leaders Amdocs, Cerence AI and Lowe\u2019s are among those using NeMo Guardrails to safeguard AI applications.\nDevelopers can use the NIM microservices to build more secure, trustworthy AI agents that provide safe, appropriate responses within context-specific guidelines and are bolstered against jailbreak attempts.

Yet, only a fraction of it gets analyzed.\nIt\u2019s estimated that less than 1% of video from industrial cameras is watched live by humans, meaning critical operational incidents can go largely unnoticed.\nThis comes at a high cost. For example, manufacturers are losing trillions of dollars annually to poor product quality or defects that they could\u2019ve spotted earlier, or even predicted, by using AI agents that can perceive, analyze and help humans take action.\nInteractive AI agents with built-in visual perception capabilities can serve as always-on video analysts, helping factories run more efficiently, bolster worker safety, keep traffic running smoothly and even up an athlete\u2019s game.\nTo accelerate the creation of such agents, NVIDIA today announced early access to a new version of the NVIDIA AI Blueprint for video search and summarization. Built on top of the NVIDIA Metropolis platform \u2014 and now supercharged by NVIDIA Cosmos Nemotron vision language models (VLMs), NVIDIA Llama Nemotron large language models (LLMs) and NVIDIA NeMo Retriever \u2014 the blueprint provides developers with the tools to build and deploy AI agents that can analyze large quantities of video and image content.\nThe blueprint integrates the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform \u2014 which includes NVIDIA NIM microservices for VLMs, LLMs and advanced AI frameworks for retrieval-augmented generation \u2014 to enable batch video processing that\u2019s 30x faster than watching it in real time.\nThe blueprint contains several agentic AI features \u2014 such as chain-of-thought reasoning, task planning and tool calling \u2014 that can help developers streamline the creation of powerful and diverse visual agents to solve a range of problems.\nAI agents with video analysis abilities can be combined with other agents with different skill sets to enable even more sophisticated agentic AI services. Enterprises have the flexibility to build and deploy their AI agents from the edge to the cloud.\nHow Video Analyst AI Agents Can Help Industrial Businesses\u00a0\nAI agents with visual perception and analysis skills can be fine-tuned to help businesses with industrial operations by:\n\nIncreasing productivity and reducing waste: Agents can help ensure standard operating procedures are followed during complex industrial processes like product assembly. They can also be fine-tuned to carefully watch and understand nuanced actions, and the sequence in which they\u2019re implemented.\n\n\nBoosting asset management efficiency through better space utilization: Agents can help optimize inventory storage in warehouses by performing 3D volume estimation and centralizing understanding across various camera streams.\n\n\nImproving safety through auto-generation of incident reports and summaries: Agents can process huge volumes of video and summarize it into contextually informative reports of accidents. They can also help ensure personal protective equipment compliance in factories, improving worker safety in industrial settings.\n\n\nPreventing accidents and production problems: AI agents can identify atypical activity to quickly mitigate operational and safety risks, whether in a warehouse, factory or airport, or at a traffic intersection or other municipal setting.\n\n\nLearning from the past: Agents can search through operations video archives, find relevant information from the past and use it to solve problems or create new processes.\n\nVideo Analysts for Sports, Entertainment and More\nAnother industry where video analysis AI agents stand to make a mark is sports \u2014 a $500 billion market worldwide, with hundreds of billions in projected growth over the next several years.\nCoaches, teams and leagues \u2014 whether professional or amateur \u2014 rely on video analytics to evaluate and enhance player performance, prioritize safety and boost fan engagement through player analytics platforms and data visualization. With visually perceptive AI agents, athletes now have unprecedented access to deeper insights and opportunities for improvement.\nDuring his CES opening keynote, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang demonstrated an AI video analytics agent that assessed the fastball pitching skills of an amateur baseball player compared with a professional\u2019s. Using video captured from the ceremonial first pitch that Huang threw for the San Francisco Giants baseball team, the video analytics AI agent was able to suggest areas for improvement.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3568870_CES25_Agentic_AI_MetropolisSection_720p_10mb.mp4\nThe $3 trillion media and entertainment industry is also poised to benefit from video analyst AI agents. Through the NVIDIA Media2 initiative, these agents will help drive the creation of smarter, more tailored and more impactful content that can adapt to individual viewer preferences.\nWorldwide Adoption and Availability\u00a0\nPartners from around the world are integrating the blueprint for building AI agents for video analysis into their own developer workflows, including Accenture, Centific, Deloitte, EY, Infosys, Linker Vision, Pegatron, TATA Consultancy Services (TCS), Telit Cinterion and VAST.\nApply for early access to the NVIDIA Blueprint for video search and summarization.\nSee notice regarding software product information.\nEditor\u2019s note: Omdia is the source for 1.5 billion enterprise-level cameras deployed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | CES 2025 | Industrial and Manufacturing | Media and Entertainment | Metropolis | NVIDIA AI Enterprise | NVIDIA Blueprints | NVIDIA NIM \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Honors Americas Partners Advancing Agentic and Physical AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Blackwell Powers Real-Time AI for Entertainment Workflows\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Over 750 games and applications feature RTX support, including best selling games, the most popular apps, and the most used game engines.\nNVIDIA DLSS is our award-winning suite of neural rendering technologies that use AI to boost FPS, reduce latency and improve image quality using dedicated Tensor Core AI processors on GeForce RTX GPUs.\nIn all supported DLSS games and apps, listed below, every GeForce RTX user can enhance their experience with DLSS Super Resolution, which taps into the power of a deep learning neural network to boost frame rates and generate beautiful, sharp images.\nDLAA delivers higher image quality with an AI-based anti-aliasing technique, rather than increasing performance, using the same Super Resolution technology developed for DLSS, constructing a more realistic, high-quality image at native resolution.\nDLSS Ray Reconstruction replaces hand-tuned ray tracing denoisers with a new unified AI model that enhances ray tracing in supported games, elevating image quality to new heights.\nDLSS Frame Generation multiplies frame rates in games and apps on GeForce RTX 50 Series and GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards and laptops.\nAnd with DLSS Multi Frame Generation, GeForce RTX 50 Series users can further accelerate frame rates by generating up to 3 frames per traditionally rendered frame, multiplying performance by up to 8X when DLSS Multi Frame Generation is used in conjunction with DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Ray Reconstruction.\nOur latest breakthrough, NVIDIA DLSS 4, enhances image quality in DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Ray Reconstruction, and DLAA games and apps using a new, innovative, even-better transformer AI model. And with an updated DLSS Frame Generation model, performance is accelerated, and VRAM usage reduced. Get a deep dive on DLSS 4\u2019s full range of benefits here.\nDLSS on GeForce RTX is the best way to play, backed by an NVIDIA AI supercomputer in the cloud that\u2019s constantly improving your PC\u2019s gaming capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn games and apps that have yet to update with native support for DLSS 4 and DLSS Multi Frame Generation, NVIDIA app includes DLSS 4 overrides that enable you to upgrade select titles:\n\nDLSS Multi Frame Generation Override - Enables DLSS Multi Frame Generation for GeForce RTX 50 Series users when Frame Generation is ON in-game\nDLSS Frame Generation Model Upgrade - Enables the latest DLSS Frame Generation model for GeForce RTX 50 Series and GeForce RTX 40 Series users, when Frame Generation is ON in-game, which uses less video memory and can increase frame rates\nDLSS Transformer Model Upgrade - Enables the latest transformer AI model for DLSS Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, and DLAA for all GeForce RTX users, when the aforementioned features are ON in-game\nDLAA & Ultra Performance Modes - Sets the internal rendering resolution for DLSS Super Resolution, enabling DLAA or Ultra Performance mode in games lacking native support, when Super Resolution is ON in-game\n\nEnhancing games takes just a few clicks - head to our NVIDIA app article to learn how to set up each feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX gamers also benefit from class-leading RTX-accelerated Ray Tracing, which brings realistic and immersive visual effects to games. In apps, acceleration from dedicated Ray Tracing Cores dramatically speeds up renders, enabling artists to not only create final renders more quickly but also enabling interactive ray tracing in the viewport which makes iterating on and refining new ideas simpler and easier.\nAnd AI technologies and features, powered by the Tensor Cores found on GeForce RTX GPUs, unlock revolutionary creative workflows which make tedious tasks a thing of the past. Follow the links to check out examples of how AI helps creators and industries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich Games, Engines and Applications Support RTX Technologies?\nMore and more add support each and every month.

Rich driving datasets from Uber, combined with the features of the Cosmos platform and NVIDIA DGX Cloud, will help AV partners build stronger AI models even more efficiently.\n\nAvailability\nCosmos WFMs are now available under an open model license on Hugging Face and the NVIDIA NGC catalog. Cosmos models will soon be available as fully optimized NVIDIA NIM microservices.\nGet started with Cosmos and join NVIDIA at CES.\nSee notice regarding software product information.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: Artificial Intelligence | CES 2025 | Cosmos | NVIDIA DGX | Omniverse | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Honors Americas Partners Advancing Agentic and Physical AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Blackwell Powers Real-Time AI for Entertainment Workflows\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Then generative AI \u2014 creating text, images and sound,\u201d Huang said. Now, we\u2019re entering the era of \u201cphysical AI, AI that can proceed, reason, plan and act.\u201d\nNVIDIA GPUs and platforms are at the heart of this transformation, Huang explained, enabling breakthroughs across industries, including gaming, robotics and autonomous vehicles (AVs).\nKey Announcements\nHuang\u2019s keynote showcased how NVIDIA\u2019s latest innovations are enabling this new era of AI, with several groundbreaking announcements, including:\n\nThe just-announced NVIDIA Cosmos platform advances physical AI with new models and video data processing pipelines for robots, autonomous vehicles and vision AI.\nNew NVIDIA Blackwell-based GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs offer stunning visual realism and unprecedented performance boosts.\nAI foundation models introduced at CES for RTX PCs feature NVIDIA NIM microservices and AI Blueprints for crafting digital humans, podcasts, images and videos.\nThe new NVIDIA Project DIGITS brings the power of NVIDIA Grace Blackwell to developer desktops in a compact package.\nNVIDIA is partnering with Toyota for safe next-gen vehicle development using the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX in-vehicle computer running NVIDIA DriveOS.\n\n\nHuang started off his talk by reflecting on NVIDIA\u2019s three-decade journey. In 1999, NVIDIA invented the programmable GPU. Since then, modern AI has fundamentally changed how computing works, he said. \u201cEvery single layer of the technology stack has been transformed, an incredible transformation, in just 12 years.\u201d\nRevolutionizing Graphics With GeForce RTX 50 Series\n\u201cGeForce enabled AI to reach the masses, and now AI is coming home to GeForce,\u201d Huang said.\nWith that, he introduced the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 GPU, the most powerful GeForce RTX GPU so far, with 92 billion transistors and delivering 3,352 trillion AI operations per second (TOPS).\n\u201cHere it is \u2014 our brand-new GeForce RTX 50 series, Blackwell architecture,\u201d Huang said, holding the blacked-out GPU aloft and noting how it\u2019s able to harness advanced AI to enable breakthrough graphics. \u201cThe GPU is just a beast.\u201d\n\u201cEven the mechanical design is a miracle,\u201d Huang said, noting that the graphics card has two cooling fans.\n\nMore variations in the GPU series are coming. The GeForce RTX 5090 and GeForce RTX 5080 desktop GPUs are scheduled to be available Jan. 30. The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and the GeForce RTX 5070 desktops are slated to be available starting in February. Laptop GPUs are expected in March.\nDLSS 4 introduces Multi Frame Generation, working in unison with the complete suite of DLSS technologies to boost performance by up to 8x. NVIDIA also unveiled NVIDIA Reflex 2, which can reduce PC latency by up to 75%.\nThe latest generation of DLSS can generate three additional frames for every frame we calculate, Huang explained. \u201cAs a result, we\u2019re able to render at incredibly high performance, because AI does a lot less computation.\u201d\nRTX Neural Shaders use small neural networks to improve textures, materials and lighting in real-time gameplay.

This will help boost engineering efficiencies, reduce costs and accelerate time to market.\nThe Group will also work with NVIDIA to create simulated environments for developing autonomous driving systems and validating self-driving applications.\nSimulation is becoming increasingly critical in the safe deployment of AVs. It provides a safe way to test self-driving technology in any possible weather, traffic conditions or locations, as well as rare or dangerous scenarios.\nHyundai Motor Group will develop applications, like digital twins using Omniverse technologies, to optimize its existing and future manufacturing lines in simulation. These digital twins can improve production quality, streamline costs and enhance overall manufacturing efficiencies.\nThe company can also build and train industrial robots for safe deployment in its factories using NVIDIA Isaac Sim, a robotics simulation framework built on Omniverse.\nNVIDIA is helping advance robotics intelligence with AI tools and libraries for automated manufacturing. As a result, Hyundai Motor Group can conduct industrial robot training in physically accurate virtual environments \u2014 optimizing manufacturing and enhancing quality.\nThis can also help make interactions with these robots and their real-world surroundings more intuitive and effective while ensuring they can work safely alongside humans.\nUsing NVIDIA technology, Hyundai Motor Group is driving the creation of safer, more intelligent vehicles, enhancing manufacturing with greater efficiency and quality, and deploying cutting-edge robotics to build a smarter, more connected digital workplace.\nThe partnership was formalized during a signing ceremony that took place last night at CES.\nLearn more about how NVIDIA technologies are advancing autonomous vehicles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Main image shows Heung-Soo Kim, executive vice president and head of global strategy office at Hyundai Motor Group, and Rishi Dhall, vice president of automotive at NVIDIA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: Artificial Intelligence | CES 2025 | Digital Twin | Industrial and Manufacturing | Isaac | Omniverse | Physical AI | Simulation and Design | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Honors Americas Partners Advancing Agentic and Physical AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Blackwell Powers Real-Time AI for Entertainment Workflows\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Upgrade Now          Why Nvidia (NVDA) Is Retreating Today      Larry Ramer   January 14, 2025 2 min read        4   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.63%       Nvidia (NVDA) stock is falling 3% today after the U.S. government unveiled new restrictions on the export of advanced chips known as graphics processing units (GPUs). Nvidia specializes in developing and marketing those semiconductors that are used to create artificial intelligence. However, investment bank Wedbush stated today that it remains upbeat on NVDA and a number of its large-tech peers.   Is Vertiv Holdings (VRT) The Best AI Stock to Buy For 2025?   10 Important AI Announcements for Investors The New Restrictions Under the new rules, the number of GPUs that can be shipped to most other countries will be limited to 50,000. However, countries can obtain a license to obtain more of the chips, the purchases of about 18 U.S. allies will not be restricted, and orders of up to 1,700 chips will not be limited.  \u201cThe United States must act decisively to lead this transition by ensuring that US technology undergirds global AI use and that adversaries cannot easily abuse advanced AI,\u201d the White House said in a statement today. Wedbush Remains Bullish on Multiple Large-Tech Names Nvidia is one of the large-tech stocks that investors should own despite the market's recent volatility, Wedbush's well-known analyst, Dan Ives, wrote in a note to investors today. The recent increase in bond yields has created \"a tricky time for the tech sector\" amid concerns about valuations, according to Ives. But the analyst is still bullish on many of the most famous large-tech names, including Nvidia. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Upgrade Now          Jim Cramer on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): \u2018It\u2019s Doing Nothing!\u2019      Ramish Cheema   January 30, 2025 8 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.68%       We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discussed These 11 Stocks Before The DeepSeek Sell-Off. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks. In a fresh appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer cautioned viewers to not be caught up by the energy that's gripped the US stock market since President Donald Trump resumed charge. \"Things are happening very fast. And I want so much to slow it down,\" he stated. Cramer mentioned an article that mentioned \"the burst of energy, some good, some bad,\" adding that not every remark made by the President is investment advice. He believes that \"a lot of people want to do that. [treat all of Trump's remarks as investable]\" They wanna do oil and gas, they wanna do with interest rates,\" he added and shared \"They have to remember that he doesn't have the authority\" particularly when it comes to determining interest rates.  Cramer further commented on the state of America's non-tech industrial economy and how it tied in with the President's desire for lower rates. According to him \"I just think the industrial economy justifies everything that Trump wants to lower rates.\" Yet, as consumer spending has remained robust despite high rates, Cramer added that \"the consumer economy, says don't lower rates.\" He believes that if the president took a look at \"how great things are at small to medium-sized business. Where the real strength's coming since his election,\" he would be hard-pressed to press for further rate cuts. Energy was another topic on the CNBC host's mind. Commenting particularly on natural gas and its demand in today's era of AI data centers, Cramer shared \"People only want to be in this business. Want to own stocks in this business because it's going to be the biggest thing that we export.\" However, he believes that these investors need to ask themselves \"Are we going to export so much that domestically because we need it for the data centers, that the customer's going to be squeezed by uh nat gas prices.\" The surge in exports and data center demand could very well lead to higher natural gas prices for consumers. According to Cramer \"Nat gas could go to five. That would be something.\" Not only is Cramer interested in energy, but the President ran his election on the promise of increasing America's oil production and requiring oil companies to drill more. However, the CEOs that he's spoken to \"are all saying listen, we're going to hold.\"   Story Continues \"It's kind of a Braveheart thing,\" Cramer added. He believes \"They're not going to break. And they all are kind of united, but they don't fix prices. Some people, the FTC felt that they fixed prices. That's nonsense. But I do think that they've all said listen we're making a ton of money. We're not going to go down the path the President wants. So there's going to be a test of wills.\"Another topic that Cramer touched on was SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service. Starlink is powered by thousands of small satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO) launched by SpaceX. Over the past year, it has grown its presence in the commercial aviation industry by providing airlines with internet connectivity. Cramer revealed, \"You know the rap about Starlink I'm getting from, the push back that I'm hearing from some of the. . . that when you put em all up, like even when United starts, it's going to slow down the latency, they can't handle that.\"One of the hottest topics on Wall Street these days is Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. Investors' worries about the firm's R1 model being purportedly cheaper than American models led to Wall Street's favorite AI stock crashing by a whopping 17% on Monday. However, Cramer dismissed the worries of US companies pouring too much money into AI on Friday. He shared that he wasn't worried \"because I'm a huge believer that this is the industrial revolution, and there are going to be so many uses that you just have to be in.\"A mere industrial revolution isn't the only reason why Cramer was dismissive of the firm that led the AI GPU stock to lose all gains made since October 2024. Commenting on the firm's GPUs and their potential he revealed:\"I think that what we're not thinking about, like when I went to Jensen Huang's panel on healthcare. It's so much bigger than anything involving AI PC. I mean they're really just talking about having the data to really attack every single disease and changing it from fatal to maintenance. You have tremendous number of people involved in trying to do that. Then you have Stripe there working with [the GPU company] to be able to do something revolutionary in finance. And then you have the banks working doing some revolutionary things trying to get people who're doing S1s. . . .\" Cramer also believes that Fed chair Jerome Powell will be 'perplexed' by the amount of spending in America. According to him:\"The amount of people traveling. The bump up to first class, from commercial, from the, you know what second class we'll call it, David. Uh, the amount of people just, the frequency at which people are having a dinner out. I don't know what to say, there's a burst of optimism that is being translated into spend. And particularly for younger people that I'm just flabbergasted about. It just can't stop!\" The spending has left him flabbergasted. \"We're spending so much I don't know how they can cut!\" Cramer explained. \"I want them to cut . . . I wanted to cut like a thousand times!\" he added.Our MethodologyTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 24th.For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193Not a show goes by without Cramer talking about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). This time around, he commented on the firm on Friday, which was the last day before the DeepSeek sell-off. During the day, Cramer discussed reports that technology stock valuations were overstretched. For that day's specific moves, the host pointed at other sectors, such as healthcare, that were doing well and contributing to strong index performance. Naturally, and in eerie foreboding, he commented on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s overstretched valuation on the last trading day before the stock sank by 17%:\"[on reports of markets being stretched] We're in a good time. And yet of course we have to have everyone saying, well it's over, it's stretched. It's been stretched now since when I, since August of 1981 when I started. It was very stretched. You know it went up like eighty points in five weeks. Stretched. I am just saying don't play that game. Find good stocks. Find stocks that are winning and they are going, higher. NVIDIA by the way was at one forty two when I woke up at three o clock. Well one forty six. Then it went down to one forty five. Now it's back to one forty seven. It's doing nothing!\"\"Why, the stock's trading down on what, what phrase in that thing is negative. What phrase. Look, Microsoft's doing eighty, it's good for NVIDIA.\" Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer talked about before DeepSeek wreaked havoc on the stock market. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

So was its tumble Monday, which caused $595 billion in wealth to vanish. That\u2019s about as much as PepsiCo, McDonalds, Starbucks and Target are worth, combined.Mostly known only in gaming and crypto circles a few years ago, Nvidia burst into the zeitgeist after seeing its sales surge because customers wanted its chips to train their chatbots and other artificial intelligence products.Nvidia became a household name as its stock more than tripled in 2023 and then more than doubled in 2024. Investors and analysts lauded CEO Jensen Huang as the \u201cGodfather of AI.\u201d Nvidia grew into a $3 trillion-plus behemoth and traded places with titans like Apple to become the most valuable company on Wall Street.But that all came to a screeching halt Monday, at least for a moment, after a Chinese upstart called DeepSeek said it had developed a large-language model that could perform like ChatGPT and other U.S. rivals, but by using far less computing power.Here\u2019s a look at how it all got to this point: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                            RELATED COVERAGE\n                        \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang unveils new Rubin AI chips at GTC 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall Street falls in a manic day after briefly dropping more than 10% below its record\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall Street tumbles as tariff whiplash and falling AI stocks drag Nasdaq 10% below its record\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did it become a market darling?Nvidia\u2019s roots began in gaming.The Santa Clara, California-based tech company\u2019s invention of the graphics processor unit, or GPU, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. Now Nvidia\u2019s specialized chips are key components that help power different forms of artificial intelligence, including the latest generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuang has dubbed AI \u201cthe next industrial revolution,\u201d and Nvidia\u2019s GPUs are designed to perform artificial intelligence tasks faster and more efficiently than general-purpose chips like CPUs. Tech giants are snapping up Nvidia chips as they wade deeper into AI \u2014 a movement that\u2019s enabling cars to drive by themselves, and generating stories, art and music.\n\nThe demand helped Nvidia\u2019s revenue grow by eye-popping levels, quarter after quarter. On Feb. 23, 2023, after Nvidia breezed past analysts\u2019 expectations for quarterly profit, Huang said that \u201cAI is at an inflection point, setting up for broad adoption reaching into every industry.\u201d The company\u2019s quarterly revenue at the time was $6.05 billion. That ramped up to $7.19 billion just three months later and then nearly doubled to $13.51 billion three months after that. Revenue has since vaulted to $35.08 billion in the three months through October 2024. The company\u2019s stock price has similarly soared, and its total market value quickly passed rivals like Intel, Microsoft and others. Nvidia alone accounted for more than a fifth of all of the S&P 500 index\u2019s total return last year. No other stock came close, and it had more than triple Apple\u2019s impact.Buy an S&P 500 index fund today, and nearly 6 cents out of every $1 will go only into Nvidia. That leaves 94 cents for all the other 499 companies. \n\nIs it still a darling?Unlike the dot-com boom, real money was behind Nvidia\u2019s surge, and its stock price rose on expectations of ever more to come. Those expectations came into question on Monday. DeepSeek and its seemingly lower-cost operations raised worries about whether companies would need to spend as many dollars on Nvidia chips as previously thought. The concerns dragged down stocks across the AI industry, including suppliers to the chip industry and the power companies hoping to electrify the vast data centers that were expected to get built to run those chips. But Nvidia was in the spotlight because its stock has become the brightest symbol of the AI bonanza. Some on Wall Street saw Monday\u2019s nearly 17% plunge for Nvidia\u2019s stock as an opportunity rather than a signal of pending doom, saying the stock became more affordable. If AI does become cheaper to run, it could open the door to new kinds of customers and software innovations that could ultimately help the industry in the long term.\u201cAs for Nvidia itself, this isn\u2019t the first time a major tech stock has faced existential questions,\u201d said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen similar situations with Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Google, Amazon, and Netflix \u2014 companies that were once doubted but ultimately rebounded.\u201d\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s entrance certainly adds uncertainty to the entire AI ecosystem, but it doesn\u2019t change the overwhelming momentum behind the movement, according to Brian Colello, strategist at Morningstar.\u201cWe believe that AI GPU demand still exceeds supply,\u201d he wrote in a report. \u201cSo, while slimmer models may enable greater development for the same number of chips, we still think tech firms will continue to buy all the GPUs they can as part of this AI \u2018gold rush.\u2019\u201dFor its part, Nvidia\u2019s stock wobbled between gains and losses early Tuesday following its worst plunge since the 2020 COVID crash, and then rallied a bit and ended the day nearly 9% higher. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSARAH PARVINI\n\n\n                Parvini covers artificial intelligence for The Associated Press.

PC enthusiasts and developers are leading the charge in pushing the boundaries of this groundbreaking technology.\nCountless times, industry-defining technological breakthroughs have been invented in one place \u2014 a garage. This week marks the start of the RTX AI Garage series, which will offer routine content for developers and enthusiasts looking to learn more about NVIDIA NIM microservices and AI Blueprints, and how to build AI agents, creative workflow, digital human, productivity apps and more on AI PCs. Welcome to the RTX AI Garage.\nThis first installment spotlights announcements made earlier this week at CES, including new AI foundation models available on NVIDIA RTX AI PCs that take digital humans, content creation, productivity and development to the next level.\nThese models \u2014 offered as NVIDIA NIM microservices \u2014 are powered by new GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs. Built on the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, RTX 50 Series GPUs deliver up to 3,352 trillion AI operations per second of performance, 32GB of VRAM and feature FP4 compute, doubling AI inference performance and enabling generative AI to run locally with a smaller memory footprint.\nNVIDIA also introduced NVIDIA AI Blueprints \u2014 ready-to-use, preconfigured workflows, built on NIM microservices, for applications like digital humans and content creation.\nNIM microservices and AI Blueprints empower enthusiasts and developers to build, iterate and deliver AI-powered experiences to the PC faster than ever. The result is a new wave of compelling, practical capabilities for PC users.\nFast-Track AI With NVIDIA NIM\nThere are two key challenges to bringing AI advancements to PCs. First, the pace of AI research is breakneck, with new models appearing daily on platforms like Hugging Face, which now hosts over a million models. As a result, breakthroughs quickly become outdated.\nSecond, adapting these models for PC use is a complex, resource-intensive process. Optimizing them for PC hardware, integrating them with AI software and connecting them to applications requires significant engineering effort.\nNVIDIA NIM helps address these challenges by offering prepackaged, state-of-the-art AI models optimized for PCs. These NIM microservices span model domains, can be installed with a single click, feature application programming interfaces (APIs) for easy integration, and harness NVIDIA AI software and RTX GPUs for accelerated performance.\nAt CES, NVIDIA announced a pipeline of NIM microservices for RTX AI PCs, supporting use cases spanning large language models (LLMs), vision-language models, image generation, speech, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), PDF extraction and computer vision.\nThe new Llama Nemotron family of open models provide high accuracy on a wide range of agentic tasks. The Llama Nemotron Nano model, which will be offered as a NIM microservice for RTX AI PCs and workstations, excels at agentic AI tasks like instruction following, function calling, chat, coding and math.\nSoon, developers will be able to quickly download and run these microservices on Windows 11 PCs using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).\n\nTo demonstrate how enthusiasts and developers can use NIM to build AI agents and assistants, NVIDIA previewed Project R2X, a vision-enabled PC avatar that can put information at a user\u2019s fingertips, assist with desktop apps and video conference calls, read and summarize documents, and more. Sign up for Project R2X updates.\nBy using NIM microservices, AI enthusiasts can skip the complexities of model curation, optimization and backend integration and focus on creating and innovating with cutting-edge AI models.\nWhat\u2019s in an API?\nAn API is the way in which an application communicates with a software library. An API defines a set of \u201ccalls\u201d that the application can make to the library and what the application can expect in return. Traditional AI APIs require a lot of setup and configuration, making AI capabilities harder to use and hampering innovation.\nNIM microservices expose easy-to-use, intuitive APIs that an application can simply send requests to and get a response. In addition, they\u2019re designed around the input and output media for different model types. For example, LLMs take text as input and produce text as output, image generators convert text to image, speech recognizers turn speech to text and so on.\nThe microservices are designed to integrate seamlessly with leading AI development and agent frameworks such as AI Toolkit for VSCode, AnythingLLM, ComfyUI, Flowise AI, LangChain, Langflow and LM Studio. Developers can easily download and deploy them from build.nvidia.com.\nBy bringing these APIs to RTX, NVIDIA NIM will accelerate AI innovation on PCs.\nEnthusiasts are expected to be able to experience a range of NIM microservices using an upcoming release of the NVIDIA ChatRTX tech demo.\nA Blueprint for Innovation\nBy using state-of-the-art models, prepackaged and optimized for PCs, developers and enthusiasts can quickly create AI-powered projects. Taking things a step further, they can combine multiple AI models and other functionality to build complex applications like digital humans, podcast generators and application assistants.\nNVIDIA AI Blueprints, built on NIM microservices, are reference implementations for complex AI workflows. They help developers connect several components, including libraries, software development kits and AI models, together in a single application.\n\nAI Blueprints include everything that a developer needs to build, run, customize and extend the reference workflow, which includes the reference application and source code, sample data, and documentation for customization and orchestration of the different components.\nAt CES, NVIDIA announced two AI Blueprints for RTX: one for PDF to podcast, which lets users generate a podcast from any PDF, and another for 3D-guided generative AI, which is based on FLUX.1 [dev] and expected be offered as a NIM microservice, offers artists greater control over text-based image generation.\nWith AI Blueprints, developers can quickly go from AI experimentation to AI development for cutting-edge workflows on RTX PCs and workstations.\nBuilt for Generative AI\nThe new GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs are purpose-built to tackle complex generative AI challenges, featuring fifth-generation Tensor Cores with FP4 support, faster G7 memory and an AI-management processor for efficient multitasking between AI and creative workflows.\nThe GeForce RTX 50 Series adds FP4 support to help bring better performance and more models to PCs. FP4 is a lower quantization method, similar to file compression, that decreases model sizes. Compared with FP16 \u2014 the default method that most models feature \u2014 FP4 uses less than half of the memory, and 50 Series GPUs provide over 2x performance compared with the previous generation. This can be done with virtually no loss in quality with advanced quantization methods offered by NVIDIA TensorRT Model Optimizer.\nFor example, Black Forest Labs\u2019 FLUX.1 [dev] model at FP16 requires over 23GB of VRAM, meaning it can only be supported by the GeForce RTX 4090 and professional GPUs. With FP4, FLUX.1 [dev] requires less than 10GB, so it can run locally on more GeForce RTX GPUs.\nWith a GeForce RTX 4090 with FP16, the FLUX.1 [dev] model can generate images in 15 seconds with 30 steps. With a GeForce RTX 5090 with FP4, images can be generated in just over five seconds.\nGet Started With the New AI APIs for PCs\nNVIDIA NIM microservices and AI Blueprints are expected to be available starting next month, with initial hardware support for GeForce RTX 50 Series, GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080, and NVIDIA RTX 6000 and 5000 professional GPUs. Additional GPUs will be supported in the future.\nNIM-ready RTX AI PCs are expected to be available from Acer, ASUS, Dell, GIGABYTE, HP, Lenovo, MSI, Razer and Samsung, and from local system builders Corsair, Falcon Northwest, LDLC, Maingear, Mifcon, Origin PC, PCS and Scan.\nGeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs and laptops deliver game-changing performance, power transformative AI experiences, and enable creators to complete workflows in record time.

They feature ninth-generation NVIDIA encoders for advanced video editing and livestreaming, and come with NVIDIA DLSS 4 and up to 32GB of VRAM\u00a0 to tackle massive 3D projects.\n\nThese GPUs come with various software updates, including two new AI-powered NVIDIA Broadcast effects, updates to RTX Video and RTX Remix, and NVIDIA NIM microservices \u2014 prepackaged and optimized models built to jumpstart AI content creation workflows on RTX AI PCs.\nBuilt for the Generative AI Era\nGenerative AI can create sensational results for creators, but with models growing in both complexity and scale, generative AI can be difficult to run even on the latest hardware.\nThe GeForce RTX 50 Series adds FP4 support to help address this issue. FP4 is a lower quantization method, similar to file compression, that decreases model sizes. Compared with FP16 \u2014 the default method that most models feature \u2014 FP4 uses less than half of the memory and 50 Series GPUs provide over 2x performance compared to the previous generation. This can be done with virtually no loss in quality with advanced quantization methods offered by NVIDIA TensorRT Model Optimizer.\nFor example, Black Forest Labs\u2019 FLUX.1 [dev] model at FP16 requires over 23GB of VRAM, meaning it can only be supported by the GeForce RTX 4090 and professional GPUs. With FP4, FLUX.1 [dev] requires less than 10GB, so it can run locally on more GeForce RTX GPUs.\nWith a GeForce RTX 4090 with FP16, the FLUX.1 [dev] model can generate images in 15 seconds with 30 steps. With a GeForce RTX 5090 with FP4, images can be generated in just over five seconds.\nA new NVIDIA AI Blueprint for 3D-guided generative AI based on FLUX.1 [dev], which will be offered as an NVIDIA NIM microservice, offers artists greater control over text-based image generation. With this blueprint, creators can use simple 3D objects \u2014 created by hand or generated with AI \u2014 and lay them out in a 3D renderer like Blender to guide AI image generation.\nA prepackaged workflow powered by the FLUX NIM microservice and ComfyUI can then generate high-quality images that match the 3D scene\u2019s composition.\nThe NVIDIA Blueprint for 3D-guided generative AI is expected to be available through GitHub using a one-click installer in February.\n\nStability AI announced that its Stable Point Aware 3D, or SPAR3D, model will be available this month on RTX AI PCs. Thanks to RTX acceleration, the new model from Stability AI will help transform 3D design, delivering exceptional control over 3D content creation by enabling real-time editing and the ability to generate an object in less than a second from a single image.\nProfessional-Grade Video for All\nGeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs deliver a generational leap in NVIDIA encoders and decoders with support for the 4:2:2 pro-grade color format, multiview-HEVC (MV-HEVC) for 3D and virtual reality (VR) video, and the new AV1 Ultra High Quality mode.\nMost consumer cameras are confined to 4:2:0 color compression, which reduces the amount of color information. 4:2:0 is typically sufficient for video playback on browsers, but it can\u2019t provide the color depth needed for advanced video editors to color grade videos. The 4:2:2 format provides double the color information with just a 1.3x increase in RAW file size \u2014 offering an ideal balance for video editing workflows.\n\nDecoding 4:2:2 video can be challenging due to the increased file sizes. GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs include 4:2:2 hardware support that can decode up to eight times the 4K 60 frames per second (fps) video sources per decoder, enabling smooth multi-camera video editing.\nThe GeForce RTX 5090 GPU is equipped with three encoders and two decoders, the GeForce RTX 5080 GPU includes two encoders and two decoders, the 5070 Ti GPUs has two encoders with a single decoder, and the GeForce RTX 5070 GPU includes a single encoder and decoder. These multi-encoder and decoder setups, paired with faster GPUs, enable the GeForce RTX 5090 to export video 60% faster than the GeForce RTX 4090 and at 4x speed compared with the GeForce RTX 3090.\nGeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs also feature the ninth-generation NVIDIA video encoder, NVENC, that offers a 5% improvement in video quality on HEVC and AV1 encoding (BD-BR), as well as a new AV1 Ultra Quality mode that achieves 5% more compression at the same quality. They also include the sixth-generation NVIDIA decoder, with 2x the decode speed for H.264 video.\nNVIDIA is collaborating with Adobe Premiere Pro, Blackmagic Design\u2019s DaVinci Resolve, Capcut and Wondershare Filmora to integrate these technologies, starting in February.\n3D video is starting to catch on thanks to the growth of VR, AR and mixed reality headsets. The new RTX 50 Series GPUs also come with support for MV-HEVC codecs to unlock such formats in the near future.\nLivestreaming Enhanced\nLivestreaming is a juggling act, where the streamer has to entertain the audience, produce a show and play a video game \u2014 all at the same time. Top streamers can afford to hire producers and moderators to share the workload, but most have to manage these responsibilities on their own and often in long shifts \u2014 until now.\nStreamlabs, a Logitech brand and leading provider of broadcasting software and tools for content creators, is collaborating with NVIDIA and Inworld AI to create the Streamlabs Intelligent Streaming Assistant.\n\nStreamlabs Intelligent Streaming Assistant is an AI agent that can act as a sidekick, producer and technical support. The sidekick that can join streams as a 3D avatar to answer questions, comment on gameplay or chats, or help initiate conversations during quiet periods. It can help produce streams, switching to the most relevant scenes and playing audio and video cues during interesting gameplay moments. It can even serve as an IT assistant that helps configure streams and troubleshoot issues.\nStreamlabs Intelligent Streaming Assistant is powered by NVIDIA ACE technologies for creating digital humans and Inworld AI, an AI framework for agentic AI experiences. The assistant will be available later this year.\nMillions have used the NVIDIA Broadcast app to turn offices and dorm rooms into home studios using AI-powered features that improve audio and video quality \u2014 without needing expensive, specialized equipment.\nTwo new AI-powered beta effects are being added to the NVIDIA Broadcast app.\nThe first, Studio Voice, enhances the sound of a user\u2019s microphone to match that of a high-quality microphone. The other, Virtual Key Light, can relight a subject\u2019s face to deliver even coverage as if it were well-lit by two lights.\nBecause they harness demanding AI models, these beta features are recommended for video conferencing or non-gaming livestreams using a GeForce RTX 5080 GPU or higher. NVIDIA is working to expand these features to more GeForce RTX GPUs in future updates.\nThe NVIDIA Broadcast upgrade also includes an updated user interface that allows users to apply more effects simultaneously, as well as improvements to the background noise removal, virtual background and eye contact effects.\nThe updated NVIDIA Broadcast app will be available in February.\n\nLivestreamers can also benefit from NVENC \u2014 5% BD-BR video quality improvement for HEVC and AV1 \u2014 in the latest beta of Twitch\u2019s Enhanced Broadcast feature in OBS, and the improved AV1 encoder for streaming in Discord or YouTube.\nRTX Video \u2014 an AI feature that enhances video playback on popular internet browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, and locally with Video Super Resolution and HDR \u2014 is getting an update to decrease GPU usage by 30%, expanding the lineup of GeForce RTX GPUs that can run Video Super Resolution with higher quality.\nThe RTX Video update is slated for a future NVIDIA App release.\nUnprecedented 3D Render Performance\nThe GeForce RTX 5090 GPU offers 32GB of GPU memory \u2014 the largest of any GeForce RTX GPU ever, marking a 33% increase over the GeForce RTX 4090 GPU. This lets 3D artists build larger, richer worlds while using multiple applications simultaneously. Plus, new RTX 50 Series fourth-generation RT Cores can run 3D applications 40% faster.\nDLSS 4 debuts Multi Frame Generation to boost frame rates by using AI to generate up to three frames per rendered frame. This enables animators to smoothly navigate a scene with 4x as many frames, or render 3D content at 60 fps or more.\n\nD5 Render and Chaos Vantage, two popular professional-grade 3D apps for architects and designers, will add support for DLSS 4 in February.\n3D artists have adopted generative AI to boost productivity in generating draft 3D meshes, HDRi maps or even animations to prototype a scene. At CES, Stability AI announced SPAR3D, its new 3D model that can generate 3D meshes from images in seconds with RTX acceleration.\nNVIDIA RTX Remix \u2014 a modding platform that lets modders capture game assets, automatically enhance materials with generative AI tools and create stunning RTX remasters with full ray tracing \u2014 supports DLSS 4, increasing graphical fidelity and frame rates to maximize realism and immersion during gameplay.\nRTX Remix soon plans to support Neural Radiance Cache, a neural shader that uses AI to train on live game data and estimate per-pixel accurate indirect lighting. RTX Remix creators can also expect access to RTX Skin in their mods, the first ray-traced sub-surface scattering implementation in games. With RTX Skin, RTX Remix mods expect to feature characters with new levels of realism, as light will reflect and propagate through their skin, grounding them in the worlds they inhabit.\nGeForce RTX 5090 and 5080 GPUs will be available for purchase starting Jan. 30 \u2014 followed by GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and 5070 GPUs in February and RTX 50 Series laptops in March.\nAll systems equipped with GeForce RTX GPUs include the NVIDIA Studio platform optimizations, with over 130 GPU-accelerated content creation apps, as well as NVIDIA Studio Drivers, tested extensively and released monthly to enhance performance and maximize stability in popular creative applications.\nStay tuned for more updates on the GeForce RTX 50 Series.

They use input data, including text, image, video and movement, to generate and simulate virtual worlds in a way that accurately models the spatial relationships of objects in the scene and their physical interactions.\nAnnounced at CES, NVIDIA is making available the first wave of Cosmos WFMs for physics-based simulation and synthetic data generation \u2014 plus state-of-the-art tokenizers, guardrails, an accelerated data processing and curation pipeline, and a framework for model customization and optimization.\nCosmos won Best AI and Best Overall accolades from the Best of CES Awards by the CNET Group, awards partner for the Consumer Technology Association, which produces CES.\nResearchers and developers, regardless of their company size, can freely use the Cosmos models under NVIDIA\u2019s permissive open model license that allows commercial usage. Enterprises building AI agents can also use new open NVIDIA Llama Nemotron and Cosmos Nemotron models, unveiled at CES.\nThe openness of Cosmos\u2019 state-of-the-art models unblocks physical AI developers building robotics and AV technology and enables enterprises of all sizes to more quickly bring their physical AI applications to market. Developers can use Cosmos models directly to generate physics-based synthetic data, or they can harness the NVIDIA NeMo framework to fine-tune the models with their own videos for specific physical AI setups.\nPhysical AI leaders \u2014 including robotics companies 1X, Agility Robotics and XPENG, and AV developers Uber and Waabi \u00a0\u2014 are already working with Cosmos to accelerate and enhance model development.\nDevelopers can preview the first Cosmos autoregressive and diffusion models on the NVIDIA API catalog, and download the family of models and fine-tuning framework from the NVIDIA NGC catalog and Hugging Face.\n\nWorld Foundational Models for Physical AI\nCosmos world foundation models are a suite of open diffusion and autoregressive transformer models for physics-aware video generation. The models have been trained on 9,000 trillion tokens from 20 million hours of real-world human interactions, environment, industrial, robotics and driving data.\nThe models come in three categories: Nano, for models optimized for real-time, low-latency inference and edge deployment; Super, for highly performant baseline models; and Ultra, for maximum quality and fidelity, best used for distilling custom models.\nWhen paired with NVIDIA Omniverse 3D outputs, the diffusion models generate controllable, high-quality synthetic video data to bootstrap training of robotic and AV perception models. The autoregressive models predict what should come next in a sequence of video frames based on input frames and text. This enables real-time next-token prediction, giving physical AI models the foresight to predict their next best action.\nDevelopers can use Cosmos\u2019 open models for text-to-world and video-to-world generation. Versions of the diffusion and autoregressive models, with between 4 and 14 billion parameters each, are available now on the NGC catalog and Hugging Face.\nAlso available are a 12-billion-parameter upsampling model for refining text prompts, a 7-billion-parameter video decoder optimized for augmented reality, and guardrail models to ensure responsible, safe use.\nTo demonstrate opportunities for customization, NVIDIA is also releasing fine-tuned model samples for vertical applications, such as generating multisensor views for AVs.\nAdvancing Robotics, Autonomous Vehicle Applications\nCosmos world foundation models can enable synthetic data generation to augment training datasets, simulation to test and debug physical AI models before they\u2019re deployed in the real world, and reinforcement learning in virtual environments to accelerate AI agent learning.\nDevelopers can generate massive amounts of controllable, physics-based synthetic data by conditioning Cosmos with composed 3D scenes from NVIDIA Omniverse.\nWaabi, a company pioneering generative AI for the physical world, starting with autonomous vehicles, is evaluating the use of Cosmos for the search and curation of data for AV software development and simulation. This will further accelerate the company\u2019s industry-leading approach to safety, which is based on Waabi World, a generative AI simulator that can create any situation a vehicle might encounter with the same level of realism as if it happened in the real world.\nIn robotics, WFMs can generate synthetic virtual environments or worlds to provide a less expensive, more efficient and controlled space for robot learning. Embodied AI startup Hillbot is boosting its data pipeline by using Cosmos to generate terabytes of high-fidelity 3D environments. This AI-generated data will help the company refine its robotic training and operations, enabling faster, more efficient robotic skilling and improved performance for industrial and domestic tasks.\nIn both industries, developers can use NVIDIA Omniverse and Cosmos as a multiverse simulation engine, allowing a physical AI policy model to simulate every possible future path it could take to execute a particular task \u2014 which in turn helps the model select the best of these paths.\nData curation and the training of Cosmos models relied on thousands of NVIDIA GPUs through NVIDIA DGX Cloud, a high-performance, fully managed AI platform that provides accelerated computing clusters in every leading cloud.\nDevelopers adopting Cosmos can use DGX Cloud for an easy way to deploy Cosmos models, with further support available through the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform.\nCustomize and Deploy With NVIDIA Cosmos\nIn addition to foundation models, the Cosmos platform includes a data processing and curation pipeline powered by NVIDIA NeMo Curator and optimized for NVIDIA data center GPUs.\nRobotics and AV developers collect millions or billions of hours of real-world recorded video, resulting in petabytes of data. Cosmos enables developers to process 20 million hours of data in just 40 days on NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, or as little as 14 days on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs. Using unoptimized pipelines running on a CPU system with equivalent power consumption, processing the same amount of data would take over three years.\nThe platform also features a suite of powerful video and image tokenizers that can convert videos into tokens at different video compression ratios for training various transformer models.\nThe Cosmos tokenizers deliver 8x more total compression than state-of-the-art methods and 12x faster processing speed, which offers superior quality and reduced computational costs in both training and inference. Developers can access these tokenizers, available under NVIDIA\u2019s open model license, via Hugging Face and GitHub.\nDevelopers using Cosmos can also harness model training and fine-tuning capabilities offered by NeMo framework, a GPU-accelerated framework that enables high-throughput AI training.\nDeveloping Safe, Responsible AI Models\nNow available to developers under the NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement, Cosmos was developed in line with NVIDIA\u2019s trustworthy AI principles, which include nondiscrimination, privacy, safety, security and transparency.\nThe Cosmos platform includes Cosmos Guardrails, a dedicated suite of models that, among other capabilities, mitigates harmful text and image inputs during preprocessing and screens generated videos during postprocessing for safety. Developers can further enhance these guardrails for their custom applications.\nCosmos models on the NVIDIA API catalog also feature an inbuilt watermarking system that enables identification of AI-generated sequences.\nNVIDIA Cosmos was developed by NVIDIA Research. Read the research paper, \u201cCosmos World Foundation Model Platform for Physical AI,\u201d for more details on model development and benchmarks. Model cards providing additional information are available on Hugging Face.\nLearn more about world foundation models in an AI Podcast episode\u00a0that features Ming-Yu Liu, vice president of research at NVIDIA.\u00a0\nGet started with NVIDIA Cosmos and join NVIDIA at CES.

Morgan Conference in San Francisco, IQVIA\u2019s collection of models, AI agents and reference workflows will be developed with the NVIDIA AI Foundry platform for building custom models, allowing IQVIA\u2019s thousands of pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device customers to benefit from NVIDIA\u2019s agentic AI capabilities and IQVIA\u2019s technologies, life sciences information and expertise.\nEnabling Industry Applications in Clinical Trials\nThe healthcare and life sciences industry generates more information than any other industry in the world, making up 30% of the world\u2019s data volume.\nIQVIA plans to use its unparalleled information assets, analytics and domain expertise \u2014\u00a0 known as IQVIA Connected Intelligence \u2014 with the NVIDIA AI Foundry service to build language and multimodal foundational models that will power a collection of customized IQVIA AI agents.\nThese agents are anticipated to be available in predefined workflows, or blueprints, that would accomplish a specific task. This partnership aims to accelerate the innovation cycle of IQVIA Healthcare-grade AI. IQVIA has been leading in the responsible use of AI, ensuring that its AI-powered capabilities are grounded in privacy, regulatory compliance and patient safety. IQVIA Healthcare-grade AI represents the company\u2019s commitment to these principles.\nOne key opportunity area is in clinical development, when clinical trials are conducted for new drugs. The overall process takes about 11 years, on average, and each trial has a multitude of workflows that could be supported by AI agents. For example, just starting a clinical trial involves site selection, participant recruitment, regulatory submissions and tight communication between study sites and their sponsors.\nNVIDIA AI Foundry Streamlines Custom Model Development\nTo streamline the development of these AI agents, IQVIA is using tools within NVIDIA AI Foundry and the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, including NVIDIA NIM microservices, especially the Llama Nemotron and Cosmos Nemotron model families; NVIDIA AI Blueprint reference workflows; the NVIDIA NeMo platform for developing custom generative AI; and dedicated capacity on NVIDIA DGX Cloud.\nThe NVIDIA AI Blueprint for multimodal PDF data extraction can help IQVIA unlock the immense amount of healthcare text, graphs, charts and tables stored in PDF files, bringing previously inaccessible information to train AI models and agents for domain-specific and even customer-specific applications. NVIDIA RAPIDS data science libraries then accelerate the construction of knowledge graphs.\nAdditional AI agents could automate complex, time-consuming tasks, like document generation and patient recruitment, allowing healthcare professionals to focus on strategic decision-making and human interaction.\nLearn more about NVIDIA technologies and their impact on healthcare and life sciences.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: DGX Cloud | Healthcare and Life Sciences | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA NIM | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Honors Americas Partners Advancing Agentic and Physical AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Blackwell Powers Real-Time AI for Entertainment Workflows\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Today, we\u2019re excited to announce the initial\u00a0release of the G-Assist System Assistant feature is coming to GeForce RTX users via the NVIDIA app in February.  As modern PCs become more powerful, they also grow more complex to operate. Users today face over a trillion possible combinations of hardware and software settings when configuring a PC for peak performance \u2014 spanning GPU, CPU, monitors, motherboard, peripherals, and more.\nNVIDIA built Project G-Assist, an experimental AI assistant that runs locally on GeForce RTX AI PCs, to simplify this experience. G-Assist helps users control a broad range of PC settings, from optimizing game and system settings, charting frame rates and other key performance statistics, to controlling select peripherals settings such as lighting \u2014 all via basic voice or text commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject G-Assist System Assistant\nProject G-Assist uses a specially tuned Small Language Model (SLM) to efficiently interpret natural language instructions, and call a variety of NVIDIA and third-party PC APIs to execute actions on the PC.\nG-Assist can provide real-time diagnostics and recommendations to alleviate system bottlenecks, improve power efficiency, optimize game settings, overclock your GPU, and much more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can chart and export various performance metrics, such as FPS, latency, GPU utilization, temperatures, among others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can answer questions about your PC, or about NVIDIA software onboard your GeForce RTX GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG-Assist can even control select peripherals and software applications with simple commands \u2014 enabling users to benchmark or adjust fan speeds, or change lighting on supported Logitech G, Corsair, MSI, and Nanoleaf devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG-Assist will be available via the NVIDIA app overlay, and users will be able to type in commands to the chat interface, or hold a push-to-talk hotkey to speak to G-Assist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn-Device AI\nUnlike massive cloud-hosted AI models that require online access and paid subscriptions, G-Assist runs on your GeForce RTX GPU. This means it is responsive, free to use, and can run offline.\nUnder the hood, G-Assist uses a Llama-based Instruct model with 3 billion parameters, packing language understanding into a tiny fraction of the size\u2014well under 1%\u2014of today\u2019s large scale AI models. This allows G-Assist to run on a wide array of RTX hardware with good performance. And with the rapid pace of SLM research, these compact models are becoming more capable and efficient every few months.  When G-Assist is prompted for help\u2014say, to optimize graphics settings or check GPU temperatures\u2014the RTX GPU briefly allocates a portion of its horsepower to AI inference. During those few seconds, a short dip in render rate may occur if you\u2019re gaming or running another GPU-heavy application. Once G-Assist finishes its task, the GPU returns to delivering full performance to the game or app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowering Assistants For Partners & Community Tinkerers\nG-Assist is built on NVIDIA ACE\u2014the same AI tech suite game developers use to breathe life into NPCs. OEMs and ISVs are already leveraging ACE technology to create custom AI Assistants like G-Assist.\nMSI unveiled the \u201cAI Robot\u201d engine at CES, designed to power AI Assistants built into MSI Center and MSI Afterburner. Logitech is using ACE to develop the Streamlabs Intelligent AI Assistant, complete with an interactive avatar that can chat with the streamer, comment on gameplay, and more. And HP is also working on leveraging ACE for AI assistant capabilities in Omen Gaming Hub.\nBeyond industry partners, we\u2019re opening this framework to the broader AI community. Tools like CrewAI, Flowise, and LangFlow will be able to leverage this service, enabling enthusiasts and developers to integrate function-calling capabilities in low-code, customizable language processing workflows, AI applications, and agentic flows.\nG-Assist itself is designed to be extensible by the community. NVIDIA will publish a GitHub repository with samples for creating \u201cplugins\u201d that teach G-Assist additional functionality. Tinkerers will be able to define functions in straightforward JSON formats, then submit them to NVIDIA for review and potential inclusion, making these new capabilities available for others. Before merging, plugins can be tested locally by placing config files in a designated directory, allowing G-Assist to load and interpret them.\nDetails on how to build, share, and load plugins, will be available in documentation from the GitHub repo when G-Assist launches. We can\u2019t wait to see what the community dreams up!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject G-Assist: Coming To NVIDIA App In February\nIn 2013 we launched GeForce Experience, featuring Optimal Playable Settings that automatically configured a game\u2019s options for smooth gameplay with a single click. Tens of millions of gamers have clicked \u201cOptimize\u201d over the years.  Now, AI has unlocked new ways to intelligently interact with and optimize RTX AI PCs. When released in February, Project G-Assist will appear on the NVIDIA app\u2019s Home tab as a new entry in the Discover section for GeForce RTX owners to download and install.\nWhile you wait for G-Assist\u2019s release, check out all of our other GeForce RTX 50 Series announcements to see how we\u2019re further improving experiences in games and apps, and delivering new innovations that advance the PC industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Global leaders in software development and professional services are using Omniverse to develop new products and services that will accelerate the next era of industrial AI.\nAccenture, Altair, Ansys, Cadence, Foretellix, Microsoft and\u00a0Neural Concept are among the first to integrate Omniverse into their next-generation software products and professional services. Siemens, a leader in industrial automation, announced today at the CES trade show the availability of Teamcenter Digital Reality Viewer \u2014 the first Siemens Xcelerator application powered by NVIDIA Omniverse libraries.\n\u201cPhysical AI will revolutionize the $50 trillion manufacturing and logistics industries. Everything that moves \u2014 from cars and trucks to factories and warehouses \u2014 will be robotic and embodied by AI,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO at NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s Omniverse digital twin operating system and Cosmos physical AI serve as the foundational libraries for digitalizing the world\u2019s physical industries.\u201d\nNew Models and Frameworks Accelerate World Building for Physical AI\r\nCreating 3D worlds for physical AI simulation requires three steps: world building, labeling the world with physical attributes and making it photoreal.\nNVIDIA offers generative AI models that accelerate each step. The USD Code and USD Search NVIDIA NIM\u2122 microservices are now generally available, letting developers use text prompts to generate or search for OpenUSD assets. A new NVIDIA Edify SimReady generative AI model unveiled today can automatically label existing 3D assets with attributes like physics or materials, enabling developers to process 1,000 3D objects in minutes instead of over 40 hours manually.\nNVIDIA Omniverse, paired with new NVIDIA Cosmos\u2122 world foundation models, creates a synthetic data multiplication engine \u2014 letting developers easily generate massive amounts of controllable, photoreal synthetic data. Developers can compose 3D scenarios in Omniverse and render images or videos as outputs. These can then be used with text prompts to condition Cosmos models to generate countless synthetic virtual environments for physical AI training.\nNVIDIA Omniverse Blueprints Speed Up Industrial, Robotic Workflows\r\nDuring the CES keynote, NVIDIA also announced four new blueprints that make it easier for developers to build Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD)-based Omniverse digital twins for physical AI. The blueprints include:\n\nMega, powered by Omniverse Sensor RTX APIs, for developing and testing\u00a0robot fleets at scale in an industrial factory or warehouse digital twin before deployment in real-world facilities.\nAutonomous Vehicle (AV) Simulation, also powered by Omniverse Sensor RTX APIs, that lets AV developers replay driving data, generate new ground-truth data and perform closed-loop testing to accelerate their development pipelines.\nOmniverse Spatial Streaming to Apple Vision Pro that helps developers create applications for immersive streaming of large-scale industrial digital twins to Apple Vision Pro.\nReal-Time Digital Twins for Computer Aided Engineering (CAE), a reference workflow built on NVIDIA CUDA-X\u2122 acceleration, physics AI and Omniverse libraries that enables real-time physics visualization.\n\nNew free Learn OpenUSD courses are also now available to help developers build OpenUSD-based worlds faster than ever.\nMarket Leaders Supercharge Industrial AI Using NVIDIA Omniverse\r\nGlobal leaders in software development and professional services are using Omniverse to develop new products and services that are poised to accelerate the next era of industrial AI.\nBuilding on its adoption of Omniverse libraries in its Reality Digital Twin data center digital twin platform, Cadence, a leader in electronic systems design, announced further integration of Omniverse into Allegro, its leading electronic computer-aided design application used by the world\u2019s largest semiconductor companies.\nAltair, a leader in computational intelligence, is adopting the Omniverse blueprint for real-time CAE digital twins for interactive computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Ansys is adopting Omniverse into Ansys Fluent, a leading CAE application. And Neural Concept is integrating Omniverse libraries into its next-generation software products, enabling real-time CFD and enhancing engineering workflows.\nAccenture, a leading global professional services company, is using Mega to help German supply chain solutions leader KION by building next-generation autonomous warehouses and robotic fleets for their network of global warehousing and distribution customers.\nAV toolchain provider Foretellix, a leader in data-driven autonomy development, is using the AV simulation blueprint to enable full 3D sensor simulation for optimized AV testing and validation. Research organization MITRE is also deploying the blueprint, in collaboration with the University of Michigan\u2019s Mcity testing facility, to create an industry-wide AV validation platform.\nKatana Studio is using the Omniverse spatial streaming workflow to create custom car configurators for Nissan and Volkswagen, allowing them to design and review car models in an immersive experience while improving the customer decision-making process.\nInnoactive, an XR streaming platform for enterprises, used the workflow to add platform support for spatial streaming to Apple Vision Pro. The solution enables Volkswagen Group to conduct design and engineering project reviews at human-eye resolution. Innoactive also collaborated with Syntegon, a provider of processing and packaging technology solutions for pharmaceutical production, to enable Syntegon\u2019s customers to walk through and review digital twins of custom installations before they are built.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: the benefits, impact, and performance of NVIDIA\u2019s products, services, and technologies, including NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA NIM\u00a0microservices, NVIDIA Edify SimReady generative AI model, NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models, NVIDIA CUDA-X, and NVIDIA Blueprints including Mega, Autonomous Vehicle (AV) Simulation, Omniverse Spatial Streaming to Apple Vision Pro, and Real-Time Digital Twins for Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE); third parties using or adopting NVIDIA\u2019s products and technologies, the benefits and impact thereof, and the features, performance and availability of their offerings; physical AI revolutionizing the $50 trillion manufacturing and logistics industries; and everything that moves \u2014 from cars and trucks to factories and warehouses \u2014 being robotic and embodied by AI are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

For example, Black Forest Labs\u2019 FLUX models \u2014 available on Hugging Face this week \u2014 at FP4 precision require less than 10GB of VRAM, compared with over 23GB at FP16. With a GeForce RTX 5090 GPU, the FLUX.1 [dev] model can generate images in just over five seconds, compared with 15 seconds on FP16 or 10 seconds on FP8 on a GeForce RTX 4090 GPU.\nGeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs also come equipped with ninth-generation encoders and sixth-generation decoders that add support for 4:2:2 and increase encoding quality for HEVC and AV1. Fourth-generation RT Cores paired with DLSS 4 provide creators with super-smooth 3D rendering viewports.\n\u201cThe GeForce RTX 5090 is a content creation powerhouse.\u201d \u2014 PC World\n\nThe GeForce RTX 5090 GPU includes 32GB of ultra-fast GDDR7 memory and 1,792 GB/sec of total memory bandwidth \u2014 a 77% bandwidth increase over the GeForce RTX 4090 GPU. It also includes three encoders and two decoders, reducing export times by a third compared with the prior generation.\nThe GeForce RTX 5080 GPU features 16GB of GDDR7 memory, providing up to 960 GB/sec of total memory bandwidth \u2014 a 34% increase over the GeForce RTX 4080 GPU. And it includes two encoders and two decoders to boost video editing workloads.\n\u201cThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 FE is notable on its own as a viable powerhouse option for any creative pro\u2026\u201d \u2014 Creative Bloq\n\nThe latest version of the NVIDIA Broadcast app is now available, adding two new beta AI effects \u2014 Studio Voice and Virtual Key Light \u2014 and improvements to existing ones, along with an updated user interface for better usability.\nIn addition, the January NVIDIA Studio Driver with support for the GeForce RTX 5090 and 5080 GPUs is ready for installation today. For automatic Studio Driver notifications, download the NVIDIA app, including an update for RTX Video Super Resolution \u2014 expanding the lineup of GeForce RTX GPUs that can run RTX Video Super Resolution for higher-quality video.\nUse the GeForce RTX graphics card product finder to pick up GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 GPUs or a prebuilt system today.\nLights, Camera, Broadcast\nThe latest NVIDIA Broadcast app release features two new AI effects \u2014 Studio Voice and Virtual Key Light \u2014 both currently in beta.\nStudio Voice enhances a user\u2019s microphone to match that of a high-quality microphone. Virtual Key Light relights subjects to deliver even lighting, as if a physical key light was defining the form and dimension of an individual. The new effects require a GeForce RTX 4080 or 5080 GPU or higher, and are designed for chatting streams and podcasts \u2014 these are not recommended for gaming.\nThe app update also improves voice quality with the Background Noise Removal feature, adds gaze stability and subtle random eye movements for a more natural appearance with Eye Contact, and improves foreground and background separation with Virtual Background.\nThe updated NVIDIA Broadcast app interface.\nThere\u2019s also an updated user interface that allows users to apply more effects simultaneously and includes a side-by-side camera preview option, a GPU utilization meter and more.\nDevelopers can integrate these effects directly into applications with NVIDIA Maxine Windows software development kits (SDKs) or by accessing them as an NVIDIA NIM microservice.\nThe updated NVIDIA Broadcast app is available for download today.\nAccelerating Creative Workflows\nFor video editors, all GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs include 4:2:2 hardware support and can decode a single video source at up to 8K at 75 frames per second (fps) or nine video sources at 4K at 30 fps per decoder, enabling smooth multi-camera video editing.\n\u201cThe GeForce RTX 5090 is currently unmatched in the consumer GPU market \u2014 nothing can touch it in terms of performance, with virtually any workload \u2014 AI, content creation, gaming, you name it.\u201d \u2014 Hot Hardware\n\nThe GeForce RTX 5090 is equipped with three encoders and two decoders. These multi-encoder and -decoder setups enable the GeForce RTX 5090 GPU to export video 40% faster than the GeForce RTX 4090 GPU and at 4x speed compared with the GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.\nGeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs also feature the ninth-generation NVIDIA Encoder (NVENC) with a 5% improvement in video quality on HEVC and AV1 encoding. The new AV1 Ultra Quality mode achieves 5% more compression at the same quality versus the previous generation, and the sixth-generation NVIDIA decoder achieves 2x decode speeds for H.264 over the prior version. The AV1 Ultra Quality mode will also be available to GeForce RTX 40 Series users.\nVideo editing applications Blackmagic Design\u2019s DaVinci Resolve and Wondershare Filmora have integrated these technologies.\n\nLivestreamers also benefit from the ninth-generation NVENC with a 5% video quality improvement for HEVC and AV1 \u2014 meaning that video quality looks like it used 5% more bitrate \u2014 in Twitch with the Twitch Enhanced Broadcasting beta, YouTube or Discord. This improvement is measured using BD-BR PSNR, the standard for measuring video quality by comparing what bitrate matches the same video quality between two encoders.\n3D artists benefit from the 32GB of memory in GeForce RTX 5090 GPUs, allowing them to work on massive 3D projects and across multiple platforms simultaneously with smooth viewport movement. GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs with fourth-generation RT Cores run 3D applications 40% faster.\n\nDLSS 4 is now available in D5 Render and is coming in February to Chaos Vantage, two popular professional-grade 3D apps for architects, animators and designers. D5 Render will support DLSS 4\u2019s new Multi Frame Generation feature to boost frame rates by using AI to generate up to three frames per rendered frame. This enables animators to smoothly navigate a scene with 4x as many frames, or render 3D content at 60 fps or more.\nDevelopers can learn more about integrating these new tools into their apps via SDKs.\nStay tuned for more updates on the GeForce RTX 50 Series, app performance and compatibility, and emerging AI technologies.\nEvery month brings new creative app updates and optimizations powered by the NVIDIA Studio.

Sometimes a case \u2014 like a malpractice suit or a labor dispute \u2014 requires special expertise, so judges send court clerks to a law library, looking for precedents and specific cases they can cite.\nLike a good judge, large language models (LLMs) can respond to a wide variety of human queries. But to deliver authoritative answers \u2014 grounded in specific court proceedings or similar ones\u00a0 \u2014 the model needs to be provided that information.\nThe court clerk of AI is a process called retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG for short.\nHow It Got Named \u2018RAG\u2019\nPatrick Lewis, lead author of the 2020 paper that coined the term, apologized for the unflattering acronym that now describes a growing family of methods across hundreds of papers and dozens of commercial services he believes represent the future of generative AI.\nPatrick Lewis\n\u201cWe definitely would have put more thought into the name had we known our work would become so widespread,\u201d Lewis said in an interview from Singapore, where he was sharing his ideas with a regional conference of database developers.\n\u201cWe always planned to have a nicer sounding name, but when it came time to write the paper, no one had a better idea,\u201d said Lewis, who now leads a RAG team at AI startup Cohere.\nSo, What Is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?\nRetrieval-augmented generation is a technique for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models with information fetched from specific and relevant data sources.\nIn other words, it fills a gap in how LLMs work. Under the hood, LLMs are neural networks, typically measured by how many parameters they contain. An LLM\u2019s parameters essentially represent the general patterns of how humans use words to form sentences.\nThat deep understanding, sometimes called parameterized knowledge, makes LLMs useful in responding to general prompts. However, it doesn\u2019t serve users who want a deeper dive into a specific type of information.\nCombining Internal, External Resources\nLewis and colleagues developed retrieval-augmented generation to link generative AI services to external resources, especially ones rich in the latest technical details.\nThe paper, with coauthors from the former Facebook AI Research (now Meta AI), University College London and New York University, called RAG \u201ca general-purpose fine-tuning recipe\u201d because it can be used by nearly any LLM to connect with practically any external resource.\nBuilding User Trust\nRetrieval-augmented generation gives models sources they can cite, like footnotes in a research paper, so users can check any claims. That builds trust.\nWhat\u2019s more, the technique can help models clear up ambiguity in a user query. It also reduces the possibility that a model will give a very plausible but incorrect answer, a phenomenon called hallucination.\nAnother great advantage of RAG is it\u2019s relatively easy. A blog by Lewis and three of the paper\u2019s coauthors said developers can implement the process with as few as five lines of code.\nThat makes the method faster and less expensive than retraining a model with additional datasets. And it lets users hot-swap new sources on the fly.\nHow People Are Using RAG\nWith retrieval-augmented generation, users can essentially have conversations with data repositories, opening up new kinds of experiences. This means the applications for RAG could be multiple times the number of available datasets.\nFor example, a generative AI model supplemented with a medical index could be a great assistant for a doctor or nurse. Financial analysts would benefit from an assistant linked to market data.\nIn fact, almost any business can turn its technical or policy manuals, videos or logs into resources called knowledge bases that can enhance LLMs. These sources can enable use cases such as customer or field support, employee training and developer productivity.\nThe broad potential is why companies including AWS, IBM, Glean, Google, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Oracle and Pinecone are adopting RAG.\nGetting Started With Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u00a0\nThe NVIDIA AI Blueprint for RAG helps developers build pipelines to connect their AI applications to enterprise data using industry-leading technology. This reference architecture provides developers with a foundation for building scalable and customizable retrieval pipelines that deliver high accuracy and throughput.\nThe blueprint can be used as is, or combined with other NVIDIA Blueprints for advanced use cases including digital humans and AI assistants. For example, the blueprint for AI assistants empowers organizations to build AI agents that can quickly scale their customer service operations with generative AI and RAG.\nIn addition, developers and IT teams can try the free, hands-on NVIDIA LaunchPad lab for building AI chatbots with RAG, enabling fast and accurate responses from enterprise data.\nAll of these resources use NVIDIA NeMo Retriever, which provides leading, large-scale retrieval accuracy and NVIDIA NIM microservices for simplifying secure, high-performance AI deployment across clouds, data centers and workstations. These are offered as part of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform for accelerating AI development and deployment.\nGetting the best performance for RAG workflows requires massive amounts of memory and compute to move and process data. The NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, with its 288GB of fast HBM3e memory and 8 petaflops of compute, is ideal \u2014 it can deliver a 150x speedup over using a CPU.\nOnce companies get familiar with RAG, they can combine a variety of off-the-shelf or custom LLMs with internal or external knowledge bases to create a wide range of assistants that help their employees and customers.\nRAG doesn\u2019t require a data center. LLMs are debuting on Windows PCs, thanks to NVIDIA software that enables all sorts of applications users can access even on their laptops.\nAn example application for RAG on a PC.\nPCs equipped with NVIDIA RTX GPUs can now run some AI models locally. By using RAG on a PC, users can link to a private knowledge source \u2013 whether that be emails, notes or articles \u2013 to improve responses. The user can then feel confident that their data source, prompts and response all remain private and secure.\nA recent blog provides an example of RAG accelerated by TensorRT-LLM for Windows to get better results fast.\nThe History of RAG\u00a0\nThe roots of the technique go back at least to the early 1970s. That\u2019s when researchers in information retrieval prototyped what they called question-answering systems, apps that use natural language processing (NLP) to access text, initially in narrow topics such as baseball.\nThe concepts behind this kind of text mining have remained fairly constant over the years. But the machine learning engines driving them have grown significantly, increasing their usefulness and popularity.\nIn the mid-1990s, the Ask Jeeves service, now Ask.com, popularized question answering with its mascot of a well-dressed valet. IBM\u2019s Watson became a TV celebrity in 2011 when it handily beat two human champions on the Jeopardy! game show.\n\nToday, LLMs are taking question-answering systems to a whole new level.\nInsights From a London Lab\nThe seminal 2020 paper arrived as Lewis was pursuing a doctorate in NLP at University College London and working for Meta at a new London AI lab. The team was searching for ways to pack more knowledge into an LLM\u2019s parameters and using a benchmark it developed to measure its progress.\nBuilding on earlier methods and inspired by a paper from Google researchers, the group \u201chad this compelling vision of a trained system that had a retrieval index in the middle of it, so it could learn and generate any text output you wanted,\u201d Lewis recalled.\nThe IBM Watson question-answering system became a celebrity when it won big on the TV game show Jeopardy!\nWhen Lewis plugged into the work in progress a promising retrieval system from another Meta team, the first results were unexpectedly impressive.\n\u201cI showed my supervisor and he said, \u2018Whoa, take the win. This sort of thing doesn\u2019t happen very often,\u2019 because these workflows can be hard to set up correctly the first time,\u201d he said.\nLewis also credits major contributions from team members Ethan Perez and Douwe Kiela, then of New York University and Facebook AI Research, respectively.\nWhen complete, the work, which ran on a cluster of NVIDIA GPUs, showed how to make generative AI models more authoritative and trustworthy. It\u2019s since been cited by hundreds of papers that amplified and extended the concepts in what continues to be an active area of research.\nHow Retrieval-Augmented Generation Works\nAt a high level, here\u2019s how retrieval-augmented generation works.\nWhen users ask an LLM a question, the AI model sends the query to another model that converts it into a numeric format so machines can read it. The numeric version of the query is sometimes called an embedding or a vector.\n\nIn retrieval-augmented generation, LLMs are enhanced with embedding and reranking models, storing knowledge in a vector database for precise query retrieval.\nThe embedding model then compares these numeric values to vectors in a machine-readable index of an available knowledge base. When it finds a match or multiple matches, it retrieves the related data, converts it to human-readable words and passes it back to the LLM.\nFinally, the LLM combines the retrieved words and its own response to the query into a final answer it presents to the user, potentially citing sources the embedding model found.\nKeeping Sources Current\nIn the background, the embedding model continuously creates and updates machine-readable indices, sometimes called vector databases, for new and updated knowledge bases as they become available.\nRetrieval-augmented generation combines LLMs with embedding models and vector databases.\nMany developers find LangChain, an open-source library, can be particularly useful in chaining together LLMs, embedding models and knowledge bases. NVIDIA uses LangChain in its reference architecture for retrieval-augmented generation.\nThe LangChain community provides its own description of a RAG process.\nThe future of generative AI lies in agentic AI \u2014 where LLMs and knowledge bases are dynamically orchestrated to create autonomous assistants. These AI-driven agents can enhance decision-making, adapt to complex tasks and deliver authoritative, verifiable results for users.\n\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Explainer | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Events | Inference | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA Blueprints | NVIDIA NeMo | TensorRT | Trustworthy AI \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Honors Americas Partners Advancing Agentic and Physical AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Blackwell Powers Real-Time AI for Entertainment Workflows\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Upgrade Now          Tigress Upgrades NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) to Strong Buy, Raises Target to $220 on AI Growth Potential      Affan Mir   January 29, 2025 4 min read        6   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.69%       We recently compiled a list of the 12 AI News Investors Probably Missed.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. AI is evolving rapidly with recent breakthroughs making it more accessible and efficient than ever. Smaller, cost-effective models are emerging, which are challenging the idea that cutting-edge AI requires massive resources. DeepSeek seems to be a great example of that.  Moreover, Tech Crunch reported that barely a week after DeepSeek unveiled its R1 reasoning AI model, Hugging Face has launched Open-R1, a project to replicate and fully open-source DeepSeek\u2019s R1 reasoning AI model, addressing concerns about its lack of transparency. While R1 has gained attention for its efficiency and top performance, Hugging Face aims to demystify its training process to promote responsible use and innovation. Using its Science Cluster, the team plans to recreate R1 and make it a foundation for future open-source models, emphasizing the collaborative benefits of openness in AI. Rethinking AI Dominance in a Multi-Model World At CNBC\u2019s WorldWide Exchange, Zack Kass, an AI futurist and former Head of GTM at OpenAI, discussed the implications of a Chinese firm creating a GPT-4 equivalent model with remarkable efficiency. He highlighted how this reflects a shift from reliance on capital and scale toward innovation driven by necessity. Kass noted that while U.S. firms have benefited from abundant resources, China's limitations spurred creative breakthroughs, such as building a competitive model at a lower cost. He addressed skepticism about claims regarding the model's development cost and chip usage and suggested that it is reasonable to assume the information is largely accurate. Kass also commented on the evolving role of national security in AI, emphasizing the private sector's growing involvement. While a U.S. executive order aimed at restricting China's access to chips may not have achieved its intended impact, it may have unintentionally fueled innovation.  Kass argued that the research behind AI models is becoming increasingly accessible, which could lead to more discoveries worldwide. He dismissed concerns over U.S. dominance in AI, framing this development as an opportunity for cheaper, widely available technology. On open source, Kass noted that the future likely involves a diverse ecosystem of models, rather than dominance by a single proprietary approach. For this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.   Story Continues Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Driving AGI Advancements with Test Time Scaling and DeepSeek  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) develops AI platforms for data centers, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and cloud computing. On January 28, Tigress Financial's Ivan Feinseth upgraded Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to Strong Buy with a raised price target of $220, viewing the recent selloff as a significant buying opportunity. While DeepSeek's R1 AI model claims competitive features at lower costs, the firm highlighted unknown capabilities and security concerns. Tigress emphasized Nvidia\u2019s key role in AI and data center growth and considers it as a long-term beneficiary of ongoing investments in these areas.Overall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks investors probably missed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\u00a0Disclosure: None.

NVIDIA Reflex accomplishes this by synchronizing CPU and GPU work, so player actions are reflected in-game quicker, giving gamers a competitive edge in multiplayer games, and making single-player titles more responsive.\nIn the last four years, NVIDIA Reflex has been integrated in over 100 games and reduced latency for tens of millions of GeForce gamers. Over 90% of gamers turn Reflex on, allowing them to experience better responsiveness, aim more accurately, and win more games.\nAt CES 2025, we\u2019re unveiling NVIDIA Reflex 2, which can reduce PC latency by up to 75%. Reflex 2 combines Reflex Low Latency mode with a new Frame Warp technology, further reducing latency by updating the rendered game frame based on the latest mouse input right before it is sent to the display.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex 2 Explained\nEvery player action taken in a video game goes through a complex pipeline before being rendered on-screen, with each step introducing latency. Inputs from your keyboard and mouse are passed to the game, where their effects are calculated by the CPU. The results are placed in a render queue, which is passed to the GPU for rendering, before finally being output to the display.\nThis process typically executes in tens of milliseconds for each frame, though stalls and other delays can add latency, making the game feel unresponsive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the launch of Reflex, we set out to optimize the latency pipeline from mouse to display via an SDK integrated directly into the game engine. Reflex better paces the CPU, preventing it from running ahead, and allowing it to submit tasks to the GPU just in time for the GPU to start work, effectively eliminating the render queue. And by starting the CPU work later, mouse inputs can be sampled closer to when a frame is being submitted to the GPU, further improving responsiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Reflex 2, we\u2019ve introduced a different approach to reducing latency. Four years ago, NVIDIA\u2019s esports research team published a study illustrating how players could complete aiming tasks faster when frames are updated after being rendered, based on even more recent mouse input. In the experiment, game frames were updated to reduce 80 milliseconds (ms) of added latency, which resulted in players completing an aiming target test 30% faster.\nWhen a player aims to the right with the mouse, for example, it would normally take some time for that action to be received, and for the new camera perspective to be rendered and eventually displayed. What if instead, an existing frame could be shifted or warped to the right to show the result much sooner?\nReflex 2 Frame Warp takes this concept from research to reality. As a frame is being rendered by the GPU, the CPU calculates the camera position of the next frame in the pipeline, based on the latest mouse or controller input. Frame Warp samples the new camera position from the CPU, and warps the frame just rendered by the GPU to this newer camera position. The warp is conducted as late as possible, just before the rendered frame is sent to the display, ensuring the most recent mouse input is reflected on screen.\nWhen Frame Warp shifts the game pixels, small holes in the image are created where the change in camera position reveals new parts of the game scene. Through our research, NVIDIA has developed a latency-optimized predictive rendering algorithm that uses camera, color and depth data from prior frames to in-paint these holes accurately. Players see the rendered frame with an updated camera perspective and without holes, reducing latency for any actions that shift the in-game camera. This helps players aim better, track enemies more precisely, and hit more shots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s an example from Embark Studios\u2019 THE FINALS, with Frame Warp, with and without in-painting:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result is a frame which shows the freshest camera position, seamlessly inserted into the rendering pipeline.\u00a0\nTHE FINALS features complex lighting and physics, and users can crank up the graphics settings to deliver a great visual experience, giving the GPU a good workout. At 4K with max settings and global illumination on an RTX 5070, THE FINALS achieves 56ms of latency. With Reflex Low Latency, latency is more than halved to 27ms. And by enabling Reflex 2, Frame Warp cuts input lag by nearly an entire frametime, reducing latency by another 50% to 14ms. The result is an overall latency reduction of 75% by enabling NVIDIA Reflex 2 with Frame Warp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflex Low Latency mode is most effective when a PC is GPU bottlenecked. But Reflex 2 with Frame Warp provides significant savings in both CPU and GPU bottlenecked scenarios. In Riot Games\u2019 VALORANT, a CPU-bottlenecked game that runs blazingly fast, at 800+ FPS on the new GeForce RTX 5090, PC latency averages under 3 ms using Reflex 2 Frame Warp - one of the lowest latency figures we\u2019ve measured in a first-person shooter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex 2 is coming soon to THE FINALS and VALORANT, and will debut first on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, with support added for other GeForce RTX GPUs in a future update.\nStay tuned to GeForce.com for updates on Reflex 2 availability, and for upcoming games incorporating the new tech.\nIn the meantime, check out all of our other GeForce RTX 50 Series announcements to see how we\u2019re further improving the PC experience for top games and apps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Because of the extremely high volume and various data types, most generative AI applications use a fraction of the total amount of data being stored and generated.\nFor enterprises to thrive in the AI era, they must find a way to make use of all of their data. This isn\u2019t possible using traditional computing and data processing techniques. Instead, enterprises need an AI query engine.\nWhat Is an AI Query Engine?\nSimply, an AI query engine is a system that connects AI applications, or AI agents, to data. It\u2019s a critical component of agentic AI, as it serves as a bridge between an organization\u2019s knowledge base and AI-powered applications, enabling more accurate, context-aware responses.\nAI agents form the basis of an AI query engine, where they can gather information and do work to assist human employees. An AI agent will gather information from many data sources, plan, reason and take action. AI agents can communicate with users, or they can work in the background, where human feedback and interaction will always be available.\nIn practice, an AI query engine is a sophisticated system that efficiently processes large amounts of data, extracts and stores knowledge, and performs semantic search on that knowledge, which can be quickly retrieved and used by AI.\nAn AI query engine processes, stores and retrieves data \u2014 connecting AI agents to insights.\nAI Query Engines Unlock Intelligence in Unstructured Data\nAn enterprise\u2019s AI query engine will have access to knowledge stored in many different formats, but being able to extract intelligence from unstructured data is one of the most significant advancements it enables.\nTo generate insights, traditional query engines rely on structured queries and data sources, such as relational databases. Users must formulate precise queries using languages like SQL, and results are limited to predefined data formats.\nIn contrast, AI query engines can process structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. Common unstructured data formats are PDFs, log files, images and video, and are stored on object stores, file servers and parallel file systems. AI agents communicate with users and with each other using natural language. This enables them to interpret user intent, even when it\u2019s ambiguous, by accessing diverse data sources. These agents can deliver results in a conversational format, so that users can interpret results.\nThis capability makes it possible to derive more insights and intelligence from any type of data \u2014 not just data that fits neatly into rows and columns.\nFor example, companies like DataStax and NetApp are building AI data platforms that enable their customers to have an AI query engine for their next-generation applications.\nKey Features of AI Query Engines\nAI query engines possess several crucial capabilities:\n\nDiverse data handling: AI query engines can access and process various data types, including structured, semi-structured and unstructured data from multiple sources, including text, PDF, image, video and specialty data types.\nScalability: AI query engines can efficiently handle petabyte-scale data, making all enterprise knowledge available to AI applications quickly.\nAccurate retrieval: AI query engines provide high-accuracy, high-performance embedding, vector search and reranking of knowledge from multiple sources.\nContinuous learning: AI query engines can store and incorporate feedback from AI-powered applications, creating an AI data flywheel in which the feedback is used to refine models and increase the effectiveness of the applications over time.\n\nRetrieval-augmented generation is a component of AI query engines. RAG uses the power of generative AI models to act as a natural language interface to data, allowing models to access and incorporate relevant information from large datasets during the response generation process.\nUsing RAG, any business or other organization can turn its technical information, policy manuals, videos and other data into useful knowledge bases. An AI query engine can then rely on these sources to support such areas as customer relations, employee training and developer productivity.\nAdditional information-retrieval techniques and ways to store knowledge are in research and development, so the capabilities of an AI query engine are expected to rapidly evolve.\nThe Impact of AI Query Engines\nUsing AI query engines, enterprises can fully harness the power of AI agents to connect their workforces to vast amounts of enterprise knowledge, improve the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses, process and utilize previously untapped data sources, and create data-driven AI flywheels that continuously improve their AI applications.\nSome examples include an AI virtual assistant that provides personalized, 24/7 customer service experiences, an AI agent for searching and summarizing video, an AI agent for analyzing software vulnerabilities or an AI research assistant.\nBridging the gap between raw data and AI-powered applications, AI query engines will grow to play a crucial role in helping organizations extract value from their data.\nNVIDIA Blueprints can help enterprises get started connecting AI to their data.

This technological wave is simultaneously transforming advertising and marketing, customer engagement and supply chain operations. By harnessing AI, retailers and CPG brands are not just adapting to change \u2014 they\u2019re actively shaping the future of commerce.\nNVIDIA\u2019s second annual \u201cState of AI in Retail and CPG\u201d survey provides insights into the adoption, investment and impact of AI, including generative AI; the top use cases and challenges; and a special section this year examining the use of AI in the supply chain. It\u2019s an in-depth look at the current ecosystem of AI in retail and CPG, and how it\u2019s transforming the industries.\nDrawn from hundreds of responses from industry professionals, key highlights of the survey show:\n\n89% of respondents said they are either actively using AI in their operations or assessing AI projects, including trials and pilots (up from 82% in 2023)\n87% said AI had a positive impact on increasing annual revenue\n94% said AI has helped reduce annual operational costs\n97% said spending on AI would increase in the next fiscal year\n\nGenerative AI in Retail Takes Center Stage\nGenerative AI has found a strong foothold in retail and CPG, with over 80% of companies either using or piloting projects. Companies are harnessing the technology, especially for content generation in marketing and advertising, as well as customer analysis and analytics.\nConsistent with last year\u2019s survey, over 50% of retailers believe that generative AI is a strategic technology that will be a differentiator in the market.\nThe top use cases for generative AI in retail include:\n\nContent generation for marketing (60%)\nPredictive analytics (44%)\nPersonalized marketing and advertising (42%)\nCustomer analysis and segmentation (41%)\nDigital shopping assistants or copilots (40%)\n\nWhile some concerns about generative AI exist, specifically around data privacy, security and implementation costs, these concerns haven\u2019t dampened retailers\u2019 enthusiasm, with 93% of respondents saying they still plan to increase generative AI investment next year.\nAI Across the Retail Landscape\nAI use cases have proliferated across nearly every line of business in retail, with over 50% of retailers using AI in more than six different use cases throughout their operations.\nIn physical stores, the top three use cases are inventory management, analytics and insights, and adaptive advertising. For digital retail, they\u2019re marketing and advertising content creation, and hyperpersonalized recommendations. And in the back office, the top use cases are customer analysis and predictive analytics.\nAI has made a significant impact in retail and CPG, with improved insights and decision-making (43%) and enhanced employee productivity (42%) being listed as top benefits among survey respondents.\nThe most common AI challenge retailers faced in 2024 was a lack of easy to understand and explainable AI tools, underscoring a greater need for software and solutions \u2014 specifically around generative AI and AI agents \u2014 to enter the market to make it easier for companies to use AI solutions and understand how they work.\nAI in the Supply Chain\nManaging the supply chain has always been a challenge for retail and CPG companies, but it\u2019s become increasingly difficult over the last several years due to tumultuous global events and shifting consumer preferences. Companies are feeling the pressure, with 59% of respondents saying that their supply chain challenges have grown in the last year.\nIncreasingly, companies are turning to AI to help address these challenges, and the impact of these AI solutions is starting to show up in results.\n\n58% said AI is helping to improve operational efficiency and throughput.\n45% are using AI to reduce supply chain costs.\n42% are employing AI to meet shifting customer expectations.\n\nInvestment in AI for supply chain management is set to grow, with 82% of companies planning to increase spending in the next fiscal year.\nAs the retail and CPG industries continue to embrace the power of AI, the findings from the latest survey underscore a pivotal shift in how businesses operate in a complex new landscape.

To address this significant demand, particularly in industrial and manufacturing sectors, NVIDIA is releasing a collection of robot foundation models, data pipelines and simulation frameworks to accelerate next-generation humanoid robot development efforts.\nAnnounced by NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang today at the CES trade show, the NVIDIA Isaac GR00T Blueprint for synthetic motion generation helps developers generate exponentially large synthetic motion data to train their humanoids using imitation learning.\n\nImitation learning \u2014 a subset of robot learning \u2014 enables humanoids to acquire new skills by observing and mimicking expert human demonstrations. Collecting these extensive, high-quality datasets in the real world is tedious, time-consuming and often prohibitively expensive. Implementing the Isaac GR00T blueprint for synthetic motion generation allows developers to easily generate exponentially large synthetic datasets from just a small number of human demonstrations.\n\nStarting with the GR00T-Teleop workflow, users can tap into the Apple Vision Pro to capture human actions in a digital twin. These human actions are mimicked by a robot in\u00a0 simulation and recorded for use as ground truth.\nThe GR00T-Mimic workflow then multiplies the captured human demonstration into a larger synthetic motion dataset. Finally, the GR00T-Gen workflow, built on the NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA Cosmos platforms, exponentially expands this dataset through domain randomization and 3D upscaling.\nThe dataset can then be used as an input to the robot policy, which teaches robots how to move and interact with their environment effectively and safely in NVIDIA Isaac Lab, an open-source and modular framework for robot learning.\nWorld Foundation Models Narrow the Sim-to-Real Gap\u00a0\nNVIDIA also announced Cosmos at CES, a platform featuring a family of open, pretrained world foundation models purpose-built for generating physics-aware videos and world states for physical AI development. It includes autoregressive and diffusion models in a variety of sizes and input data formats. The models were trained on 18 quadrillion tokens, including 2 million hours of autonomous driving, robotics, drone footage and synthetic data.\nIn addition to helping generate large datasets, Cosmos can reduce the simulation-to-real gap by upscaling images from 3D to real. Combining Omniverse \u2014 a developer platform of application programming interfaces and microservices for building 3D applications and services \u2014 with Cosmos is critical, because it helps minimize potential hallucinations commonly associated with world models by providing crucial safeguards through its highly controllable, physically accurate simulations.\n\nAn Expanding Ecosystem\u00a0\nCollectively, NVIDIA Isaac GR00T, Omniverse and Cosmos are helping physical AI and humanoid innovation take a giant leap forward. Major robotics companies have started adopting and demonstrated results with Isaac GR00T, including Boston Dynamics and Figure.\nHumanoid software, hardware and robot manufacturers can apply for early access to NVIDIA\u2019s humanoid robot developer program.\nWatch the CES opening keynote from NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang, and stay up to date by subscribing to the newsletter and following NVIDIA Robotics on LinkedIn, Instagram, X and Facebook.\nSee notice regarding software product information.\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | CES 2025 | Cosmos | Digital Twin | Isaac | Omniverse | Robotics | Synthetic Data Generation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Honors Americas Partners Advancing Agentic and Physical AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Blackwell Powers Real-Time AI for Entertainment Workflows\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

WFMs can generate detailed videos from text or image input data and predict how a scene evolves by combining its current state (image or video) with actions (such as prompts or control signals).\n\u201cWorld foundation models are important to physical AI developers,\u201d said Liu. \u201cThey can imagine many different environments and can simulate the future, so we can make good decisions based on this simulation.\u201d\nThis is particularly valuable for physical AI systems, such as robots and self-driving cars, which must interact safely and efficiently with the real world.\n\nThe AI Podcast \u00b7 NVIDIA\u2019s Ming-Yu Liu on How World Foundation Models Will Advance Physical AI \u2013 Episode 240\n\nWhy Are World Foundation Models Important?\nBuilding world models often requires vast amounts of data, which can be difficult and expensive to collect. WFMs can generate synthetic data, providing a rich, varied dataset that enhances the training process.\nIn addition, training and testing physical AI systems in the real world can be resource-intensive. WFMs provide virtual, 3D environments where developers can simulate and test these systems in a controlled setting without the risks and costs associated with real-world trials.\nOpen Access to World Foundation Models\nAt the CES trade show, NVIDIA announced NVIDIA Cosmos, a platform of generative WFMs that accelerate the development of physical AI systems such as robots and self-driving cars.\nThe platform is designed to be open and accessible, and includes pretrained WFMs based on diffusion and auto-regressive architectures, along with tokenizers that can compress videos into tokens for transformer models.\nLiu explained that with these open models, enterprises and developers have all the ingredients they need to build large-scale models. The open platform also provides teams with the flexibility to explore various options for training and fine-tuning models, or build their own based on specific needs.\nEnhancing AI Workflows Across Industries\nWFMs are expected to enhance AI workflows and development in various industries. Liu sees particularly significant impacts in two areas:\n\u201cThe self-driving car industry and the humanoid [robot] industry will benefit a lot from world model development,\u201d said Liu. \u201c[WFMs] can simulate different environments that will be difficult to have in the real world, to make sure the agent behaves respectively.\u201d\nFor self-driving cars, these models can simulate environments that allow for comprehensive testing and optimization. For example, a self-driving car can be tested in various simulated weather conditions and traffic scenarios to help ensure it performs safely and efficiently before deployment on roads.\nIn robotics, WFMs can simulate and verify the behavior of robotic systems in different environments to make sure they perform tasks safely and efficiently before deployment.\nNVIDIA is collaborating with companies like 1X, Huobi and XPENG to help address challenges in physical AI development and advance their systems.\n\u201cWe are still in the infancy of world foundation model development \u2014 it\u2019s useful, but we need to make it more useful,\u201d Liu said. \u201cWe also need to study how to best integrate these world models into the physical AI systems in a way that can really benefit them.\u201d\nListen to the podcast with Ming-Yu Liu, or read the transcript.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Cosmos and the latest announcements in generative AI and robotics by watching the CES opening keynote by NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang, as well as joining NVIDIA sessions at the show.\n\n\n\nCategories: The AI PodcastTags: Artificial Intelligence | CES 2024 | Physical AI | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Honors Americas Partners Advancing Agentic and Physical AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Blackwell Powers Real-Time AI for Entertainment Workflows\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The R&D company out of China stated the model cost $6 million to train, which sent the market into a panic as this is pennies to the dollar compared to what Big Tech is spending. The jerk-reaction readthrough was that, in the blink of an eye, DeepSeek had fundamentally rewritten the AI capex story.\u00a0The battle between the United States and China on large language models (LLMs) following DeepSeek\u2019s challenge to OpenAI has been called AI\u2019s Sputnik moment. The most important takeaway for investors about this analogy is that Sputnik spurred massive investments. It was not the final destination, rather, it was the beginning of a multi-decade space race. The Sputnik satellite cost $15 to $20 million or $33 million with cost-adjusted inflation, yet the United States would spend an estimated $1 trillion over a sixty year period in response.The United States takes it quite seriously to stay in the lead, and AI will spur an arms race unlike anything the world has seen before. Consider that it took sixty years for the government to spend $1 trillion (inflation adjusted) on the space race, yet in one sweeping piece of legislation, the United States will spend $500 billion in 5 years on AI infrastructure, up from $70 billion being spent in 2024 alone.Remember, it was the market\u2019s so-called \u201cefficiency\u201d that caused Nvidia\u2019s stock to drop 60% from a gaming-related miss following rumors that Ethereum\u2019s merge to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) would be the death knell for the stock. This was the very moment the powerful AI GPUs called Hopper were shipping, equipped with a Transformer Engine that would enable self-learning models, and change the world as we know it.Tech is defined by disruption, by thousands of product announcements, and by leagues of competitors. It can be a noisy and costly sector when investors get whiplashed by the news of the day. My firm has an enviable track record on Nvidia \u2013 including speaking out during staggering selloffs or supply chain rumors. This includes also telling you when we are not buying, or when a stock is frothy, such as when Nvidia was trading in the $140s. We also go to great lengths to tell you when we plan to buy again. You will find dozens (perhaps hundreds) of articles on DeepSeek at this point; yet you will be hard pressed to find one other person helping investors navigate Nvidia\u2019s stock at this granular level.Below, I provide evidence that DeepSeek is not the black swan that killed Nvidia overnight \u2013 in fact, driving down the costs of AI development has always been the plan -- and will ultimately boost Nvidia\u2019s sales in the long run as AI will leave the data center, and move on-premise for enterprises and on-device for consumers.I also touch base on what investors should keep an eye on price-wise moving forward for the GPU juggernaut.DeepSeek\u2019s DualPipe AlgorithmDeepSeek\u2019s DualPipe Algorithm optimized pipeline parallelism, which essentially reduces inefficiencies in how GPU nodes communicate and how mixture of experts (MoE) is leveraged. MoE refers to distributing a computational load across \u201cmultiple experts\u201d (or neural networks) to train across thousands of GPUs using what is called model and pipeline parallelism. This enables more compute-efficient training yet the parameters still need to be loaded in VRAM, so the memory requirements remain high.Tom\u2019s Hardware wrote an article about this a month ago, with an usually prescient title: \u201cChinese AI company says breakthroughs enabled creating a leading-edge AI model with 11X less compute \u2014 DeepSeek's optimizations could highlight limits of US sanctions.\u201d The article stated: \u201cThe DualPipe algorithm minimized training bottlenecks, particularly for the cross-node expert parallelism required by the MoE architecture, and this optimization allowed the cluster to process 14.8 trillion tokens during pre-training with near-zero communication overhead.\u201dBy allowing the routing of tokens to experts and the aggregation of results to be handled in parallel through code called PTX (Parallel Thread Execution), DualPipe helped to drive down costs. The software essentially optimized the hardware. The company also created a 4-node maximum to limit nodes and reduce traffic, allowing for a more efficient communication framework.MoE models like DeepSeek\u2019s can provide numerous benefits, and this is what DeepSeek is showing \u2013 an ability to train larger models at a lower cost with much faster pre-training, faster inference, and an ability to deliver decreased first-token latency. However, MoE also can require higher VRAM to store all experts simultaneously and can face challenges in fine-tuning.Mixed Point Precision and Multi-Head Latent Attention Lowers Memory UsageDeepSeek\u2019s success is also found in lowering memory usage with multi-head latent attention that lowered memory usage to 5% to 13%. MLA ultimately reduces memory requirements during inference by processing long sequences of text. As pointed out by ML Engineer Zain ul Abideen, \u201cMLA achieves superior performance than MHA, as well as significantly reduces KV-cache boosting inference efficiency.\u201dIt has been estimated that HBM3e\u2019s component costs in Hopper GPUs could be as much as 25% higher than HBM3-equipped GPUs, and it\u2019s expected HBM4 will add more costs due to the complexities of delivering faster data rates.\u00a0Memory is an expensive component and Hopper is known for its limited memory capacity at 80GB of HBM3e memory versus Blackwell\u2019s 192GB of HBM3e (nearly 2.5X the memory in the upcoming release). Therefore, reducing memory usage is one path to optimizing Hopper GPUs.DeepSeek\u2019s success also stemmed from its pioneering approach to model architecture. The company introduced a novel\u00a0MLA (multi-head latent attention)\u00a0method that lowers memory usage to just 5%\u201313% of what the more common MHA architecture consumes.\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s hardware excellence stands out in the Hopper generation of GPUs with the Transformer Engine. Two years ago, Hopper\u2019s transformer engine brought about Chat-GPT\u2019s big moment as the OpenAI model eliminated the need to find patterns between elements mathematically, and this opens up which datasets can be used and how quickly.The H100s also leverage the transformer engine for mixed precision, such as FP8, FP16 or FP32, depending on the workload. Nvidia architected the ability to switch between floating precision points in order to require less memory usage. Here is what Nvidia states:\u201cThere are numerous benefits to using numerical formats with lower precision than 32-bit floating point. First, they require less memory, enabling the training and deployment of larger neural networks. Second, they require less memory bandwidth which speeds up data transfer operations. Third, math operations run much faster in reduced precision, especially on GPUs with Tensor Core support for that precision. Mixed precision training achieves all these benefits while ensuring that\u00a0no\u00a0task-specific accuracy is lost compared to full precision training. It does so by identifying the steps that require full precision and using 32-bit floating point for only those steps while using 16-bit floating point everywhere else.\u201dDeepSeek says that FP8 allowed it to \u201cachieve both accelerated training and reduced GPU memory usage,\u201d as it validated FP8\u2019s usage for training large scale models for a fraction of the cost.\u00a0 A majority of the \u201cmost compute-density operations are conducted in FP8, while a few key operations are strategically maintained in their original data formats,\u201d such as those that require higher precision due to sensitivity reasons.Though lower-precision training has often been \u201climited by the presence of outliers in activations, weights, and gradients,\u201d and tests have shown that FP8 training was prone to higher instability and more frequent loss spikes, it is now emerging as a solution for efficient training due to hardware advancements (i.e., Hopper bringing powerful FP8 support, Blackwell bringing FP4).DeepSeek also provided recommendations for future chips to accommodate low-precision training and replicate this at scale, suggesting chip designs should \u201cincrease accumulation precision in Tensor Cores to support full-precision accumulation, or select an appropriate accumulation bit-width according to the accuracy requirements of training and inference algorithms.\u201dThis is what Blackwell was designed to address, with new precisions in Tensor Cores, FP4 precision, increased SM count, and more CUDA cores versus the Hopper. Blackwell also packs 208 billion transistors to provide up to 20 petaflops of FP4, compared to the H100\u2019s 4 petaflops of FP8. The B200 features a second-generation transformer engine supporting 4-bit floating point (FP4), with the goal of doubling the performance and size of models the memory can support while maintaining accuracy.To simply recreate DeepSeek\u2019s training efficiencies and develop large-scale models, Hopper GPUs are a requirement due to support for FP8, with Blackwell bringing FP4 to power real-time inference and supercharged training for trillion parameter models.Understanding the nuances of Nvidia\u2019s hardware is the reason that I first called out Nvidia\u2019s AI GPU thesis and CUDA moat in late 2018, and in 2019, Volta\u2019s AI capabilities prompted me to say on my\u00a0premium stock research\u00a0site: \u201cI believe Nvidia will be one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies by 2030.\u201d This has led to potential gains of over 4,000% for our free readers.Blackwell is Not HopperThis may seem like a moment where AI software is triumphant, yet we are at the end of the Hopper generation with the H100s (and the more restricted H800) GPUs being available for two years now. Two years is eternity in the AI arms race, and the fact Hopper is reaching a point of peak optimization at the very moment that Blackwell is shipping is not a shocking new revelation --- rather, it\u2019s the point of keeping a fast-paced product road map. Per Nvidia\u2019s Computex keynote, from Pascal to Blackwell, their AI systems will deliver \u201c1,000 times increase in AI compute,\u201d while simultaneously decreasing the \u201cenergy per token by 45,000X.Therefore, the market is a bit confused to think the 11X increase in compute from software optimizations is going to catch Nvidia off guard. Below are the stated differences between the H100 and GB200 NVL72 systems on Mixture of Experts (MoE) real-time throughput and training speeds.DeepSeek acquiesced the limitations they faced in deploying the model is \u201cexpected to be naturally addressed with the development of more advanced hardware.\u201d Note, they are not saying with the development of more advanced software.I made the point nearly a year ago that Nvidia is competing with Nvidia with its one-year product release road map stating: \u201cThe product road map is the single most important thing investors should be focused on. A good chunk of the AI accelerator story is understood at this point. What is not understood is how aggressive Nvidia is becoming by speeding up to a one-year release cycle for its next generation of GPUs instead of a two-year release cycle.\"In addition, by open sourcing the model, there will be more developers who can build new AI capabilities. As stated in a Predibase analysis, there were 500 derivative models of DeepSeek created in a few days\u2019 time.Nvidia has been early to this eventual outcome with the launch of Project Digits, a $3,000 supercomputer that can run 200B-parameter models. By releasing powerful personal computers, Nvidia seeks the proliferation of its GPUs \u2013 much like Apple\u2019s iPhone -- whereas companies like OpenAI are the ones most challenged by an open source LLM that drives down input token and output token costs that are 27X less expensive than OpenAI\u2019s o1 model.Blackwell Inches United States Toward General Artificial Intelligence (AGI)The reason that software has not officially begun to commoditize hardware, and we could be as far as 5-10 years away from this moment, is because AI development is incredibly nascent. Blackwell and future generations of GPUs are a necessity for AI development to inch closer to the start of general artificial intelligence (AGI).There have been discussions questioning if it is possible to reach AGI with reinforcement learning: \u201cartificial general intelligence can be achieved if an agent tries to maximize a reward in a complex environment because the complexity of the environment will force the agent to learn complex abilities like; social intelligence, language, etc.\u201dReinforcement learning is an ML method where an agent or model learns to make decisions through interactions in its environment, via rewards or punishments. Agents will interact with the environment, receive a positive or negative reward, and adjust its decisions/actions based on the feedback it has received.AGI refers to the creation of a machine that is capable of performing intellectual tasks on par with humans, and have the ability to understand, learn and apply knowledge to a wide range of domains. Both RL and AGI involve learning from interactions with the environment, though RL is typically more focused on specific tasks or environments where AGI aims to be \u2018all-encompassing.\u2019If software efficiencies from China are relatable to Sputnik, then the arrival of AGI will be the moment we land on the moon. AGI requires an order of magnitude larger models \u2013 minimum 1 trillion, up to 10 trillion or more. Reinforcement learning is certainly a step in the right direction, yet trillion+ parameter models are inevitable \u2013 and it\u2019ll require Nvidia and other AI accelerator design companies to get there.Source: DeepSeek R-1 Pictured Above: Nvidia Stock saw its market cap shed $600 billion in one day\u00a0 following DeepSeek\u2019s release with benchmarks surpassing OpenAI on its performance and reasoning abilities.\u00a0DeepSeek is Cheap \u2026 Or is it?DeepSeek has stated V3 was trained on 14.8 trillion tokens in pre-training, with each 1 trillion tokens taking 180K H800 GPU hours (3.7 days) on its 2,048 H800 cluster. Compare this to Meta\u2019s 405 billion parameter Llama 3.1 model, which was trained in 54 days (30.8M GPU hours) on a 16,384 H100 GPU cluster, estimated to cost ~$80 million at a $2.6/hour rental price.This accounted for a majority of the costs at $5.328 million, assuming a $2/hour rental price for the H800s (this is about in-line with long-term contract rates at Lambda for the H100, but ~20% lower than short-term costs from other startup cloud providers).The estimated $6 million cost for DeepSeek would also be pennies on the dollar compared to estimated training costs for OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 and Alphabet\u2019s Gemini Ultra.Source: DeepSeekWhile the training costs were estimated utilizing rental prices (and up for debate), what\u2019s important to note is that the $5.6 million cost only excluded \u201ccosts associated with prior research and ablation experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data.\u201dDemocratization of AI Helps NvidiaNvidia\u2019s goal is to not only sell GPUs to the fortresses of Big Tech. Rather, all tech companies seek large addressable markets and the democratization of AI will assist Nvidia in reaching worldwide AI device ubiquity.In the meantime, Blackwell is sold out. Microsoft stated this week that they are still supply constrained in the cloud, and Azure needs more supply to grow. Meta doubled down on its planned capex for 2025, and signaled a willingness to spend \u201chundreds of billions\u201d towards AI infrastructure in the long run.In the medium term, Nvidia will allocate supply to enterprises and edge AI, as lower costs will facilitate enterprise AI and edge computing. The market grew concerned that there would not be ROI on these large AI investments, and on the other hand, the market now is panicking when costs are lowered to the point where ROI can be achieved.This has always been Nvidia\u2019s goal, with CEO Jensen Huang and other executives declaring at high profile stages such as CES and GTC that the cost of computing will go down with each generation of GPUs. At GTC 2024, Huang explained that Nvidia \u201caccelerated algorithms so quickly that the marginal cost of computing has declined so tremendously over the last decade that it enabled generative AI to emerge. He further explained that reducing the cost of computing and accelerating computing is what Nvidia \u201cdoes for a living at its core,\u201d and that the \u201cpricing that we create always starts from TCO.\u201dNvidia VP Ian Buck corroborated this at BofA GTC Conference in June 2024: \u201cThe opportunity here is to help [customers] get the maximum performance through a fixed megawatt data center and at the best possible cost and optimized for cost.\u201dSign up for I/O Fund's free newsletter with gains of up to 2600% because of Nvidia's epic run - Click hereWhat to Monitor for Nvidia\u2019s Earnings ReportThere seems to be no end to the amount of Blackwell supply rumors with yet another one circulated in January 2025. According to Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s management team, \u201ccut the order, that won\u2019t happen. Actually [it will] continue to increase.\u201dHere are the additional points that cause us to believe Blackwell revenue will show up soon enough:1)\u00a0Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at CES reconfirmed that Blackwell is in full production, adding that \u201cevery single cloud service provider now has systems up and running.\"2)\u00a0CFO Colette Kress in Q3\u2019s earnings: \u201cBlackwell demand is staggering and we are racing to scale supply to meet the incredible demand customers are placing on us. Customers are gearing up to deploy Blackwell at scale.\u201d3)\u00a0CFO Colette Kress in Q3: \u201cWhile demand is greatly exceeding supply, we are on track to exceed our previous Blackwell revenue estimate of several billion dollars as our visibility into supply continues to increase.\u201d4)\u00a0CFO Colette Kress at UBS\u2019 Global Technology Conference: \u201cWhat we see in terms of our Blackwell, which will be here this quarter is also probably a supply constraint that is going to take us well into our next fiscal year for several quarters from now. So, no, we don't see a slowdown. We continue to see tremendous demand and interest, particularly for our new architecture that's coming out.\u201d UBS Analyst Tim Arcuri added, \u201cyou are actually shipping more Blackwell than you thought you would three months ago.\u201d5)\u00a0CFO Colette Kress at CES: \u201cWe are able to increase our demand and increase our revenue each quarter as well. \u2026 When we think about the demand that is in front of us, it is absolutely a growth year.\u201dBig Tech\u2019s CapexTwo weeks ago, my firm covered how Big Tech capex (AI spending) came in significantly above expectations in 2024, and is on track to repeat that in 2025. To recap, analysts had initially estimated capex of ~$200 billion for Big Tech in 2024, an increase of ~30% YoY. However, our latest checks suggest that Big Tech is on track to spend at least $236 billion in capex in 2024, 18% higher than analyst estimates and representing YoY growth of more than 52%.For 2025, Big Tech is on track to spend $300 billion or more on capex, based on initial commitments from Microsoft and Meta totaling at least $140 billion combined. This is already tracking ~7% higher than ~$280 billion estimated by analysts, with Microsoft\u2019s $80 billion commitment 40% higher than estimated and Meta\u2019s $60-65 billion more than 18% higher than estimated.DeepSeek has highlighted one major tailwind that has been overlooked \u2013 if AI models can now be trained quicker and cheaper, it\u2019s likely to catalyze demand for GPU instances in the cloud from leading providers, as GPUs can be rented much faster than setting up new infrastructure. In order to meet elevated demand, hyperscalers will need to continue purchasing, or even accelerate purchasing, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs in order to prevent chip constraints from impeding revenue growth.Analyst Revisions for Nvidia\u2019s Stock Remain UnchangedIn June 2024, in the analysis Here's Why Nvidia Stock Will Reach $10 Trillion Market Cap By 2030, I discussed the importance of intra-quarter analyst revisions supporting Nvidia\u2019s massive run, as data center revenue continued to blow past expectations.Seen below, Nvidia\u2019s revenue for FY25 was estimated at $120 billion in June, being revised 31.5% higher over the six months prior. In dollar terms, that represented a nearly $29 billion increase from $91.3 billion. For FY26, revenue was estimated at $157.5 billion in June, a 44.8% increase from $108.8 billion, a nearly $50 billion increase in six months.Compare that to today:FY25 revisions are up just 7.6% (or $9 billion) since July to $129.2 billion as the fiscal year comes to a close, but FY26 revenue is 20% higher to $196.5 billion. That\u2019s another $39.5 billion (or over a full quarter at the current run rate) that has been added in the past seven months.Opinions aside, intra-quarter revisions will be where you will first see any material hiccups or impacts on revenue. FY26 quarterly revisions have come down slightly over the past month, at -1.3% lower for Q4. So far, there has been no impact from DeepSeek\u2019s V3 release \u2013 in fact, estimates inched marginally higher on January 28, with Q4 FY26 revenue rising from $55.49 billion to $55.51 billion.The bigger picture \u2013 revenue is still 14% to 24% higher than it was six months ago. At this scale, that\u2019s $6 to $10-billion-plus higher.Where Nvidia\u2019s Stock Price Goes NextLet\u2019s talk price targets.In the write-up \u201cWhere I Plan to Buy Nvidia Stock Next\u201d we stated that Nvidia still needs, at least, one more push higher to complete the current uptrend. This would make the volatility that started in June of 2024 a correction within a larger uptrend.We still believe that NVDA\u2019s uptrend is not over. We stand by the two scenarios outlined in the last report; both are still in play.\u201cBlue \u2013 The final 5th wave is playing out as an ending diagonal pattern, which is common for 5th waves. This type of pattern is a 5 wave pattern in itself that is characterized with large swings in both directions. Our target zone for the bottom on this 4th wave is $126 - $116. If Nvidia can push over $140.75, then then odds favor this scenario.Red \u2013 Nvidia is in a much more complex 4th wave. If this is playing out, NVDA would see the $116 level break, which opens the door to a potential low at $101, $90, or $78.\u201dWhile the $116 support level still holds from our last analysis, the resistance worth monitoring is now $132. If Nvidia can breakout over the $132 resistance, it will shift the odds to the more immediately bullish count in blue. This would see a push into the $170 - $190 region over the coming months.On the other hand, if Nvidia breaks below the $116 support level, it will signal that the more immediately bearish count in red is playing out. This would see us make a meaningful low in the $102 - $83 range over the coming months.We began executing on our current buy plan, which is to layer into Nvidia at key levels. The $126 - $116 region was our first target. If the $116 region breaks, we will then target the $102 - $83 region to complete our buying. Considering the blue count is looking for a final 5th wave higher, we will likely not chase a breakout over $132.ConclusionIf DeepSeek\u2019s breakthroughs are truly the key to ushering in a new paradigm of AI training and ultimately AI democratization from cost reductions, it will not be a death sentence for Nvidia; in fact, quite the opposite.This is Jevons paradox -- where the technological advancements of Hopper and Blackwell will translate into significant efficiency gains and cost reductions for AI training, that then will drive near-ubiquity for AI services -- and thus increase demand for GPUs in the data center, on-premise for enterprises and also on edge devices.The market\u2019s readthrough is that Big Tech has now been overspending on AI. However, The I/O Fund believes this readthrough is wrong; it\u2019s not that the United States is overspending, it\u2019s that we will accelerate spending to stay ahead. The I/O Fund recently entered five new small and mid-cap positions that we believe will be beneficiaries of this AI spending war.

These advanced AI agents require a system of multiple generative AI models optimized for agentic AI functions and capabilities. This complexity means that the need for powerful, efficient, enterprise-grade models has never been greater.\nTo provide a foundation for enterprise agentic AI, NVIDIA today announced the Llama Nemotron family of open large language models (LLMs). Built with Llama, the models can help developers create and deploy AI agents across a range of applications \u2014 including customer support, fraud detection, and product supply chain and inventory management optimization.\nTo be effective, many AI agents need both language skills and the ability to perceive the world and respond with the appropriate action.\nWith new NVIDIA Cosmos Nemotron vision language models (VLMs) and NVIDIA NIM microservices for video search and summarization, developers can build agents that analyze and respond to images and video from autonomous machines, hospitals, stores and warehouses, as well as sports events, movies and news. For developers seeking to generate physics-aware videos for robotics and autonomous vehicles, NVIDIA today separately announced NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models.\nOpen Llama Nemotron Models Optimize Compute Efficiency, Accuracy for AI Agents\nBuilt with Llama foundation models \u2014 one of the most popular commercially viable open-source model collections, downloaded over 650 million times \u2014 NVIDIA Llama Nemotron models provide optimized building blocks for AI agent development. This builds on NVIDIA\u2019s commitment to developing state-of-the-art models, such as Llama 3.1 Nemotron 70B, now available through the NVIDIA API catalog.\nLlama Nemotron models are pruned and trained with NVIDIA\u2019s latest techniques and high-quality datasets for enhanced agentic capabilities. They excel at instruction following, chat, function calling, coding and math, while being size-optimized to run on a broad range of NVIDIA accelerated computing resources.\n\u201cAgentic AI is the next frontier of AI development, and delivering on this opportunity requires full-stack optimization across a system of LLMs to deliver efficient, accurate AI agents,\u201d said Ahmad Al-Dahle, vice president and head of GenAI at Meta. \u201cThrough our collaboration with NVIDIA and our shared commitment to open models, the NVIDIA Llama Nemotron family built on Llama can help enterprises quickly create their own custom AI agents.\u201d\nLeading AI agent platform providers including SAP and ServiceNow are expected to be among the first to use the new Llama Nemotron models.\n\u201cAI agents that collaborate to solve complex tasks across multiple lines of the business will unlock a whole new level of enterprise productivity beyond today\u2019s generative AI scenarios,\u201d said Philipp Herzig, chief AI officer at SAP. \u201cThrough SAP\u2019s Joule, hundreds of millions of enterprise users will interact with these agents to accomplish their goals faster than ever before. NVIDIA\u2019s new open Llama Nemotron model family will foster the development of multiple specialized AI agents to transform business processes.\u201d\n\u201cAI agents make it possible for organizations to achieve more with less effort, setting new standards for business transformation,\u201d said Jeremy Barnes, vice president of platform AI at ServiceNow. \u201cThe improved performance and accuracy of NVIDIA\u2019s open Llama Nemotron models can help build advanced AI agent services that solve complex problems across functions, in any industry.\u201d\nThe NVIDIA Llama Nemotron models use NVIDIA NeMo for distilling, pruning and alignment. Using these techniques, the models are small enough to run on a variety of computing platforms while providing high accuracy as well as increased model throughput.\nThe Llama Nemotron model family will be available as downloadable models and as NVIDIA NIM microservices that can be easily deployed on clouds, data centers, PCs and workstations. They offer enterprises industry-leading performance with reliable, secure and seamless integration into their agentic AI application workflows.\nCustomize and Connect to Business Knowledge With NVIDIA NeMo\nThe Llama Nemotron and Cosmos Nemotron model families are coming in Nano, Super and Ultra sizes to provide options for deploying AI agents at every scale.\n\nNano: The most cost-effective model optimized for real-time applications with low latency, ideal for deployment on PCs and edge devices.\nSuper: A high-accuracy model offering exceptional throughput on a single GPU.\nUltra: The highest-accuracy model, designed for data-center-scale applications demanding the highest performance.\n\nEnterprises can also customize the models for their specific use cases and domains with NVIDIA NeMo microservices to simplify data curation, accelerate model customization and evaluation, and apply guardrails to keep responses on track.\nWith NVIDIA NeMo Retriever, developers can also integrate retrieval-augmented generation capabilities to connect models to their enterprise data.\nAnd using NVIDIA Blueprints for agentic AI, enterprises can quickly create their own applications using NVIDIA\u2019s advanced AI tools and end-to-end development expertise. In fact, NVIDIA Cosmos Nemotron, NVIDIA Llama Nemotron and NeMo Retriever supercharge the new NVIDIA Blueprint for video search and summarization, announced separately today.\nNeMo, NeMo Retriever and NVIDIA Blueprints are all available with the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform.\nAvailability\nLlama Nemotron and Cosmos Nemotron models will be available soon as hosted application programming interfaces and for download on build.nvidia.com and Hugging Face. Access for development, testing and research is free for members of the NVIDIA Developer Program.\nEnterprises can run Llama Nemotron and Cosmos Nemotron NIM microservices in production with the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform on accelerated data center and cloud infrastructure.\nSign up to get notified about Llama Nemotron and Cosmos Nemotron models, and join NVIDIA at CES.\nSee notice regarding software product information.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | CES 2025 | Cosmos | NVIDIA Blueprints | NVIDIA NIM \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Honors Americas Partners Advancing Agentic and Physical AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Blackwell Powers Real-Time AI for Entertainment Workflows\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But the Chinese company said it spent just $5.6 million on Nvidia technology to develop its large-language model, and though experts speculate this is a gross underestimate, it still upsets the core thesis behind Nvidia stock\u2019s meteoric rise. Nvidia\u2019s net profits soared from $4.8 billion in 2022 to an estimated $66.7 billion in 2024 thanks in large part to demand for its GPUs, which fetch up to $25,000 apiece, from American tech giants like Facebook parent Meta, Tesla and ChatGPT maker OpenAI. If big U.S. tech companies \u201ccan learn from DeepSeek to design AI systems with cheaper GPUs\u2026it might not be a happy development for Nvidia,\u201d remarked Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research in a note to clients.\nSurprising Fact\nNvidia\u2019s nearly $600 billion market cap loss Monday is larger than the individual market values of all but 13 American companies, more than the market cap of titans like health insurer UnitedHealth, oil giant Exxon Mobil and retailer Costco.\n\nForbes Valuation\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang got $21 billion poorer Monday, as his net worth fell from $124.4 billion to $103.1 billion, according to Forbes estimates. Huang is Nvidia\u2019s largest individual shareholder with a 3% stake in the Silicon Valley firm.\n\nFurther ReadingForbesDeepSeek Panic: Here\u2019s Why Tech Stocks Are Getting Crushed As Nasdaq Paces To Worst Day Of 2025By Derek Saul\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Derek SaulFollowingEditorial StandardsForbes AccoladesJoin The ConversationComments\u00a0One Community.

Morgan Healthcare Conference to discuss how AI is transforming biomedical research, clinical trials and pathology.\t\t\t\n\n\nJanuary 14, 2025 by Isha Salian \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  AI is making inroads across the entire healthcare industry \u2014 from genomic research to drug discovery, clinical trial workflows and patient care.\nIn a fireside chat Monday during the annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang took the stage with industry leaders progressing each of these areas to advance biomedical science and meet the global demand for patient care.\nHealthcare has a more severe labor shortage than any other field \u2014 the industry is expected to be short 10 million workers by the end of the decade, according to the World Health Organization. By deploying foundation models to narrow the field of potential drug molecules and streamlining workflows with agentic AI, these innovators are helping meet the global demand by enabling clinicians and researchers to achieve more with their limited time.\nThey include industry luminaries Patrick Collison, cofounder of Stripe and the Arc Institute nonprofit research organization; Christina Zorn, chief administrative officer at Mayo Clinic; Jacob Thaysen, CEO of DNA sequencing technology leader Illumina; and Ari Bousbib, chairman and CEO of clinical research and commercial services provider IQVIA.\nThe four organizations at J.P. Morgan Healthcare announced partnerships with NVIDIA to advance drug discovery, accelerate pathology, enhance genomic research and augment healthcare with agentic AI, respectively.\nAI\u2019s Evolution, From Predicting to Reasoning\nHuang opened the event by reflecting on the tremendous progress in AI over the past year, spanning large language models, visual generative AI and physical AI for robotics \u2014 and outlining a vision for a future involving agentic AI models that are capable of reasoning and problem-solving.\n\u201cThe future of AI is likely to involve a fair amount of thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ability for AI to now reason, plan and act is foundational to the way we\u2019re going to go forward.\u201d\nTo support the development of these AI models, NVIDIA recently unveiled NVIDIA Cosmos, a physical AI platform that includes state-of-the art generative world foundation models. These models apply the same technique as a language model that predicts the next word in a sentence \u2014 instead predicting the next action a robot should take.\n\u201cThe idea that you can generate the next frame for a video has become common sense,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s the case, is it possible that generating the next articulation could be common sense? And the answer is absolutely.\u201d\nAI for Every Modality\nChanneling a late-night talk show host, Huang called up the guest speakers one by one to discuss their work accelerating biomedical research with AI innovation.\nFirst up was Collison, who shared the Arc Institute\u2019s mission to help researchers tackle long-term scientific challenges by providing multiyear funding that enables them to focus on innovative research instead of grant writing \u2014 which he believes will spur breakthroughs that are unfeasible to pursue under today\u2019s funding models.\n\u201cA lot of the low-hanging fruit, the stuff that is easier to discover, we did,\u201d Collison said, referring to the development of groundbreaking treatments like antibiotics, chemotherapy and more in decades past. \u201cToday, it\u2019s immensely harder.\u201d\nAlready, Arc Institute\u2019s investments have resulted in Evo, a powerful foundation model that understands the languages of DNA, RNA and proteins. The institute is now working with NVIDIA on foundation models for biology that can advance applications for drug discovery, synthetic biology across multiple scales of complexity, disease and evolution research, and more.\nNext, Mayo Clinic\u2019s Zorn shared how the research hospital is applying NVIDIA technology to one of the world\u2019s largest pathology databases to transform cancer care with AI insights.\n\u201cWe saw a paradigm shift in healthcare. You\u2019re either going to disrupt from within or you\u2019re going to be disrupted,\u201d she said. \u201cWe knew we had to embrace tech in a way that was really going to optimize everything we do.\u201d\nZorn also shared how Mayo Clinic is approaching the future healthcare worker shortage by investing in robotics.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to use, essentially, the robots to be a member of the healthcare team in the healthcare spaces,\u201d she said.\nThe evening wrapped with two leaders in healthcare information reflecting on ways multimodal AI models can uncover insights and streamline processes to boost the capabilities of human experts.\n\u201cCombining other information, other modalities, other \u2018omics\u2019\u2026is going to give us much deeper insight into biology. But while DNA was very difficult itself, when you then combine all the omics, it becomes exponentially more challenging,\u201d said Illumina\u2019s Thaysen. \u201cIt\u2019s getting so complicated that we do need huge computing power and AI to really understand and process it.\u201d\nIQVIA is working with NVIDIA to build custom foundation models and agentic AI workflows trained on the organization\u2019s vast healthcare-specific information and deep domain expertise. Use cases include boosting the efficiency of clinical trials and optimizing planning for the launch of therapies and medical devices.\nThe company is committed to using AI responsibly, ensuring that its AI-powered capabilities are grounded in privacy, regulatory compliance and patient safety.\n\u201cThe opportunity here is to try to reduce the dependencies and sequential series of steps that require a lot of interactions, and handle them without human touch,\u201d said Bousbib.\u00a0 \u201cAI agents will be able to eliminate the white space, that is, the time waiting for humans to complete those tasks. There\u2019s a great opportunity to reduce time and costs.\u201d\nNVIDIA at J.P. Morgan Healthcare\nThe fireside chat followed a presentation at the conference by Kimberly Powell, NVIDIA\u2019s vice president of healthcare. In her talk, Powell discussed the industry collaborations and announced new resources for healthcare and life sciences developers.\nThese include an NVIDIA NIM microservice for GenMol, a generative AI model for controlled, high-performance molecular generation \u2014 and an NVIDIA BioNeMo Blueprint for protein binder design, part of the NVIDIA Blueprints collection of enterprise-grade reference workflows for agentic and generative AI use cases.\nFor more from NVIDIA at the J.P.

But it was also faster than the RTX 3080 Ti, 3090, and 3090 Ti. One of the good things about a new graphics card generation is that the new cards bring the last generation's inaccessibly expensive high-end performance down to cards that more people can actually afford.\nThat's not the case with the new $999 RTX 5080, which beats the previous-generation RTX 4080 Super by a little bit and the older RTX 4080 by a slightly larger bit but doesn't come close to beating or even replicating the performance of the outgoing 4090.\nNvidia points to its new DLSS Multi-Frame Generation technology as a mitigating factor here, leaning on its AI-generated frames to close the gap that the 5080's raw rendering performance can't close on its own. And sure, it's nice that this card\u00a0can do that. On paper, the 5080 is also technically a good value compared to the flagship RTX 5090\u2014between 60 and 75 percent of the performance for half the price (though talking about the MSRP of any of these cards at launch is strictly theoretical, given allegedly short supply and the demand from both actual buyers and scalpers looking to make a buck).\nBut the 5080 really feels a lot more like a 4080 Super Super\u2014meaningfully better than the 4080 but still in the same general performance category. It's an upgrade, especially for anyone coming from a 30-series or older GPU, but it's a disappointing break from Nvidia's past precedent.\nWhat you need to know about the RTX 5080\n\n\n\n\nRTX 5090\nRTX 4090\nRTX 5080\nRTX 4080 Super\nRTX 4080\n\n\nCUDA cores\n21,760\n16,384\n10,752\n10,240\n9,728\n\n\nBoost clock\n2,410 MHz\n2,520 MHz\n2,617 MHz\n2,550 MHz\n2,505 MHz\n\n\nMemory bus width\n512-bit\n384-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n\n\nMemory bandwidth\n1,792 GB/s\n1,008 GB/s\n960 GB/s\n736 GB/s\n717 GB/s\n\n\nMemory size\n32GB GDDR7\n24GB GDDR6X\n16GB GDDR7\n16GB GDDR6X\n16GB GDDR6X\n\n\nTGP\n575 W\n450 W\n360 W\n320 W\n320 W\n\n\n\nOf Nvidia's mid-generation Super refresh for the 40-series last year, the 4080 Super was already the mildest improvement over the original card, with just a few hundred extra CUDA cores and very mild clock speed increases. Its biggest and most important improvement was that it brought the old 4080's original $1,299 price tag down to a somewhat less offensive (and, again, strictly theoretical) price of $999.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe strategy with the 5080 looks pretty similar. You get a mild increase in core count (up 10.5 percent over the original 4080 and only 5 percent over the 4080 Super), plus the same 16GB of RAM on the same 256-bit memory interface. Switching from GDDR6X to GDDR7 does get you a decent bump to memory bandwidth, though, on the order of just over 30 percent compared to the 4080 and 4080 Super.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      As with the 5090, the 12-pin power connector is now slightly recessed and angled so it doesn't stick out as far in your case.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Andrew Cunningham\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nBut all of that is incredibly mild and incremental compared to the big across-the-board jumps in core count, memory bus width, memory size, and memory bandwidth that you get when you go from the RTX 4090 to the RTX 5090. The 5080's core counts and memory bandwidth also stay well below the RTX 4090's. This has the benefit of not blowing up the 5080's power requirements\u2014at 360 W, it's only 40 W higher than the 4080, and in our actual testing, the 5080 didn't actually consume that much more power on average\u2014but it also means that the 4090 and 5090 continue to stand apart from the rest of the lineup, inaccessible to anyone with less than a couple thousand dollars to spend on a GPU.\nAs for the physical design of Nvidia's Founders Edition version of the 5080, it's identical to that of the 5090, just as the 4080 looked like the 4090.

Compared to reviews from 2023 and 2024, we're using a faster CPU (the Ryzen 7 9800X3D) and a beefed-up power supply. We've also added some newer games to our test suite and discarded a few that weren't challenging the cards enough.\nAs with the 5090, we focused on 4K tests for this review. The 5080 is half the price of the 5090, but you could still buy a good 1080p gaming PC or a pair of game consoles for the same money\u2014it ought to be capable of playing modern games smoothly at high settings and resolutions. (If you are curious about 1440p performance, look at the benchmarks we've run with DLSS enabled\u2014we run these in \"Quality\" mode, which at 4K means a 1440p internal resolution.)\nPerformance and power\nIn our 5090 review, we observed that its performance improvement over the 4090 generally scaled linearly with its CUDA core count and its power consumption\u2014all three usually increased by between 30 and 35 percent, depending on the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 5080 did a bit better than this, with average frame rates that were generally between 10 and 20 percent faster than the regular 4080 and between 5 and 13 percent faster than the 4080 Super. A combination of cores, marginally higher clock speeds, and memory bandwidth increases help give it a boost.\nBut especially compared to the 4080 Super, these numbers look less like a generational performance increase and more like what you could get out of a 4080 Super with a particularly good overclock. We point this out not because people are upgrading their GPUs every generation but because people with an older 30-series, 20-series, or even 10-series GPU who have been waiting to upgrade won't really be rewarded for waiting for this generation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS Multi-Frame Generation is meant to bolster the card's performance numbers, and as with the 5090, they do look impressive on paper. As we covered in that review, Multi-Frame Generation (MFG) is exclusive to the 50-series, and it's an amped-up version of the Frame Generation technology that was introduced in the 40 series. Both versions take two rendered frames and use AI to interpolate extra frames in between, sort of like a supercharged version of TV motion smoothing. The 40-series cards can generate one frame this way; the 50-series cards can generate up to three.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Multi-frame generation looks great on paper, but it's misleading to compare MFG frame rates to natively rendered frame rates.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Andrew Cunningham\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nHardware Unboxed on YouTube has a good in-depth look at MFG and its trade-offs, which are mostly the same as the trade-offs with regular FG. It's useful when your rendered frame rate is already fairly high, giving the algorithm plenty of data to use when generating frames and making individual errors or artifacts harder for your eyes to spot. But it's not a cure-all for low frame rates. It can also increase latency because user input is only being polled at your actual rendered frame rate, and running the Frame Generation algorithm actually reduces that frame rate by a bit.\nThe RTX 5080 is fast enough that it can hit the frame rates needed to make MFG look good, but it will still be game-dependent and scene-dependent. It's a good way to augment rendering performance, but contrary to Nvidia's messaging, it's still not a substitute for better rendering performance.\nTechnically an upgrade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      The RTX 5080 isn't bad; it just doesn't move things forward a whole lot.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Andrew Cunningham\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nThis is not really the generational leap that GPU buyers were probably hoping for from an RTX 5080. It is the third-fastest GPU on the market, but it's far short of the 4090, and it performs more like a second refresh of 2022's RTX 4080.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe worst thing about the 5080 is that it suggests that every 50-series GPU other than the 5090 will be a very mild upgrade over its 40-series counterpart, with Nvidia leaning heavily on Multi-Frame Generation for the typical generational performance improvements. That will trickle down to cards like the 5070 and 5060 series, the kinds of cards that most people actually buy and use.\nMulti-Frame Generation can put up big frame rate numbers, but as with the old Frame Generation, you want a good base frame rate for the best results; improvements to traditional rendering performance still matter. This is OK for the 5080, which is still fast enough to deliver high base frame rates, especially with an assist from DLSS upscaling. But we'd expect this to be a bigger problem for the RTX 5070, which is the only card announced so far to come with fewer CUDA cores than its Super predecessor.\nThe main takeaway is that the 5080 isn't the kind of generational upgrade that Nvidia has usually delivered up until now, where a new GPU could match or beat the rendering performance of previous-generation cards at higher performance tiers. The days when the GTX 1060 could beat the GTX 980? Long gone. Even in the 40-series, the RTX 4070 could usually match or beat the RTX 3080; that kind of jump looks extremely unlikely this time around.\nThe best argument for grabbing a 5080 right now, if you can find one at $999 in the first place, is that the only cards that come close to its performance are either way more expensive than they're supposed to be (the 4080 Super) or not cheap enough to justify the Nvidia-specific features you give up (AMD's Radeon 7900 XTX).\nThe good\n\nGood frame rates at 4K resolutions\nRedesigned Founders Edition will be an easier fit for many PC cases\nPower consumption only mildly increased over last generation\nStill the third-fastest GPU you can buy\nA relatively decent value at $999\u2014if you can find it for $999\n\nThe bad\n\nTrying to find one at $999\nBarely an upgrade over the RTX 4080 Super\nMulti-frame generation is interesting but not a cure-all for low frame rates\n\nThe ugly\n\nThe rest of the 50-series GPUs don't look like very promising upgrades, especially the RTX 5070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Cunningham\nSenior Technology Reporter\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Cunningham\nSenior Technology Reporter\n\n\n      Andrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with a focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of operating systems like Windows and macOS.

Developed by chip manufacturer Nvidia, Cosmos includes a video data curation pipeline, various tools for customizing data to specific use cases and \u2014 perhaps most importantly \u2014 a family of specialized AI models called \u201cworld foundation models.\u201d\nTraining physical AI systems is incredibly labor-intensive, often requiring the collection, labeling and categorization of millions of hours of real-world footage. Cosmos\u2019 world foundation models (WFMs) aim to tackle this issue by generating three-dimensional simulations of the physical world to train robots \u2014 whether it\u2019s a factory robot assembling a product, a humanoid robot interacting with humans or an autonomous vehicle navigating the road. In other words: WFMs make synthetic training data so developers don\u2019t have to rely entirely on costly real-world data collection and processing.\nWhat Is Nvidia Cosmos?Nvidia Cosmos is a cloud-based platform that helps developers build and deploy AI for robots and autonomous vehicles, using \u201cworld foundation models\u201d to generate synthetic training data.\n\n\nNvidia unveiled Cosmos at the 2025 CES conference in Las Vegas, alongside several other product launches and upgrades. Among them is a new feature on its Isaac simulation platform, enabling robot builders to generate large volumes of synthetic training data from just a few examples. The company also upgraded its Omniverse platform with a \u201cMega\u201d operating system that lets developers create, test and optimize their robot fleets in a digital twin environment before deploying them in the real-world.\u00a0\nTogether, Nvidia hopes these products will expand what is possible in physical AI \u2014 an industry projected to be worth $45 billion by 2029.\n\u201cEverything that moves \u2014 from cars and trucks to factories and warehouses \u2014 will be robotic and embodied by AI,\u201d Jensen Huang, Nvidia\u2019s founder and CEO, said in a statement. \u201cNvidia\u2019s Omniverse digital twin operating system and Cosmos physical AI serve as the foundational libraries for digitalizing the world\u2019s physical industries.\u201d\n\n\nA demonstration of what Nvidia Cosmos can do, and its potential impact on physical AI development. Video: Nvidia\n\u00a0\nWhat Is Nvidia Cosmos?\nNvidia Cosmos offers a suite of foundation models that can generate \u201ccontrollable, high-quality\u201d synthetic data to train robots, driverless cars and more, according to Nvidia. The models are divided into three categories:\n\nNano, for real-time, low-latency inference and edge deployment.\nSuper, a \u201chighly performant baseline\u201d model for \u201cout-of-the box\u201d fine-tuning and deployment.\nUltra, for maximum accuracy and quality outputs; provides best fidelity knowledge transfer for distilling custom models.\n\nThe size of the models range from 4 billion to 14 billion parameters, with Nano being the smallest and Ultra being the largest. Essentially, parameters correspond to an AI model\u2019s problem-solving skills, so models with more parameters generally perform better than those with fewer parameters.\nIn addition to the WFMs, Cosmos includes a 12-billion-parameter \u201cunsampling\u201d model for refining text prompts, a 7-billion-parameter video decoder optimized for augmented reality and a guardrail model to ensure \u201cresponsible\u201d use. It also includes fine-tuned models for applications like generating multisensor views for autonomous vehicles.\u00a0\nNvidia says all of its Cosmos models were trained on 9,000 trillion tokens (bits of raw data \u2014 in this case, video footage) from 20 million hours of real-world environmental, industrial, robotics, and driving data, as well as human activities like walking and manipulating objects. Users can also fine-tune the models with their own data.\nNvidia is joining a growing roster of companies building tools to simplify the integration of artificial intelligence into robots. Other top players include cloud provider AWS, game development company Unity and Genesis, an open source computer simulation system created by a group of university and private industry researchers (including from Nvidia) that can reportedly train robots 430,000 times faster than reality.\u00a0\nNvidia Cosmos is now available for free on both Hugging Face and Nvidia\u2019s own NGC catalog under an open model license, meaning developers can freely access and use all of the models, so long as they have Nvidia hardware. Several companies have begun using the platform, according to Nvidia, including humanoid robot makers Galbot, Agility Robotics and Figure AI, as well as self-driving car companies Uber, Wayve and Waabi.\nMore on NvidiaWhat Is Nvidia\u2019s Chat with RTX?\n\u00a0\nWhat Can Nvidia Cosmos Do?\nHere are some of the key features and capabilities of Nvidia Cosmos.\nVideo Search\nNvidia says Cosmos can simplify the video tagging and search process, helping to make robots that are ready for the real world. So, whether it\u2019s footage of a snowy road in front of a self-driving car or a busy warehouse, the platform is able to understand spatial and temporal patterns, saving developers time and costs associated with training data preparation.\n\u20183D-to-Real\u2019 Synthetic Data Creation\nWith Cosmos, developers can transform their 3D simulation data into \u201cphotoreal\u201d synthetic video, according to Nvidia. By pairing the platform with Omniverse, users can create 3D environments that represent their training needs. Then, they can generate photorealistic videos that are \u201cprecisely controlled\u201d by the 3D scenes, creating \u201chighly tailored\u201d synthetic datasets.\nPolicy Model Training and Evaluation\nCosmos\u2019 world foundation models \u2014 when fine-tuned for \u201caction conditioned video prediction\u201d \u2014 enable scalable and repeatable training and evaluation of policy models, according to Nvidia, which define strategies for physical AI systems by mapping states to actions. The company says developers can use these models instead of relying on \u201crisky real-world tests\u201d or complex simulations of tasks like obstacle navigation and object manipulation, which can help optimize machines\u2019 performance and improve their reliability.\u00a0\nPredictive Intelligence\nCosmos is designed to bring advanced predictive intelligence \u2014 or \u201cforesight,\u201d as Nvidia puts it \u2014 to physical AI, enabling systems to anticipate future scenarios and make decisions based on those predictions. The platform can do this by generating predictive videos based on past data and text prompts, enabling robots and other automated machines to navigate and adapt to dynamic physical environments safely and efficiently.\n\u2018Multiverse\u2019 Simulation\nWhen paired with Omniverse, Cosmos can help developers simulate multiple outcomes of real-time scenarios, accelerating the decision making process for robots, autonomous vehicles and other artificially intelligent machines. Creating a sort of \u201cmultiverse,\u201d Nvidia says Cosmos and Omniverse can work together to explore \u201call possible future outcomes,\u201d ultimately selecting the best path for \u201cenhanced precision and reliability in complex environments.\u201d\nRelated ReadingThe Future of Robots and Robotics\n\u00a0\nHow Does Nvidia Cosmos Work?\nNvidia Cosmos\u2019 world foundation models work similarly to large language models (LLMs), insofar as both process vast amounts of data and produce complex outputs based on the patterns they learned from that data.\u00a0\nHowever, while LLMs are trained on text data (books, articles, social media posts, etc.) to perform tasks related to natural language processing and generation, WFMs are designed to make photorealistic, \u201cphysics-aware\u201d simulations for training robots in real-world applications. Using data from text, images, video and motion sensors, these models render detailed worlds, and then identify and label the physical attributes within those worlds \u2014 maintaining accurate spatial awareness, physics and object permanence throughout.\nThe focus isn\u2019t just on generating AI content, but on teaching AI to understand the physical world well enough to operate in it effectively. Cosmos can, for example, make video footage of boxes falling from shelves, which can be used to train a robot to recognize accidents. Or it can simulate a self-diving car encountering an animal on the side of the road, teaching the vehicle to anticipate the animal\u2019s movements and slow down if necessary. Meanwhile, all of this training data is synthetic, making it more accessible to a broader range of developers.\n\u201cThe ChatGPT moment for robotics is coming. Like large language models, world foundation models are fundamental to advancing robot and [autonomous vehicle] development, yet not all developers have the expertise and resources to train their own,\u201d Huang said in a statement. \u201cWe created Cosmos to democratize physical AI and put general robotics in reach of every developer.\u201d\nFrequently Asked QuestionsWhat is Nvidia Cosmos?Nvidia Cosmos is a cloud-based platform designed to help developers build and deploy AI models for physical AI systems, such as robots and automated vehicles.\n\n\nNvidia Omniverse vs. Nvidia CosmosNvidia Omniverse functions as a digital twin operating system, enabling developers to create, test and optimize their robot fleets in a simulated environment before deploying them in the real world. The Nvidia Cosmos platform, on the other hand, has a family of specialized AI models that can generate realistic, three-dimensional videos, maintaining accurate spatial awareness, physics and object permanence throughout. So, while Omniverse provides a space to create and simulate virtual environments, Cosmos has the tools necessary to produce the synthetic data required for training robots within those environments.\n\n\nIs Nvidia Cosmos available?Yes, Nvidia Cosmos is now available for free on both Hugging Face and Nvidia\u2019s own NGC catalog under an open model license. Cosmos also provides an end-to-end pipeline to fine-tune Cosmos\u2019 world foundation models with Nvidia NeMo. Developers can use the Cosmos tokenizer from /NVIDIA/cosmos-tokenizer on GitHub and Hugging Face.\n\n\nIs Nvidia Cosmos free?Yes, Nvidia Cosmos is available for free on both Hugging Face and Nvidia\u2019s own NGC catalog under an open model license.\n\n\nIs Nvidia Cosmos open source?No, the world foundation models on Nvidia Cosmos are not technically open source. Nvidia has not disclosed what specific data was used to train these models, nor has it made available all the tools needed to recreate the models from scratch. Hence, the company calls these models \u201copen\u201d \u2014 not \u201copen source.\u201d\n\n\nIs Nvidia Cosmos compatible with non-Nvidia hardware?No, Nvidia Cosmos appears to only be compatible with Nvidia\u2019s hardware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent Artificial Intelligence Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n                            An Introduction to Support Vector Machine (SVM) in Python\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            How to Supercharge Application Modernization With AI\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            What Is AI Literacy?\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Explore Job Matches.\n\n\n\n\n\nJob Title or Keyword\n\nClear search\n\n\n\n\nLocation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJob Type\n\nClear\nApply\n\n\n\nSee Jobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJobs\n\nCompanies\n\nArticles\nMy Items\nMore\n\n\n                                    Join\n                                \n\n                                    Log In\n                                \nTech Jobs\n\nCompanies\n\nArticles\n\nRemote\nBest Places To Work\nTech Hubs\n\n                        Post Job\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n            Built In is the online community for startups and tech companies.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia stock begins recovery after DeepSeek AI frenzy prompted near $600 billion loss      Laura Bratton    Updated January 29, 2025 2 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.79%    AVGO   +2.48%     ^IXIC   +1.08%      Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose nearly 9% Tuesday as the AI chipmaker began to recover from a massive decline the prior day that shaved nearly $600 billion off its market cap. Nvidia\u2019s 17% freefall Monday was prompted by investor anxieties related to a new, cost-effective artificial intelligence model from the Chinese startup DeepSeek. Some Wall Street analysts worried that the cheaper costs DeepSeek claimed to have spent training its latest AI models, due in part to using fewer AI chips, meant US firms were overspending on artificial intelligence infrastructure. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    118.65 +3.22 (+2.79%)  As of 2:01:03 PM EDT. Market Open.     Advanced Chart    That created a concern among the investment community that Nvidia\u2019s high GPU (graphics processing unit, or AI chip) prices could come under pressure and that demand for semiconductors could wane. Nvidia\u2019s $589 billion market cap decline was the largest single-day loss in stock market history. The DeepSeek announcements drove down not only Nvidia but the market at large, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) dropping 3%. Chip stocks dropped across the board Monday, but some names began to recover. After dropping more than 17% to start the week, Broadcom (AVGO) rose 2.6% Tuesday. Nvidia itself didn\u2019t express much anxiety over the DeepSeek buzz, calling R1 \"an excellent AI advancement\" in a statement Monday.

Credit: DeeCee Carter/MediaPunch /IPX  \u00b7 DeeCee Carter/MediaPunch/MediaPunch/IPx Wall Street analysts continued to reflect on the DeepSeek-fueled market rout Tuesday, expressing skepticism over DeepSeek\u2019s reportedly low costs to train its AI models and the implications for AI stocks. JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur and Citi analyst Christopher Danley said in separate notes to investors that because DeepSeek used a process called \u201cdistillation\u201d \u2014 in other words, it relied on Meta\u2019s (META) open-source Llama AI model to develop its model \u2014 the low spending cited by the Chinese startup (under $6 billion to train its recent V3 model) did not fully encompass its costs.  \u201cWe believe it is crucial to validate these costs before drawing conclusions,\u201d Sur wrote. Danley added: \u201cGiven Deepseek is based on leveraging cloud service providers [Meta] and AI is still in its infancy, we lean towards the argument of continued strong growth in AI spending.\u201d Even so, DeepSeek \u201cclearly doesn\u2019t have access to as much compute as US hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,\u201d Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri wrote in a note to investors Monday.

NVIDIA is working to bring cloud gaming to the popular PC gaming handheld device later this year.\nIn collaboration with Apple, Meta and ByteDance, NVIDIA is expanding GeForce NOW cloud gaming to Apple Vision Pro spatial computers, Meta Quest 3 and 3S and Pico virtual- and mixed-reality devices \u2014 with all the bells and whistles of NVIDIA technologies, including ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS.\nIn addition, NVIDIA is launching the first GeForce RTX-powered data center in India, making gaming more accessible around the world.\nPlus, GeForce NOW\u2019s extensive library of over 2,100 supported titles is expanding with highly anticipated AAA titles. DOOM: The Dark Ages and Avowed will join the cloud when they launch on PC this year.\nRTX on Deck\nThe Steam Deck\u2019s portability paired with GeForce NOW opens up new possibilities for high-fidelity gaming everywhere. The native GeForce NOW app will offer up to 4K resolution and 60 frames per second with high dynamic range on Valve\u2019s innovative Steam Deck handheld when connected to a TV, streaming from GeForce RTX-powered gaming rigs in the cloud.\n\nLast year, GeForce NOW rolled out a beta installation method that was eagerly welcomed by the gaming community. Later this year, members will be able to download the native GeForce NOW app and install it on Steam Deck.\nSteam Deck gamers can gain access to all the same benefits as GeForce RTX 4080 GPU owners with a GeForce NOW Ultimate membership, including NVIDIA DLSS 3 technology for the highest frame rates and NVIDIA Reflex for ultra-low latency. Because GeForce NOW streams from an RTX gaming rig in the cloud, the Steam Deck uses less processing power, which extends battery life compared with playing locally.\n\nThe streaming experience with GeForce NOW looks stunning, whichever way Steam Deck users want to play \u2014 whether that\u2019s in handheld mode for HDR-quality graphics, connected to a monitor for up to 1440p 120 fps HDR or hooked up to a TV for big-screen streaming at up to 4K 60 HDR. GeForce NOW members can take advantage of RTX ON with the Steam Deck for photorealistic gameplay on supported titles, as well as HDR10 and SDR10 when connected to a compatible display for richer, more accurate color gradients.\nGet ready for major upgrades to streaming on the go when the GeForce NOW app launches on the Steam Deck later this year.\nStream Beyond Reality\nGet immersed in a new dimension of big-screen gaming as GeForce NOW brings AAA titles to life on Apple Vision Pro spatial computers, Meta Quest 3 and 3S and Pico virtual- and mixed-reality headsets. Later this month, these supported devices will give members access to an extensive library of games to stream through GeForce NOW by opening the browser to play.geforcenow.com when the newest app update, version 2.0.70, starts rolling out later this month.\nJump into a whole new gaming dimension with GeForce NOW.\nMembers can transform the space around them into a personal gaming theater with GeForce NOW. The streaming experience on these devices will support gamepad-compatible titles for members to play their favorite PC games on a massive virtual screen.\nFor an even more enhanced visual experience, GeForce NOW Ultimate and Performance members using these devices can tap into RTX and DLSS technologies in supported games. Members will be able to step into a world where games come to life on a grand scale, powered by GeForce NOW technologies.\nLand of a Thousand Lights \u2026 and Games\nNew year, new data center.\nNVIDIA is broadening cloud gaming in India and Latin America. The first GeForce RTX 4080-powered data center will launch in India in the first half of this year. This follows the launch of GeForce NOW in Japan last year, as well as in Colombia and Chile, to be operated by GeForce NOW Alliance partner Digevo.\nGeForce RTX-powered gaming in the rapidly growing Indian gaming market will provide the ability to stream AAA games without the latest hardware. Gamers in the region can look forward to the launch of Ultimate memberships, along with all the new games and technological advancements announced at CES.\nSend in the Games\nAAA content from celebrated publishers is coming to the cloud. Avowed from Obsidian Entertainment, known for iconic titles such as Fallout: New Vegas, will join GeForce NOW. The cloud gaming platform will also bring DOOM: The Dark Ages from id Software, the legendary studio behind the DOOM franchise. All will be available at launch on PC this year.\nGet ready to jump into the Living Lands.\nAvowed, a first-person fantasy role-playing game, will join the cloud when it launches on PC on Tuesday, Feb. 18. Welcome to the Living Lands, an island full of mysteries and secrets, danger and adventure, choices and consequences and untamed wilderness. Take on the role of an Aedyr Empire envoy tasked with investigating a mysterious plague. Freely combine weapons and magic \u2014 harness dual-wield wands, pair a sword with a pistol or opt for a more traditional sword-and-shield approach. In-game companions \u2014 which join the players\u2019 parties \u2014 have unique abilities and storylines that can be influenced by gamers\u2019 choices.\nHave a hell of a time in the cloud.\nDOOM: The Dark Ages is the single-player, action first-person shooter prequel to the critically acclaimed DOOM (2016) and DOOM Eternal. Play as the DOOM Slayer, the legendary demon-killing warrior fighting endlessly against Hell. Experience the epic cinematic origin story of the DOOM Slayer\u2019s rage this year.\nGet ready to play these titles and more at high performance when they join GeForce NOW at launch. Ultimate members will be able to stream at up to 4K resolution and 120 fps with support for NVIDIA DLSS and Reflex technology, and experience the action even on low-powered devices. Keep an eye out on GFN Thursdays for the latest on their release dates in the cloud.\nGeForce NOW is making popular devices cloud-gaming-ready while consistently delivering quality titles from top publishers to bring another ultimate year of gaming to members across the globe.\nSee notice regarding software product information.\n\n\nCategories: GamingTags: Cloud Gaming | GeForce NOW \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Honors Americas Partners Advancing Agentic and Physical AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Blackwell Powers Real-Time AI for Entertainment Workflows\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

For instance, the GPU family\u2019s new fifth-generation Tensor Cores pack a \u201cmassive amount of AI processing horsepower\u201d to run AI models two times faster using less graphics memory when taking advantage of the newly supported 4-bit floating point (FP4) format, according to Nvidia.\nOn the desktop side, the flagship GPU, the 32-GB GeForce RTX 5090, will cost $1,999 when it becomes available along with the $999, 16-GB GeForce RTX 5080 on Jan. 30. The $749, 16-GB GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and $549, 12-GB GeForce RTX 5070 will become available in February. The GPUs will be available from Nvidia and add-in board partners as well as in desktops from system builders such as Falcon Northwest and Maingear.\nLaptops equipped with RTX 5090, RTX 5080 and RTX 5070 Ti GPUs will debut in March while laptops with the RTX 5070 will launch in the following month from several OEMs, including Acer, Asus, Dell Technologies, HP Inc., Lenovo and MSI.\nNvidia Vows \u2018Pipeline\u2019 Of Microservices For AI PC Development\nTo foster development of AI PC applications on the new RTX 50 series and other recent generations of GeForce GPUs, Nvidia said it plans to release a \u201cpipeline\u201d of Nvidia NIM microservices and Nvidia AI Blueprints that use first- and third-party models to enable use cases ranging from PDF extraction, computer vision and speech to image generation, large language models and embedded models for retrieval-augmented generation.\nThese models include Nvidia\u2019s newly released Llama Nemotron family of models, which are versions of Meta\u2019s Llama models that have been optimized to aid with the development of agentic AI use cases ranging from instruction following and chat to coding and math.\nTo demonstrate how NIMs can be used to build AI agents and assistants, Nvidia plans to release a vison-enabled PC avatar called Project R2X that can read and summarize documents, fetch information and \u201cassist with desktop apps and video conference calls.\u201d It will also be able to connect with cloud AI services such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT4o.\nNvidia Highlights Content Creation Enhancements\nWhen it comes to content creation, Nvidia said the new RTX 50 GPUs come with new hardware features to boost video editing and 3-D rendering workloads on top of new software capabilities for image generation as well as voice and video communication.\nFor video editing, Nvidia said the RTX 50 series comes with new video encoders and decoders that provide a \u201cgenerational leap\u201d in capabilities with support for the 4:2:2 pro-grade color format, the multi-view extension of HEVC (high-efficiency video coding) for 3-D and virtual reality video as well as the new AV1 Ultra High Quality mode.\nFor 3-D rendering, Nvidia said the GPUs come with fourth-generation RT Cores, which enable applications to run 40 percent faster. One way the chips speed up 3-D rendering is through its fourth-generation AI-based image upscaling technology, DLSS 4, which introduces Multi Frame Generation to increase frame rates.\nFor image generation, Nvidia highlighted how the new FP4 support in RTX 50 GPUs will enable models used for such purposes to take up significantly less VRAM compared to the default 16-bit floating point (FP16) format.\nAs an example, the company said the FLUX.1 [dev] model from Black Forest Labs will only need less than 10 GB of memory with FP4, which means it can run on each of the four new RTX 50 GPUs since they range from 32-12 GB in VRAM. By contrast, the FLUX.1 [dev] model running with FP16 would require more than 23 GB of memory, which restricts it to the RTX 4090 and professional GPUs from the last generation.\nNvidia said it plans to offer a NIM microservice based on FLUX.1 [dev], which will be made available in an Nvidia AI Blueprint for 3-D guided image generation next month.\nFor voice and video communication, Nvidia said it plans to add two new features to the Nvidia Broadcast app for AI-enhanced video and voice effects. The first feature, Studio Voice, will make a user\u2019s microphone sound like a high-quality microphone while the second, Virtual Key Light, can relight a \u201csubject\u2019s face to deliver even coverage.\u201d These will initially require an RTX 4080 or higher when they become available in February.\nHow The RTX 50 Series Compares To The 40 Series\nThe flagship GPU in the RTX 50 series, the RTX 5090, is made up of 92 billion transistors, up 21 percent from the 76 billion transistors of its predecessor, the RTX 4090, which debuted in 2022 using Nvidia\u2019s previous-generation Ada Lovelace architecture.\nAcross the RTX 50 series, the GPUs come with new fourth-gen RT Cores and fifth-gen Tensor Cores as well as a streaming multiprocessor that \u201chas been updated with more processing throughput and a tighter integration with the Tensor Cores in order to optimize the performance of neural shaders,\u201d according to Nvidia.\nThe RTX 5090 comes with 32 GB of GDDR7 memory and 21,760 CUDA cores, up from the 24 GB of GDDR6X memory and 16,385 CUDA cores of the RTX 4090. The GPU\u2019s boost and base clock frequencies are 2.41GHz and 2.01GHz, respectively, which are lower than the 2.52GHz and 2.23GHz clock speeds of the RTX 4090.\nAs for performance, the RTX 5090\u2019s Tensor Cores are capable of hitting 3,352 trillion operations per second (TOPS) in AI computing performance while the RT Cores can achieve 318 trillion floating-point operations per second (TFLOPS). These figures are 2.5 times and 60 percent faster, respectively, than the 1,321 AI TOPs achieved by the RTX 4090\u2019s Tensor Cores and the 191 TFLOPS of the GPU\u2019s RT Cores.\nNvidia did not disclose Shader Core performance numbers for the RTX 50 series after providing such information for the previous generation.\nThe total graphics power required by the RTX 5090 is 575 watts, up 27 percent from the 450 watts needed for the RTX 4090. The lowest-end GPU, the RTX 5070, requires 250 watts, which is 25 percent higher than the 200 watts needed for the RTX 4070.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA stock gains after-hours as tech giants continue to pour money into AI    Investing.com   January 30, 2025 1 min read        4   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.83%    MSFT   +0.87%       NVIDIA (NVDA) (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock gained 2% after-hours Wednesday after large clients Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) pointed to continued investment in AI infrastructure with their quarterly results. \"We remain committed to balancing operational discipline with continued investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure,\" Microsoft's CFO Amy Hood said. The tech giant reported that their AI business has surpassed an annual revenue run rate of $13 billion, up 175% year-over-year.  Meanwhile, Meta recently raised its 2025 capital expenditures to $60-65 billion, driven by increased investment to support both their generative AI efforts and core business. Shares of NVIDIA have been under heavy pressure this week after China AI upstart DeepSeek released their AI model, built for a tiny fraction of the billions spent by others and using old NVIDIA servers. The release has created worries that others will look to the DeekSeek model of being more efficient with AI, thereby spending less on more sophisticated NVIDIA GPUs and servers. NVIDIA stock has seen a wild ride this week - falling 17% on Monday, bouncing 9% on Tuesday, and then giving back 4% during the regular trading session on Wednesday.

In a packed Las Vegas arena, Huang kicked off the CES this week with his vision for how his companies\u2019 products will drive gaming, robotics, personal computing and even self-driving vehicles forward.Here\u2019s a look at the biggest announcements to come out of his appearance. New graphics cards and AI chipsGoing back to its roots in gaming, the chipmaker and AI darling unveiled its GeForce RTX 50 Series desktop and laptop GPUs \u2014 its consumer graphics processor units for gamers, creators and developers. Huang said the GPUs, which use the company\u2019s next-generation artificial intelligence chip Blackwell, can deliver breakthroughs in AI-driven rendering.\u201cBlackwell, the engine of AI, has arrived for PC gamers, developers and creatives,\u201d Huang said, adding that Blackwell \u201cis the most significant computer graphics innovation since we introduced programmable shading 25 years ago.\u201d Blackwell technology is now in full production, he said.The flagship RTX 5090 model will be available in January for $1,999. The RTX 5070 will launch later in February for $549\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI models to help with robotics and vehiclesHuang also introduced a series of new AI models \u2014 dubbed Cosmos \u2014 that can generate cost-efficient photo-realistic video that can then be used to train robots and other automated services.The open-source model, which works with the Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse \u2014 a physics simulation tool \u2014 to create more realistic video, promises to be much cheaper than traditional forms of gathering training, such as having cars record road experiences or having people teach robots repetitive tasks.Central to this is Nvidia\u2019s new partnership with Japanese automaker Toyota to build its next-generation autonomous vehicles, and its announced partnership with Aurora to power its autonomous shipping trucks.Nvidia\u2019s DriveOS operating system would power the new cars, which Huang said has the highest standard of safety. \u201cI predict that this will likely be the first multi-trillion dollar robotics industry.\u201dAurora, based in Pittsburgh, plans to launch its driverless trucks \u2014 with Nvidia\u2019s hardware \u2014 commercially in April 2025.\n\nAnd a supercomputer on your deskAnd finally, Huang announced Project DIGITS, a $3,000 desktop computer targeted at developers or gen AI enthusiasts who want to experiment with AI models at home. The machine will launch in May and is powered by the new Blackwell chip. In all, Project DIGITS will allow users to run AI models with up to 200 billion parameters. This means models previously requiring expensive cloud infrastructure to operate can run on your desktop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                            Most read\n                        \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJFK assassination files released, sending history buffs hunting for new clues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump administration makes public thousands of files related to JFK assassination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFDA staff return to crowded offices, broken equipment and missing chairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Security will soon require in-person identity checks for new and existing recipients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoberts rejects Trump\u2019s call for impeaching judge who ruled against his deportation plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

Whether you're a gaming enthusiast or a content creator, NVIDIA app simplifies the process of keeping your PC updated with the latest GeForce Game Ready and NVIDIA Studio Drivers, and enables quick discovery and installation of NVIDIA applications like GeForce NOW and NVIDIA Broadcast.\u00a0\nToday, we\u2019re releasing a major NVIDIA app update, coinciding with the release of our new GeForce RTX 5090 and GeForce 5080 graphics cards, and the new GeForce Game Ready Driver and NVIDIA Studio driver.\nBy installing the update and our new driver, launching at 6am PT, you can employ NVIDIA DLSS 4 to enhance over 75 games and apps with DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, and new, even better AI models for DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Ray Reconstruction.\nGeForce RTX 50 Series gamers can now also enable NVIDIA Smooth Motion, a new driver-based AI model that delivers smoother gameplay by inferring an additional frame between two rendered frames. For games without DLSS Frame Generation, NVIDIA Smooth Motion is a new option for enhancing your experience on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs.\nA new NVIDIA Broadcast update is now also available for download, introducing new AI-powered Studio Voice and Virtual Key Light effects to enhance your streams, and a new user interface that enables users to combine even more effects.\nRTX Video Super Resolution enhances the quality of video using AI. Our new NVIDIA app update reduces the GPU usage of this popular feature by 30%, adds an on-screen status indicator, and enables users to automatically adapt quality and GPU utilization when using other GPU-intensive programs.\nRounding out our new release is the addition of more NVIDIA Control Panel options, namely Advanced Optimus and Multiple Display management.\nFor further details about each of the new additions, read on; for a tour of previously released features, head here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Overrides Upgrade Your Games & Apps\nNVIDIA DLSS has revolutionized graphics by using AI and GeForce RTX Tensor Cores to accelerate frame rates while delivering crisp, high-quality images, as part of over 700 RTX games and apps. Since release, upgrades have continually improved DLSS Super Resolution\u2019s image quality, multiplied frame rates with the introduction of DLSS Frame Generation, and greatly enhanced fully ray-traced games and apps through the addition of DLSS Ray Reconstruction.\nNow, alongside the launch of GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, we\u2019re releasing NVIDIA DLSS 4, which introduces DLSS Multi Frame Generation and includes enhancements for all existing DLSS features.\nDLSS Multi Frame Generation generates up to three additional frames per traditionally rendered frame, working in unison with the complete suite of DLSS technologies to multiply frame rates by up to 8X over traditional brute-force rendering. This massive performance improvement unlocks stunning 4K 240 FPS fully ray-traced gaming on GeForce RTX 5090 graphics cards:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the GeForce RTX 5090, DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation multiplies performance by over 8X versus traditional brute force rendering in this Cyberpunk 2077 scene, PC latency is halved for more responsive gameplay, and image quality is further enhanced\nDLSS 4 also introduces the biggest upgrade to its AI models since the release of DLSS 2.0 in 2020.\nDLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Ray Reconstruction, and DLAA are now powered by the graphics industry\u2019s first real-time application of \u2018transformers\u2019, the same advanced architecture powering frontier AI models like ChatGPT, Flux, and Gemini. DLSS transformer models improve image quality with improved temporal stability, less ghosting, and higher detail in motion.\nSimilarly, the DLSS Frame Generation AI model is upgraded, boosting performance and reducing VRAM use on GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs and GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077, and Hogwarts Legacy have added native support for DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation today.\nIn games and apps that have yet to update to DLSS 4 or add native support for DLSS Multi Frame Generation, NVIDIA app users can activate DLSS 4 overrides to enhance image quality on all GeForce RTX GPUs, unlock DLSS Multi Frame Generation for GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, and more:\n\nDLSS Multi Frame Generation Override - Enables DLSS Multi Frame Generation for GeForce RTX 50 Series users when Frame Generation is ON in-game\nDLSS Frame Generation Model Upgrade - Enables the latest DLSS Frame Generation model for GeForce RTX 50 Series and GeForce RTX 40 Series users, when Frame Generation is ON in-game, which uses less video memory and can increase frame rates\nDLSS Transformer Model Upgrade - Enables the latest transformer AI model for DLSS Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, and DLAA for all GeForce RTX users, when the aforementioned features are ON in-game\nDLAA & Ultra Performance Modes - Sets the internal rendering resolution for DLSS Super Resolution, enabling DLAA or Ultra Performance mode in games lacking native support, when Super Resolution is ON in-game\n\nDLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation is available now in over 75 games, and many more games and apps support other DLSS enhancements, such as updated Frame Generation, or the new transformer AI model for Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, and DLAA.

The other, Virtual Key Light, relights the subject to deliver even lighting, as if a physical key light was defining the form and dimension of the individual.\nBecause they harness demanding AI models, these new beta features are recommended for video conferencing or non-gaming livestreams using a GeForce RTX 5080 or 4080 GPU, or higher. NVIDIA is working to expand these features to more GeForce RTX GPUs in future updates.\nThe NVIDIA Broadcast upgrade also includes an updated user interface that allows users to apply more effects simultaneously, as well as improvements to the background noise removal, virtual background and eye contact effects. For further details, head over to the NVIDIA Studio blog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Video Super Resolution Now Supports HDR & Is More Efficient\nAccessed via System > Video in NVIDIA app, RTX Video uses AI to enhance streaming video on all GeForce RTX GPUs. It has 2 features: Video Super Resolution (VSR), which removes compression artifacts, and sharpens edges when upscaling. And Video HDR, which tone maps SDR videos to HDR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the new NVIDIA app update, VSR has been updated to a more efficient AI model, using up to 30% fewer GPU resources at its highest quality setting, allowing more GeForce RTX GPUs to enable it.\nVSR now also upscales HDR video, so if you are watching any HDR video below your monitor\u2019s resolution in your browser, it will automatically get upscaled to your native panel resolution.\nWe\u2019ve also added a GPU Utilization feature for RTX Video when Quality is set to \u201cAuto\u201d. Setting your GPU Utilization to \u201cHigh\u201d will use as much GPU as needed to provide the best quality Super Resolution available on your GPU.\nSetting the GPU Utilization to lower levels will reserve more GPU for games or creative apps by applying lower quality settings. Or alternatively, switch to Manual mode and set a fixed quality level to use at all times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we\u2019ve added optional on-screen indicators to show when Video Super Resolution and Video HDR are active.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Optimus & Multiple Display Options\nThe NVIDIA app development team has converted, accelerated, and modernized two additional features from the NVIDIA Control Panel in this new release, with more on the way in the future.\nAdvanced Optimus enables a laptop to dynamically switch between using the GeForce GPU and integrated graphics. When performing basic tasks like word processing, the integrated processor is used. When GPU-accelerated apps or games are launched, Advanced Optimus switches to the GeForce GPU to maximize performance, to take advantage of high refresh rate displays, and to enable G-SYNC.\nNow, you can control Advanced Optimus in NVIDIA app from System > Displays. Open \u201cDisplay Mode\u201d, adjust as needed, then press Apply. With \u201cNVIDIA GPU\u201d selected, G-SYNC options and additional Display Settings appear, ready to be configured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can determine if your laptop supports Advanced Optimus by going to System > My Rig, clicking \u201cView Rig Details\u201d, and scrolling down the list of items until you reach \u201cAdvanced Optimus\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Control Panel\u2019s \u201cSet up multiple displays\u201d enables you to move the virtual position of connected monitors and TVs, select the primary display, and clone displays across multiple devices.\u00a0\nThese features can now be accessed from System > Displays in NVIDIA app:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the icon on the top right to enable or disable displays, and highlight a display with your mouse to access the three dot configuration menu, which allows for cloning, setting the primary display, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Smooth Motion Now Available\nNVIDIA Smooth Motion is a new driver-based AI model that delivers smoother gameplay by inferring an additional frame between two rendered frames. For games without DLSS Frame Generation, NVIDIA Smooth Motion will debut first on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, with support added for GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs in a future update.\nTo enable NVIDIA Smooth Motion, select a compatible DirectX 11 or DirectX 12 game in Graphics > Program settings. Scroll down the list of options on the right to reach \u201cDriver Settings\u201d, and switch Smooth Motion on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Smooth Motion can be applied to games running at native resolution, with super resolution technologies, or with other scaling techniques, typically doubling the perceived frame rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Features Are In Development\nYour feedback matters, and we appreciate your continued support. In future updates, we\u2019ll continue to add remaining NVIDIA Control Panel options like Surround and Video Color settings, along with new features and further enhancements. Please share your thoughts about NVIDIA app via the in-app feedback feature at the top right of the window and let us know which other features you\u2019d like to see incorporated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo send NVIDIA feedback about any feature of the new app, please click the exclamation point to the right of the NVIDIA Overlay button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay tuned for updates on future NVIDIA app developments on GeForce.com, and if you haven\u2019t already installed NVIDIA app, download it now from our website!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This industry is built on a computing fabric of electrons, is fully software-defined, accelerated \u2014 and now generative AI-enabled. While huge, it\u2019s a fraction of the larger physical industrial market that relies on the movement of atoms.\nToday\u2019s 10 million factories, nearly 200,000 warehouses and 40 million miles of highways form the \u201ccomputing\u201d fabric of our physical world. But that vast network of production facilities and distribution centers is still laboriously and manually designed, operated and optimized.\nIn warehousing and distribution, operators face highly complex decision optimization problems \u2014 matrices of variables and interdependencies across human workers, robotic and agentic systems and equipment. Unlike the IT industry, the physical industrial market is still waiting for its own software-defined moment.\nThat moment is coming.\nChoreographed integration of human workers, robotic and agentic systems and equipment in a facility digital twin. Image courtesy of Accenture, KION Group.\nNVIDIA today at CES announced \u201cMega,\u201d an Omniverse Blueprint for developing, testing and optimizing physical AI and robot fleets at scale in a digital twin before deployment into real-world facilities.\nAdvanced warehouses and factories use fleets of hundreds of autonomous mobile robots, robotic arm manipulators and humanoids working alongside people. With implementations of increasingly complex systems of sensor and robot autonomy, it requires coordinated training in simulation to optimize operations, help ensure safety and avoid disruptions.\nMega offers enterprises a reference architecture of NVIDIA accelerated computing, AI, NVIDIA Isaac and NVIDIA Omniverse technologies to develop and test digital twins for testing AI-powered robot brains that drive robots, video analytics AI agents, equipment and more for handling enormous complexity and scale. The new framework brings software-defined capabilities to physical facilities, enabling continuous development, testing, optimization and deployment.\n\nDeveloping AI Brains With World Simulator for Autonomous Orchestration\nWith Mega-driven digital twins, including a world simulator that coordinates all robot activities and sensor data, enterprises can continuously update facility robot brains for intelligent routes and tasks for operational efficiencies.\nThe blueprint uses Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX APIs that enable robotics developers to render sensor data from any type of intelligent machine in the factory, simultaneously, for high-fidelity large-scale sensor simulation. This allows robots to be tested in an infinite number of scenarios within the digital twin, using synthetic data in a software-in\u2013the-loop pipeline with NVIDIA Isaac ROS.\nOperational efficiency is gained with sensor simulation. Image courtesy of Accenture, KION Group.\nSupply chain solutions company KION Group is collaborating with Accenture and NVIDIA as the first to adopt Mega for optimizing operations in retail, consumer packaged goods, parcel services and more.\nJensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA, offered a glimpse into the future of this collaboration on stage at CES, demonstrating how enterprises can navigate a complex web of decisions using the Mega Omniverse Blueprint.\n\u201cAt KION, we leverage AI-driven solutions as an integral part of our strategy to optimize our customers\u2019 supply chains and increase their productivity,\u201d said Rob Smith, CEO of KION GROUP AG. \u201cWith NVIDIA\u2019s AI leadership and Accenture\u2019s expertise in digital technologies, we are reinventing warehouse automation. Bringing these strong partners together, we are creating a vision for future warehouses that are part of a smart agile system, evolve with the world around them and can handle nearly any supply chain challenge.\u201d\nCreating Operational Efficiencies With Mega Omniverse Blueprint\nCreating operational efficiencies, KION and Accenture are embracing the Mega Omniverse Blueprint to build next-generation supply chains for KION and its customers. KION can capture and digitalize a warehouse digital twin in Omniverse by using computer-aided design files, video, lidar, image and AI-generated data.\nKION uses the Omniverse digital twin as a virtual training and testing environment for its industrial AI\u2019s robot brains, powered by NVIDIA Isaac, tapping into smart cameras, forklifts, robotic equipment and digital humans. Integrating the Omniverse digital twin, KION\u2019s warehouse management software can create and assign missions for robot brains, like moving a load from one place to another.\nGraphical data is easily introduced into the Omniverse viewport showcasing productivity and throughput among other desired metrics. Image courtesy of Accenture, KION Group.\nThese simulated robots can carry out tasks by perceiving and reasoning in environments, and they\u2019re capable of planning next motions and then taking actions that are simulated in the digital twin. The robot brains perceive the results deciding the next action, and this cycle continues with Mega precisely tracking the state and position of all the assets in the digital twin.\nDelivering Services With Mega for Facilities Everywhere\nAccenture, global leader in professional services, is adopting Mega as part of its AI Refinery for Simulation and Robotics, built on NVIDIA AI and Omniverse, to help organizations use AI simulation to reinvent factory and warehouse design and ongoing operations.\nWith the blueprint, Accenture is delivering new services \u2014 including Custom Robotics and Manufacturing Foundation Model Training and Finetuning; Intelligent Humanoid Robotics; and AI-Powered Industrial Manufacturing and Logistics Simulation and Optimization \u2014 to expand the power of physical AI and\u00a0 simulation to the world\u2019s factories and warehouse operators.\u00a0 Now, for example, an organization can explore numerous options for their warehouse before choosing and implementing the best one.\n\u201cAs organizations enter the age of industrial AI, we are helping them use AI-powered simulation and autonomous robots to reinvent the process of designing new facilities and optimizing existing operations,\u201d said Julie Sweet, chair and CEO of Accenture. \u201cOur collaboration with NVIDIA and KION will help our clients plan their operations in digital twins, where they can run hundreds of options and quickly select the best for current or changing market conditions, such as seasonal market demand or workforce availability.\u00a0 This represents a new frontier of value for our clients to achieve using technology, data and AI.\u201d\nJoin NVIDIA at CES.\u00a0\nSee notice regarding software product information.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | RoboticsTags: CES 2025 | Metropolis | NVIDIA Isaac Sim | Omniverse \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Honors Americas Partners Advancing Agentic and Physical AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Blackwell Powers Real-Time AI for Entertainment Workflows\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Upgrade Now          Analyst: Custom AI Chips Market Can \u2018Outgrow\u2019 NVIDIA (NVDA)      Fahad Saleem   January 28, 2025 4 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.77%       We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks Everyone is Talking About These Days. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks everyone is talking about these days. President Donald Trump\u2019s $500 billion investment plan to build AI infrastructure, Stargate, is making waves as analysts believe the project provides a new growth catalyst for major tech companies. Sasha Ostojic, Playground Global venture partner, said in a latest program on CNBC that the plan is just the beginning of AI \u201crenaissance\u201d in the country: \u201cStargate is just the beginning, I think, of this renaissance of AI technology in this country, even though it seems like we\u2019ve been in it for a few years. And, you know, it reminds me of the Apollo program from the 50s and 60s. In that case, it was a government-run program that created a bunch of technology, propelled the world forward, created a bunch of companies, and set us up for a lot of prosperity in the decades to follow.\u201d  Ostojic also talked about the Jensen Huang-led company and said its stock has been going \u201csideways\u201d and the market is waiting for the next big \u201ctrigger.\u201d He is bullish on the company and thinks the $500 billion plan with the company at its center could be the next growth catalyst investors were waiting for.

With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   Analyst: Custom AI Chips Market Can \u2018Outgrow\u2019 NVIDIA (NVDA)   NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) bull Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein Research managing director, was recently asked on CNBC what could be the biggest competitor to Jensen Huang\u2019s company. The analyst said custom AI chips space, or ASICs, can \u201coutgrow\u201d NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, this does not worry the investor for now. \u201cI actually do think the ultimate shake is probably NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs, and then for captive workloads at hyperscalers, it\u2019ll likely be ASICs\u2014they\u2019re all working on their own. I suspect ASICs, frankly, will probably outgrow in the sense that they\u2019re coming from a much smaller base. But you can do the math today. If I was, you know, it\u2019s a little bit of monkey math, but I bet ASICs relative to GPUs are probably low double digits\u201410, 11, 12% of the spend today. Could that number be 20% of a much bigger pie in 5 years? Yeah, I think it could.    Story Continues Manole Capital Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\u201cAs of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date.\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of AI stocks everyone is talking about these days. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Cramer explained that Trump\u2019s rhetoric has been \u201chot\u201d but the reality is \u201ccool\u201d and his much-feared tariffs against Canada and Mexico might also not realize as the new administration said it will \u201cstudy\u201d the matter. \u201cThe president loves the stock market; he always loves to send signals that all hell is going to break loose, and when it doesn\u2019t, well, guess what? The market flies. This rally is built on the back of tariffs, more specifically small-than-expected tariffs that could grow bigger if countries don\u2019t play ball. It\u2019s built on the backs of new projects like Stargate, a new AI infrastructure initiative.\u201d   Cramer then explained in detail why he believes Biden and his government were against top companies and how it affected the market and economy. Cramer said Trump is better for stock portfolios.\u201cHe knows business people in Silicon Valley; he knows how things work. You may like him, you may hate him, but the bottom line is, if you\u2019re a tech titan, Trump will take your call. In fact, he\u2019ll call you. Biden, I don\u2019t know if he knew who they even were, and he certainly didn\u2019t bother to call them. In the end, I think he preferred to sue them. If you own stocks, which is why you watch me, Trump\u2019s method is a heck of a lot better for your portfolio.\u201dREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest InFor this article, we picked 10 stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about during his programs on CNBC. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193Jim Cramer in a latest program explained the reasons why NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares fell after the CES tech show. Cramer called this decline \u201chideous.\u201d \u201cSometimes the stock doesn\u2019t tell the whole story, particularly this stock. First of all, the whole tech sector rolled over today, even as other parts of the market like healthcare and banks held up well. Second, I\u2019d argue the tech stocks were victims of the flailing 10-year Treasury, as I said at the top of the show. Finally, this stock was up huge going into Jensen\u2019s speech last night. At its highs, it was shocking NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) managed to open up strongly in the morning. It only fell from those levels because the yield in the 10-year Treasury spiked.\u201d Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore, and the impact of high expectations will continue to weigh on the stock as growth cools. An EPS surprise of 8.5% was not able to help the stock. A similar trend occurred following the second-quarter earnings after a 5.6% EPS surprise. It\u2019s difficult to see Nvidia maintaining a mid-70s gross margin by the end of 2026. Over the last two quarters, Nvidia has already reported a drop in its gross margin from 78% to 74.5%.Then there\u2019s competition. Amazon (AMZN) recently disclosed its Trainium 3 chip, which is set to be released by the end of 2025. The chip is expected to be twice as fast with 40% more power efficiency than the previous generation, manufactured on TSMC\u2019s (TSM) cutting-edge N3 technology. Reportedly, technology giant Apple (AAPL) will be a consumer of Amazon\u2019s new silicon.Manole Capital Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter: \u201cAs of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date.\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of stocks to buy and sell highlighted in Jim Cramer\u2019s latest calls. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Why Nvidia Stock Is Taking a Hit Today?      Nauman khan   January 30, 2025 1 min read        38   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.77%       Thursday morning, Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) shares plunged nearly 2.5% after the start of trading on concerns in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. This appears to be the stock's decline after earlier this week, when its decline cut 17% off Nvidia's market capitalization, erasing nearly $600 billion. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA.    Why Nvidia Stock Is Taking a Hit Today?   Two main factors have been attributed to the recent downturn: DeepSeek's R1 Reasoning Model: Cost effective yet as good as it gets' in its debut. Nvidia's model development at a fraction of the cost of Western equivalents has unnerved investors who fear the company might not be able to recapture the demand for its chips, even as industry leaders like Microsoft (MSFT, Financial) and Google reassess AI spending. The Biden administration's updated export rules restrict the flow of advanced AI chips to adversaries like China. Nvidia's revenue could be hit hard by these restrictions, as it gets around 56% of income from overseas markets, with China capturing 17%. Those developments have also contributed to a broader sell-off in semiconductor stocks, which has hit several other Chip maker companies. The market's response to the news is an overreaction to some analysts. However, it serves as an example of how dynamic the AI industry is. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia kicked off its CES 2025 keynote with a rehashing of the company history, starting with NV1 and arcade machines and evolving into an AI powerhouse. The goal is to apply machine learning to every application possible, all powered by Nvidia GPUs \u2014 the house that GeForce built. And that's what we're really here to see: The next generation of GeForce hardware, powered by the Blackwell architecture.\n\nJumping right into the heart of the matter, Nvidia kicked off the GPU announcements with the RTX 5070 at $549. That will leverage AI in various ways to deliver, according to Nvidia, RTX 4090 performance for one third the price. It will also allow for higher levels of performance in laptops, with a mobile RTX 5070 using half the power of an RTX 4090 while matching it in performance (we're assuming Nvidia is talking about a mobile 4090, though that wasn't immediately clear).Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)The rest of the announced 50-series lineup consists of the RTX 5090 at $1,999 as the halo part of this generation, with 3,400 AI TOPS of performance. The RTX 5080 will deliver a bit more than half the AI performance at 1,800 TOPS, with a far more attractive price of $999 \u2014 inheriting the price of the outgoing RTX 4080 Super. The RTX 5070 Ti comes next at $749 with 1,400 TOPS, and then finally the RTX 4070 with 1,000 TOPS at already noted $549 price point.\n\nIt's an impressive start to the next generation GPU announcements, but we need to understand how Nvidia plans to deliver these upgrades. There's also plenty that we don't yet know (officially) about these GPUs. But let's start with what we do know. Many of the core specifications have been listed by Nvidia now, and we've updated the table as appropriate.Swipe to scroll horizontallyGraphics CardRTX 5090RTX 5080RTX 5070 TiRTX 5070ArchitectureGB202GB203GB203GB205Process NodeTSMC 4NPTSMC 4NPTSMC 4NPTSMC 4NPTransistors (Billion)92.245.645.631.0Die size (mm^2)750378378263SMs170847048GPU Shaders (ALUs)217601075289606144Tensor Cores680336280192Ray Tracing Cores170847048Boost Clock (MHz)2407261724522512VRAM Speed (Gbps)28302828VRAM (GB)32161612VRAM Bus Width512256256192L2 Cache96644848Render Output Units160?112?96?64?Texture Mapping Units680336280192TFLOPS FP32 (Boost)104.856.343.930.9TFLOPS FP16 (INT8 TOPS)838 (3352)450 (1801)352 (1406)247 (988)Bandwidth (GB/s)1792960896672TBP (watts)575360300250Launch DateJan 2025Jan 2025Feb 2025?Feb 2025?Launch Price$1,999$999$749$549You'll note that there are some question marks still, mostly on the GPUs below the RTX 5090 level. Nvidia provided the full specs for the top GPU, and later appears to have given transistor counts and die sizes, but we don't have official ROPS (Render Outputs) numbers still.\n\nGiven the stated AI TOPS of performance, the first thing to note is that Nvidia has doubled the AI compute operations relative to Ada Lovelace \u2014 at least for certain data types. Our Blackwell RTX 50-series overview has had rumored specifications for a while, but the only real improvement here is the addition of native FP4 (and presumably FP6) support to the tensor cores. And while Nvidia says \"TOPS\" as that has become the industry standard, the AI TOPS are actually for FP4 TFLOPS \u2014 normally TOPS refers to integer operations, though 4-bit floating point isn't far off from that.\n\nNvidia also showed \"RTX Blackwell\" offering 125 TFLOPS of FP32 graphics compute via the shaders, which is 1.5X more than its Ada generation counterpart, while the AI performance will be 3X as high. But that's for the full-fat GB202 chip, not for the trimmed down solution used in the RTX 5090. There could potentially be a higher spec RTX 5090 Ti or maybe even Titan down the line, or if not that, certainly there's the potential for a higher tier AI / data center part using a fully enabled GB202 die.\n\nSo far, none of the announced RTX 50-series parts offers anything beyond standard 16Gb (2GB) GDDR7 modules. That means while the 512-bit interface on the RTX 5090 provides a whopping 32GB of VRAM, the 256-bit interfaces on the 5080 and 5070 Ti still end up with a 16GB GPU, and the 192-bit interface on the 5070 will 'only' provide 12GB of VRAM.\n\nThat's generally enough right now for more games, but with the voracious appetite for VRAM that AI workloads have, we wouldn't be at all surprised to see future variants of each GPU paired with 24Gb (3GB) memory modules, providing a 50% boost to VRAM capacity at all levels. Maybe that will be part of the mid-cycle refresh next year.(Image credit: Nvidia)We don't know if the fifth generation tensor cores used in Blackwell will double the throughput for other number formats. Considering the multipurpose use cases for these GPUs \u2014 they'll go into gaming cards, yes, but also professional GPUs and data center AI solutions \u2014 we suspect all aspects of the tensor cores got upgraded. We've updated the FP16 performance as appropriate, though the question marks indicate we don't know these figures for certain.\n\nWhat's interesting is that if we plug in the known clock speeds and core counts, we get most of the final specs. The 125 TFLOPS figure is also accompanied by a maximum 4,000 INT8 TOPS, while the RTX 5090 scales that down to 3,400 TOPS \u2014 85% of a fully enabled GB202, give or take. That 125 TFLOPS figure for a hypothetical chip thus scales down to ~107 TFLOPS on the RTX 5090, which makes sense.\n\nCurrent rumors put the GB202 at up to 192 SMs, while the RTX 5090 will only have 170 enabled. With a 2.41 GHz boost clock, we also wonder if that's as conservative as the RTX 40-series boost clocks. Most of the 40-series GPUs tend to boost roughly 200 MHz higher than the listed boost clocks, so if things stay the same with Blackwell, we can expect clocks more in the 2.6\u20132.7 GHz range.\n\nThe 1.8 TB/s of bandwidth figure does match up perfectly with the previously rumored 28 Gbps GDDR7 memory running on a 512-bit memory interface. Will the 5080, 5070 Ti, and 5070 also use 28 Gbps GDDR7, or will they clock it a bit higher? Nvidia released the full memory specs now, and the RTX 5080 at least will push beyond 28 Gbps, running at 30 Gbps. The 5070 Ti and 5070 will stick with the same 28 Gbps as the 5090.\n\nWhat will Nvidia do with double the AI compute on all of its gaming GPUs? Naturally, it plans to have new features and software solutions that will take advantage of the capabilities. With the RTX 5070 offering 1,000 TOPS of compute, nearly the same performance as the RTX 4090 (1,320 TOPS) at one third the price, that opens the doors for more computationally demanding tasks.Image 1 of 3(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)One of the most likely use cases will be AI-based texture compression. We've heard about this in the past, and the idea was demonstrated running on previous generation hardware... but not at extreme framerates. Neural Texture Compression (NTC) back in May 2023 ran at less than half the speed of standard BTC (Block Truncation Coding) compression. But 18 months later, with boosted AI compute and more training? It's conceivable that we could have NTC running at the same speed as traditional BTC.\n\nGiven the concerns we and others have had with GPUs running out of VRAM on modern games, it's not too surprising that NTC would be one of the major new features of the Blackwell generation of hardware. Boasting higher image quality with one third the memory use, if utilized it could make even 8GB graphics cards far more viable \u2014 and the 5070 with 12GB wouldn't be as concerning.\n\nThere's just one slight problem: Many games are cross-platform titles that run on consoles powered by AMD GPUs. How many games are going to support Nvidia's new texture compression technology if it requires even just an RTX graphics card? And if it requires an RTX 50-series card, that number will be far smaller. But Nvidia has enough sway to move the gaming market in ways that AMD and Intel can't.\n\nIt's also possible that Nvidia could get around this by having an NTC setting in the drivers or as part of DLSS that would work with games, even if they don't explicitly support the feature. That would be the, in our view, ideal situation, because it would mean potential VRAM effective capacity benefits for a whole host of games. We're also curious about whether NTC will be locked to the RTX 50-series, or if it will also be available on other RTX GPUs.\n\nWe have a lot of questions, in other words, and we'll find out more in the coming days. This is likely all part of the DLSS 4 family of technologies, which were shown in a game demo during the keynote. Under the broad heading of \"neurally rendered graphics,\" we saw various new technologies at work: DLSS 4, RTX Neural Materials, DLSS: CNN, DLSS: Transformer, Text-to-Animation, and RTX Neural Faces \u2014 all with full ray tracing, naturally. However all of these new technologies are enabled, certainly they appear to hold a lot of promise as the demo video looked pretty amazing.(Image credit: Nvidia)Besides the desktop GPUs, Nvidia also announced the mobile lineup product names. There will be matching RTX 5090, 5080 5070 Ti, and 5070 laptops with availability in March 2025. While the model names match the desktop line, performance will be significantly lower, and we expect the other specifications will also see similar cuts.\n\nThe RTX 5090 laptop GPU will offer 1,850 AI TOPS and start at $2,899. That means it's basically equal to the desktop RTX 5080. The mobile 5080 drops to 1,350 AI TOPS, slightly less than the desktop 5070 Ti. Mobile 5070 Ti will have the same 1,000 TOPS as the desktop 5070, and then the vanilla 5070 laptop GPU will offer up to 800 AI TOPS \u2014 which is probably a tease of the upcoming RTX 5060 Ti desktop part.(Image credit: Nvidia)The rest of the keynote, as you might expect, spent a lot of time talking about AI use in all sorts of other areas \u2014 vehicles, medical, warehouses, robotics, etc. It's all stuff we've been hearing repeatedly from Nvidia for the past several years, and it's all interesting, but it's not really our core focus. There's so much happening in the realm of AI, and at times it feels a lot like the crypto and NFT hype we were hearing about back in 2020\u20132021. Except, this time it doesn't appear that we'll see an end to Ethereum mining that will quiet things down.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.(Image credit: Nvidia)Nvidia also showed off its new \"AI supercomputer\" that packs a Grace Blackwell GB10 superchip into a mini PC. Called Project Digits, it runs the full DGX software stack, with 20 Grace CPU cores, 1 PFLOPS of FP4 performance, 128GB of memory, and a 4TB SSD into what should be a more affordable and portable solution than existing DGX servers, as well as something that can easily sit on a desk.\n\nAnd that wraps up the keynote. The most exciting stuff was obviously the RTX 50-series announcement, and there's still a lot that we still don't know. That will all be revealed in the coming days, and we're anticipating the full RTX 50-series launch to begin before the end of the month.

Both AMD and Intel have had more customer centric approaches though it does sound like AMD's new FSR might have a hardware limit. So long as Intel is able to continue leveraging XMX they should be able to maintain backwards compatibility across generations. Hopefully whatever AMD is doing will be similar in that they can easily carry it forward. \n\nWhile this generation still doesn't seem to be fast enough to make me want to upgrade at least they're not raising price again. The announcement press release from nvidia said 80/90 this month and 70/70 Ti February.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nohio_buckeye\n\n\nI\u2019m not going to lie though the presentation seemed impressive but I want to see numbers from independent reviewers.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nemike09\n\n\nThis is a far better way to announce your new products. Actual data. Statistical improvements, prices, and strategies we can see. I'm glad to see Nvidia pushing for refining alternative approaches to the way things have been done the last 20 years.\n\nLots to take in here! As a current 4090 owner, I'm not sure yet if this will justify an upgrade, as outside of gaming, I don't really use many AI related features that I could benefit from the new 5090. Perhaps if the Topaz AI suite, Adobe Suite (Local AI, not cloud based - I don't like sharing my projects to the cloud), Davinci, etc utilized it in a more functional way, I could be sold. It's rare that I use ~24GB of VRAM (mostly local GPT experiments), but common I use more than 16GB. I understand why high-end users want that higher bandwidth 32GB VRAM. Gotta push my game.\n\nLooking forward to more data, benchmarks, and future developments!

Illustration by TradingViewAI bellwether got a huge chunk of its valuation stripped away after a Chinese rival said it has achieved more with less.  \ud83c\udfc6 Nvidia Sheds $589 BillionNvidia stock NVDA showed it can also make records in reverse. It washed out a whopping 17% of its valuation on Monday as investors ran for the hills after Chinese AI startup DeepSeek released an AI model that took on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. And it did so for a fraction of the cost without compromising on the quality of results.  Jensen Huang\u2019s Nvidia shed a shocking $589 billion in market value, the biggest single-day loss in history, while Huang himself waved goodbye to $20 billion of his net worth.  \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc48 $6 Mil Against $100 MilThings went south even before the market opened with futures contracts sliding on the news that DeepSeek\u2019s new AI model R1 was on par with the most advanced OpenAI chatbot, GPT-4. DeepSeek said it spent just about $6 million to train its technology, while OpenAI burned through more than $100 million.  Once the realization hit, there was no way back \u2014 traders rushed to sell off their shares of companies with frothy valuations, resulting in the mayhem on Wall Street.  \ud83d\ude18 DeepSeek Used Nvidia to Beat NvidiaFunnily enough, DeepSeek used 2,048 Nvidia H800 chips to train its R1 model and achieve its impressive results. Big tech companies, at the same time, have been paying for the most-advanced H100 chips that run for around $30,000 a piece.  So what\u2019s DeepSeek?

See our ethics statement.Tom Warren is a senior editor and author of Notepad, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.Nvidia is officially announcing its RTX 50-series GPUs today. After months of leaks and rumors, the next-generation RTX Blackwell GPUs are now official, and there are four of them on the way.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang revealed the RTX 50-series GPUs during a CES keynote this evening, announcing a $1,999 RTX 5090, a $999 RTX 5080, a $749 RTX 5070 Ti, and a $549 RTX 5070. Nvidia\u2019s new RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 GPUs will both be available on January 30th, with the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 to follow in February.Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5090 GPU is surprisingly small. Image: NvidiaRelatedCan Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5070 really deliver RTX 4090 performance for $549?Here\u2019s how small Nvidia\u2019s $3,000 Digits supercomputer looks in personNvidia announces DLSS 4 with Multi Frame GenerationThe RTX 50-series GPUs include a new design for the Founders Edition, with just two double flow-through fans, a 3D vapor chamber, and GDDR7 memory. All of the RTX 50-series cards are PCIe Gen 5 and include DisplayPort 2.1b connectors to drive displays up to 8K and 165Hz.Surprisingly, the RTX 5090 Founders Edition will be a two-slot GPU and will be capable of fitting inside small form factor PCs \u2014 a big departure from the size of the RTX 4090. The RTX 5090 has 32GB of GDDR7, a memory bandwidth of 1,792GB/sec, and a massive 21,760 CUDA cores.This all adds up to a GPU that Nvidia says will be two times faster than the RTX 4090, thanks to DLSS 4 and the Blackwell architecture. But it will come at a cost of power consumption, as Nvidia says the RTX 5090 will have a total graphics power of 575 watts and a recommended PSU requirement of 1000 watts. That\u2019s 125 watts more than the RTX 4090, but hopefully the RTX 5090 will be a lot more power efficient so that you\u2019ll rarely be using the full 575 watts.Nvidia demonstrated Cyberpunk 2077 running on an RTX 5090 with DLSS 4 at 238fps compared to 106fps on an RTX 4090 with DLSS 3.5. Both GPUs are running the game with full ray tracing enabled.The RTX 5080 is designed to be twice as fast as the RTX 4080 and will include 16GB of GDDR7 memory, a memory bandwidth of 960GB/sec, and 10,752 CUDA cores. The RTX 5080 will have a total graphics power of 360 watts and Nvidia is recommending a 850-watt power supply. Nvidia is promising big performance gains with the RTX 5080 over the previous RTX 4080 model as a result of these specs.RTX 5090 performance. Image: NvidiaNvidia\u2019s RTX 5080 performance promises. Image: NvidiaNvidia is also launching an RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070. The RTX 5070 Ti includes 16GB of GDDR7 memory, a memory bandwidth of 896GB/s, and 8,960 CUDA cores. The RTX 5070 has 12GB of GDDR7, a memory bandwidth of 672 GB/sec, and 6,144 CUDA cores. The RTX 5070 Ti will have a total graphics power of 300 watts and require a 750-watt PSU, while the RTX 5070 has a total graphics power of 250 watts and only needs a 650-watt PSU.Nvidia says the RTX 5070 Ti will be 2x faster than the RTX 4070 Ti, and the RTX 5070 should be twice as fast as the RTX 4070. Huang even claimed on stage at CES that the RTX 5070 will deliver \u201cRTX 4090 performance at $549,\u201d but this will undoubtedly be because of DLSS 4 improvements and not pure rasterization performance.Nvidia is also bringing its RTX 50-series to laptops, with the RTX 5090 laptop GPU debuting with 24GB of GDDR7 memory. The RTX 5080 laptop GPU will ship with 16GB of GDDR7 memory, the RTX 5070 Ti with 12GB of GDDR7 memory, and the RTX 5070 with just 8GB of GDDR7 memory. RTX 50-series laptops will be available starting in March from a variety of PC makers.RTX 50-series laptops are coming in March. Image: NvidiaHuang demonstrated Nvidia\u2019s RTX Blackwell GPUs with a real-time rendering demo at the beginning of the company\u2019s CES keynote today. The demo included new RTX Neural Materials, RTX Neural Faces, text to animation, and even DLSS 4. \u201cThe new generation of DLSS can generate beyond frames, it can predict the future,\u201d says Huang. \u201cWe used GeForce to enable AI, and now AI is revolutionizing GeForce.\u201dNvidia\u2019s new RTX Neural Shaders can be used to compress textures in games, while RTX Neural Faces aim to improve face quality using generative AI. The next generation of DLSS includes Multi Frame Generation, which generates up to three additional frames per traditional frame and can multiply frame rates by up to 8x over traditional rendering, according to Nvidia.PreviousNext1/3DLSS 4 also includes a real-time application of transformers to improve image quality, reduce ghosting, and add higher detail in motion. The DLSS 4 upgrade will even work on existing RTX GPUs, as features have been upgraded to the new transformer AI models.

Nvidia\u2019s RTX 40-series of GPUs focused on improving ray tracing with Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) version 3, and the RTX 4090 delivered some truly impressive performance gains over the previous RTX 3090 GPU.See More: CESEntertainmentGamingNewsNvidiaPC GamingTechMore in this streamSee allNvidia\u2019s latest driver enables DLSS 4 override options for more games.Richard LawlerMar 18CommentsComment Icon BubbleTwenty years later, Half-Life 2 is a top tech demo again.Sean HollisterMar 13CommentsComment Icon BubbleNvidia denies reports that its RTX 50 laptop GPUs are missing ROPs, tooSean HollisterMar 6CommentsComment Icon BubbleMost PopularMost PopularThe first new Pebble smartwatches are coming later this yearThe future of search isn\u2019t Google \u2014 and it\u2019s $10 a monthAnalogue\u2019s 4K Nintendo 64 retro console has been delayed, againNvidia\u2019s RTX Pro 6000 has 96GB of VRAM and 600W of powerBYD announces charging tech that\u2019s twice as fast as Tesla\u2019sInstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Upgrade Now          Why this 50-year-old restaurant chain has a stock that's smoking Nvidia's      Brian Sozzi   \u00b7 Executive Editor  January 31, 2025 3 min read        49   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   CMG   +1.42%    MCD   +0.58%    NVDA   +2.67%     EAT   +4.40%    SHAK   +2.97%      Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. Brinker International (EAT) CEO Kevin Hochman won't agree with me to put an item called Nvidia (NVDA) chips and guac on the menu \u2014 but maybe he should. The former KFC marketing whiz is leading one of the hottest restaurant chains on the planet in Chili's, an old-school sit-down eatery that was born in 1975. Its long claim to fame has been saucy ribs, sizzling fajitas, and gigantic burger patties \u2014 hardly revolutionary stuff. \"Of course, I have been surprised [by the results],\" Hochman told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above; listen below). \"I knew we were doing the right things and I knew over time we would get better and get stronger and get good results.\"  Brinker's stock has served up a savory 348% gain over the past year, outperforming Nvidia's meager 99% advance. The stock price has also outperformed every other major restaurant chain. Yahoo Finance data shows Brinker now sports a market cap of $8.1 billion, lightyears ahead of the paltry $468 million afforded struggling Dine Brands (DIN) \u2014 its longtime rival that operates Applebee's and IHOP. How great has the performance of the 1,500 locations chain been? Pretty damn great, considering sit-down restaurants are battling mobile ordering, salad-loving 20-somethings, Ozempic shots, higher costs for labor and food, and perhaps a dozen other headwinds.   Chili's same-store sales exploded 31.4% year over year in the most recent quarter. The gain was propped up by an eye-opening 19.9% increase in customer visits. The results come following a series of double-digit quarterly sales gains for Chili's. Hochman credited a few items for the chain's comeback.  First, a steady stream of value marketing to a customer base that often views eating out as a weekly or monthly luxury. And second, investments in higher-quality food. Hochman has swapped chicken trimmings in some items for \"whole lobe\" chicken. Bacon is coming out of the kitchen crispier. Guacamole is being made fresh daily instead of using \"day two\" guac.   \"The flywheel of better food, service, atmosphere, and marketing translating into sales is in full effect, with Chili\u2019s posting comp growth we\u2019ve never seen from a mature brand (ex-COVID),\" Citi restaurant analyst Jon Tower wrote in a client note. \"There\u2019s little evidence to suggest this strength should fade with management pointing to sales momentum carrying into fiscal third quarter, a pipeline of new product news and store-level initiatives (oven replacement, remodels) providing duration to the sales story.\"   Story Continues Hochman also didn't bite on a suggestion to put DeepSeek Dippers on the menu, but he has other things in the works to keep the sales momentum going.See more from the Opening Bid podcast        How millennials should handle the $124 trillion wealth transfer     Why more big deals are coming in the music industry     Why Netflix and Amazon will dominate live sports    He told Yahoo Finance that a reinvention of Chili's ribs to include more smoke and better sauce will drop soon. Fajitas will get softer shells (Hochman said his team has been working to reboot fajitas for two years).A new surprise menu item is coming too (the Street thinks it's a chicken sandwich \u2014 Hochman declined to comment). And Turbochef ovens in the back of the house to replace tired old conveyor belt cookers, which should help get the food out quicker, are being installed.\"So the key question for our team is what's the next three years of the turnaround? And I would tell you there [are] way more changes ahead of us than we've actually completed,\" Hochman said.Three times each week, I field insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

To be clear, that's generally for good reason\u2014it's either being put to nefarious use, is coming fer our jobs, or is being used as some marketing gimmick with no actual relation to genuine artificial intelligence. But the most impressive thing I saw in my time at CES 2025, and throughout the Nvidia RTX Blackwell Editor's Day was AI-based. And it's a tangible advancement on the AI us gamers likely use every day: DLSS.DLSS\u2014or Deep Learning Super Sampling, to give it its full title\u2014is Nvidia's upscaling technology used to deliver higher frame rates for our PC games (mostly because ray tracing sucked them down), and single-handedly kicked off the upscaling revolution that is now demanded of every single GPU and games console maker across the planet.And its fourth iteration offers \"by far the most ambitious and most powerful DLSS yet.\" So says Nvidia's deep learning guru, Brian Catanzaro. And the reason it's such a massive deal is that it's moving from using a US news network for its AI architecture to the technology behind Optimus Prime.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nIt's time for me to admit that AI-accelerated frame generation might actually be the way of the future and that's a good thing\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 50-series and dev kit show that rasterization is old news and we're now firmly in the era of AI rendering\n\n\n\nYes, DLSS 4 is now powered by energon cubes. Wait, no, I think I've fundamentally misunderstood something vital. Hang on.From the introduction of DLSS 2 in 2020, Nvidia's upscaling has been using a technology called CNN, which actually stands for convolutional neural network (not Cable News Network, my apologies). CNN has gone hand-in-hand with GPUs since the early 2000s when it was shown that the parallel processing power of a graphics chip could hugely accelerate the performance of a convolutional neural network compared with a CPU. But the big breakthrough event was in 2012 when the AlexNet CNN architecture became the instant standard for AI image recognition.Back then it was trained on a pair of GTX 580s, how times have changed\u2026At its most basic form, a CNN is designed to locally bunch pixels together in an image and analyse them in a branching structure, going from a low level to a higher level. This allows a CNN to summarise an image in a very computationally efficient way and, in the case of DLSS, display what it 'thinks' an image should look like based on all its aggregated pixels.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Convolutional neural networks, however, are no longer the cutting edge of artificial intelligence and deep learning. That is now something called the transformer. And this is the big switcheroo that has come out of CES 2025\u2014DLSS will be powered by the transformer model going forward, and will deliver far better image quality, being far more accurate and stable... though that does come with a hit on gaming performance.The transformer architecture was developed by the smart bods at Google, and is essentially the power behind the latest AI boom as it forms the heart of large language models, such as ChatGPT. In fact, the GPT part there stands for generative pre-trained transformer.Image 1 of 3(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)While CNN is more closely related to images, transformers are far more generalised. Their power is about where computational attention is directed.\"The idea behind transformer models,\" Catanzaro tells us, \"is that attention\u2014how you spend your compute and how you analyse data\u2014should be driven by the data itself. And so the neural network should learn how to direct its attention in order to look at the parts of the data that are most interesting or most useful to make decisions.\"And, when you think about DLSS, you can imagine that there are a lot of opportunities to use attention to make a neural graphics model smarter, because some parts of the image are inherently more challenging.\"Transformer models are also computationally efficient, and that has allowed Nvidia to increase the size of the models it uses for DLSS 4 because they can be trained on much larger data sets now, and \"remember many more examples of things that they saw during training.\"Nvidia has also \"dramatically increased the amount of compute that we put into our DLSS model,\" says Catanzaro.\" Our DLSS 4 models use four times as much compute as our previous DLSS models did.\"And it can make a huge difference in games that support DLSS 4. I think maybe the most obvious impact is in games which use Ray Reconstruction to improve the ray tracing and the denoising of a gameworld. I was hugely impressed with Ray Reconstruction when I first used it, and it still anchors characters in a world far better than previous solutions to ray traced lighting.But you do get a noticeable smearing effect sometimes in games such as Cyberpunk 2077 and Alan Wake 2. With the smarts of the transformer model, however, that's all gone. The improved neural network perceives scene elements more accurately than the CNN model, most especially those trickier scene elements, and most especially in darker environments.Alan Wake 2 is the epitome of that, with its always brooding level design, and the example we were given on stage highlights a ceiling fan spinning around, leaving the familiar Ray Reconstruction smearing effect in the wake of its fan blades using the CNN model. With DLSS 4 and the transformer model, it just looks like a regular fan, with the dark ceiling behind the spinning fan now given clear detail.You can also see how much more stable fine details are from this example of a chain-link fence, and you get the same effect with trailing overhead cables, etc.(Image credit: Nvidia)I've also seen it used to great effect in Cyberpunk 2077, and in the RTX Remix version of Half-Life 2\u2014which is still yet to be released but I got to have a play with it last week. I got to check out the demo of HL2 where we could toggle between the two DLSS models at will and the level of detail that suddenly pops out of the darkness with the transformer architecture in play is pretty astounding.Not in a strange, 'why is it highlighting that?' kinda way, but more naturally. The way that even in the flickering gloom outside the ring of light around a flaming touch, set just outside of Ravenholm, you can make out a trail of leaves where before there were just muddy pixels.And that extra level of visual fidelity is coming to all games that support DLSS 4, which, thankfully, is every game which currently supports DLSS. There are going to be 75 games and apps at the launch of the RTX 50-series cards that support DLSS 4 out of the box, and they will either give you the option to switch between CNN and transformer models\u2014this is what the build of Cyberpunk 2077 I've played with does\u2014or it just switches over wholesale for DLSS 4.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)But, via the Nvidia App, you're also going to be able to override the DLSS version any game currently uses to essentially drop in the new transformer model to take advantage of the improved image quality. You will also be able to add Multi Frame Generation (MFG) into any game that currently supports Nvidia's existing Frame Generation feature via this method, too. So long as you have an RTX Blackwell card, anyways\u2026It is worth noting, however, that even though MFG is hardware-locked to Blackwell, the standard two-times Frame Generation benefits from an enhanced model, too. Nvidia says its new AI model is 40% faster and uses 30% less VRAM. It also no longer uses the optical flow hardware baked into the Ada architecture, as it's been replaced by a more efficient AI model to do the same job. RTX 40-series cards can also now take advantage of the Flip Metering frame pacing tech\u2014the same thing which locks MFG to RTX Blackwell\u2014just without enhanced hardware in the display engine.Image 1 of 3(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)But DLSS 4's transformer model for Ray Reconstruction and Super Resolution isn't restricted to RTX 50-series or RTX 40-series cards, however, and is available to all RTX GPUs from Turing upwards. Which is a hell of a sell.\"One of the reasons this is possible,\" says Catanzaro, \"is because the way that we built DLSS 4 was to be as compatible as possible with DLSS 3. So, games that have integrated DLSS 3 and DLSS 3.5 can just fit right in.\"DLSS 4 has something for all RTX gamers.\"But there always has to be some sort of caveat. While it is supported by all RTX GPUs, the transformer model is more computationally intensive than the previous CNN incarnation. From speaking to Nvidia folk at the show they estimated potentially around 10% more expensive in terms of frame rates. So, if you just look at the raw frame rate data you will see DLSS 4 performing worse at the same DLSS levels compared with previous iterations.What you won't see there is the extra visual fidelity.You could potentially offset that performance hit, however, by leaning on that extra fidelity to drop down a DLSS tier, from Quality to Balanced, for example, and that might well give you better performance and maybe even slightly improved visuals. But we will, however, have to check that out for ourselves when DLSS 4 launches out of beta in full.I for one am almost looking forward more to the DLSS 4 launch than I am to getting my hands on the svelte new RTX 5090. Though I will say, its Multi Frame Generation does have to be seen to be believed.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\nPRODUCTS\n\nNvidia Blackwell\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5090\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5080\n\n\nDave JamesSocial Links NavigationEditor-in-Chief, HardwareDave has been gaming since the days of Zaxxon and Lady Bug on the Colecovision, and code books for the Commodore Vic 20 (Death Race 2000!).

I guess it's the death of semiconductors. But if you think reports of their demise might be a bit overblown, and want to capitalize on the spike in volatility, an iron condor in FEB is an interesting setup. Selling the 110/100 put spread and the 137/147 call spread leans slightly long delta for a $2.66 credit.\n\nSHOP ($115) Calendarize Ratio AKA Crab Trade (MAR/FEB) $0.76 debitShopify has nearly doubled since this time last year, and it is currently near 52-week highs. Its earnings are coming up on Feb. 11. If you think the upside might be muted, an upside CRAB trade provides an interesting inside/up payoff with very little risk to the downside. Go long the 125 call in MAR for some positive gamma; and selling 2x the 135 calls in FEB for a small debit has a breakeven around 140 and up to a $1,000 profit in the 120-135 range (upside expected move in FEB).\n\nSubscribe to Cherry Picks to be Cool.\u00a0We\u2019re OK with grifters, but to be on our good side\u00a0subscribe to our newsletter.Sharing is caring.\u00a0Forward this email to your friends\u00a0so they can subscribe to our newsletters, too!

Upgrade Now          Nvidia stock jumps, leads 'Magnificent 7' gains to start 2025 after end-of-year tech sell-off      Laura Bratton    Updated January 4, 2025 3 min read        74   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   AMZN   +0.28%    NVDA   +2.71%    AAPL   +0.85%    META   -0.25%    MSFT   +0.77%       Nvidia stock (NVDA) led gains among the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d tech stocks to start the new year after a group-wide sell-off in the last days of 2024. Shares of the AI chipmaker rose 4.5% Friday after gaining roughly 3% the prior day. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    118.56 +3.13 (+2.71%)  As of 2:01:18 PM EDT. Market Open.   NVDA MSFT AAPL   Advanced Chart    That upswing followed a 4% dip between Christmas Eve and New Year\u2019s Eve as megacap tech stocks dropped across the board in the absence of a \u201cSanta Claus\" rally, where the stock market typically enjoys a surge between Dec. 24 and Jan. 2. Tesla (TSLA) stock plunged nearly 13% over that time frame, while Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) dropped more than 4%. Meanwhile, Meta (META) and Google (GOOG) fell just under 4%, and Apple (AAPL) dropped 3%. Even with its December decline, Nvidia shares still ended 2024 up more than 150%. Wall Street analysts have remained bullish on the stock, estimating shares will rise to roughly $173 over the next year from their current level of $138, according to Yahoo Finance data. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    118.56 +3.13 (+2.71%)  As of 2:01:18 PM EDT. Market Open.     Advanced Chart    Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya told Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid podcast Thursday that broader market forces and company-specific issues drove the sell-off in Nvidia stock late last year. \"What we have seen in the market is a rotation of money from semiconductors to software,\" Arya said, noting that the latter was less exposed to US trade restrictions on goods to and from China. He added that for Nvidia, \"the last two quarters have not been clean, really, because they're going through growing pains from one generation of product that was Hopper to the new generation of product.\"  Arya was referring to concerns surrounding delays in shipments of the company's new Blackwell artificial intelligence chips. \"In our view, these are short-term issues,\" he said. That could create a buying opportunity: While its Magnificent Seven peers are trading at two times their average earnings growth estimates for 2025, Arya noted that Nvidia shares are trading at less than one times the consensus earnings growth for the company this upcoming year. Arya has a Buy rating on Nvidia stock and sees shares rising to $190 over the next 12 months. Shares of Nvidia and its Magnificent Seven peers have benefited from investors' massive bets on artificial intelligence, as well as earnings growth. As Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reported, through roughly three-quarters of reports, the combination of Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, and Nvidia grew earnings year over year by 33% in 2024, compared to just 4.2% growth for the other 493 S&P 500 companies, per FactSet data.   Story Continues   The NVIDIA stand at the Apsara Conference in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China, Sept. 19, 2024. (CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images)  \u00b7 CFOTO via Getty ImagesTo be sure, skeptics warn of a bubble that could burst and send AI-fueled stocks tumbling if hype over the new technology fades and Big Tech's spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure wanes. Wall Street analysts overall remain convinced the AI enthusiasm will continue, however.Tesla also notched a notable gain Friday, jumping more than 8%. Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta rose around 1%, while Amazon spiked nearly 2%. Apple shares were roughly flat.  StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.

This meeting comes after reports suggested that the Trump administration is considering further restrictions on Nvidia exports to China, specifically targeting its H20 AI GPUs. Unsurprisingly, this could have the potential to negatively impact the chipmaker\u2019s business.Invest with Confidence: Follow TipRanks' Top Wall Street Analysts to uncover their success rate and average return. Join thousands of data-driven investors \u2013 Build your Smart Portfolio for personalized insights. \nThe U.S. has already imposed restrictions on Nvidia\u2019s exports to China by banning the sale of its most advanced AI chips, including the A100, H100, A800, and H800. However, the H20 GPUs were not included in this ban. As a result, Huang is willing to meet with Trump and offer his help to the administration. This meeting may provide insight into the potential impact of Trump\u2019s policies on Nvidia\u2019s business.\nInterestingly, Trump\u2019s policies could have both positive and negative effects on Nvidia. On the one hand, his potential tariffs could harm Nvidia\u2019s overseas sales and manufacturing. On the other hand, his anti-regulation stance and commitment to promoting AI chip manufacturing and investment in the U.S. could benefit the company by allowing it to expand its domestic operations.\nIs NVDA a Good Stock to Buy?\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts remain bullish on NVDA stock, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 37 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. After\u00a0a 101% rally in its share price\u00a0over the past year, the\u00a0average NVDA price target of $178.63 per share\u00a0implies an upside potential of 41% from current levels.\n\nSee more NVDA analyst ratings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\n\n\n FACEBOOK\n\n\n\n\n TWITTER\n\n\n\n\n EMAIL\n\n\n\n\n COPY LINK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNVIDIA NewsMORE  \n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia acquires synthetic data provider Gretel - reportSeeking Alpha 2h \n\n\n\nWhy one analyst and Nvidia skeptic says the chipmaker might not grow at all next yearBusiness Insider 3h \n\n\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) Yield Shares Purpose ETF - ETF Units declares $0.75 dividendSeeking Alpha 4h \n\n\n\nS&P 500 buybacks increase 7.4% Q/Q in fourth quarter, Apple continues to leadSeeking Alpha 6h \n\n\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Gets a Buy from Stifel NicolausTipRanks 7h \n\n\n\nNvidia (NVDA): New Buy Recommendation for This Technology GiantTipRanks 7h \n\n\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) is Busy in Beijing Touting Tech Prowess to Chinese InnovatorsTipRanks 8h \n\n\n\nNvidia remains 1-2 steps ahead of competitors, says JPMorganTipRanks 8h \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tStart Trading Futures\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n\n\n\n\nNVDA\n\n\n\n117.81\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2.38 (2.06%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t01:46:00 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time NVDA charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFind News\n\t\t\t\tNews\n\n\n\n\n\nGO\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n            See also:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                - Explore more categories\n            \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Among Billionaire Steve Cohen\u2019s Top Stock Picks?      Usman Kabir   January 22, 2025 4 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.68%       We recently published a list of Billionaire Steve Cohen\u2019s Top 15 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other Billionaire Steve Cohen\u2019s top stock picks. Steve Cohen is one of the most prominent and successful hedge fund managers in the world, known for his extraordinary trading acumen and ability to generate consistent returns. As the founder of\u00a0Point72 Asset Management, Cohen has built a reputation as a pioneer in the hedge fund industry. He was born in 1956 into a middle-class family. His father worked in the garment industry, while his mother was a piano teacher. Cohen showed an interest in finance early on, even dabbling in poker, which honed his skills in risk-taking and probability analysis. He graduated from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1978 with a degree in economics. Shortly after, he began his career on Wall Street as a junior trader at Gruntal & Co, where he quickly gained recognition for his ability to generate profits through equities trading.  Read more about these developments by accessing\u00a010 Best AI Data Center Stocks\u00a0and\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. In 1992, Cohen founded SAC Capital Advisors with $25 million, including $10 million of his own savings. The hedge fund, named after his initials, focused on long/short equity strategies and became known for its aggressive trading style. Over the years, SAC Capital emerged as one of the most successful hedge funds in history, consistently delivering double-digit returns. At its peak, SAC Capital managed over $16 billion in assets. Cohen reportedly generated annualized returns of approximately 30% for his investors, an extraordinary achievement in the hedge fund industry. Cohen\u2019s trading style emphasized speed, precision, and a deep understanding of market dynamics. In 2014, Cohen launched Point72 Asset Management, a firm focused on managing his personal fortune and eventually reopening to external investors. Point72 has since grown into a major player in the hedge fund industry. As of the third quarter of 2024, Point72 manages over $39 billion in 13F securities. The firm employs over 1,800 people and operates across multiple global offices. Point72 combines Cohen\u2019s expertise in active trading with investments in technology, data analysis, and artificial intelligence, positioning itself at the forefront of modern finance.

Story Continues For this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of Point72 Asset Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Among Billionaire Steve Cohen\u2019s Top Stock Picks?  Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset ManagementNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193\u00a0Point72 Asset Management\u2019s Stake: $448 million\u00a0\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. As per the report of the third quarter of 2024, GAAP earnings per diluted share was $4.93, up 33% from the previous quarter and up 765% from a year ago, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $5.16, up 28% from the previous quarter and up 486% from a year ago. These higher earnings per share (EPS) reflect the company\u2019s improved profitability per share, directly benefiting shareholders and potentially leading to higher dividends or share buybacks in the future. Secondly, NVIDIA released NIM microservices to safeguard applications for agentic AI \u2013 NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails includes new NVIDIA NIM microservices to enhance accuracy, security and control for enterprises building AI across industries. This initiative expands the market share of the company and reinforces its reputation as an innovator in the AI industry. Moreover, the company also plans to launch its first consumer CPU-GPU platform in 2025, integrating its AI and graphics expertise to offer a comprehensive computing solution. This initiative may hold potential for investors as it aims to challenge existing market leaders by providing high-performance alternatives for consumer PCs.Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of Billionaire Steve Cohen\u2019s top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

The link above from IBM offers a highly readable summary, but, in essence, because model-generated data is less diverse and robust, \u201cbad\u201d information gets propagated easily and overwhelms \u201cgood\u201d information.It\u2019s akin to making a copy of a copy or, for Michael Keaton fans, Multiplicity.This is not a threat that\u2019s unique to DeepSeek, it\u2019s a risk to all generative AI models, but it\u2019s amplified by DeepSeek.The use of synthetic data is a key component of the model\u2019s framework.In the event of model collapse, we would expect to see increasingly nonsensical outputs from DeepSeek as it gradually decays to uselessness.Unfortunately for investors, whether DeepSeek has cracked the model collapse problem is a wait-and-see proposition.The biggest threat to investors isn\u2019t that DeepSeek usurps existing AI models (at least in my mind, for the reasons above), it\u2019s that DeepSeek is a gut check on the AI narrative as a whole.If DeepSeek can already do what more robust models do at a fraction of the price, what justifies the investments?Further, if DeepSeek is the \u201cbest\u201d model out there, what happens should it start spewing nonsense?I already count myself among the ranks of AI skeptics, so this does not materially change how I\u2019m approaching investing these days, but the apparent fragility of the AI narrative should prompt AI bulls to reconsider their theses and potentially take some profit off the table.[author_ad]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Email\n    \n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Print\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Simmerman\n\n\n                    Brad Simmerman is Senior Analyst and Editor of Cabot Wealth Daily, the award-winning free daily advisory.\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Available\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet My Free Report\n\n\nAs Seen On\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose Your Free ReportsYou have access to our expertly curated collection of free investing reports, including 5 Best Stocks to Buy this Month, How to Find Undervalued Stocks, How Options Work, and more.Get My Reports\n\n\n\n\nBrowse Topics\n\n\n\nCannabis Stocks\n\n\nDividend Stocks\n\n\nGrowth Stocks\n\n\nInternational Stocks\n\n\nOptions Trading\n\n\nPersonal Finance\n\n\nSmall-Cap Stocks\n\n\nStock Market\n\n\nTech Stocks\n\n\nValue Stocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Videos\n\n\nStill Playing Defense, but Positive Signs Emerging | Cabot Weekly Review\n\nMarch 14, 2025\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Mike Cintolo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Reports\n\n\n\n5 Best Stocks to Buy in March\n\n\nThe 7 Best Places in the World to Retire on a Budget\n\n\nEssential Guide to High-Probability Trading\n\n\nCabot\u2019s Best Dividend Stocks\n\n\nHow Options Work\u2014and How to Hedge Portfolios with Options\n\n\nHow to Find Undervalued Stocks\n\n\nHow to Invest in Stocks\n\n\nTechnical Analysis of Stocks\n\n\nHow to Invest in Cannabis Stocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCabot offers the rare combination of expert insight and confident contrarian/independent thinking to individual investors.

I am a member of Cabot Prime Pro. Best investment I ever made.\n\nB.A., Novi, Michigan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is your qualities of truthfulness, honesty and candor that have drawn me to the Cabot family of letters and to date, I am very pleased. The yo-yo effect of the market has not phased me. Reading your letters are like a prayer to me...they calm me.\n\nA. Khorsandian, Daytona Beach, Florida\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJacob gives me peace and tranquility. If I have to define him, he is a little more in the conservative side. Patience is his key and that gives me plenty of time to stay relax and trade as he advises. I have an 85% record with him in all the trades. To be honest, I put my threshold for profits lower but as he says that is my technique and I\u2019m quite happy with it. I will recommend Jacob any time.\n\nV. Maines, Mission Viejo, California\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019d recommend Cabot Top Ten to a friend with confidence that the Cabot people are like family and you can trust their every intention! They truly care about the disciplines that lead to the success of every investor.\n\nW.N. Archer, Springboro, Ohio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTyler, I want you to know that since I subscribed in October 2016 that I am very pleased with the investment advice. You have exceeded my expectations. I find your commentary on the monthly stock picks comprehensive and balanced. I also appreciate your weekly updates as you share your thoughts and sometimes address any concerns which I may have. It is also most useful to get your advice on when to sell a stock.\n\nKen K, West Indies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI manage four Trusts and have relied on Cabot newsletters for advice for years. The investments I\u2019ve made, thanks to them, have done extremely well. Chris Preston has been particularly helpful, responding immediately to my occasional emails. I cannot recommend the Cabot firm highly enough.\n\nAlan Karbelnig PhD, ABPP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Discover hot stocks and investing tips from Cabot analysts in our free Cabot Wealth Daily newsletter delivered right to your inbox.\n    \n\n\n\n\n            We understand your email address is private.

Upgrade Now          Why Nvidia (NVDA) is a Top Growth Stock for the Long-Term         Zacks Equity Research   January 20, 2025 2 min read           In This Article:  NVDA         It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors. Achieving those goals is made easier with the Zacks Style Scores, a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on popular investing methodologies, namely value, growth, and momentum. The Style Scores can help you narrow down which stocks are better for your portfolio and which ones can beat the market over the long-term. Why This 1 Growth Stock Should Be On Your Watchlist Different than value or momentum investors, growth-oriented investors are concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, they'll want to focus on the Growth Style Score, which analyzes characteristics like projected and historical earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time. Nvidia (NVDA) NVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company\u2019s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.  NVDA sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), holds a Growth Style Score of A, and has a VGM Score of B. Earnings and sales are forecasted to increase 126.2% and 111.8% year-over-year, respectively. 15 analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.10 to $2.94 per share for 2025. NVDA boasts an average earnings surprise of 9.8%. Looking at cash flow, Nvidia is expected to report cash flow growth of 303.7% this year; NVDA has generated cash flow growth of 50.2% over the past three to five years. NVDA should be on investors' short lists because of its impressive growth fundamentals, a good Zacks Rank, and strong Growth and VGM Style Scores.

By comparison, OpenAI, Google and other major U.S. companies are on track to invest a total of roughly $1 trillion in AI over the coming years, according to Goldman Sachs.On Monday, DeepSeek's rollout roiled shares of AI stalwarts such as Nvidia, the high-flying manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, and Dutch company ASML, another chipmaker. The Chinese company's tech is raising questions about whether demand for Nvidia's chips could take a hit, as well as whether investors are overvaluing tech stocks that have been buoyed by the promise of AI, from Meta to Microsoft, experts said.\"DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less,\" said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, in an email. \"This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years.\"DeepSeek's latest app comes just days after President Trump announced a new $500 billion venture\u00a0with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, dubbed Stargate, which he touted as ensuring \"the future of technology\" in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI-related stocks took a hit on Monday, with Nvidia shares tumbling 17%, shedding $600 billion in value and marking the single-biggest one-day loss for a company in stock market history, according\u00a0to CNBC. ASML sank 6%, while Broadcom, another semiconductor stock, also slumped 17%.\n\n\nSome energy-related stocks also plunged on Monday on investor worries that the new tech could require less energy to run, translating into lower demand from the tech sector. GE Vernova, which makes wind and gas turbines, plunged 21%, while electricity generator Vistra slumped 28%.The tech-heavy Nasdaq index slumped 3%, or 612 points, while the S&P 500 declined 1.5%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7%.Despite the sharp drop on the Nasdaq, it's far from the worst day for the index during the past five years. The worst one-day decline since Jan. 27, 2020, came on March 16, 2020, when the index plunged more than 12% as COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy.\u00a0What is DeepSeek?DeepSeek is a private Chinese company founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a graduate of Zhejiang University, one of China's top universities, who funded the startup via his hedge fund,\u00a0according to the MIT Technology Review. Liang has about $8 billion in assets, Ives wrote in a Jan. 27 research note.\n\n\nLiang, who had previously focused on applying AI to investing, had bought a \"stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips,\" a type of tech that is now banned from export to China. Those chips became the basis of DeepSeek, the MIT publication reported.Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius, told investors in a note that DeepSeek makes legitimate breakthroughs as an AI tool, including better learning and more efficient use of memory, although he expressed skepticism about the \"amount of chips used.\"Is DeepSeek available in the U.S.?The company's AI app is available in Apple's App store, as well as online at its website. The service is free and as of Monday morning was the top download on Apple's store, although some people were having trouble signing up for the app.\u00a0On its Chinese site, DeepSeek blamed \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its service, requiring it to temporarily limit new registrations. \"Existing users can log in as usual,\" the company said in the post, which was dated shortly after midnight Jan. 28 in China's local time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Chinese AI app Deepseek impacting stock prices of Bay Area tech companies\n04:16\n\n\n\nThe company released its latest AI model on Jan. 20, which is causing Wall Street to reappraise the AI sector.\u00a0\"Last week DeepSeek launched a model that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's Llama 3.1 and was #1 on Apple's App Store over the weekend,\" Wedbush's Ives wrote. \"DeepSeek built the model using reduced capability chips from Nvidia. which is impressive and thus has caused major agita for U.S. tech stocks with massive pressure on Nasdaq this morning.\"How is DeepSeek different than other AI apps?\u00a0DeepSeek is an open-source large language model that relies on what is known as \"inference-time computing,\" which Sette said in layman's terms means \"they activate only the most relevant portions of their model for each query, and that saves money and computation power.\"\u00a0\n\n\nSome experts praised DeepSeek's performance, with noted tech investor Marc Andreessen writing\u00a0on X on Jan. 24, \"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen \u2014 and as open source, a profound gift to the world.\"David Sacks, a venture capitalist named by Mr. Trump to help oversee AI and cryptocurrency policy, said on social media Monday that DeepSee's app \"shows that the AI race will be very competitive.\"However, Ives said he's skeptical the service will gain ground with major U.S. businesses.\u00a0\"No U.S. Global 2000 is going to use a Chinese startup DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases,\" Ives wrote. \"At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\"Are there privacy issues with DeepSeek?Some experts are raising concerns about the personal data that DeepSeek is collecting, given that the company stores data from users \u2014 including their date of birth, keystrokes, text or audio inputs, uploaded files, chat history and other data \u2014 on servers located in China, according to its privacy policy.\u00a0That echoes some of the issues raised with TikTok, another company with Chinese ownership that sparked worries about the supposed risks its ties to China posed to national security. Last year, Congress passed a law\u00a0banning\u00a0 TikTok in the U.S. as long as it is under Chinese ownership, although that is now in flux after President Trump signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0directing the Justice Department to not enforce the ban for 75 days.What does DeepSeek mean for Nvidia and other tech companies?Wall Street is trying to assess the long-term impact of a low-cost AI tool from China that rivals ChatGPT and other so-called generative AI apps. It also raises questions about whether Silicon Valley is overspending on tech advancements in the AI sector, noted Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, in an email.\u00a0\n\n\n\"The fact that this technology is supposed to take less energy and is more cost-effective than U.S.-based models has U.S. technology investors very concerned,\" Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said.It's also unclear what type of pushback or reaction could come from the White House, given that Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of placing new tariffs on Chinese imports, although he also gave the Chinese-owned TikTok a reprieve by ordering the Justice Department not to enforce a looming ban.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Trump's AI project will impact Americans\n05:32\n\n\n\nSome Wall Street analysts think Monday's stock selloff is an overreaction, noting that the enormous demand for AI will continue lifting key players in the sector.\u00a0\"It's one thing to train a [large language] model for less money, but accommodating the huge demand for the consumption of all this AI technology is still going to require massive amounts of infrastructure,\" Adam Crisafulli of VitalKnowledge said in a report.Analysts at Bernstein Research also noted that while DeepSeek's technology looks promising, it likely isn't revolutionary, suggesting that Monday's investment rout is overblown.What is Nvidia saying about DeepSeek?\u00a0In a statement to CBS News, Nvidia offered praise for DeepSeek.\u00a0\"DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of test-time scaling,\" the company said in an email. \"DeepSeek's work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export-control compliant.\"\n\n\nBut, Nvidia added, AI inference, or using AI models to make decisions or predictions, \"requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.\"\n\n\n\nAI: Artificial Intelligence\n\n              More\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHundreds of actors urging government not to loosen copyright laws for AI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Tech's big bet on nuclear power to fuel artificial intelligence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25 arrested in global operation targeting AI child sexual abuse content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMusk launches Grok 3 AI chatbot.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA\u2019s (NVDA) Role in a $500B AI Future: Buy Now?      Affan Mir   January 25, 2025 3 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.48%       We recently published a list of 10 AI News You Should Definitely Take a Look At. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news you should definitely take a look at. New AI Initiative Promises Jobs and Infrastructure Boost in the U.S. President Trump announced a major investment initiative to advance artificial intelligence in the U.S., involving a joint venture called Stargate with OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and the UAE\u2019s MGX. Initially committing $100 billion, with potential growth of up to $500 billion over four years. The venture will focus on building large data centers, starting in Texas, and creating over 100,000 American jobs. The announcement was made at the White House, with SoftBank\u2019s Masayoshi Son, OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman, and Larry Ellison in attendance.  The launch of the AI initiative has sparked a public dispute among major tech leaders. Elon Musk criticized OpenAI\u2019s partnership with the project, questioned the financial backing of companies like SoftBank, and claimed they lack the necessary funds. Sam Altman of OpenAI quickly refuted Musk\u2019s claim in a post on X. READ ALSO:\u00a010 AI News You Should Not Miss\u00a0and\u00a010 AI News Making Waves on Wall Street. Additionally, CNBC reported that President Trump announced plans to fast-track the construction of power plants for artificial intelligence by using an emergency declaration. The plants would be exempt from climate targets and could use any fuel, including coal for backup power. The aim is to quickly meet the increasing energy demands of AI data centers, as power consumption is expected to rise significantly. While tech companies have focused on renewable energy, natural gas is expected to play a crucial role due to its reliability and faster deployment. Trump emphasized that the plants would connect directly to data centers, bypassing the traditional power grid.  For this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).   Story Continues   NVIDIA Corporation: Fueling AI's Growth with Revolutionary Platforms  NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) focuses on AI-powered solutions, providing platforms for data centers, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and cloud services.Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expected to play a central role in Project Stargate, a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative announced by the Trump administration, which will span the next four years. According to UBS, the project will heavily rely on Nvidia\u2019s compute and hardware solutions, potentially extending its growth trajectory beyond 2026. Key partners in the initiative include Microsoft, ARM, Oracle, Softbank, and OpenAI, with Nvidia positioned as a critical technology provider. While addressing concerns about peak compute demand, the project highlights Nvidia\u2019s strategic importance in AI infrastructure. UBS maintains a Buy rating on Nvidia with a $185 price target.Overall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of AI news you should definitely take a look at. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Upgrade Now          Will NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Dominate the AI Market with DeepSeek\u2019s Breakthroughs?      Affan Mir   January 29, 2025 4 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.43%       We recently published a list of 10 AI News You Should Take a Look At. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news you should take a look at. DeepSeek has gained attention for creating a high-performing model, R1, at a fraction of the typical cost. Its efficient use of resources and open-source approach has prompted discussions on the traditional reliance on expensive AI chips. Despite concerns about reduced demand for high-end semiconductors, experts argue that the growing need for compute power, driven by large-scale AI models, continues to fuel demand for advanced AI infrastructure. Growing AI Competition Promises Exciting Advancements and Opportunities As AI continues to evolve, new advancements are pushing the boundaries of performance, cost-efficiency, and accessibility, creating a dynamic landscape for both established players and new competitors. Bernstein analyst Peter Weed highlighted DeepSeek\u2019s potential to drive AI adoption by offering cost-efficient inferencing, which could lead to increased demand.  While some speculate on the impact on AI infrastructure vendors, the firm suggested that software vendors providing data infrastructure, identity management, observability, and communications may be the key beneficiaries. Lower AI model costs could accelerate enterprise adoption, moving projects from proof-of-concept to production faster, and benefit a range of software vendors that have previously lagged behind hyperscalers in growth. Weed noted: \u201cIf Deepseek puts pressure to further bring down model cost, it may not only increase the number of viable projects but also may accelerate the pace of new projects going into production. This would benefit all the software consumption infrastructure above the hyperscaler level.\u201d  Additionally, in a post on X, Sam Altman acknowledged DeepSeek\u2019s R1 model as impressive, especially for its cost, but emphasized that OpenAI plans to release superior models. He expressed excitement about the competition and reiterated OpenAI\u2019s focus on its research roadmap, highlighting the growing demand for AI and the importance of increased computing power to achieve advancements, including AGI. For this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.  Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).   Story Continues   NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Driving AGI Advancements with Test Time Scaling and DeepSeek  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) focuses on AI-powered solutions, providing platforms for data centers, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and cloud computing.On January 27, Nvidia posted its comments about Deepseek. It highlighted it as a prime example of Test Time Scaling, showcasing how new models can be developed using existing resources while requiring extensive GPUs and high-performance networking for inference. The firm said:\u201cDeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek\u2019s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.\u201d Additionally, Cantor Fitzgerald views DeepSeek\u2019s V3 LLM release as highly positive for compute demand and NVIDIA, dismissing concerns about peak GPU spending. It believes the push toward AGI and Jevons Paradox will drive increased demand for compute and suggests NVDA shares are a buy during any weakness.Overall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of AI news you should take a look at. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Investors Heavily Search NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Here is What You Need to Know         Zacks Equity Research   January 21, 2025 5 min read           In This Article:  NVDA         Nvidia (NVDA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term. Over the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned -1.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has gained 2.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Revisions to Earnings Estimates Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.  For the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.84 per share, indicating a change of +61.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.94 points to a change of +126.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.21 indicates a change of +43.1% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.1%. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).   Story Continues The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $37.72 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +70.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $129.02 billion and $191.84 billion estimates indicate +111.8% and +48.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNvidia reported revenues of $35.08 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +93.6%. EPS of $0.81 for the same period compares with $0.40 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.33 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.27%. The EPS surprise was +8%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As per SAP, the changes occurring in 2025 revolve around autonomous AI agents, specialized AI models, user interface design, and enterprise adoption patterns. On 13th\u00a0January, an AI behemoth highlighted that the first Trump Administration focused on America\u2019s strength and success in AI, boosting an environment where the broader US industry can compete.  Therefore, mainstream AI is now a critical part of every new application, which helps fuel economic growth, promote US interests, and make sure that America can sustain its leadership in cutting-edge technology. On a related note, Trump announced billions of dollars in private sector investment focused on building AI infrastructure in the country. Trump Announces $500 Billion Investment for AI Infrastructure US President Donald Trump announced a private sector investment of up to $500 billion focused on financing infrastructure for AI, targeting to outperform rival nations in the business-critical technology. Mr. President went on to add that ChatGPT\u2019s creator OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle are discussing a JV called Stargate, which is expected to build data centers and create over 100,000 jobs in the US. Notably, these companies, together with several other equity backers of Stargate, decided to commit $100 billion for immediate deployment. The remaining investment is expected to take place over the upcoming 4 years.  As per Trump, this is the largest AI infrastructure project in history. Also, Stargate is expected to build the physical and virtual infrastructure which will focus on powering the next generation of AI, including data centers around the US.

AI Rally to Continue in 2025, Says UBS As per UBS, the AI rally has aided in driving 2 straight years of healthy returns for the NASDAQ Composite, which also includes a 28% rally last year. The Mag 7 group of technology stocks drove more than half of the S&P 500\u2019s gains in 2024. In the previous year, continued upward revisions in AI capex from the Big 4 tech giants supported keeping the AI rally on track. UBS expects the upward revisions to continue over the near term.   Story Continues Even though AI revenues might again lag behind capex in 2025, UBS expects that AI monetization will improve sharply in 2025. The AI adoption continues to accelerate across industries and is well-placed to broaden in 2025. Also, the arrival of more clearly useful AI agents is expected to further support return on investment (ROI).Our MethodologyTo list the 12 Most Promising AI Stocks According to Wall Street Analysts, we conducted extensive research and scanned through several online rankings.

Also, it announced a partnership with Arbe Robotics, focused on enhancing automotive free space mapping and Al-driven capabilities. The company will integrate Arbe\u2019s ultra-high-definition radar technology with its in-vehicle computing platform.Notably, JPMorgan Chase & Co. upped its price objective on shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) from $155.00 to $170.00, giving an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating on 21st\u00a0November. Infuse Asset Management, an investment management company, released its Q4 2024 investor letter.\u00a0Here\u00a0is what the fund said:\u201cWe do still own some\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) as the forward multiple isn\u2019t egregious and it powers over 90% of AI workloads. This company is only becoming increasingly important though the hyperscalers are actively trying to save money through their own ASIC programs. The moat CUDA provides has been underestimated time and time again. While I don\u2019t think Nvidia has quite the upside as some of the other companies in the portfolio, it has a product that the best companies in the world literally can\u2019t get enough of.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 10th on our list of most promising AI stocks according to Wall Street analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Cheap AI Stock to Buy in 2025?      Ali Hassan   January 29, 2025 4 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.34%       We recently published a list of 12 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other cheap AI stocks to buy in 2025. Artificial Intelligence (AI) was a buzzword around Wall Street for most of 2024. AI has shown immense promise but comes with significant risks. Big AI players are dominating the broader market, but there will be opportunities for other companies to explore as the AI market continues to expand. For instance, the new administration is keen on technological advancement, and recently, President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion AI initiative, a joint venture known as Stargate between OpenAI, Softbank, and Oracle.  However, DeepSeek\u2019s introduction shocked the U.S. companies after it released a new AI model, a much better alternative to GPT-4. DeepSeek claims to have designed the AI model in just two months and at around under $6 million using Nvidia\u2019s less-advanced H800 chips, as reported by Reuters on January 27. Since the news broke out, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have plunged over 16%, wiping away $600 billion in market capitalization, the biggest one-day loss in U.S. history. Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead, speaking to Market Domination, shared his views on DeepSeek. Moorhead was impressed by the efficiency of DeepSeek\u2019s AI. He pointed out that the Chinese have used different techniques compared to American developers, where they were able to parse or train maybe 5% of the data, which is a 95% reduction. However, Moorhead also addressed the U.S. market drop as an \u201coverreaction.\u201d\u00a0\u201cI think the market overall should be going crazy because [this is the] uplift of what we were looking for [from AI],\u201d\u00a0said Moorhead. He added that the investors\u2019 focus should be on the progress in inference. It might be a good time to invest in AI stocks, especially cheap AI stocks during the market\u2019s overreaction. Our Methodology To determine the list of cheap AI stocks, we went through various news articles and stock analyses. We shortlisted the AI stocks with the minimum analyst upside of 30%, as of January 27. Cheap, in the context of this article, means stocks that Wall Street analysts believe are undervalued and will surge to higher share prices. We have ranked the cheap AI stocks to buy based on their popularity among hedge funds, as of Q3 2024, in ascending order. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).   Story Continues   Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Cheap AI Stock to Buy in 2025?  NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Analyst Upside (as of January 27): 47.78%No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions offering platforms and chips for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services. Chinese AI startup, DeepSeek, sent shockwaves to the U.S. stock market after revealing its AI tool that is potentially more efficient than the GPT-4-level model, designed at a fraction of the cost of Open AI\u2019s model. NVDA shares plunged over 16% following the announcement of DeepSeek\u2019s AI model on January 27. Is it game over for NVDA?Analysts see this as an opportunity to buy NVDA shares as they believe the market has overreacted to the Chinese AI model. Bofa analysts believe this worry is overstated. Whereas, Wedbush analyst, Dan Ives called it a buying opportunity for American tech stocks. He wrote in a post on X:\u201cDeepSeek is a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases\u2026launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.\u00a0 It\u2019s about AGI for Big Tech and DeepSeek\u2019s noise. Also, no US tech using this tech. Buying oppy.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of cheap AI stocks to buy in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

AI Boosts Data Center Market to New Heights According to Synergy Research Group, data center M&A activity set a new record in 2024, with deals totaling $57 billion, compared to the previous high of $52 billion in 2022. While 2023 saw a sharp decline to $26 billion, the rebound in 2024 included two major equity investments in Vantage Data Centers worth $9.2 billion combined. Moreover, equity investments in data center solutions providers, EdgeConneX and DataBank contributed to the rise. Private equity played a dominant role, accounting for 80-90% of deal values since 2021. With $29 billion in pending deals and a $15 billion future pipeline, the trend is expected to continue in 2025, fueled by increasing demand for cloud services, digital platforms, and generative AI.  Moreover, the firm believes that global spending on data center hardware and software in 2024 probably rose by 34%, reaching a record $282 billion. Public cloud infrastructure spending, up 48%, now makes up 55% of the market, due to the increasing demand for GPUs to support generative AI workloads. Enterprise spending also saw a significant 21% increase after years of marginal growth. According to Synergy, public cloud spending is expected to grow further and could reach 65% of the market within five years.

The firm expects 2025 to continue to be shaped by the divide between companies benefiting from AI and those that are not. Barclays remains selective in its AI stock picks, favoring those with proprietary serializer/deserializer technology, while being less optimistic about cyclical semiconductors, analog, PC, and handset stocks, noting that recoveries in these areas may take longer to materialize.Overall NVDA ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks that investors probably missed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Bull of the Day: NVIDIA (NVDA)         Kevin Cook   January 30, 2025 5 min read        2   In This Article:  NVDA       VRT         Is NVIDIA (NVDA) a buy in the $120s or has the DeepSeek invasion delivered a serious re-rating to its growth and valuation?The biggest lever to answer this question revolves around whether the world suddenly needs less (and less-expensive) GPUs to power their LLM (large language models) and HPC (high-performance computing) models.As I write this on Wednesday afternoon, we await earnings calls from two of NVIDIA's biggest customers, Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META), that may indicate if their capex plans are being downsized after the suddenly cheaper, better, faster chatterbot from China.\u00a0The Data Will Now SpeakEven though I remain a long-term NVDA bull and added shares near $120 on Monday when it fell 17%, the stage is set for a potential near-term peak in its growth trajectory.Coming into the week, the stock was still a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) because the consensus EPS estimate for the coming fiscal year (begins February) had moved up 11.7% to $4.21 since the company's last earnings report in November.\u00a0The full-year topline consensus is for $192 billion. I was projecting that number would be over $200B by now. So $192B and $4.21, representing 49% and 43% growth, will be the numbers to watch today. If they get hit, so too might the stock.So far, I haven't heard even a single downgrade or negative estimate revision. But, again, the analysts have been waiting for the Microsoft and Meta conference calls (last night) to deliver their model adjustments this morning.I'll tell you this, the analysts are going to be chomping at the bit to get answers. This won't be your average quarterly call and I wouldn't want to be Microsoft or Meta brass having to explain and justify their respective AI capex budgets of $80 billion and $65 billion, respectively.  Tesla Too And as if that wasn't enough excitement today, Tesla (TSLA) will also have reported their quarter on Wednesday. Telsa and Musk are very big players in the GPU-AI market for self-driving cars and for his own chatterbot Grok. Elon Musk's new xAI data center in Memphis achieved something remarkable when his team assembled 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs in only a matter of months.Nicknamed \"Colossus,\" it was considereed in September the largest and one of the most powerful supercomputers in existence. I don't think Musk's appetite for GPUs will slow down much in the next five years.My NVDA Bull CaseHere's what I told my TAZR Trader members on Tuesday night...I have read a dozen different experts on AI and the DeepSeek invasion in the past 72 hours and sometimes my head was just spinning.\u00a0Because often they don't even agree with each other on the impacts.That's when I just go back to my thesis on NVIDIA: they dominate the technology stack that enterprises want, and the next stacks they don't even know they need yet (Isaac-Gr00t Robotics, Omniverse, Cosmos, NIMS, DIGITS, etc).(If you watched Jensen Huang's keynote at CES earlier this month, you got a clinic on all the latest innovations in these platforms.)I also told my group that the DeepSeek invasion has put the \"AI arms race\" back in the spotlight....Even bigger picture: forget the Jevon's Paradox stuff (lower cost + higher efficiency = more demand) for a moment and think about who is competing here.\u00a0It's USA vs. China, just like I made content around in 2019 after reading Kai-Fu Lee's book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order.(end of notes to TAZR members)So when I put together the innovative platforms coming from NVIDIA with the fact that the AI \"arms race\" is back in focus, I think NVIDIA sales estimates will not be revised lower.To round out my view, on Tuesday I also bought Vertiv (VRT), a high-growth provider of datacenter infrastructure, when the stock was down over 30% off its highs. I did this because I don't think the 2-4 year plans to build datacenters are being scrapped.Finally, part of my NVDA bull thesis after ChatGPT took the world by storm in early 2023 was that every large corporation would want to build their own internal LLMs.China definitely delivered a wake-up call to hyperscalers and LLM builders about cost efficiency. But I don't think it changes their plans to build on the model that Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta have established just because China tweaked an existing model that probably cost 100X what they claimed.Here's what I posted on X about my \"50,000 foot view\" of the panic...In May 2023 when Jensen revealed at Computex that GOOG, MSFT, and META were already in line for the coming GH200-DGX systems, I said \"Here we go to $200 billion in sales!\"Why? Because the other 1996 corps in Global 2000 would want to build their own INTERNAL LLMs. Same story today.What I mean is that no major corp wants to have their proprietary data in the hands of any outside entity. They want their own Magic Kingdoms of OZ to mine and model what only they know to serve employees and customers.The story might change at the margins. But the big builders (MSFT, AMZN, META, GOOG, Tesla, OpenAI, Oracle) are nowhere near done with their grand datacenter plans because their visions of serving the autonomous vehicle, robotics, energy, biotechnology, and custom AI markets are bigger than most of us can imagine.\u00a0They will pay for the NVIDIA GPU-DGX systems and clusters now because they see the ROI as massive in five years.\u00a0By the time you are reading this on Thursday morning, we should know a lot more as analysts react to MSFT and META.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NVDA) Project DIGITS: Empowering AI Research with a Personal Supercomputer      Affan Mir   January 11, 2025 4 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.45%       We recently published a list of 13 AI News and Ratings You Probably Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks. As per a CNBC report, in 2025, significant changes are expected in global AI regulation, especially in the U.S., the EU, and the UK. President-elect Donald Trump, who is supported by business leaders like Elon Musk, may influence AI policies, with Musk\u2019s experience in AI raising expectations for U.S. advancements. In Europe, the EU\u2019s AI Act has introduced comprehensive regulations, but tensions with U.S. tech companies are still there over its strict measures.  Meanwhile, the U.K. is considering a more flexible, principles-based approach, especially regarding the use of copyrighted content for AI training. Additionally, U.S. and China relations could affect global AI development, with both countries competing for AI dominance and potentially creating safety regulations to prevent uncontrolled AI advancements.

Navigating the AI Investment Landscape AI is driving a major transformation in technology as significant investments are being funneled into infrastructure, data centers, and the AI value chain. Companies are rapidly building out AI infrastructure, with an increasing focus on supply chain components beyond just semiconductors, which highlight potential profits in sectors like memory, cooling, and fiber optics. Jon McNeill, co-founder of Vistashares, discussed the impact of AI infrastructure on investment opportunities in an interview with Romaine Bostick and Scarlet Fu of Bloomberg. He explained that while AI\u2019s impact on data centers is often discussed in terms of semiconductors, the actual supply chain involves different elements, such as memory, cooling, and fiber optics. McNeill emphasized the potential for profits in the AI supply chain, especially for investors looking beyond the major producers to lesser-known companies.  He also addressed the risks of international investments and noted that while the U.S. dominates the AI sector, Asia is rapidly building its own AI infrastructure. McNeill highlighted the growing value of AI applications in autonomous driving and robotics, which could drive significant economic growth. He pointed to large investments in data centers, such as AWS\u2019 $11 billion investment in Georgia, as signs that this growth will continue, with the major tech companies leading the charge in the AI race.

Upgrade Now          Why NVDA Is Sinking Today      Larry Ramer   January 30, 2025 2 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.38%     BABA   +0.12%      Nvidia (NVDA) is falling 4% after Alibaba (BABA) reported today that its new AI model performs better than DeepSeek's offering. The latter Chinese start-up's model, which reportedly performed better than OpenAI's product in a number of areas, cost only about $5.6 million to train, according to DeepSeek. BABA's news may be renewing fears, first ignited by DeepSeek, that Chinese companies have discovered ways to launch highly advanced AI models without using NVDA's recently made, very expensive chips.   Jim Cramer Recommends Buying Nvidia (NVDA) on \u2018Inevitable Pullbacks\u2019   More Information About BABA's AI Model Called Qwen 2.5-Max, BABA's model \"demonstrated significant advantages across most benchmarks\" relative to Meta's (META) Llama-3.1-405B, BABA reported. Llama-3.1-405B was launched last July. BABA added that \"Qwen2.5-Max outperforms DeepSeek V3 in (a number of) benchmarks.\"  Since the U.S. government has heavily restricted China's access to America's most advanced AI chips, the Street may fear that BABA created Qwen 2.5-Max using relatively old, cheap GPUs from Nvidia. As a result, Alibaba's announcement could be renewing worries about NVDA's outlook that were first sparked by DeepSeek earlier this week. The Price Action of NVDA In the last month, the shares have sunk 8%, while they are down 11.5% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The decline was triggered by the growing popularity of a cost-effective artificial intelligence model from Chinese startup DeepSeek. However, retail investors quickly swooped in to buy the dip as they purchased over $920 million worth of Nvidia shares across Monday and Tuesday, according to data from VandaTrack.Invest with Confidence: Follow TipRanks' Top Wall Street Analysts to uncover their success rate and average return. Join thousands of data-driven investors \u2013 Build your Smart Portfolio for personalized insights. \nIn addition to the optimism from retail investors, Wall Street strategists also remain bullish on Nvidia\u2019s long-term prospects. Indeed, Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee believes the recent decline presents a \u201cbuy-the-dip\u201d opportunity, while Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya sees the recent drawdown as an \u201cenhanced buying opportunity.\u201d In addition, Bernstein\u2019s Stacy Rasgon told Yahoo Finance that the DeepSeek-driven sell-off was \u201coverblown\u201d and doesn\u2019t spell \u201cdoomsday for AI infrastructure.\u201d It is also worth noting that both Arya and Rasgon are five-star analysts.\nThe reason why DeepSeek\u2019s AI model caused panic among investors was due to its potential to disrupt Nvidia\u2019s dominance in the AI chip market. DeepSeek\u2019s model uses cheaper chips and less data, which could challenge Nvidia\u2019s pricing power and market share. However, analysts remain confident in Nvidia\u2019s ability to adapt and maintain its leadership position in the AI chip market.\nIs NVDA a Good Stock to Buy?\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts remain bullish on NVDA stock, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 37 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. After\u00a0a 94% rally in its share price\u00a0over the past year, the\u00a0average NVDA price target of $178.32 per share\u00a0implies an upside potential of 46.1% from current levels.\n\nSee more NVDA analyst ratings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\n\n\n FACEBOOK\n\n\n\n\n TWITTER\n\n\n\n\n EMAIL\n\n\n\n\n COPY LINK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNVIDIA NewsMORE  \n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia acquires synthetic data provider Gretel - reportSeeking Alpha 2h \n\n\n\nWhy one analyst and Nvidia skeptic says the chipmaker might not grow at all next yearBusiness Insider 3h \n\n\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) Yield Shares Purpose ETF - ETF Units declares $0.75 dividendSeeking Alpha 4h \n\n\n\nS&P 500 buybacks increase 7.4% Q/Q in fourth quarter, Apple continues to leadSeeking Alpha 6h \n\n\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Gets a Buy from Stifel NicolausTipRanks 7h \n\n\n\nNvidia (NVDA): New Buy Recommendation for This Technology GiantTipRanks 7h \n\n\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) is Busy in Beijing Touting Tech Prowess to Chinese InnovatorsTipRanks 8h \n\n\n\nNvidia remains 1-2 steps ahead of competitors, says JPMorganTipRanks 8h \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tStart Trading Futures\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n\n\n\n\nNVDA\n\n\n\n117.92\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2.49 (2.16%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t01:55:04 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time NVDA charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFind News\n\t\t\t\tNews\n\n\n\n\n\nGO\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n            See also:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                - Explore more categories\n            \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

Upgrade Now          META Stock Gains, NVDA Remains a Strong Bet After the DeepSeek Storm         Nilanjan Banerjee   January 31, 2025 3 min read        1   In This Article:  META       NVDA         A new artificial intelligence (AI) breakthrough by the China-based company DeepSeek has raised questions about the future of AI investments. Their model, R1, rivals top AI systems while being more cost-effective, which caused NVIDIA\u2019s NVDA stock to plummet. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms Inc. META, which embraces open-source AI, seems to benefit from this innovation. Now, the billion-dollar question is whether META presents a more promising short-term investment than NVDA and explores the potential for the latter\u2019s recovery in the long term. DeepSeek Frenzy & its Initial Market Impact Recently, DeepSeek became the most downloaded free app on Apple\u2019s AAPL U.S. store. This caused a big shake-up in the stock market. Investors panicked, thinking DeepSeek\u2019s AI technology could compete with OpenAI (creator of ChatGPT) while using less computing power. This scared people because companies like NVIDIA make expensive chips used for AI, and if a competitor can do the same with cheaper tech, it could hurt NVDA\u2019s business. Because of this fear, the stock price of technology and AI-related stocks like NVIDIA declined drastically. Meta Investors Held Their Nerve Meta supports open-source AI, signifying that Meta shares its AI tools and technologies with the public for free. Other companies or developers can use these tools to build their own AI systems or improve existing ones. This is beneficial because it encourages innovation\u2014more people working on AI means faster improvements and new ideas that can push the technology forward.  Now, DeepSeek could refer to another company or project that\u2019s innovating in the AI space. When DeepSeek comes up with something new or useful in AI, Meta can benefit from that because it\u2019s open-source. So, if DeepSeek makes a breakthrough in AI, Meta can use that to improve its own products or AI. It's like sharing the tools for a project, and everyone can help make it better together. This strategy enables Meta to maintain its edge in the rapidly evolving AI landscape, driving its stock upward. Is NVDA in Trouble? While DeepSeek claims to have developed a cost-efficient AI model, its performance doesn\u2019t match that of its U.S. counterparts. DeepSeek's AI struggles with basic tasks and delivers inconsistent results when handling complex data, making it less accurate and reliable than the cutting-edge models developed by leading tech firms. Moreover, creating a truly competitive AI system isn\u2019t just about using cheaper chips. It requires massive infrastructure, including data centers, high-performance servers and specialized technologies like cooling systems and software optimizations. Additionally, significant research and development investments are necessary to refine and scale AI capabilities. Without these critical components, an AI model may appear impressive on the surface but lack the depth and robustness needed for widespread adoption.   Story Continues In the end, many analysts maintained that the fall in NVDA's stock price was an overreaction. In reality, NVDA's technology remains essential for AI development, and the demand for its chips is likely to increase.NVDA or META: Which is the Better Stock?Meta and NVDA are both big players in AI, but Meta, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), may have a short-term advantage due to its open-source strategy. NVDA, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) despite the recent hit, is expected to remain strong in the long run.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Dominating the AI Hardware Market with Unmatched Growth Opportunities      Bob Karr   January 17, 2025 5 min read        1   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.45%       We recently compiled a list of the 20 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2025 revolved around AI. If not, it\u2019s all that exhibitors could show. Talking about the highlight of the show, it was undoubtedly the keynote from Jensen Huang. The keynote included new products to advance gaming, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and agentic AI. Huang kicked off his talk by reflecting on the company\u2019s 3-decade journey. Later on, he highlighted several significant advancements. Takeaways From CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s Keynote at CES 2025 As per Huang, AI has been advancing at an \u2018incredible pace.\u2019 It started with perception AI, meaning understanding images, words, and sounds. Then it came to generative AI, meaning creating text, images, and sound. And now, it\u2019s the era of physical AI, meaning AI that can proceed, reason, plan, and act.\u00a0The AI giant introduced GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, which are powered by Blackwell architecture. These GPUs provide significant improvements in AI-driven rendering, enhancing gaming and creative workflows. Furthermore, Huang unveiled \u201cCosmos,\u201d which is a suite of foundational AI models capable of generating photorealistic video. The models have been designed in such a way that train robots and automated systems more efficiently, further advancing robotics and autonomous technologies. The company and its partners have rolled out AI Blueprints for agentic AI, which includes PDF-to-podcast for efficient research and video search and summarization for assessing significant quantities of video and images \u2014 allowing developers to build, test, and run AI agents anywhere. Agentic AI- Road Ahead in 2025 TechInformed interviewed experts from leading technology companies to explore predictions about Agentic AI. As per Steven Webb, UK chief technology and innovation officer, Capgemini, 2025 will see wider adoption of small language models (SLMs) and AI agents as an era of Agentic AI is fast approaching. Using multiple SLMs throughout a toolchain is expected to play a critical role in the AI evolution. This will include going beyond the already familiar LLMs such as GPT.  Furthermore, Alan Jacobson (chief data and analytics officer at Alteryx) believes that 2025 will see the rise of Gen AI agents used to solve problems. This is an approach that is made possible by reducing costs and improving the performance and speed of LLMs. Frameworks for orchestrating Agentic AI work are expected to emerge. Notably, a large percentage of use cases are expected to start to employ this approach.   Story Continues Our MethodologyTo list the 20 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we conducted extensive research and sifted through numerous online rankings. After getting an initial list of 25-30 stocks, we chose the ones that were popular among hedge funds and that analysts saw upside to. Finally, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of 14th January. We also mentioned hedge fund sentiments around each stock, as of Q3 2024.At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) The Stock That Will Go to the Moon According to Reddit?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193Average Upside Potential: 31.0%NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is well-placed to benefit from the heightened investment in AI technology. Data centers require GPUs for AI training and inferencing. The company expects a $1 trillion opportunity for its business, stemming from the fact that data centers have been upgrading legacy computing systems to AI-optimized hardware. Mizuho upped its price target for NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) from $140 to $165, maintaining an \"Outperform\" rating.Mizuho analyst, Vijay Rakesh, believes that the company\u2019s GB200 NVL72 and GB300 are expected to provide significant support. The analyst also highlighted that NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s entry into the sovereign market is expected to expand in 2025, potentially making a contribution of ~$10 billion, or roughly 9-11% of the company\u2019s data center revenue. McKinsey believes that global demand for data center capacity is expected to rise at an annual rate of between 19% - 22% from 2023 to 2030 to reach an annual demand of 171 to 219 gigawatts (GW). This is expected to significantly benefit NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA), which controls 70% - 95% of the advanced AI chip market share as per\u00a0 Mizuho Securities.Manole Capital Management, an investment management company, focused on covering the Financial and Technology sectors, released its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\u201cAs of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date.\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.\u201d Overall NVDA ranks 12th on our list of the best AI stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than AI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Did Billionaire Chen Tianqiao Dump or Bet on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)?      Usman Kabir   January 22, 2025 4 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.34%     SNDA   -0.63%      We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Chen Tianqiao Dumped 3 Tech Stocks and Betting On These 4 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0 stands against the other stocks. Chen Tianqiao is a prominent Chinese entrepreneur and investor, best known for founding Shanda Interactive Entertainment, one of the leading internet and gaming companies in China during the early 2000s. Tianqiao also heads Shanda Asset Management, a hedge fund that managed more than $1.7 billion in 13F securities at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Through his innovative approach to technology and business, Chen has become one of the pioneers of the online gaming industry and a significant figure in the global tech and neuroscience communities.  Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Chen Tianqiao was born in 1973 in the Zhejiang province of China. Raised in a modest family, he excelled academically and earned admission to Fudan University, one of the top institutions in the Asian country, where he studied economics. His early years were marked by a strong interest in technology and business, which would later define his career. After graduation, Chen began his career in the investment arm of the state-owned conglomerate Jinjiang Group, where he honed his business and financial skills. However, his entrepreneurial ambitions led him to leave the corporate world and pursue opportunities in the burgeoning internet industry. In 1999, Chen co-founded Shanda Interactive Entertainment with his wife, Luo Qianqian, and younger brother, Chen Danian. The company initially focused on developing and distributing multimedia content but quickly shifted its focus to online gaming. In 2004, Shanda became the first Chinese online gaming company to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange, raising $152 million. By the mid-2000s, Chen was one of the richest individuals in China, with Forbes naming him one of the wealthiest self-made billionaires under 40.

Story Continues   Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) High Growth Semiconductor Stock That Is Profitable Heading into 2025?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193\u00a0Shanda Asset Management's Stake: $121.4 millionNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The company's investment potential is driven by following several factors. To begin with, the investors may consider the company\u2019s financial growth as a top factor. As illustrated in the report of the third quarter of 2024, GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per diluted share was 0.78 dollars, up 16% from the previous quarter and up 111% from a year ago. Additionally, the company\u2019s quarterly net income was 19.3 billion dollars, up 16% from the second quarter and up 112% from a year ago. The second most compelling factor that may attract investment is the launch of its project DIGITS, the world\u2019s smallest AI supercomputer capable of running 200B-parameter models. Moreover, the firm has launched the NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform of APIs, SDKs, and services that enable developers to integrate OpenUSD, NVIDIA RTX rendering technologies, and generative AI into existing software tools and simulation workflows for industrial and robotic use cases.Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Billionaire Chen Tianqiao dumped and bet on. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Sparking the surge is the chipmaker's unveiling of its GeForce RTX 50 Series desktop and laptop GPUs \u2014 its most advanced consumer graphics processor units for gamers, creators and developers.\u00a0In a packed Las Vegas arena, Nvidia founder Huang on Monday stood on stage and marveled over the crisp real-time computer graphics displayed on the screen behind him. He watched as a dark-haired woman walked through ornate gilded double doors and took in the rays of light that poured in through stained glass windows.\"The amount of geometry that you saw was absolutely insane,\" Huang told an audience of thousands at CES 2025 Monday night. \"It would have been impossible without artificial intelligence.\" \n\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2025. Huang unveiled advanced AI for training robots and cars, enhanced gaming chips, and Nvidia's first desktop computer.\n\n            \n                Artur Widak/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\n                          \n\n\nHuang said the GPUs, which use the company's next-generation artificial intelligence chip Blackwell, can deliver breakthroughs in AI-driven rendering.\u00a0\"Blackwell, the engine of AI, has arrived for PC gamers, developers and creatives,\" Huang said, adding that Blackwell \"is the most significant computer graphics innovation since we introduced programmable shading 25 years ago.\" Blackwell technology is now in full production, he said.The GeForce RTX 5090 and GeForce RTX 5080 graphics cards will arrive on store shelves on Jan. 30, according to the Nvidia site. The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and GeForce RTX 5070 will be available starting in February.\u00a0\n\n\nBuilding on the tech Nvidia released 25 years ago, the company announced that it would also introduce \"RTX Neural Shaders,\" which use AI to help render game characters in deep detail \u2014 a task that's notoriously tricky because people can easily spot a small error on digital humans.Huang said Nvidia is also introducing a new suite of technologies that enable \"autonomous characters\" to perceive, plan and act like human players. Those characters can help players plan strategies or adapt tactics to challenge players and create more dynamic battles.In addition to Nvidia, tech giants such as AMD, Google and Samsung were at CES 2025 to unveil artificial intelligence tools aimed at helping both content creators and consumers alike in their quest for entertainment. Nvidia and other AI stocks keep climbing even as criticism rises that their stock prices have already shot too high, too fast. Despite worries about a potential bubble, the industry continues to talk up its potential.\n\n\n\nMore from CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Teslas in Las Vegas set on fire in \"targeted attack,\" police say\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Hundreds of actors urging government not to loosen copyright laws for AI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3 questions to ask about your retirement savings when stocks plunge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Investors are fleeing U.S. stocks as tariff risks loom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Stocks continue to rebound, but Tesla shares head in reverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn:\n          Technology\nJensen Huang\nArtificial Intelligence\nLas Vegas\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Upgrade Now          Why Nvidia (NVDA) Shares Are Sliding Today      Max Juang   January 30, 2025 3 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.42%         Why Nvidia (NVDA) Shares Are Sliding Today   What Happened? Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 6.9% in the afternoon session after Bloomberg News reported that the Trump administration is considering curbing sales of the company's chips to China following the emergence of the DeepSeek AI model. According to the sources, the restriction might apply to some of Nvidia's cutting-edge chips, including the H20 AI chips. The shares closed the day at $123.81, down 4% from previous close. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free. What The Market Is Telling Us Nvidia\u2019s shares are very volatile and have had 26 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 2 days ago when the stock dropped 13% on the news that stocks heavily tied to the AI market took a hit after Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek released a new large language model (DeepSeek-R1) that ranks competitively on key global benchmarks (coding competitions, math evaluations), uses less advanced semiconductor chips, costs significantly less to build (at $5.5 million - excluding non-compute costs), and has already achieved strong adoption after topping the iPhone App Store for AI apps.  Notably, the company has also open-sourced this model, a move that may make it harder for rivals to justify huge upfront expenditures on hardware, software, and expertise to develop similar systems. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella praised DeepSeek's efforts, calling the new model \"super impressive\" for its open-source design, efficient inference-time computing, and high compute efficiency. \"We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously,\" he added. Nadella's comments suggest that upstarts like DeepSeek could reshape the competitive landscape of AI. DeepSeek's announcement disrupts long-held assumptions in key ways: 1) It undercuts the narrative that bigger budgets and access to top-tier chips are the only ways forward for AI development. 2) By using less advanced hardware, DeepSeek opens the door for innovators who face high chip costs or export restrictions, reaffirming they can still compete. 3.) The model's success questions the growth narrative of chipmakers like Nvidia\u2014whose soaring valuations depend on the demand for cutting-edge, high-performance hardware.   Story Continues Overall, DeepSeek's model demonstrates that AI innovation is no longer a race fueled solely by how much you spend, but rather by how resourceful you can be with what you have.Nvidia is down 11.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $123.19 per share, it is trading 17.6% below its 52-week high of $149.43 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $19,984.Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

Upgrade Now          Why Nvidia Stock Skyrocketed 171.2% in 2024 but Is Losing Ground in 2025      Keith Noonan, The Motley Fool   January 14, 2025 4 min read        2   In This Article:  NVDA       MSFT         Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock posted another year of explosive gains in 2024. The company's share price closed out the year's trading up 171.2%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.   NVDA data by YCharts  Nvidia continued to see very strong demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) for artificial intelligence (AI) last year. The company delivered four quarters of sales and earnings beats, and its valuation also soared in conjunction with bullish coverage from analysts, new growth initiatives, and the company's stock split. Nvidia stock delivers another fantastic performance in 2024 Nvidia continued to command a dominating position in AI processors last year. With tech companies increasing their spending on AI infrastructure, Nvidia delivered another year of strong sales and earnings reports. The company managed to beat the average Wall Street sales and earnings targets with each of the four quarterly reports it published in calendar 2024. The table below breaks down the company's top-line performances compared to the average analyst estimates. Fiscal Quarter Wall Street Consensus Revenue Target Actual Revenue Percentage Beat  Q4 2024$20.62 billion$22.1 billion7.2% Q1 2025$24.65 billion$26.04 billion5.6% Q2 2025$28.7 billion$30.04 billion4.7% Q3 2025$33.16 billion$35.08 billion5.8%  Data sources: Nvidia and CNBC. With the business continuing to post very strong margins, sales beats meant that the company's quarterly reports also arrived with earnings results that came in well ahead of Wall Street's targets. In addition to fundamental performance catalysts, Nvidia stock also got a lift from a stock split last year. The company announced a 10-for-1 stock split on May 22 and immediately saw an uptick in bullish momentum. The company's split was carried out on June 10. While its stock didn't immediately see big gains following the completion of the move, it did see subsequent valuation increases that may have been aided by the split. Why is Nvidia stock losing ground in 2025? Nvidia stock actually saw gains early in 2025 thanks to news from Microsoft about its plans for AI infrastructure spending this year. On Jan. 3, Microsoft published a blog post stating that the company planned to spend roughly $80 billion this year to build out its AI data center capabilities. Nvidia's GPUs are the foundational hardware element powering today's most advanced AI training systems and applications, and it likely stands to be the largest beneficiary of Microsoft's big spending push.   Story Continues But Nvidia stock has subsequently seen pullbacks in conjunction with macroeconomic pressures and geopolitical risk factors. As of this writing, the company's share price is down roughly 1.5% across 2025's trading.On Jan. 10, the Bureau of Labor Statistics published U.S. jobs numbers for December. The report showed that the U.S. economy added 256,000 jobs last month, which came in far ahead of the average forecast for additions of 155,000 jobs in the period. The higher-than-expected jobs growth raised concerns that inflation could be trending higher than investors and economists anticipated. If so, that makes it less likely that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates and create a more favorable backdrop for growth stocks.Nvidia stock is facing another bearish pressure following news that the U.S. will expand its restrictions on the export of advanced AI chips to China and other rival nations. Export bans were already in place that prevented Nvidia's most advanced processors from being sold to China, but it looks like the severity and breadth of limitations is poised to increase significantly in the near term.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Upgrade Now          Should You Forget Nvidia and Buy This Tech Stock Instead?      Anders Bylund, The Motley Fool   January 16, 2025 4 min read           In This Article:  NVDA       GOOG            Everybody knows that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is one of the most popular stocks on the market today. It's not only one of the most valuable stocks with a $3.24 trillion market cap on Jan. 13, but it's also very heavily traded. The daily dollar volume of Nvidia shares moving from one investor to another was about $28 billion in recent weeks. That's more than the total dollar-based trading of Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.  So it's no surprise that a Motley Fool research report finds Nvidia stock in almost every hedge fund managed by a well-known billionaire. Analyzing 16 such funds, 10 of them ranked Nvidia among their 10 largest holdings. But Nvidia wasn't the most popular name in this report. Eleven of these hedge funds listed Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) as a top-10 holding, in a tie with Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms. Alphabet's two stock classes add up to a daily trading volume of $9.2 billion, far behind Nvidia's headline-inspiring ticker. At the same time, Alphabet's stock gained roughly 35% over the last year while Nvidia posted a 145% return. I'm not saying you should forget Nvidia outright, but this might be a good time to lock in some of your profits in that stock and move the resulting cash over to Google's parent company. Here's why. Alphabet's tempting qualities Let's start with Alphabet's tempting qualities. This topic could fill volumes, but I'll keep it short and simple here: You want digital advertising? There may be many options, but none can challenge Google's massive market footprint. This business is not peanuts. It generated $258 billion of top-line revenues and $115 billion in operating profits over the last year. Nvidia's sales stopped at $113 billion over the same period. The company is incredibly flexible. Management renamed it from Google to Alphabet in order to make investors and potential customers more comfortable with products and services that might not be related to the core search-and-advertising business. Now, the company generates 13% of its quarterly sales from Google Cloud services. Another 11% comes from the YouTube video-sharing platform. Alphabet's smaller operations with big long-term potential include medical research, self-driving cars, and high-speed internet services. Alphabet was a leader in artifical intelligence (AI) before it was cool. The DeepMind subsidiary started in 2010, taking early steps toward creating general AI systems. Its AlphaZero chess engine raised eyebrows in 2017, learning the game by playing millions of games against itself and reaching its own conclusions in 24 hours. The resulting system was arguably the best chess computer at the time. The research that led to these headline-worthy highlights (and many more) never stopped. Google and Alphabet must have a plethora of AI systems on tap, and some could have game-changing consequences. The stock is worth $2.3 trillion today, but it still looks affordable. Alphabet's A shares trade at 25.3 times trailing earnings and 6.9 times sales. That's a bargain-basement valuation next to Nvidia's corresponding ratios of 52.5 and 28.8.    Story Continues Why Alphabet is a better buyNvidia's stock will probably build shareholder value in the long run, even from this lofty pricing plateau. But the days of quick and easy gains are probably behind it. The AI boom started a golden age for Nvidia and its investors, but how long will it last and what happens next? I'm not a big fan of narrowly defined business plans like Nvidia's sharp AI focus.On the other hand, Alphabet started out as a one-trick pony named Google but has moved on to wider vistas, exploring a plethora of promising business ideas. That's what I like to see in a portfolio aimed at the long term. And I can't complain about Alphabet's affordable share prices, either.All told, Alphabet's stock is simply a much better buy than Nvidia's right now. I'm not saying you should forget all about Nvidia -- I just don't recommend buying more of these pricey shares in early 2025.Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Among the Best Humane Stocks to Invest in Now?      Mashaid Ahmed   January 25, 2025 6 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.30%       We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Humane Stocks to Invest in Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best humane stocks to invest in now. In recent years, the investment landscape has seen a significant shift towards socially responsible investing strategies. Among these, humane investing has gained considerable traction. Humane investing is a comprehensive socially responsible investing strategy that encompasses several key aspects. Firstly, it involves the reduction of animal products. This can range from food and fashion to pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, focusing on companies that minimize or eliminate the use of animal products. Secondly, it ensures that businesses respect human rights and address any adverse outcomes. This includes fair labor practices, anti-discrimination policies, and ethical supply chain management. Thirdly, it promotes environmental conservation, such as reducing carbon footprints, sustainable sourcing, and waste reduction. Lastly, it involves shareholder activism, where investors engage with companies to improve welfare practices.

On January 24, Morningstar reported that the landscape of sustainable investing is entering a new era of complexity, characterized by a stark divide between the United States and Europe. This shift was precipitated by a series of significant events, including President Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement. The decision underscores a growing divergence in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) priorities, with Europe taking a leading role and the US moving in the opposite direction. Europe has positioned itself as a leader in sustainable investing, with a pledge to achieve \u201cclimate neutrality\u201d by 2050, or net-zero emissions. The European Union has also implemented ambitious mandatory ESG and sustainability reporting requirements, setting a high bar for corporate transparency and responsibility. This regulatory framework not only supports sustainable investing but also creates a fertile ground for asset managers to develop and market ESG-focused products with higher profit margins and a global reach.  Conversely, the US under the Trump administration has taken a different path. Trump\u2019s inaugural speech signaled a pivot toward promoting fossil fuels and scaling back support for renewable energy sources. This shift is reflected in the actions of major financial institutions, such as the world\u2019s six largest banks withdrawing from a major climate coalition, and BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, pulling out of a similar group. This move is seen as a significant setback\u00a0by sustainably-minded investors as\u00a0the financial industry plays a crucial role in financing companies and achieving net-zero emissions targets set by the Paris Agreement.   Story Continues For asset managers, this two-speed world presents both challenges and opportunities. European managers, who operate in a market where sustainability is mainstream, are likely to gain a competitive advantage. They can leverage their expertise in ESG to attract asset owners, such as pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, who are increasingly allocating to ESG-focused strategies. This could lead to a preference for European managers, especially in impact investing, where they can demonstrate greater commitment and expertise.US-based managers, on the other hand, are likely to adopt a more pragmatic approach, aligning their strategies with local market demands and avoiding vocal advocacy for ESG. This \u201cgreenhushing\u201d strategy is necessary to navigate the regulatory and political headwinds in the US while maintaining a global presence, particularly in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.As the demand for ethical and sustainable investment options grows, humane investing provides a compelling pathway to drive positive change while achieving financial growth.  Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Among the Best Humane Stocks to Invest in Now?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.Our MethodologyTo compile our list of the 8 best humane stocks to invest in now, we used environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ETFs to compile a list of 25 companies.

We also used Insider Monkey\u2019s Hedge Fund database as of Q3 2024 to find the number of hedge fund holders for each company. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment.Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) High Growth Semiconductor Stock That Is Profitable?      Bob Karr   January 23, 2025 5 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.42%       We recently published a list of 10 High Growth Semiconductor Stocks That Are Profitable Heading into 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other high growth semiconductor stocks that are profitable. Semiconductors have led industrial advancements and aided key applications such as personal computing, data centers, and cloud computing. As per PwC, Memory ICs were the fastest-growing semiconductor category over the previous 2 decades, with DRAM and HBM standing out.\u00a0The broader DRAM market is supported by cost and scale, while HBM, because of its advanced technological requirements, reflects a high-barrier, closed-loop ecosystem. Global Semiconductor Sales Rose 20.7% YoY in November 2024 The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) announced that global semiconductor sales touched $57.8 billion during November 2024 month, demonstrating 20.7% growth as compared to November 2023 total of $47.9 billion and 1.6% growth as compared to the October 2024 total of $56.9 billion. As per the report published by SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International), the semiconductor industry is expected to begin 18 new fab construction projects\u00a0in 2025. These new projects will include three 200mm and fifteen 300mm facilities. Notably, the majority will begin operations from 2026 \u2013 2027.  In 2025, the Americas and Japan will be the leading regions with 4 projects each. Next, China and Europe & Middle East regions have 3 planned construction projects. Finally, Taiwan has 2 planned projects, with Korea and Southeast Asia having 1 project each for this year. As per SEMI\u2019s President and CEO, investments have been fueling leading-edge and mainstream technologies to cater to dynamic global demands. Gen-AI and high-performance computing continue to fuel advancements in the leading-edge logic and memory segments. However, mainstream nodes have supported crucial automotive, IoT, and power electronics applications.

Semiconductor Capacity to Ramp Up SEMI projects semiconductor capacity to accelerate further, with a 6.6% yearly growth rate to a total of 33.6 million wafers per month (wpm)\u00a0for 2025. This expansion is expected to primarily stem from leading-edge logic technologies in high-performance computing (HPC) applications and higher penetration of generative AI in edge devices. Overall, the broader semiconductor industry continues to focus on building advanced computing capabilities, and responding to the increased computational demands of LLMs.   Story Continues Moving forward, foundry suppliers are expected to be the leaders in purchases of semiconductor equipment. The Foundry segment can increase capacity by 10.9% YoY, increasing from 11.3 million wpm in 2024 to 12.6 million wpm in 2025.Our MethodologyTo list the 10 High Growth Semiconductor Stocks That Are Profitable Heading into 2025, we conducted extensive research and scanned through several online rankings to shortlist companies having ~10% revenue growth over the previous 5 years and TTM net income of at least $400 million. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiments around each stock, as of Q3 2024. Finally, the stocks were ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiments.At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) The Stock That Will Go to the Moon According to Reddit?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)5-year Sales Growth: ~62.43%TTM net income: $63,074 MillionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is a renowned player in the semiconductor business and is known for innovative GPUs and expanding portfolio of products for AI, gaming, and data centers. As per Barclays analyst Tom O\u2019Malley, NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) GPU sales touched ~$100 billion in calendar 2024 and are projected to grow to ~$160 billion in calendar 2025. The analyst further added that custom silicon has just started to become more significant and is expected to grow at a faster compounded rate over the upcoming 3 years (at 55%).Considering the ongoing focus on the AI compute end-market, the analyst remains optimistic about NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s growth prospects. For calendar 2025, the analyst anticipates the company to grow its data-center compute business by ~60% YoY. Therefore, Tom O\u2019Malley reiterated\u00a0an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating and upped his price target to $175 from $160 on the company\u2019s shares.Furthermore, NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s strong position in the AI computing market offers a strong foundation for continued growth. Its comprehensive technology stack, which includes hardware and software solutions, provides a significant advantage in catering to the growing demand for AI infrastructure. Infuse Asset Management, an investment management company, released its Q4 2024 investor letter.\u00a0Here\u00a0is what the fund said:\u201cWe do still own some\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) as the forward multiple isn\u2019t egregious and it powers over 90% of AI workloads. This company is only becoming increasingly important though the hyperscalers are actively trying to save money through their own ASIC programs. The moat CUDA provides has been underestimated time and time again. While I don\u2019t think Nvidia has quite the upside as some of the other companies in the portfolio, it has a product that the best companies in the world literally can\u2019t get enough of.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of high growth semiconductor stocks that are profitable heading into 2025.\u00a0While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia (NVDA) Advances But Underperforms Market: Key Facts         Zacks Equity Research   January 24, 2025 3 min read           In This Article:  NVDA         Nvidia (NVDA) closed the latest trading day at $147.22, indicating a +0.1% change from the previous session's end. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.53%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.93%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.22%. The maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence's shares have seen an increase of 4.89% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.02% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.69%.  The upcoming earnings release of Nvidia will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on February 26, 2025. On that day, Nvidia is projected to report earnings of $0.84 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 61.54%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $37.72 billion, indicating a 70.68% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. NVDA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.94 per share and revenue of $129.02 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +126.15% and +111.78%, respectively. Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Nvidia should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability. Our research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

Engadget published its review of the $2,000 RTX 5090 last week, but if you\u2019re reading this article, chances are you already know if you want to splurge on a 50 series card. The question then is how to buy one. If you're reading this story on or after January 30, the good news is that major retailers, including Best Buy and Newegg, have officially begun selling the first wave of NVIDIA's new GPUs.As for the bad news? If the 50 series launch is anything like the 40 series one before it, expect high demand and limited initial availability; in fact, NVIDIA has warned RTX 5090 and 5080 stock will be constrained. If you\u2019re set on buying an RTX 5070 Ti or 5070 at release, be sure to use the notification feature Best Buy and other retailers offer to have the best chance of securing one of the cards before they all sell out.GeForce RTX 5090 for $2,000: The RTX 5090 is the most expensive consumer GPU NVIDIA has ever released. It\u2019s also one of the most powerful and power-hungry, with the 5090 featuring 21,760 CUDA cores, 32GB of GDDR7 VRAM and a potential total power draw of 575W.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementOf course, as with all of NVIDIA\u2019s new GPUs, raw specs are only half the story. In conjunction with DLSS 4, the entire 50 series is capable of multi-frame generation. With the tech, RTX 50 GPUs can generate up to three additional frames for every frame they render using traditional techniques. DLSS 4 is the reason the 5090 can produce an average of 246 frames per second with full ray tracing in games like Cyberpunk 2077.If you prefer to buy from Newegg or Best Buy, both retailers will stock models from third-party OEMs, including ASUS, Gigabyte, MSI and Zotac.GeForce RTX 5080 for $999: The RTX 5080 features 10,752 CUDA cores and 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM, with a memory bandwidth of 960GB/sec. Like the 5090, you get the benefit of DLSS 4 multi-frame generation. Moreover, total power draw is more modest at 360W, meaning you probably won\u2019t need a 1,000W PSU to power the 5080. Early reviews of the 5080 have been mixed, but that hasn't stopped people from buying the new high-end card.Again, both Newegg and Best Buy will stock third-party options. For a Founders Edition model, your best bets are NVIDIA and Best Buy.GeForce RTX 5070 Ti for $749. If I had to guess, the 5070 Ti is probably the model with the most interest from people who want to buy a 50 series card. That\u2019s because it features 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM compared to the 5070\u2019s 12GB. An extra 4GB of VRAM might not seem like much, but it will likely translate to the 5070 Ti being a much better purchase over the long run. Modern AAA games use a lot of VRAM, so much so that 8GB GPUs like the RTX 3070 are starting to show their age.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementUnfortunately, the 5070 Ti is the one model NVIDIA won't offer a Founders Edition version of, so finding one to buy may be tricky. Your best bet here is likely to be B&H. The retailer is showing a few 5070 Ti models on its website, though you'll need to wait until February for those to arrive.GeForce RTX 5070 for $549: At launch, the RTX 5070 will be NVIDIA\u2019s most affordable 50 series GPU. It\u2019s also the GPU NVIDIA claims is as fast as the RTX 4090. Of course, that\u2019s with DLSS 4 enabled. If you\u2019re interested in the 5070, I strongly advise waiting for reviews to come out before you commit to buying one. As mentioned, with only 12GB of VRAM, the 5070 could quickly become a bottleneck to your system.Update 1/29/25 1:50PM ET: As one may have predicted, it seems like it will be difficult to get your hands on one of NVIDIA\u2019s new graphics cards. The company itself stated publicly that it \u201cexpect significant demand for the GeForce RTX 5090 and 5080 and believes stock-outs may happen.\u201d It\u2019s possible that limited availability, or widespread stock-outs, could affect customers worldwide. It's reported that some countries, like Korea, won't see shipments until mid-February.Update 1/30/25 10:10AM ET: We updated this piece with more information about availability now that some of the cards are officially up for sale.Latest StoriesEngadgetThe EU's new charges against Google could lead to at least $35 billion in finesIt also ordered Apple to provide greater compatibility with third-party devices like smartwatches and headphones.EngadgetApple's first custom designed modem did surprisingly well in benchmarksOokla, the company behind Speedtest, ran the iPhone 16e\u2019s modem through its paces.

Within the next decade, a trillion-dollar-plus data center business is poised for transformation, powered by what we refer to as\u00a0extreme parallel computing, or EPC\u00a0\u2014 or as some prefer to call it, accelerated computing. Though artificial intelligence is the primary accelerant, the effects ripple across the entire technology stack.\nNvidia Corp. sits in the vanguard of this shift, forging an end-to-end platform that integrates hardware, software, systems engineering and a massive ecosystem. Our view is that Nvidia has a 10- to 20-year runway to drive this transformation, but the market forces at play are much larger than a single player. This new paradigm is about reimagining compute from the ground up: from the chip level to data center equipment, to distributed computing at scale, data and applications stacks and emerging robotics at the edge.\nIn this Breaking Analysis, we explore how extreme parallel computing is reshaping the tech landscape, the performance of the major semiconductor players, the competition Nvidia faces, the depth of its moat, and how its software stack cements its leadership. We will also address a recent development from CES \u2014 the arrival of so-called \u201cAI PCs\u201d \u2014 with data from Enterprise Technology Research. We\u2019ll then look at how the data center market could reach $1.7 trillion by 2035. Finally, we will discuss both the upside potential and the risks that threaten this positive scenario.\n\n\n\n\nOptimizing the technology stack for extreme parallel computing\nOur research indicates that every layer of the technology stack \u2014 from compute to storage to networking to the software layers \u2014 will be re-architected for AI-driven workloads and extreme parallelism. We believe the transition from general-purpose, x86, central processing units toward distributed clusters of graphics processing units and specialized accelerators is happening even faster than many anticipated. What follows is our brief assessment of several layers of the data center tech stack and the implications of EPC.\n\n\n\nCompute\nFor more than three decades, x86 architectures dominated computing. Today, general-purpose processing is giving way to specialized accelerators. GPUs are the heart of this change. AI workloads such as large language models, natural language processing, advanced analytics and real-time inference demand massive concurrency.\n\nExtreme parallelism:\u00a0Traditional multicore scaling has hit diminishing returns. By contrast, a single GPU can contain thousands of cores. Even if a GPU is more expensive at the packaged level, on a\u00a0per-unit-of-compute\u00a0basis it can be far cheaper, given its massively parallel design.\nAI at scale:\u00a0Highly parallel processors require advanced system design. Large GPU clusters share high-bandwidth memory or HBM, and require fast interconnects (such as InfiniBand or ultra-fast Ethernet). This synergy among GPUs, high-speed networking and specialized software is enabling new classes of workloads.\n\nStorage\nWhile storage is sometimes overlooked in AI conversations, data is the fuel that drives neural networks. We believe AI demands advanced, high-performance storage solutions:\n\nAnticipatory data staging:\u00a0Next-generation data systems anticipate which data will be requested by a model, ensuring that data resides near the processors ahead of time to reduce latency and address physical limits as much as possible.\nDistributed file and object stores:\u00a0Petabyte-scale capacity will be the norm, with metadata-driven intelligence orchestrating data placement across nodes.\nPerformance layers:\u00a0NVMe SSDs, all-flash arrays and high-throughput data fabrics play a significant role to keep GPUs and accelerators saturated with data.\n\nNetworking\nWith mobile and cloud last decade we saw a shift in network traffic from a north-south trajectory (user-to-data center) toward an east-west bias (server-to-server). AI-driven workloads cause massive east-west and north-south traffic within the data center and across networks. In the world of HPC, InfiniBand emerged as the go-to for ultra-low-latency interconnects. Now, we see that trend permeate hyperscale data centers, with high-performance Ethernet as a dominant standard which will ultimately in our view prove to be the prevailing open network of choice:\n\nHyper-scale networks:\u00a0Ultra-high-bandwidth and ultra-low-latency fabrics will facilitate the parallel operations needed by AI clusters.\nMulti-directional traffic:\u00a0Once dominated by north-south flows and more recently east-west, advanced AI workloads now spin off traffic in every direction.\n\nSoftware stack and tooling\nOS and system-level software\nAccelerated computing imposes huge demands on operating systems, middleware, libraries, compilers and application frameworks. These must be tuned to exploit GPU resources. As developers create more advanced applications \u2014 some bridging real-time analytics and historical data \u2014 system-level software must manage concurrency at unprecedented levels. The OS, middleware, tools, libraries and compilers are rapidly evolving to support ultra-parallel workloads with the ability to exploit GPUs (that is, GPU-aware OSes).\nData layer\nData is the fuel for AI and the data stack is rapidly becoming infused with intelligence. We see the data layer shifting from an historical system of analytics to a real-time engine that supports the creation of real time digital representations of an organization, comprising people, places and things as well as processes. To support this vision, data harmonization via knowledge graphs, unified metadata repositories, agent control frameworks, unified governance and connectors to operational and analytic systems will emerge.\nThe application layer\nIntelligent applications are emerging that unify and harmonize data. These apps increasingly have real time access to business logic as well as process knowledge. Single-agent systems are evolving to multi-agent architectures with the ability to learn from the reasoning traces of humans. Applications increasingly can understand human language, are injecting intelligence (in other words, AI everywhere) and supporting automation of workflows and new ways of creating business outcomes. Applications increasingly are becoming extensions to the physical world with opportunities in virtually all industries to create digital twins that represent a business in real time.\nKey takeaway:\u00a0Extreme parallel computing represents a wholesale rethinking of the technology stack \u2014 compute, storage, networking and especially the operating system layer. It places GPUs and other accelerators at the center of the architectural design.\n\nSemiconductor stock performance: a five-year lens\n\nThe above graphic shows the five-year stock performance of major semiconductor players, with the \u201cAI zone\u201d shaded starting in late 2022 \u2014 roughly coinciding with the initial buzz around ChatGPT. Until that timeframe, many were skeptical that large-scale GPU-accelerated AI would become such a powerful business driver.\n\nNvidia:\u00a0Broke away from the pack amid the AI enthusiasm and soared to become the most valuable public company in the world.\nBroadcom:\u00a0Our data continues to support Broadcom Inc. as a strong next-best AI play in silicon, particularly for data center infrastructure. It provides critical IP to cloud giants for custom ASICs and next-generation networking, including Google LLC, Meta Platforms Inc. and ByteDance Ltd.\nAMD:\u00a0Has been beating Intel in the x86 market, but that segment is declining, so Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is accelerating its push into AI. We see AMD attempting to replicate its successful x86 playbook \u2014 this time against Nvidia\u2019s GPUs. Nvidia\u2019s competitive moat and software stack will be harder for AMD to undermine without major missteps by Nvidia.\nIntel:\u00a0Intel\u2019s foundry strategy remains a major headwind. As outlined in our\u00a0plan for Intel Corp.\u2019s foundry, we see insufficient volume to catch Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. as capital constraints pile up. We believe Intel will be forced to divest its foundry business this year, which will make us more optimistic on Intel\u2019s formidable design business, enabling the company to unlock innovation again and become a viable AI player.\nQualcomm:\u00a0Remains focused primarily on mobile, edge and device-centric AI. Though not a direct threat to Nvidia in the data center, Qualcomm Inc.\u2019s future expansions into robotics and distributed edge AI could bring these players into occasional contention.\n\nIn our view, the market has recognized that semiconductors are the foundation of future AI capabilities, awarding premium multiples to companies that can capture accelerated compute demand. This year, the \u201chaves\u201d (led by Nvidia, Broadcom and AMD) are outperforming, while the \u201chave-nots\u201d (in particular, Intel) are lagging.\n\nThe competitive landscape: Nvidia and its contenders\nNvidia\u2019s 65% operating margins have enticed investors and competitors to enter the AI chip market in droves. Both incumbents and new entrants have responded aggressively. Yet the market potential is so large and Nvidia\u2019s lead is so substantial that in our view, near-term competition will not hurt Nvidia. Nonetheless, we see multiple angles regarding Nvidia\u2019s challengers, each with its own market approach.\n\n\n\nBroadcom and Google\nWe align these two leaders because: 1) Broadcom powers custom chips such as Google\u2019s tensor processing units or TPUs; and 2) We believe that TPU v4 is extremely competitive in AI. Broadcom\u2019s IP around SerDes, optics and networking is best-in-class and together with Google represents in our view the most viable technical alternative relative to Nvidia.\n\nPotential volume play:\u00a0A long-shot scenario is that Google could eventually commercialize TPUs more aggressively, turning from a purely internal solution to a broader market offering. But in the near term, the ecosystem around Google\u2019s TPUs remains captive and is currently a closed market limiting adoption to internal Google use cases.\n\nBroadcom and Meta\nImportantly, Broadcom also has had a long-term relationship with Meta and powers its AI chips. Both Google and Meta have proved that AI return on investment in consumer advertising pays off. While many enterprises struggle with AI ROI, these two firms are demonstrating impressive return on invested capital from AI.\nBoth Google and Meta are leaning into Ethernet as a networking standard. Broadcom is a strong supporter of Ethernet and a leading voice in the Ultra Ethernet Consortium. Moreover, Broadcom is the only company other than Nvidia with proven expertise on networking within and across XPUs and across XPU clusters, making the company an extremely formidable competitor in AI silicon.\nAMD\nAMD\u2019s data center strategy hinges on delivering competitive AI accelerators \u2014 building on the company\u2019s track record in x86. Though it has a serious GPU presence for gaming and HPC, the AI software ecosystem (centered on CUDA) remains a key obstacle.\n\nTwo angles:\u00a0Some believe AMD will take meaningful market share in AI, at least enough to sustain revenue growth. Others foresee only modest gains because AMD must match not only Nvidia\u2019s hardware but also its software stack, systems expertise and developer loyalty.\n\nAMD has made aggressive moves in AI. It is aligning with Intel to try to keep x86 viability alive. It has acquired ZT Systems to better understand end-to-end AI systems requirements and will be a viable alternative of merchant silicon, especially for inference workloads. Ultimately we believe AMD will capture a relatively small share (single digits) of a massive market. It will manage x86 market declines by gaining share against Intel and make inroads into cost sensitive AI chip markets against Nvidia.\nIntel\nOnce the undisputed leader in processors, Intel\u2019s fortunes have turned amid the shift toward accelerated compute. We continue to see Intel hampered by the massive capital requirements of retaining its own foundry.\n\nVertical integration versus scale:\u00a0Vertical integration can be advantageous for companies such as Apple Inc., Nvidia, Oracle Corp. and Tesla Inc., which combine hardware and software in a single system. But in Intel\u2019s case, we believe the foundry business is draining critical resources and management attention. Intel in our view risks further damage if it doesn\u2019t shed its foundry business this year.\nPossible outcomes:\u00a0Our widely held position is that Intel should spin off its foundry operations to focus on design and partnerships, similar to how AMD shed its fab operations. Another scenario is that Intel continues to invest, eventually regains process leadership and competes head-on. However, the probability of this outcome is extremely low (less than 5% in our view).\n\nAWS and Marvell: Trainium and Inferentia\nAmazon\u2019s custom silicon approach has succeeded with Graviton in CPU instances. Its acquisition of Annapurna Labs is one of the best investments in the history of enterprise tech. And certainly it\u2019s one that is often overlooked. Today, AWS works with Marvell and is applying a Graviton-like strategy to GPUs with Trainium (for training) and Inferentia (for inference).\nDylan Patel\u2019s take on Amazon\u2019s GPU sums it up in our view. Here\u2019s what he said on a recent episode of the BG2 pod:\nAmazon, their whole thing at re:Invent, if you really talk to them when they announce Trainium 2 and our whole post about it and our analysis of it is supply chain-wise\u2026 you squint your eyes, This looks like a Amazon Basics TPU, right? It\u2019s decent, right? But it\u2019s really cheap, A; and B, it gives you the most HBM capacity per dollar and most HBM memory bandwidth per dollar of any chip on the market. And therefore it actually makes sense for certain applications to use. And so this is like a real shift. Like, hey, we maybe can\u2019t design as well as Nvidia, but we can put more memory on the package.\n[Dylan Patel\u2019s take on Amazon Trainium]\nOur view is that AWS\u2019 offering will be cost-optimized \u2014 and offer an alternative GPU approach within the AWS ecosystem for both training an inference. Though developers ultimately may prefer the familiarity and performance of Nvidia\u2019s platform, AWS will offer as many viable choices to customers as it can and will get a fair share of its captive market. Probably not the penetration it sees with Graviton relative to merchant x86 silicon but a decent amount of adoption to justify the investment. We don\u2019t have a current forecast for Trainium at this time, but it\u2019s something we\u2019re watching to get better data.\nKey takeaways\n\nValue versus performance:\u00a0Some workloads do not require Nvidia\u2019s premium capabilities, and those might migrate to lower-cost AWS silicon. Meanwhile, the Nvidia stack will remain the top choice for complex, large-scale deployments and developer convenience.\nAWS back-end infrastructure\u00a0\u2013 Our research at re:Invent indicates that AWS has been working for years on building out its own AI infrastructure to reduce reliance on Nvidia\u2019s full stack. Unlike many companies that require Nvidia\u2019s end-to-end systems, while AWS can offer such a solution to customers, it can also offer its own networking and supporting software infrastructure further lowering costs for customers, while improving its own margins.\n\nMicrosoft and Qualcomm\nMicrosoft has historically lagged AWS and Google in custom silicon, though it does have ongoing projects, such as Maia. Microsoft can offset any silicon gap with its software dominance and willingness to pay Nvidia\u2019s margins for high-end GPUs. Qualcomm is a key supplier for Microsoft client devices. Qualcomm, as indicated, competes in mobile and edge, but as robotics and distributed AI applications expand, we see potential for more direct clashes with Nvidia.\nEmerging alternatives\nFirms such as Cerebras Systems Inc., SambaNova Systems Inc., Tenstorrent Inc. and Graphcore Ltd. have introduced specialized AI architectures. China is also developing homegrown GPU or GPU-like accelerators. However, the unifying challenge remains software compatibility, developer momentum and the steep climb to dislodge a de facto standard.\nKey takeaway:\u00a0Though competition is strong, none of these players alone threatens Nvidia\u2019s long-term dominance \u2014 unless Nvidia makes significant missteps. The market\u2019s size is vast enough that multiple winners can thrive.\n\nInside Nvidia\u2019s moat: hardware, software and ecosystem\nWe see Nvidia\u2019s competitive advantage as a multifaceted moat spanning hardware and software. It has taken nearly two decades of systematic innovation to produce an integrated ecosystem that is both broad and deep.\n\n\n\nHardware integration and \u2018whole cow\u2019 strategy\nNvidia\u2019s GPUs employ advanced process nodes, including HBM memory integration and specialized tensor cores that deliver huge leaps in AI performance. Notably, Nvidia can push a new GPU iteration every 12 to 18 months. Meanwhile, it uses \u201cwhole cow\u201d methods \u2014 ensuring that every salvageable die has a place in its portfolio (data center, PC GPUs or automotive). This keeps yields high and margins healthy.\nNetworking advantage\nThe acquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd. put Nvidia in control of InfiniBand, enabling it to sell comprehensive end-to-end systems for AI clusters and get to market quickly. The integration of ConnectX and BlueField DPUs extends Nvidia\u2019s leadership in ultra-fast networking, a critical component for multi-GPU scaling. As the industry moves toward the Ultra Ethernet standard, many see this as a threat to Nvidia\u2019s moat. We do not. Though networking is a critical component of Nvidia\u2019s time to market advantage, we see it as a supporting member of its portfolio. In our view, the company can and will successfully optimize its stack for Ethernet as the market demands; and it will maintain its core advantage, which comes from tight integration across its stack.\nSoftware integration and platform approach\nNvidia\u2019s software ecosystem has grown far beyond CUDA to include frameworks for nearly every stage of AI application development. The net result is that developers have more reason to stay within Nvidia\u2019s ecosystem rather than seeking alternatives.\nEcosystem and partnerships\nJensen Huang, Nvidia\u2019s CEO, has frequently underscored the company\u2019s emphasis on building a partner network. Virtually every major tech supplier and cloud provider offers Nvidia-based instances or solutions. That broad footprint generates significant network effects, reinforcing the moat.\nKey takeaway:\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s advantage does not hinge on chips alone. Its integration of hardware and software \u2014 underpinned by a vast ecosystem \u2014 forms a fortress-like moat that is difficult to replicate.\n\nDrilling down into Nvidia\u2019s software stack\nCUDA rightly dominates the software discussion, but Nvidia\u2019s stack is broad. Below we highlight six important layers: CUDA, NVMI/NVSM (here denoted as \u201cNIMS\u201d), Nemo, Omniverse, Cosmos and Nvidia\u2019s developer libraries/toolkits.\n\n\nCUDA\n \nCompute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) is Nvidia\u2019s foundational parallel computing platform. It abstracts away the complexities of GPU hardware and allows developers to write applications in languages like C/C++, Fortran, Python, and others. CUDA orchestrates GPU cores and optimizes workload scheduling for accelerated AI, HPC, graphics, and more.\n \nNIMS (Nvidia Inference Microservices)\n \nNvidia NIMS are a set of \u00a0inference microservices\u00a0designed to simplify and accelerate the deployment of foundation models on any cloud or data center.\n \nNeMo\n \nNeMo is an end-to-end framework for developing and fine-tuning large language models and natural language applications. It provides pre-built modules, pretrained models, and the tooling to export those models into other Nvidia products, helping speed time-to-insight for businesses that want to leverage NLP and large language models.\n \nOmniverse\n \nOmniverse is a platform for 3D design collaboration, simulation, and real-time visualization. While originally showcased for design engineering and media, Omniverse now extends into robotics, digital twins and advanced physics-based simulations. It leverages CUDA for graphical rendering, combining real-time graphics with AI-driven simulation capabilities.\n \nCosmos\n \nCosmos is a\u00a0platform that\u00a0helps developers create world models for physical AI systems.\u00a0It\u2019s used to accelerate the development of robotics and autonomous vehicles.\nDeveloper libraries and toolkits\nBeyond the core frameworks, Nvidia has developed hundreds of specialized libraries for neural network operations, linear algebra, device drivers, HPC applications, image processing and more. These libraries are meticulously tuned for GPU acceleration \u2014 further locking in the developer community that invests time to master them.\nKey takeaway:\u00a0The software stack is arguably the most important factor in Nvidia\u2019s sustained leadership. CUDA is only part of the story. The depth and maturity of Nvidia\u2019s broader AI software suite forms a formidable barrier to entry for new challengers.\n\nBrief tangent from the data center: AI PCs emerge\nAlthough this Breaking Analysis focuses on data center transformation, we would be remiss not to discuss AI PCs briefly. At CES this year, multiple vendors announced laptops and desktops branded as \u201cAI PCs,\u201d often featuring NPUs (neural processing units) or specialized GPUs for on-device inference.\nETR data on client devices\n\n\n\nSurvey data shown above is from ETR in a survey of approximately 1,835 information technology decision makers. The vertical axis is Net Score or spending momentum and the horizontal axis is Overlap or penetration within those 1,835 accounts. The table insert shows how the dots are plotted (Net Score and N). It shows Dell laptops at the top of the share curve with 543 N, with strong spending momentum across Apple, HP, and Lenovo. The plot reveals healthy spending momentum for leading PC suppliers.\n\nDell Technologies Inc.:\u00a0Introduced AI laptops\u00a0and has signaled collaboration with multiple silicon partners, including AMD, Intel and Qualcomm. We believe it could integrate Nvidia solutions as well.\nApple:\u00a0Has\u00a0shipped NPUs for several years\u00a0in its M-series chips, benefiting battery life and local inference. Apple remains a force in vertical integration.\nOthers (HP Inc., Lenovo Group Ltd. and so on):\u00a0Each is testing or releasing AI-focused endpoints, sometimes with dedicated NPUs or discrete GPUs.\n\nRole of NPUs in PCs\nCurrently, the NPU often sits idle in many AI PCs because software stacks are still not fully optimized. Over time, we expect more specialized AI applications on client devices \u2014 potentially enabling real-time language translation, image/video processing, advanced security and local LLM inference at smaller scales.\nNvidia\u2019s position\nWe believe Nvidia, with its track record in GPUs, can offer AI PC technology that is more performant than typical NPUs on mobile or notebooks. However, the power consumption, thermals, and cost constraints remain significant challenges. We do see Nvidia using salvaged \u201cwhole cow\u201d dies and building them into laptop GPUs with reduced power envelopes.\nAlthough this section deviates from the data center focus, AI PCs could drive developer adoption. On-device AI makes sense for productivity, specialized workloads, and specific vertical use cases. This, in turn, may reinforce the broader ecosystem transition to parallel computing architectures.\n\nMarket analysis: data center spending and EPC ascendancy\nWe have modeled the entire data center market \u2014 servers, storage, networking, power, cooling and related infrastructure \u2014 from 2019 through 2035. Our research points to a rapid transition away from traditional general-purpose computing toward extreme parallel computing.\n\n\n\nData center TAM growth\n\nThe total data center market is projected to surpass\u00a0$1 trillion by 2032\u00a0and expand to\u00a0$1.7 trillion by 2035.\nFrom 2024 onward, our baseline model shows an\u00a0overall compound annual growth rate of 15%\u00a0\u2014 considerably higher than the historical single-digit growth rate for enterprise IT.\n\nExtreme parallel computing growth\nWe categorize \u201cextreme parallel computing\u201d as the specialized hardware and software for AI training, inference, HPC clusters and advanced analytics.\n\nThe EPC portion is growing at a\u00a023% CAGR\u00a0over the same period, ultimately dwarfing the once-dominant share of standard x86-based systems.\nIn 2020, EPC represented roughly 8% of data center spend. By 2030, we project it will exceed 50%. By mid-2030s, advanced accelerators could represent the overwhelming majority (80% to 90%) of data center silicon investments.\n\nNvidia\u2019s capture of EPC spend\nCurrently, we estimate that Nvidia accounts for roughly\u00a025%\u00a0of the entire data center segment. Our view is that Nvidia will retain that leading share throughout the forecast period \u2014 assuming it avoids unforced errors \u2014 despite intense competition from hyperscalers, AMD and others.\nDrivers of growth\n\nGenerative AI and LLMs:\u00a0ChatGPT-like large language models demonstrate the power of accelerated computing for natural language, coding, search and more.\nEnterprise agent models:\u00a0Firms worldwide will embed AI in business processes, requiring heavier data center workloads.\nRobotics and digital twins:\u00a0Over time, industrial automation and sophisticated robotics will demand large-scale simulations and real-time inference.\nAutomation ROI:\u00a0The drive to reduce costs and labor dependencies often produces immediate returns when combined with accelerated AI.\n\nKey takeaway:\u00a0The anticipated shift toward accelerated compute forms the foundation of our bullish stance on data center growth. We believe extreme parallel computing ushers in a multi-year (or even multi-decade) supercycle for data center infrastructure investments.\n\nConclusion and risks to our positive Nvidia scenario\nSummary of the premise\nWe assert that a new trillion-dollar-plus marketplace is emerging, fueled by AI. The data center \u2014 as we have known it \u2014 will transform into a distributed, parallel processing fabric where GPUs and specialized accelerators become the norm. Nvidia\u2019s tightly integrated platform (hardware + software + ecosystem) leads this transition, but it is not alone. Hyperscalers, competing semiconductor firms, and specialized startups all have roles to play in a rapidly expanding market.\n\n\n\nKey risks to the scenario\nDespite our positive assessment, we acknowledge several risks:\n\nReliance on TSMC and supply chain fragility\n\nNvidia relies heavily on TSMC for fabrication. Potential disruption from geopolitical events, notably involving China and Taiwan, is a critical vulnerability.\n\n\nAI overhype or economic downturn\n\nAI may struggle to deliver near-term returns as quickly as some expect. A macroeconomic pullback could dampen spend on expensive infrastructure.\n\n\nOpen-source alternatives\n\nNumerous communities and vendors are working on open-source frameworks to bypass Nvidia\u2019s software stack. If these become sufficiently mature, they could erode Nvidia\u2019s grip on developer mindshare.\n\n\nAntitrust, regulation and Huang succession planning\n\nGovernments worldwide have AI in their crosshairs, from ethics to competition policy. Regulatory pressure could constrain Nvidia\u2019s ability to bundle hardware and software or expand through acquisitions.\nHuang is the single most important force providing strategic direction, clear communications and massive influence in the industry. If he were no longer in a position to lead Nvidia, that would change the dynamic. Succession planning discussions haven\u2019t been disclosed but it remains an unspoken risk.\n\n\nAlternative approaches\n\nQuantum computing, optical computing or ultra-low-cost AI chips might eventually disrupt GPU dominance, especially if they offer superior performance at lower cost and wattage.Final word:\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s future looks bright, in our view, but it cannot be complacent. The company\u2019s best defense remains relentless innovation in both hardware and software \u2014 a strategy that has carried it to where it is today and will likely drive its continued leadership in this new era of extreme parallel computing.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal word:\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s future looks bright, in our view, but it cannot be complacent.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia Positioned For $400 Billion AI Boom With Advanced GPUs, New Product Launches Driving Revenue Growth, Say Analysts      Anusuya Lahiri   January 30, 2025 4 min read        14   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.31%         Nvidia Positioned For $400 Billion AI Boom With Advanced GPUs, New Product Launches Driving Revenue Growth, Say Analysts   Wall Street analysts rerated NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) after U.S. tech stocks\u00a0plunged Monday as Chinese open-source artificial intelligence platform\u00a0DeepSeek made the market jittery over the AI technology investment prospects in the U.S. tech firms. Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth upgraded Nvidia from Buy to Strong Buy and raised the price target from\u00a0$170\u00a0to\u00a0$220.  DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria maintained a Hold rating on Nvidia with a price target of\u00a0$135. Don't Miss: Nancy Pelosi Invested $5 Million In An AI Company Last Year \u2014 Here's How You Can Invest In Multiple Pre-IPO AI Startups With Just $1,000 Built on the trusted network of Fortune 500 companies, this blockchain company partners with Salesforce to uproot lengthy and expensive B2B transactions, and you can invest with just $100.  Tigress Financial: Nvidia continues as a core holding in the powerful AI investing theme and the industry-leading beneficiary of significant capital investment in AI development. This drives the ongoing acceleration of AI adoption across all industries and enterprises, which will continue to drive substantial revenue and cash flow growth, as well as better shareholder value creation, viewing yesterday's sell-off as a significant buying opportunity. DeepSeek's models were trained on less advanced Nvidia chips, leading to a significant drop in the stock value. However, the capabilities of DeepSeek's R1 AI model are unknown, and there are tremendous concerns about security.  Most importantly, AI and the data centers it runs on will require a multiyear ongoing investment in buildout and development. Nvidia will be a key beneficiary as it continues to be the number one supplier of AI-driving GPUs and introduces more advanced and powerful GPUs, including its current Blackwell line of processors and the upcoming Vera Rubin processors. Trending: Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share! Expectations for aggregate AI-driven and data center development capital investment should exceed $330 billion this year, from just under $250 billion in 2024 to over $400 billion next year. Nvidia highlighted multiple new product launches at CES 2025 in Las Vegas earlier this month. In November, Nvidia reported another quarter of strong results. Demand for its industry-leading AI-enabling GPUs remains incredibly strong, and it continues to support the powerful AI-driven investment theme.   Story Continues DA Davidson: DeepSeek R1 has just lowered the market price for best-in-class intelligence, and as a result, OpenAI is reacting costlyly. Sam Altman announced on X that OpenAI would give non-paying users \"hundreds\" of free queries a week to their upcoming o3-mini model.Analyst Luria noted the cost of providing such a service for free would be in the hundreds of millions a week, with his base case assuming $677 million in inference cost per week. Luria noted the most underappreciated takeaway of R1 is the visibility of its reasoning tokens.See Also: This 12,000 RPM Spinning Battery With Over $100 Million In LOIs Could Be The Missing Link For Green Energy \u2014 Here\u2019s Why Early Investors Are Flocking To Invest Before Funding ClosesAnother reason Luria noted sentiment shifting drastically in favor of DeepSeek over OpenAI is the inability to see o1\u2019s reasoning tokens despite paying for them at the $60 per million token cost.DeepSeek already released a leading text-to-image model, Janus-Pro-7B, that outperforms Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 3.Thus, Luria noted OpenAI\u2019s only move is to out-innovate open-source labs faster and find a way to lower inference costs if they are to prevail.While Luria is aware of skepticism about DeepSeek\u2019s training cluster size, he noted this as pure speculation with little evidence to back it.In China, DeepSeek is not alone; Luria flagged developments from Qwen (Alibaba), Doubao (ByteDance), Kimi,and MiniMax as just some of the labs that have released leading models over the past few weeks. Luria expects a flurry of responses from American labs as a response to R1 shortly.Read Next:According to Juniper Research, the total value of B2B cross-border payments stored on the blockchain is projected to exceed $4.4 trillion \u2014 Join the first company to bring blockchain payments to Salesforce early with just $100. \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones.

Dick\u2019s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I\u2019m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.\nYet while there\u2019s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum \u00a31939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is \u2013 dare I say it \u2013 quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4\u2019s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.\n\nThere\u2019s definitely a sense of Nvidia going \"Sod it\" with this one, cutting the sensibility brakes to produce something that even hyperenthusiasts might find a bit too mad. Besides the price, this is by far the biggest PSU-muncher to ever wear a GeForce badge: the Founders Edition I tested demands a thundering 1000W power supply and is rated to hoover up to 575W at once, a threat that it made good on by pulling 578W in Cyberpunk 2077. In comparison, the 450W-rated RTX 4090 looks like it can be powered by potatoes. Credit to the redesigned dual-fan cooler for keeping a lid on temperatures, which I nonetheless measured peaking at a very manageable 74\u00b0c.\n\n\n \nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun\n\nOn that note, if there\u2019s something the RTX 5090 does brilliantly without any AI caveats, it\u2019s the industrial design. This might actually be \u2013 granted that it\u2019s not a high bar \u2013 the best-looking graphics card I\u2019ve seen in my life, a modern yet mature slice of precision-cut aluminium. Also, unlike the RTX 4090 FE, it isn\u2019t so big that it could feasibly have come from the age when computers needed their own cupboards. It\u2019s a solid 2cm thinner, to be exact, finally arresting and reversing the trend of ever-fattening premium GPUs.\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5090 review: 4K benchmarks\nUltra HD is the RTX 5090\u2019s spiritual home, just as with the RTX 4090 and RTX 3090 before it. Since I had all three to hand, I introduced them to the new test rig I'd piloted with the Intel Arc B580, which combines 16GB of DDR5 RAM with an Intel Core i9-13900K.\nIn terms of unaltered, native-rez games performance, let alone any frame gen gubbins, the RTX 5090 is inarguably the new quickest card of them all. It\u2019s the first ever to smash through 100fps in Cyberpunk 2077 with these settings, and provided you\u2019ve got at least a 144Hz monitor (comparatively not a big ask, if you can afford \u00a32K\u2019s worth of graphics card) then you could see a visible improvement over the RTX 4090 in other tough games like Total War: Warhammer III and F1 24.\n\n\n \nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun\n\nNevertheless, it\u2019s hard to ignore how the jump from the RTX 4090 to the RTX 5090 isn\u2019t nearly as big or as consistent as the former\u2019s improvement over the RTX 3090. Nvidia\u2019s top two GPUs are almost level in Horizon Forbidden West and Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage, and the differences remain minor once you start adding upscaling. Quality-level DLSS in Forbidden West, for example, got it up to 137fps on the RTX 5090 and 125fps on the RTX 4090: hardly a grand leap forward.\nThe RPS test PC:\n\nCPU: Intel Core i9-13900K\nRAM: 16GB Crucial DDR5 Pro\nMotherboard: Asus ROG Maximus Z790 Dark Hero\nPSU: NZXT C1000 Gold\n\nOn the other hand, the RTX 5090\u2019s Blackwell architecture does appear a little better at handling the performance hit from ray tracing \u2013 and this was already one of Nvidia\u2019s strong suits. After enabling Ultra-quality RT effects, Metro Exodus dropped from 163fps to 117fps on the RTX 5090 and from 135fps to 87fps on the RTX 4090: that makes for reductions of 28% and 36% respectively.\nThen there\u2019s DLSS 4, and its most numbermaking component, Multi Frame Generation. This works similarly to the frame generation that DLSS 3 introduced for the 40 series: the card takes data from the frames that the GPU is rendering and uses AI to generate lookalike frames that can be slipped in-between the rendered ones, boosting overall framerates in exchange for a touch of added input lag. However, whereas the DLSS 3 version creates up to one AI frame for every rendered frame, MSG can generate three or four, resulting in scenes like this:\n\n\n \nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun\n\nThat is indeed the RTX 5090 running fully pathed-traced Cyberpunk 2077 and Alan Wake II, at 4K, at \u2013 as far as your eyes are concerned \u2013 200fps. And crucially, 4x MFG doesn\u2019t significantly increase latency over what classic 2x frame generation already did, nor does it look any worse in terms of image quality.\nThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s immaculate sorcery. Input lag is input lag, and while MFG doesn\u2019t make this tradeoff noticeably worse, it also doesn\u2019t make it any better. Cyberpunk 2077 could also get quite blurry when making rapid camera movements \u2013 an issue I didn\u2019t really have with AW2 and Dragon Age: The Veilguard, to be fair \u2013 and it\u2019s important to remember that no matter how many imitation frames an AI generator can add, it\u2019s not going to make these games feel faster in your hands. That 218fps will only ever have the mouse snappiness of a 64fps game, because those frames \u2013 the ones delivered via the usual PC pipeline \u2013 are the only ones that can accurately reflect your inputs.\nAll that in mind, the visual smoothness is a stark upgrade, and if you\u2019re not playing something that needs hyper-accurate twitch aiming\u2026 why not? Especially if the underlying GPU is strong enough to get comfortable 'real' framerates out of max-quality settings like path tracing, in which case frame generation becomes the luxury it really should be. Not a crutch that games without adequate low-end settings can use to pump their numbers up.\nMFG is also but one part of DLSS 4, which covers a range of tricks that both are and aren\u2019t exclusive to this new Nvidia generation. The RTX 5090 thus also has the duty of showcasing some tech that will benefit GPUs going right back to the RTX 20 series, such as DLSS 4\u2019s new 'Transformer' model and support for 'DLSS overrides' in the Nvidia app.\n\n\n \nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun\n\nFirstly, the Transformer model is a rejigged technique for how DLSS applies its best-in-class anti-aliasing. It runs slightly slower than the preexisting \u2018Convolutional Neural Network\u2019 model, averaging 120fps in Cyberpunk 2077 at 4K/Ultra versus the 132fps of the older version. But it does look sharper and more detailed: a lot of Nvidia\u2019s promotional comparison images have focused on textures, but what I found most noticeable was the improvement to fine-edged objects like grass and wire fences. DLSS already looked better than its rivals FSR and XeSS on these, but the Transformer model cleans and sharpens them up even further, bringing the overall picture closer than ever to true native-rez quality. Good stuff.\nSecondly, DLSS overrides could be a very big deal in bringing newer, superior versions of DLSS to games that either never updated their support or lacked it in the first place. It still requires a degree of support in the Nvidia app \u2013 you can\u2019t just go slapping DLSS 4 on anything ever made \u2013 but there will be a batch of 75 compatible games at launch, and the options are impressively flexible. You could force a game to use DLAA anti-aliasing if it was never officially implemented, for example, or take a game that has Convolutional Neural Network DLSS support and upgrade it to the new Transformer model. And, if you\u2019ve got a 50 series GPU like this one, you can have a game with DLSS 3 frame gen capability also work with full 4x MFG, as I did with Dragon Age: The Veilguard to get those benchmark results above.\nI\u2019m still not seeing the value in a lot of what Nvidia does with AI, up to and including their attempts at creating creepy, artless NPCs. But it\u2019s much, much easier to get on board with these DLSS advancements, which devalue nothing, steal from nowhere, and could well breathe life into older hardware as much as they enrich the new.\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5090 review: 1440p benchmarks\nBefore we get too lovey-dovey, though, time for another reminder of the RTX 5090\u2019s limitations. Buying a top-shelf GPU and hooking it up to less demanding 1440p screen might seem like galaxy brain setup-building to some \u2013 the PC equivalent of those Fiats with massive engines poking out the back because they won\u2019t fit inside. In practice, your mismatched rigmobile will just send you crashing into a CPU bottleneck:\n\n\n \nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun\n\nAgain, the RTX 3090 is left well behind, but at this resolution the RTX 5090 is effectively only as powerful as the GPU it replaces. You could potentially open up the gap again by laying on thick with the ray tracing, but still, the results underwhelm: Cyberpunk 2077, with Psycho RT effects and Quality DLSS, averaged 124fps on the RTX 5090 and 111fps on the RTX 4090. All that cash for an extra 11fps? Not a great deal. MFG isn\u2019t really useful here either, as you\u2019re already getting so many frames shoved down your eyes that regular 2x frame generation will push supporting games beyond the point where you\u2019ll seldom be able to perceive a load more.\nNope, 4K is where the RTX 5090 is at. But then, trying to be practical with a card like this kind of feels like missing its point. Yes, we once had the GTX 1080 Ti and the RTX 2080 Ti, GPUs that could top a range while still being somewhat attainable high-enders. I miss those days too. But is the RTX 5090 not more of an aspirational device anyway? A concept model that\u2019s just happened to escape the design wing and sneak into the production factory?\n\n\n \nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun\n\nLet\u2019s be real: you were never going to buy this. I was never going to buy this. Even the people who might buy this, presumably when they\u2019re not busy executing their generals, probably have at least one eye on the RTX 5080 as well. It\u2019s just so far beyond us normies that there doesn\u2019t seem to be much sense in hating it either. The GPU itself won\u2019t care, and Nvidia certainly won\u2019t. They\u2019re probably already planning the RTX 6090 for \u00a32,500.\nInstead, let\u2019s just see this for what it really is, an eye-grabbing exercise for DLSS features that are far more likely to make waves than any one single graphics card. You\u2019ve got me there, RTX 5090, even if you aren\u2019t getting my money.\n\nThis review is based on a retail unit provided by the manufacturer.\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            All InZoi early access DLC \"will be provided for free\" because of course it should be\n          \n\n\n\n            Ok, Fallout 76's Ghoul Within update: I'll play as a ghoul if you stop using words like \"Ghoultastic\"\n          \n\n\n\n            New Palworld update adds crossplay, Photo Mode, new drafting table feature and cosmetic armour\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nJames Archer: James had previously hung around beneath the RPS treehouse as a freelancer, before being told to drop the pine cones and climb up to become hardware editor.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia stock falls after notching record high ahead of CES AI superchip debut      Laura Bratton     January 8, 2025 2 min read        306   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +2.37%     SMH   +0.56%      Nvidia stock (NVDA) tumbled more than 6% Tuesday, a day after shares closed at a record high in anticipation of CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s keynote at the tech industry\u2019s annual CES trade show in Las Vegas. Huang's presentation on Monday night gave a flurry of updates on upcoming Nvidia products, previewing what\u2019s next in the burgeoning artificial intelligence market and for other emerging technologies. Shares jumped as much as 2.5% early Tuesday before reversing direction. The chip maker was the Dow's worst performer of the session. Nvidia stock's decline comes amid a broader slump in stocks Tuesday after November job openings data came in mixed and separate economic data stoked inflation concerns. Nvidia shares are still up roughly 190% from last year. Its updates at CES fueled more bullish takes on the stock.

Advanced Chart    Analysts at Stifel, Wedbush, and Truist Securities on Tuesday reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock. On average, Wall Street analysts tracked by Yahoo Finance see Nvidia shares rising to $172.80 over the next 12 months. \u201c[T]he company continues to position itself more favorably \u2014 not just in the datacenter but increasingly at all areas of the edge \u2014 from client compute to autonomous vehicles to robotics \u2014 supporting revenue growth and our Buy rating on the stock,\u201d Truist Securities analyst William Stein, who holds a Buy rating on the stock, wrote in a note to investors Tuesday morning.  One of Nvidia's most notable updates at the trade show: a new, pint-sized artificial intelligence superchip called GB10 used in its (also new) client supercomputer. The supercomputer \u2014 sized to fit on the average-sized desk \u2014 is part of Nvidia\u2019s Project DIGITS announced Monday, advertised to developers, researchers, and students, and the device will be available in May for $3,000.   Jensen Huang speaking at NVIDIA Keynote at Michelob Ultra Arena in Las Vegas, NV, on Jan. 6, 2025. Credit: DeeCee Carter/MediaPunch /IPX  \u00b7 DeeCee Carter/MediaPunch/MediaPunch/IPx Nvidia also unveiled major updates about its robotics strategy. The chip giant debuted its Cosmos platform, which offers AI models for developing humanoid robots as well as autonomous vehicles. Nvidia shares closed at a record high of $149.43 Monday ahead of Huang\u2019s keynote \u2014 eclipsing its prior record close of $148.88 reached on Nov. 7. Wedbush analyst and Nvidia bull Dan Ives said he sees robotics and autonomous technology representing a $1 trillion market for the company. Huang put that number higher in his keynote, saying that autonomous driving technologies alone \u201cwill likely be the first multitrillion-dollar robotics industry.\"  Additionally, Nvidia showcased new Blackwell-generation gaming GPUs (graphics processing units) and applications for developers to launch their own custom AI agents. Yahoo Finance\u2019s Dan Howley reported that Nvidia could debut a successor to its Blackwell generation AI chips during its GTC conference in March.

And the performance boost is even more compared to FP16.\nGeForce RTX 50 Series Ray Tracing cores yield an up to 1.4X performance improvement in 3D rendering apps. Plus DLSS Multi Frame Generation boosts viewport framerates in creative apps - delivering 2X the performance over the previous generation when editing 3D scenes in applications like D5 Render.\nThe video encoders and decoders add 4:2:2 pro-grade color format support, allowing you to decode up to 9x 4K30 4:2:2 streams per decoder, and encoding up to a staggering 11X encoding speed compared to software encoders. There\u2019s also three 9th Gen NVIDIA encoders on the GeForce RTX 5090 and 2 on the RTX 5080, and 2x 6th Gen NVIDIA decoders in both, to boost video export speed. The HEVC and AV1 encoders have a 5% improvement in quality. There is also a new AV1 Ultra High Quality mode that improves the quality by an extra 5%.\u00a0\nLivestreamers also benefit from the ninth-gen NVIDIA encoders for better livestreaming quality, especially for those using NVIDIA Broadcast. The new NVIDIA Broadcast app comes with two new beta effects focused on pushing the livestreaming experience to the next level: Studio Voice enhances a user\u2019s microphone to match that of a high-quality microphone. Virtual Key Light relights the subject to deliver even lighting as if a physical key light was defining the form and dimension of the individual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload NVIDIA Broadcast here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlongside the launch of our new GPUs, gamers and creators can download several new items to enhance their PCs.\nOur new Game Ready and NVIDIA Studio drivers add support for DLSS 4, new RTX gaming technologies, new games, new NVIDIA Studio technologies and optimizations, new AI optimizations, and NVIDIA app\u2019s new features.\nAnd game updates for Alan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077, and Hogwarts Legacy add native support for DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, along with new technologies that further enhance image quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 5090 Reviews\nThe world\u2019s press and YouTubers have been putting the GeForce RTX 5090 and GeForce RTX 5080 through their paces alongside the game-changing DLSS 4 - here\u2019s a sampling of what they said in their reviews:\n\n\u201cNVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5090 is the fastest, most powerful, and feature-rich consumer GPU in the world as of today, period.\u201d - HotHardware\n\u201cSimply put, the Nvidia RTX 5090 has coalesced all the current thinking on AI, performance, sharpness, and generative content into a single card that blows the doors off anything on the market.

Huang walked onstage carrying the graphics card to a round of applause. This was the most anticipated moment of the Nvidia event, but not the only big announcement. The AI computing company integral to the rise of generative AI had many more cards to play at the Las Vegas tech conference. Nvidia is now building its own AI models, fueling robotics and autonomous vehicle development, and bringing some of the most powerful computing tools to the masses. Here's everything that was announced at the Nvidia keynote.GeForce RTX 50 series The big news of course was Nvidia's new GPUs, the GeForce RTX 50 Series. The graphics cards are underpinned by Nvidia's new RTX Blackwell architecture and consist of the flagship GeForce RTX 5090 as well as the GeForce RTX 5080, 5070 Ti, and 5070. The RTX 50 series is powered by 92 billion transistors, which gives it 3,352 trillion AI operations per second (TOPS) and boasts 1.8TB/s of memory bandwidth. Mashable's Chance Townsend and Alex Perry have the full details on specs, availability, and pricing, but rest assured, it's \"just a beast,\" as Huang put it.Cosmos World Foundation ModelsThe graphics card giant is getting into the world model game with the introduction of Nvidia Cosmos. World models are the underlying technology for robotics training. And Nvidia has made its Cosmos World Foundation Models (Cosmos WFM) available as an open license platform available on Github, granting broader access to robotics developers that previously lacked these resources or expertise. \"The ChatGPT moment for general robotics is just around the corner,\" said Huang.\n\n            Mashable Light Speed\n        \n\nWant more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?\nSign up for Mashable's weekly Light Speed newsletter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading...\nSign Me Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                By clicking Sign Me Up, you confirm you are 16+ and agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\n            \n\n\n\nThanks for signing up!\n\n\nAI foundation models for RTX AI PCs, Llama NemotronNvidia also introduced AI foundation models for LLM development. AI foundation models for RTX PCs are \"offered as Nvidia NIM microservices\" and use the GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs. Additionally, Huang shared the top manufacturers are launching PCs that support NIM with its new graphics cards, adding \"AI PCs are coming to a home near you.\"Another NIM microservice announcement introduced Llama Nemotron family of LLMs. Llama Nemotron uses Meta's open-source Llama models are primed for agentic capabilities and \"excel at instruction following, chat, function calling, coding and math, while being size-optimized to run on a broad range of NVIDIA accelerated computing resources,\" according to the announcement. Llama 3.1 Nemotron 70B is now available in Nvidia's API catalog.Project DigitsIn keeping with the theme of empowering developers with access to powerful computing tools, Nvidia unveiled Project Digits. The device is a supercomputer about the size of a Mac mini that easily sits on a desk and plugs into a keyboard and monitor. With its GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, Digits can run up to 200-billion-parameters LLMs without the need for cloud infrastructure. And it's $3,000 a pop, which in the grand scheme of things, is a pretty accessible price point for small businesses and solo developers. Project Digits is expected this coming May. \n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\nI bent LG's new 5K2K bendable gaming monitor at CES 2025\nCES 2025 highlights: What we've seen so far\nDell roasted at CES for adopting Apple-like device names\nCES 2025: Acer's new Aspire Vero 16 laptop is partially made from *checks notes* oyster shells\n22 new gadgets from CES 2025 that you can buy right now\n\n\nDRIVE Hyperion AV platformNvidia has also been working hard in the autonomous vehicle department, introducing the DRIVE Hyperion AV platform, powered by the AGX Thor system-on-a-chip (SoC). DRIVE Hyperion is an \"end-to-end autonomous driving platform,\" that includes the SoC, sensors, safety systems, and a DriveOS operating system that car manufacturers can use to build their autonomous vehicles.

Please don\u2019t distribute this. I beg you.\n\n\tBy Shaun Cichacki\nJanuary 7, 2025, 3:17pm\n\nScreenshot: NVIDIA\n\n\n\nShare:\nX\nFacebook\nShareCopied to clipboard\n\n\n\nDo you know my least favorite thing about Raids? Learning patterns, finding out exactly what I should do to help my team kill a boss, and becoming a better player for it. You know what I do want to see in my future Raids, though? A boss that learns how to overcome these patterns, making every encounter with it extremely miserable and turning what could be a 20-minute run into an hour or more because we keep getting wiped. No, those words are definitely not dripping with sarcasm right now. NVIDIA\u2019s new AI Boss tech could do just that, however, and I hate it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAh Yes, Manmade NVIDIA Horror Beyond Our Comprehension Sounds Very Fun\nAlright, so, picture this. You and your friends are looking to settle down after a busy day at work. Sitting down, you log into your favorite MMO or RPG \u2014 or whatever you\u2019re currently playing. You rush through a dungeon, fighting the same enemies you have many times before. After arriving on the doorstep of the final creature, you realize something feels a little\u2026 different than it did before. That\u2019s because this boss is now powered by NVIDIA ACE, AI technology that helps the boss learn player patterns and changes how it reacts.\n\n\n\t\t\tVideos by VICE\t\t\n\nOn paper, this sounds like a kind of cool idea. But after the game has learned what players do and how they do it, it seems like it would become the biggest mess possible. Look at Chessbots. These AI anomalies turn a game of wit and strategy into a nearly unwinnable mess. And if there is one thing we know about gamers? They like to win. Playing against a boss, especially one they\u2019ve fought before, feels like a treat.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople don\u2019t go into dungeons in Final Fantasy XIV to face off against Good King Moogle Mog with an advanced AI mindset. They go in because they want to punch the shit out of a giant Moogle while the most Danny Elfman/Tim Burton-ass music plays in the background. It sounds like a solution to a problem people don\u2019t have. Maybe something like this could be cool in a single-player game. But, online gaming?\nDon\u2019t let this get anywhere near our favorite games, please, and thank you. Maybe I\u2019m glad I went to AMD over NVIDIA now, for real. \n\n\n\n\nTagged:Waypoint\nShare:\nX\nFacebook\nShareCopied to clipboard\n\n\n\n\n\nOne email. One story. Every week.

Plus, GPU-accelerated NVIDIA CUDA libraries increased our model throughput by 30x.\u201d\nThese libraries include the NVIDIA TensorRT ecosystem of application programming interfaces for high-performance deep learning inference and the NVIDIA cuDNN library of primitives for deep neural networks.\nTaming Traffic in Tuscon, Vancouver and Beyond\nIn Tuscon, Arizona, more than 80 intersections are tapping into the NoTraffic AI Mobility platform, which has enabled up to a 46% reduction in road delays during rush hours \u2014 and a half-mile reduction in peak queue length.\nThe work is an expansion of NoTraffic\u2019s initial deployment on Tuscon\u2019s West Ajo Way. That effort led to an average delay reduction of 23% for drivers.\nSince installation, NoTraffic technology has helped free Tucson drivers from over 1.25 million hours stuck in traffic, the company estimates, representing an economic benefit of over $24.3 million. The company has also tracked a nearly 80% reduction in red-light runners since its platform was deployed, helping improve safety at Tucson intersections.\nBy reducing travel times, drivers have also saved over $1.6 million in gas, cutting emissions and improving air quality to make the equivalent impact of planting 650,000 trees.\nIn Vancouver, Canada, the University of British Columbia (UBC) is using the NoTraffic platform and Rogers Communications\u2019 5G-connected, AI-enabled smart-traffic platform to reduce both pedestrian delays and greenhouse gas emissions.\nRogers Communications\u2019 5G networks provide robust and stable connectivity to the sensors embedded on the traffic poles.\nThis advanced network infrastructure enhances the NoTraffic platform\u2019s efficacy and scalability, as the improved speed and reduced latency of 5G networks means traffic data can be processed in real time. This is critical for predicting numerous potential traffic scenarios, adjusting signal timings and prioritizing road users accordingly.\nWith AI Mobility deployed at seven intersections across the campus, the university experienced an up to 40% reduction in pedestrian delays and significant decreases in vehicle wait time.\nIn addition, UBC reduces 74 tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year thanks to the NoTraffic and Rogers solution, which is powered by NVIDIA edge AI and accelerated computing.\nThe platform is also in action on the roads of Phoenix, Arizona; Baltimore, Maryland; and in 35 states through 200+ agencies across the U.S. and Canada.\nHonk If You Love Reducing Congestion, Carbon Emissions\nThe NoTraffic AI Mobility platform offers local AI-based predictions that, based on sensor inputs at multiple intersections, analyze numerous traffic scenarios up to two minutes in advance.\nIt can adapt to real-time changes in traffic patterns and volumes, send messages between intersections and run optimization algorithms that control traffic signals to improve overall transportation efficiency and safety through cloud connectivity.\nSpeedups in the AI Mobility platform mean quicker optimizations of traffic signals \u2014 and reduced congestion on the roads means reduced carbon emissions from vehicles.\nNoTraffic estimates that for every city optimized with this platform, eight hours of traffic time could be saved per driver. Plus, with over 300,000 signalized intersections in the U.S., the company says this could result in a total of $14 billion in economic savings per year.\nLearn more about the NVIDIA Metropolis platform and how it\u2019s used in smart cities and spaces.\n\n\nCategories: Data CenterTags: Artificial Intelligence | CUDA | Customer Stories | GPU | Inception | Jetson | Metropolis | Mobility | Smart Spaces | Social Impact | Transportation | Visual Computing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Honors Americas Partners Advancing Agentic and Physical AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Blackwell Powers Real-Time AI for Entertainment Workflows\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Building a platform to do the job of 1 million analystsfor\u00a0Great SpeculationsFollow AuthorJan 27, 2025, 10:19am ESTShareSaveCommentHANGZHOU, CHINA - JANUARY 27, 2025 - A Illustration photo shows DeepSeek and Nvidia LOGO in Hangzhou ... [+] City, Zhejiang Province, China, January 27, 2025. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images)CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images\nA few weeks ago, Chinese AI research lab DeepSeek released its open-source AI model, DeepSeek-R1, which has drawn significant attention in the tech world. According to a paper authored by the lab, the DeepSeek-R1 model outperforms cutting-edge models such as OpenAI\u2019s o1 and Meta\u2019s Llama AI models across multiple benchmarks. This is impressive, given that the model is also open-source, cost-effective, and requires significantly less computational power compared to its rivals.\n\n\nNow DeepSeek\u2019s approach appears to have set off alarm bells in Silicon Valley, where most big tech giants have been relying more on brute force \u2014 amassing a larger stock of GPU chips and servers and running long model training periods. We believe this development could potentially have implications for Nvidia stock, the dominant player in the AI hardware space. Also, check out our analysis on: How Nvidia stock could drop 50%.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s Innovations\nDeepSeek has reportedly restructured the foundation of AI models, emphasizing software-driven resource optimization over hardware dependency. Although the company apparently utilizes tens of thousands of Nvidia\u2019s H100 and H200 AI GPUs to train its models, it has faced constraints due to U.S. export controls limiting access to the latest chips. To overcome this, DeepSeek has implemented innovative engineering tweaks, such as custom communication schemes between chips to improve data transfer efficiency, memory-saving techniques, and reinforcement learning methods to minimize computational power requirements. These optimizations result in drastically lower costs compared to traditional large language models. Separately, up 45% in a week? See: What\u2019s Happening With Tempus AI (TEM) Stock?\n\n\nThis cost efficiency is reflected in the API pricing for DeepSeek-R1, which costs just $0.55 per million input tokens and $2.19 per million output tokens \u2014 significantly undercutting OpenAI\u2019s API rates of $15 and $60, respectively. However, it remains unclear how quickly DeepSeek can expand its reach. The company\u2019s commercial ambitions could face challenges due to the U.S. chip ban. More importantly, geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China could create trust issues for companies considering using Chinese-built large language models. These factors could limit DeepSeek\u2019s penetration in Western markets. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.\n\nImpact On GPU Makers Like Nvidia\nThat being said, we believe that DeepSeek\u2019s advancements could prompt a moment of reckoning for big tech companies. DeepSeek\u2019s resource-efficient methods could force a reconsideration of brute-force AI strategies that rely on massive investments in computing power. Nvidia has been the largest beneficiary of this approach through the AI boom, with its GPUs regarded as the best performing for training and deploying AI models. Over the past two years, companies have funneled massive resources into building AI models, driving Nvidia\u2019s revenue up by over 125% in fiscal year 2024 to $61 billion, with net margins nearing 50%.\nMORE FOR YOU\u2018The Floodgates Open\u2019\u2014Bitcoin And Crypto Brace For A $9 Trillion Fed Price FlipGoogle Chrome Attack Warning\u2014Stop Using Your Passwords\u2018NYT Mini\u2019 Clues And Answers For Wednesday, March 19\n\nIf the industry begins to take inspiration from the methods DeepSeek uses in its open-source models, we could very well see demand for AI Computing power cool off. The underlying economics of the broader AI ecosystem have been weak in the first place, and most of Nvidia\u2019s customers likely aren\u2019t generating meaningful returns on their investments. This could accelerate the shift toward more cost-effective, resource-optimized AI models.\n\nNow the increase in NVDA stock over the last four-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, 239% in 2023, and 171% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could NVDA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months \u2014 or will it see a strong jump?\n\n\nWe see a possibility that the \u201cfear-of-missing-out\u201d driven AI wave seen over the last two years could ease off due to diminishing incremental performance gains from larger models and also as the availability of high-quality training data becomes a bottleneck. This shift toward more efficient models could compound the impact of a potential slowdown for GPU makers such as Nvidia.\nMoreover, Nvidia also faces mounting competition from the likes of AMD as well as its own customers such as Amazon, who have been focusing on developing and deploying their own AI chips. While Nvidia does have a comprehensive software ecosystem around its AI processors, including programming languages that should help it better lock customers into its products, the company could face pressure. Nvidia\u2019s premium valuation may not fully reflect these risks. We value Nvidia stock at about $93 per share, roughly 35% below the current market price.

Deploying thousands will change the way we live,\u201d said Chris Urmson, CEO and co-founder at Aurora. \u201cNVIDIA is the market leader in accelerated computing, and they\u2019ll strengthen our ecosystem of partners and our ability to deliver safe and reliable driverless trucks to our customers at scale.\u201d\u201cDeveloping, industrializing, and manufacturing powerful self-driving hardware at commercial scale requires unique and unparalleled expertise,\u201d said Aruna Anand, President & CEO, Automotive, Continental North America. \u201cOur industry-first collaboration with Aurora and NVIDIA to deliver driverless trucks positions Continental at the forefront of this cutting-edge technology and will drive value to our business.\u201d\u201cThe combination of NVIDIA\u2019s automotive-grade DRIVE Thor platform with Aurora\u2019s advanced self-driving trucking technology and Continental\u2019s manufacturing and integration expertise is set to help drive the future of autonomous trucking, helping make roads safer while driving up operational efficiency,\u201d said Rishi Dhall, vice president of automotive at NVIDIA.\u00a0\n                Delivering safe, highly performant and reliable driverless trucks\n            Aurora \u2013 a leader in autonomous trucks \u2013 is in the final stages of validating the Aurora Driver for driverless operations on public roads. The Aurora Driver is equipped with a powerful computer and sensors, including lidar, radar, and cameras, enabling it to safely operate at highway speeds. Verifiable AI enables the Aurora Driver to quickly adapt to new operating domains while being validated through Aurora's Safety Case, an essential tool for regulatory trust and public acceptance. Aurora plans to launch its driverless trucking service in Texas in April 2025.NVIDIA will power the primary computer of the Aurora Driver with a dual NVIDIA DRIVE Thor SoC configuration that runs DriveOS. DRIVE Thor, built on the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, is designed to accelerate inference tasks critical for autonomous vehicles to understand and navigate the world around them. As Continental and Aurora prepare to manufacture self-driving hardware at scale in 2027, production samples of DRIVE Thor are coming in the first half of 2025.Continental \u2013 one of the world's largest automotive suppliers \u2013 is developing a reliable, serviceable, cost-efficient generation of the Aurora Driver hardware, specifically for high-volume manufacturing. The company is also developing a specialized independent secondary system that can take over operation if a failure occurs in the primary Aurora Driver computer. With\u00a0start of production planned\u00a0for 2027, Continental will test prototypes of the future hardware kit in the coming months. Continental will then integrate DRIVE Thor with DriveOS into the primary Aurora Driver computer at its manufacturing facilities and ship the full hardware kit to Aurora\u2019s truck OEM partners for integration into customers\u2019 trucks.\n                Continental and Aurora at CES 2025\n            To learn more about this news and partnership, please visit Continental\u2019s booth at CES.
