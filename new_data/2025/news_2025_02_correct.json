Upgrade Now           Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Buying Back Its Stock?       Maxim G.   Tue, Feb 25, 2025, 10:39 PM 6 min read                 In This Article:    NVDA          We recently published a list of 10 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other companies that are buying back their stock in 2025. Stock repurchases are the most discretionary form of capital allocation and have also become over time the most dominant for the US corporations. Unlike dividends, which create a recurring obligation, or capital expenditures, which are often a necessity to maintain the business operations going, buybacks offer flexibility \u2013 companies can repurchase shares when excess cash is available and halt the program during downturns or when capital allocation priorities shift. A buyback reduces the number of outstanding shares, effectively increasing earnings per share, and are therefore often seen as a form of instant gratification \u2013 prefer immediate upward pressure on stock prices over long-term gains from strategic reinvestments. Critics argue that buybacks can signal a lack of attractive reinvestment opportunities in the core business, as firms would most likely prioritize any potential project that could strengthen the competitive position and boost the growth trajectory. While such scenarios are certainly possible in some cases, proponents view stock repurchases as a natural adjustment to limited or uncertain growth opportunities or a way to return excess cash to investors in a more tax-efficient way than dividends.   Also read:\u00a010 Technology Stocks with Insider Buying in 2024 One of the primary reasons behind stock buybacks is to support the share price during periods of economic uncertainty or market volatility. It is well known that the management possesses insider information and has much greater visibility into the business trajectory; thus, when a company perceives that its stock is undervalued and repurchases significant amount of its own stock, it can signal confidence and boost morale among the entire shareholder base. Successful investors like\u00a0Warren Buffett\u00a0have spoken favorably about buybacks when executed at prices below intrinsic value, emphasizing that they can be an intelligent use of capital when alternative investments offer lower returns. However, buybacks have also faced scrutiny for their potential to artificially inflate stock prices and reward executives who are compensated based on EPS growth. The debate intensifies when companies borrow money to finance these operations, which can strain balance sheets in times of economic distress and depletes the cash reserves without any claw-back option.   Story Continues   Recent legislative developments have placed buybacks under greater regulatory and tax scrutiny \u2013 the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 introduced a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases, aimed at curbing excessive reliance on buybacks and encouraging reinvestment in business operations and employee wages. In short, the purpose behind these regulatory attempts was to limit the hoarding of capital into investors\u2019 hands and stimulate reinvestments that would fuel economic growth and create jobs. Despite this, repurchase activity remains robust, with S&P 500 firms continuing to allocate substantial capital to buybacks. For reference, data published by S&P Global shows that the total dollar volume of stock repurchases during 3Q 2024 increased 22% YoY. Some investors argue that government regulations will have limited impact, as corporations may simply adjust capital allocation strategies or increase leverage to maintain shareholder returns. As the US stock market experienced a strong rally throughout 2024 and reaching new all-time highs in the second half of the year extending into 2025, studying companies that repurchase significant amounts of their own stock may offer unique insights into their business; the key question to answer though is whether these operations signal an undervalued stock price or a lack of profitable reinvestment opportunities in the near-term. Our Methodology For our list of companies that are buying back stock we selected the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 index with the largest dollar volume of shares repurchased during Q3 2024, as reported by the S&P Dow Jones Indices. We ranked them according to their buyback activity for the quarter and also added the number of hedge fund holders for each company in this analysis. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 208 percentage points (see more details here).   Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Buying Back Its Stock in 2025?   A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Q3 2024 buybacks: $12.68 billion Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a global leader in accelerated computing, best known for its cutting-edge GPUs that power gaming, AI, data centers, and autonomous systems. Originally dominant in gaming hardware, NVDA has expanded into high-performance computing, AI-driven applications, and enterprise solutions, with its GPUs playing a crucial role in AI model training, machine learning, and deep learning. The company\u2019s innovations extend to industries such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and digital twins. The California-based company ranked\u00a02nd\u00a0on our recent list of\u00a010 Hot AI Stocks to Buy Now.   NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was among the best performers and highest market movers during the calendar 2024, as demand for its state-of-the-art GPUs remained exceptional throughout the year. Companies scaled their infrastructure of GPUs to support next-generation AI models training, multimodal, and agentic AI, deep learning recommender engines, generative AI inference and content creation workloads, and hence sales of H200 chips increased significantly to double-digit billions, the fastest prod ramp in NVDA\u2019s history. Going forward, the company is focusing on three major areas: digital health, digital biology, and digital devices, with digital biology representing a $300 billion opportunity. NVDA already announced significant partnerships with IQVIA to accelerate clinical trials, Arc Institute to develop biology foundation models, Illumina for genomics advancement, and Mayo Clinic for AI-driven digital pathology. The beauty of NVDA is that it\u2019s not a capex-intensive business, meaning that it can pursue new growth opportunities with minimal incremental cash outflows. Consequently, the only viable option to dispose of its $28 billion operating cash flow during 2024 (more than 5x the 2023 level) is to return it to investors through discretionary stock repurchases. Overall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of companies that are buying back their stock in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. \u00a0 READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap \u00a0 Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Jim Cramer on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): The \u2018Split\u2019s Over\u2019      Ramish Cheema   February 26, 2025 6 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses These 12 Stocks, Elon Musk & President Trump. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. In his recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer shared his thoughts about Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk's role in the government, and its impact on his companies. Commenting on industry concerns about his government efficiency initiatives impacting his companies, Cramer shared that his car, AI, and rocket companies have \"seen valuations soar in recent months. So, again, the complainers, they really have to re-think their view.\" Musk \"is creating wealth,\" Cramer believes as he added that \"he's [Musk] changing the government. Cramer then wondered \"is he President Musk?\" and asked, \"Who is The Apprentice?\"  When asked if he didn't have a problem with Musk splitting his between two companies \"No, I don't think that Dorsey, I did give him grief because it wasn't clear that he was for everyone. This guy favors every. . . .look I, he is remarkable. I just don't want him to show up here.\" He added: \"Look what do you do, when it says, Elon Musk on line two? What do you do?\" Another hot topic that caught Cramer's attention was the SEC purportedly dropping its lawsuit against one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the US. He shared: \"Well look we always know why that it was a parochial view that Gensler took. Uh, Tim Massad over at the CFTC didn't take that view. He said it's going to be huge overseas because they got even less faith in their currencies than we have. And it's got a lot more portability than gold. Look I'm a huge believer in it. I don't know if I'm a believer in the big buck, but I am a believer in Bitcoin because I believe the thirty-six trillion, I don't know what to do with the thirty-six trillion in debt. I haven't figured that out yet, David. I thought when you spoke to Mnuchin, you would push the fifty-year bond that you know I'm a huge believer in.\"  However, Cramer added that what former SEC chair Gary Gensler also \"really didn't like were the bogus coins! He didn't wanna see that. . .\" The CNBC TV host also commented on AI and Elon Musk's xAI announcing its Grok 3 model Cramer thought \"it [Grok 3] was okay. I think it was okay. I don't know, I caught ChatGPT hallucinating like mad yesterday. No, look, Grok 3's okay.\" When asked whether AI could displace a substantive portion of jobs, he shared:   Story Continues \"I do think that there are few employees in areas that are drone-like, but there are more employees in areas that really matter. I know Salesforce, really interesting that they're talking about, you know lack of code. But they are putting people in a much more substantive position. I think banks will do that too.\" Returning to Musk's DOGE, he shared:\"Uh, okay so there's this piece in The Atlantic. 'This Is What Happens When The DOGE Guys Take Over,' I want everyone to read this piece. Because what it is, is they come in and they take over your computer and they find out what's wrong. And it is devastating. Because they're going into companies and really, and they're going into agencies, and just taking over. It's a great article. It's heavily sourced. And one of the things that's really clear about it is they're winning. They're winning. They're finding things. And they tend to be in agencies so far which are, you know, I think of like the Consumer Financial Safety Board. They're in there heavily. They tend be on to agencies that frankly many people would say, Democrat agencies. Democrat agencies.\" As for DOGE rapidly firing and re-hiring people, he commented: \"This thing is done so ad-hoc, uh, there is, there's almost no due process whatsoever. If you overwhelm the courts, and just make it so that they have to constantly take up these matters then, then DOGE wins. That seems to be the pattern. They can overwhelm the court system with all these different, if they just keep going after agency, after agency.\"Our MethodologyTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on February 21st.For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) the Tech Stock with Best Earnings Growth in 2025?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q4 2024: 223NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the AI GPU firm that has taken the market by storm over the past couple of years. Its shares have gained triple-digit percentages on the back of its GPUs being able to power the AI revolution. However, the narrative surrounding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has shifted slightly after the DeepSeek selloff. Investors, who were already cautious during H2 2024, are now waiting on the sidelines to see whether it can sustain massive AI GPU demand. As for Cramer, it appears that the jitters surrounding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are also getting to him:\"[On NVDA's upcoming earnings] No it's going to be very, very important. . . .yeah and there's four different notes today saying don't worry about the quarter so I don't like that. We need, we, those who own it like my Charitable Trust, we don't want any expectations. Especially cause Blackwell, it's just now shipping for some companies. That's the latest and greatest. And we do like, David, there seemed a secret Atlanta warehouse for Musk where he bought a lot of GPUs. I don't know if you're aware of the secret Atlanta.\"\"The Atlanta data center, I'm reading Business Insider, has sizable computing power. . .for X and xAI. You know what this is David? Twelve thousand GPUs they bought, seven hundred million dollars worth of equipment. Again, another check, presuming for Jensen Huang. Remember when they had split? That split's over.\" Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Maintains \u2018Buy\u2019 Rating as AI Demand Fuels Growth Potential      Ghazal Ahmed   February 26, 2025 4 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI Stocks Worth Watching Today.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. The R1 model is going to get a successor soon. For those who don\u2019t know, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek wreaked havoc in the tech world last month with its cut-price AI reasoning model, the R1, claiming that it outperforms many Western competitors.  Only a month later, hundreds of Chinese companies have already integrated the AI model into their products and services. At least 13 Chinese city governments and 10 state-owned energy companies also report deploying DeepSeek into their systems. Tech giants Lenovo, Baidu, and Tencent have integrated it too. Goldman Sachs anticipates that the country\u2019s economy will reflect the positive impact of AI adoption from next year. \u201cThe recent emergence of DeepSeek ... suggests faster AI development and adoption in China than we previously anticipated.\"  READ ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Dominating Headlines\u00a0and 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm The impact of the emergence was so intense, that it triggered a $1 trillion-plus sell-off in global equities markets last month. While the initial release of the R2 model was scheduled for release sometime in May, the company is now planning to launch it as early as possible. \u201cDeepSeek demonstrates that China is at or near the cutting edge of AI development, which boosts the prestige of China\u2019s economy and tech ecosystem, making them more attractive for global investors\u201d.  DeepSeek is expecting highly of its new model too. The company said that it hopes that its new model will be able to produce better coding and be able to reason in languages beyond English. While competitors are still dealing with the implications of the R1 model, only time will tell how the market is going to react to its successor. \"The launch of DeepSeek's R2 model could be a pivotal moment in the AI industry. DeepSeek's success at creating cost-effective AI models \"would likely spur companies worldwide to accelerate their own efforts ... breaking the stranglehold of the few dominant players in the field\u201d.  For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.   Story Continues Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points \u00a0(see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) the Tech Stock with Best Earnings Growth in 2025?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services. On February 25, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the stock with an associated price target of $190.00. Even though the stock has underperformed compared to the broader market, the stock is still being considered as undervalued. It is being traded at a price-to-earnings ratio that is lower than its historical average, presenting an attractive entry point for investors ahead of the company\u2019s earnings print.Hyperscaler continue to choose NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as their preferred platform owing to its robust ecosystem, with demand for GPUs outstripping supply. Moreover, since the demand for Nvidia\u2019s current products is robust, the delay in the Blackwell product ramp is not likely to tarnish Nvidia\u2019s market position. In addition, artificial intelligence advancements are expected to drive the adoption of the company\u2019s technology, advocating for its long-term growth prospects.Overall NVDA ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks worth watching today. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a020 Best AI Stock To Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a0Complete List of All AI Companies Under $2 Billion Market Cap.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Jim Cramer Says \u2018The Selling In NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) World Is So Vicious\u2019      Syeda Seirut Javed   February 27, 2025 5 min read        4   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Commented on 12 Stocks Linked to Data Centers.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks that are linked to data centers. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, highlighted the growing significance of data centers as a major theme in the technology sector during Tuesday\u2019s episode. He pointed out that although it might not always be immediately visible in the broader market indices, data centers have become a significant investment focus. \u201cThe data center has been the single biggest investment story for months on end, even if it\u2019s not always obvious from the averages\u2026 This sea-change, one that we are undergoing in real time, with the data center theme suddenly going from positive to negative, is buried within the broader indices, but it\u2019s like a living, breathing, seething animal, a snorting bull turned into a grizzly, scratching and clawing back the gains in your portfolio.\u201d  READ ALSO: Jim Cramer on 10 Stocks With The Biggest Declines Last Week and Jim Cramer Recently Shed Light on These 9 Stocks Cramer offered a historical perspective, tracing the rise of NVIDIA, a graphics and gaming chip maker, as pivotal to the development of modern data centers. He explained that the company\u2019s invention of a semiconductor capable of enabling both accelerated computing and generative artificial intelligence became foundational to a wide range of technologies. \u201cThis semiconductor becomes the backbone of electric vehicles, of robots, and most important, of the data centers themselves\u2026 Huge warehouses full of servers. No large tech company worth its salt can afford to do without these data centers.\u201d  However, Cramer revealed that the situation took a dramatic turn when a Chinese company found a way to achieve similar results with fewer, less expensive chips, throwing the entire data center industry into turmoil. Describing the company as \"the odd man out of the Magnificent Seven,\" Cramer emphasized the company's central role in the tech market, noting that its products are essential to the operations of numerous tech companies. Cramer pointed out that President Trump's administration may impose tighter export controls on Chinese technology, which could further complicate the company\u2019s market position.  Among the companies most at risk from these changes, Cramer singled out semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment players, with the GPU kingpin standing out as the most exposed. He concluded by suggesting that some people even argue that the company\u2019s performance could be decisive to the future fortunes of major momentum stocks in the tech sector.   Story Continues Our MethodologyFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on February 25.

Is NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) the Tech Stock with Best Earnings Growth in 2025?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223Cramer noted the investors\u2019 slipping confidence in data centers, which carries the possibility of impacting NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) but urged that the company\u2019s upcoming earnings release will clarify many things.\u201cTomorrow evening, Nvidia reports so right now I think we have two markets. There's the market that's dependent on Nvidia and its fellow tech titans\u2026 The selling in Nvidia world is so vicious. To the sellers, it can be only one victor and they think it's not gonna be the data centers\u2026 NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), known for its advancements in graphics, computing, and networking technologies, is seeing significant growth due to its GPUs and the CUDA software platform, both of which are essential to AI infrastructure.Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Jim Cramer on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): \u2018We\u2019re Gonna Continue to Own It\u2019      Syeda Seirut Javed   February 25, 2025 4 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Talked About These 12 Stocks Recently.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks. On Friday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, discussed the recent struggles in the market and how the downturn in momentum stocks has significantly affected aggressive growth investors. He pointed out the complexities of the market on Friday, explaining how things took a drastic turn for the worse. According to Cramer, the market can be divided into two distinct categories: one driven by momentum and the other focused on traditional growth. \u201cAlright, we got two markets right now. One is all about momentum. The other is all about old-fashioned growth. Momentum is nasty right now. Classic growth, well, it is cruising.\u201d  READ ALSO Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 17 Stocks in Focus and Jim Cramer Discussed These 11 Stocks Recently Despite the numbers, Cramer noted that these dynamics were not immediately obvious when you look at the broader averages, with the Dow dropping 749 points, the S&P falling 1.71%, and the Nasdaq plummeting by 2.2% on Friday. He said that investors heavily invested in momentum stocks are finding it increasingly difficult like they are struggling to breathe after the \u201coxygen\u201d was taken away. Cramer said that on the other hand, those with investments in established growth stocks and diversified portfolios are faring much better. He mentioned that these stocks have performed well for the first time in quite a while, offering a bit of relief for those holding them. Reflecting on the sharp downturn in the market, Cramer explained that the situation can be traced back to several concerning economic indicators. He added: \u201cThis week, we got a series of readings, key numbers for home sales, consumer sentiment that show true softness, and a sense that maybe things are starting to go off the rails in the economy. Well, that's incredible given the surprising head of steam we had going into 2025.\u201d  Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on February 21. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).   Story Continues   NVIDIA (NVDA) Gears Up for Pivotal AI Earnings as Analysts Stay Bullish  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was mentioned during the episode and here\u2019s what Cramer had to say about it:\u201cThe fact is the stock is up huge still. Now we say own it, don't trade it but we had to take a little bit off the top because we didn't wanna be the Nvidia fund, but you need to know this, when the stock is at this big a move, no matter what they say when they report next week, it may not be enough. So there are people who are taking profits now ahead of when it reports so they can buy stock back if they want to or they just say, you know what? We've made so much money\u2026 in this company that we're not gonna make anymore. I personally feel that it's a great long-term investment and we've owned it for long term. We're gonna continue to own it.\u201d NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), recognized for its innovations in graphics, computing, and networking technologies, is experiencing substantial growth with its GPUs and the CUDA software platform, which are crucial components of AI infrastructure. The company stock went up more than 69% over the past year.Overall NVDA ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Why Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Is Retreating Today      Larry Ramer   February 26, 2025 2 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       Nvidia (NVDA) is sinking 3% after Bloomberg reported that the U.S. government is looking to tighten the restrictions on AI chips that can be exported to other nations without a license, Bloomberg reported today. Additionally, members of the Trump administration asked two U.S. allies to put additional restrictions on China's semiconductor sector, according to the news service.  The Trump Administration's New Moves on Chips Washington is in the midst of \"early conversations\" about adding new restrictions on the amount of AI chips that can be sold to other countries without obtaining a license from the U.S. government, unnamed sources said, according to Bloomberg. Additionally, American officials spoke to Japanese and Dutch government representatives in order to convince them to prevent Chinese firms from using chip-making equipment made by Japanese and Dutch companies.   NVIDIA (NVDA) Sees Strong AI Demand Despite GB200 NVL Server Constraints   Previously, the administration has discussed putting additional curbs on the type of chips that Nvidia can sell to Chinese firms. More Information About NVDA Nvidia is slated to report its fiscal fourth-quarter results after the market closes tomorrow. Analysts on average expect the company to report that its Q4 EPS rose to 85 cents from 52 cents during the same period a year earlier. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Upgrade Now          Jim Cramer on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): \u2018Don\u2019t Have Any Expectations Of This Particular Quarter\u2019      Syeda Seirut Javed   February 28, 2025 5 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Thoughts on 8 Stocks As He Discussed Market Froth.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, discussed how \"froth\" is currently affecting the market, explaining that trend-driven stocks need to experience a decline before more stable stocks can begin to recover. \u201cThe fad stocks, they need to go down before non-fad stocks can triumph. That's what's happening. It's just a fact of life in this business.\u201d  READ ALSO: Jim Cramer Commented on 12 Stocks Linked to Data Centers and Jim Cramer Commented on 12 Stocks Linked to Data Centers After a rough week marked by a significant downturn in trendy stocks, Cramer pointed out that it is a rare positive sign in an otherwise negative environment that the trend seems to be running its course. Cramer reflected on the market's performance, mentioning that the Dow managed to inch up by 33 points, while the S&P 500 fell by 0.5%. However, the Nasdaq dropped by 1.21%, turning negative for the year.  He also stressed that the decline primarily occurred toward the end of the trading day, which he found unusual and concerning, though he was not sure about the specific cause of the abrupt drop. \"It was pronounced, it was nasty,\" Cramer remarked, highlighting the sharpness of the downturn. \u201cNow, nobody wants anybody to lose money, including me, but there's a thing called froth, and we gotta talk about it as froth is the enemy of prudence. Smart investing requires a degree of prudence, something that's highly incompatible with froth.\u201d  He explained that smart investment strategies require a certain degree of caution, which frothy market conditions cannot support. He pointed out that for a period, the market had been filled with froth but lacked prudence, especially evident during the turbulent trading seen late last week. However, Cramer noted that as the froth subsides, investors are turning to assets with more durability and longevity. He specifically mentioned that drug stocks have been performing well recently. \u201cSo here's the bottom line: Once these frothy momentum stocks come in enough, then we will finally be in a much more straightforward world, a world where what tends to rally is not the sizzle, but the steak.\u201d  Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on February 24. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.   Story Continues Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Magic Formula Stock for 2025?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was mentioned during the episode and here\u2019s what Cramer had to say:\u201cIt's terrifying when you own a nuclear power derivative and a big nuclear believer says it might not need that much, that much energy. Either that or it isn't going to order a lot of chips from NVIDIA, which reports Wednesday. I'm trying to prep you. Of course, this whole alleged slowdown in the data center occurs right in front of NVIDIA's earnings. Here's a terrific company with a stock that's just absolutely wilted. I mean unbelievable. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), recognized for its innovations in graphics, computing, and networking technologies, is experiencing substantial growth driven by its GPUs and the CUDA software platform, both of which play an important role in AI infrastructure. The company delivered another beat and raise quarter on Wednesday when it reported results for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2025, posting an EPS of $0.89 on revenue of $39.33 billion. The Street was looking for $0.85 in per share earnings on sales of $38.14 billion. Here's what Cramer said after the company's latest earnings beat on February 26:\u201cNow, I don't wanna obscure the company where the stock\u2026 that I always say own, don't trade Nvidia. After the close, it was a very good quarter. Everyone thought this would be the most eventful quarter of earnings season, but it was a non-event. Why? Because it was terrific and Jensen Huang gives us terrific numbers. Overall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) Q4 Sales Top Estimates, Provides Encouraging Quarterly Revenue Guidance      Anthony Lee   February 27, 2025 5 min read        4   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%         Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) Q4 Sales Top Estimates, Provides Encouraging Quarterly Revenue Guidance   Leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported revenue ahead of Wall Street\u2019s expectations in Q4 CY2024, with sales up 77.9% year on year to $39.33 billion. Guidance for next quarter\u2019s revenue was optimistic at $43 billion at the midpoint, 2.1% above analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.89 per share was 5.2% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Find out in our full research report. Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 CY2024 Highlights: Revenue: $39.33 billion vs analyst estimates of $38.34 billion (77.9% year-on-year growth, 2.6% beat) Adjusted EPS: $0.89 vs analyst estimates of $0.85 (5.2% beat) Adjusted Operating Income: $25.52 billion vs analyst estimates of $24.55 billion (64.9% margin, 3.9% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q1 CY2025 is $43 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $42.11 billion Operating Margin: 61.1%, in line with the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 39.5%, down from 50.9% in the same quarter last year Inventory Days Outstanding: 86, up from 78 in the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $3.10 trillion  \u201cDemand for Blackwell is amazing as reasoning AI adds another scaling law \u2014 increasing compute for training makes models smarter and increasing compute for long thinking makes the answer smarter,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. Company Overview Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang and two former Sun Microsystems engineers, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading fabless designer of chips used in gaming, PCs, data centers, automotive, and a variety of end markets. Processors and Graphics Chips The biggest demand drivers for processors (CPUs) and graphics chips at the moment are secular trends related to 5G and Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and high performance computing in the data center space, specifically around AI and machine learning. Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles. Sales Growth A company\u2019s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last five years, Nvidia grew its sales at an incredible 64.2% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth surpassed the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a great starting point for our analysis. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions (which can sometimes offer opportune times to buy).   Story Continues   Nvidia Quarterly Revenue  We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within semiconductors, a half-decade historical view may miss new demand cycles or industry trends like AI. Nvidia\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 120% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was strong and recently accelerated.  Nvidia Year-On-Year Revenue Growth  This quarter, Nvidia reported magnificent year-on-year revenue growth of 77.9%, and its $39.33 billion of revenue beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 2.6%. Despite the beat, this was its third consecutive quarter of decelerating growth, potentially indicating that the current upcycle is losing a bit of\u00a0steam. Company management is currently guiding for a 65.1% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 50.9% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. Still, this projection is eye-popping given its scale and implies the market is baking in success for its products and services.Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

In a tight supply environment, inventories tend to be stable, allowing chipmakers to exert pricing power. Steadily increasing DIO can be a warning sign that demand is weak, and if inventories continue to rise, the company may have to downsize production.This quarter, Nvidia\u2019s DIO came in at 86, which is 18 days below its five-year average. These numbers show that despite the recent increase, there\u2019s no indication of an excessive inventory buildup.  Nvidia Inventory Days Outstanding  Key Takeaways from Nvidia\u2019s Q4 ResultsWe enjoyed seeing Nvidia beat analysts\u2019 revenue, EPS, and adjusted operating income expectations this quarter. We were also glad next quarter's revenue guidance topped Wall Street\u2019s estimates. On the other hand, its inventory levels increased materially. Still, this quarter had some key positives and the stock remained flat at $130.65 immediately following the results.Zooming out, investors are likely breathing a sigh of relief as many were afraid that some combination of DeepSeek's emergence and rumors surrounding weaker demand for Microsoft's cloud offerings would negatively impact results. These fears were reflected in Nvidia's options contract pricing going into the print, which implied a 10%+ move in either direction.Big picture, is Nvidia a buy here and now? When making that decision, it\u2019s important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

Upgrade Now          One ridiculous chart on Nvidia ahead of earnings      Brian Sozzi   \u00b7 Executive Editor Updated February 24, 2025 3 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%    META   +1.67%    AMZN   +1.00%    AMD   +0.04%    AVGO   +0.65%       This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings  I have asked around my circles and can't seem to get a straight answer on why Nvidia's (NVDA) stock looks so cheaply valued on a price-to-earnings multiple basis.  So, I am coming to you for answers \u2014 drop them to me on X @BrianSozzi. What am I missing with Nvidia? Let's discuss! I caution this is not me suggesting a Nvidia buying spree heading into earnings on Feb. 26. Yahoo Finance isn't a stock trading platform or investment bank. We are in the context game as it pertains to investing. This is just a general callout that the market may have a flaw in how it's valuing Nvidia. Nvidia is among the most cheaply valued AI stocks at the moment, if you can wrap your head around that one! On a forward price-to-earnings multiple basis, Yahoo Finance data shows Nvidia trading at 31 times. Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL) are valued at 35 times and 41 times, respectively. Arm Holdings (ARM) clocks in at 76 times. Listen: What Bill Gates thinks of Nvidia's CEO NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    110.15 +1.77 (+1.63%)  At close: 4:00:00 PM EDT  109.40 -0.75 (-0.68%) Pre-Market: 5:39:26 AM EDT   Advanced Chart    Zoom out further, and Nvidia's stock is trading at a discount to several other \"Magnificent Seven\" members. Tesla's (TSLA) stock is trading at 121 times forward earnings. Amazon (AMZN) trades at 36 times. There are two reasons for this odd valuation level on Nvidia, the former analyst in me posits. One, the Street is underbaking its forward estimates on Nvidia's earnings power. Yahoo Finance data shows Nvidia's first quarter earnings per share (EPS) trend has drifted modestly lower over the past 30 days. The Street has also not pushed up its 2025 EPS estimates on Nvidia for more than 60 days.  I find this bizarre. Despite China-based DeepSeek rocking the super-bullish AI thesis earlier this year, Wall Street still sees Nvidia profiting from the global buildout of AI infrastructure. Aggressive 2025 capital expenditures assumptions by hyperscalers such as Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) shared during this earnings season underscore the point. \"Over the coming decades, the investment [in artificial intelligence] is happening,\" Russell Investments chief investment officer Kate El-Hillow told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above).   Then the other possible explanation is with EPS estimates not rising, Nvidia's stock price is in wait-and-see mode. While the stock has rallied hard off the February DeepSeek lows, it has still underperformed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) this year. Shares are down from early November 2024 highs.   Story Continues Given the DeepSeek and China trade war worries, I get it. But I come right back to the impressive structural drivers powering Nvidia's business.Notes KeyBanc analyst John Vinh, \"Nvidia remains uniquely positioned to benefit from AI/ML secular data center growth within the industry. With significant barriers to entry created by its CUDA software stack, we see limited competitive risks and expect Nvidia to continue to dominate one of the fastest-growing workloads in cloud and enterprise.\"I suspect seconds after earnings hit on Feb. 26 after the close, this valuation disparity may be more easily explained.The Yahoo Finance team will do just that. We are having a live Nvidia earnings special on Feb. 26 starting at 4 p.m. ET running right through 6 p.m. ET. The next day, I will have a live episode of my Opening Bid podcast at 8:30 a.m. ET with a great roundtable of Nvidia pros.Tune in to our new Streaming Now section on the Yahoo Finance homepage, our app, or major streaming platforms.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia (NVDA) Just Flashed Golden Cross Signal: Do You Buy?      Zacks Equity Research   February 27, 2025 1 min read              In This Article:  NVDA         Nvidia (NVDA) reached a significant support level, and could be a good pick for investors from a technical perspective. Recently, NVDA broke through the 20-day moving average, which suggests a short-term bullish trend. The 20-day simple moving average is a popular trading tool. It provides a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period, and is beneficial to short-term traders since it smooths out price fluctuations and provides more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages. Similar to other SMAs, if a stock's price moves above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive, while price falling below the moving average can signal a downward trend.   Moving Average Chart for NVDA   Shares of NVDA have been moving higher over the past four weeks, up 6.1%. Plus, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, suggesting that NVDA could be poised for a continued surge. The bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account NVDA's positive earnings estimate revisions. There have been 2 revisions higher for the current fiscal year compared to none lower, and the consensus estimate has moved up as well. Investors should think about putting NVDA on their watchlist given the ultra-important technical indicator and positive move in earnings estimate revisions.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA a Lucrative Buy With Solid Visions, Execution and Innovation      Nalak Das   February 28, 2025 7 min read              In This Article:  NVDA         On Feb. 26, after the closing bell, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA \u2014 the undisputed global leader of the generative artificial intelligence (AI)-powered graphical processing units (GPUs) \u2014 released outstanding fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings results and strong guidance for first-quarter fiscal 2026. Yet, the stock price of NVDA plummeted 8.5% on Feb. 27 on concerns of a minor miss in adjusted gross margin and slowing growth of year-over-year revenues and earnings as we have seen in the last several quarters. Concerns about a possible tariff on NVIDIA\u2019s inputs and export restrictions also dampened investors\u2019 sentiment.  Irrespective of these drawbacks, NVIDIA has been able to keep the flag high with its path-breaking vision, innovation and solid execution. The recent decline in stock price has actually placed NVDA in negative territory year to date. We believe that, at this stage, NVIDIA offers a lucrative buying opportunity for the rest of 2025. Outstanding Q4 Fiscal 2025 Earnings Results NVIDIA came up with quarterly adjusted earnings of $0.89 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.84 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.52 per share a year ago. Reported quarterly revenues of $39.33 billion compare to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37.72 billion, representing a surprise of +4.3%. Despite this stellar performance, a section of financial researchers is complaining about slowing growth. NVIDIA\u2019s non-GAAP gross margin of 73.5% reflects a contraction of 3.2% on a year-over-year basis and 1.5% sequentially. This was primarily due to a transition to more complex and higher-cost systems within the Data Center segment.  The Data Center revenues came in at $35.58 billion compared with the consensus estimate of $33.51 billion, marking a jump of 93% year over year. Within this segment, Computing revenues were $$32.56 billion versus the consensus mark of $30.22 billion. Networking revenues were $3.02 billion versus the consensus estimate of $3.35 billion. Most importantly, NVDA has mostly resolved the supply-related issues of its next-generation Blackwell chips and ramped up its production and shipment. In the reported quarter, the company sold $11 billion Blackwell chips, higher than the consensus estimate of $6-7 billion. Strong Guidance NVIDIA expects an impressive first quarter fiscal 2026 buoyed by rock-solid demand for its AI-powered GPUs, and downplayed the Chinese DeepSeek-related availability of low-cost solution concerns. NVDA\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang said that the next-generation AI model requires more computing power. Per Huang, \u201cThe amount of computation necessary to do that reasoning process is 100 times more than what we used to do.\u201d   Story Continues NVDA anticipates first-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues of $43 billion (+/-2%), higher than the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41.06 billion. The non-GAAP gross margin is projected at 71% (+/-50 bps). Non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated at $3.6 billion.The consensus mark for non-GAAP gross margin is 72.1%. Nevertheless, an adjusted gross margin of more than 70% for a company that is the leader of a highly competitive high-end industry is something commendable.NVDA\u2019s Growth to Generate From Robust AI SpendingAI frenzy will continue with astonishing spending. The four major data center operators \u2014 Meta Platforms Inc. META, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Microsoft Crop. MSFT and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN pledged $325 billion as AI expenditure in 2025.On Jan 21, President Donald Trump unveiled a joint venture called \u201cStargate\u201d with OpenAI, Oracle Corp. (ORCL) and Softbank. The project will create an AI infrastructure, especially data centers in the United States.The initial investment of $100 billion can go up to $500 billion in the next four years. This expenditure will be in addition to Softbank\u2019s pledge of $100 billion in December to create AI infrastructure in the United States.Apple Inc. (AAPL) has decided to invest $500 billion over the next four years, part of which will be spent on developing and manufacturing AI servers to power its Apple Intelligence AI tools. Moreover, Meta Platforms is reportedly planning to construct a new data center campus for its AI projects, with potential costs exceeding $200 billion.Continuous InnovationsFor all the above-mentioned companies, NVIDIA is the largest chipset supplier. In addition to Blackwell, on June 2, 2024, NVDA unveiled its new AI chip architecture called Rubin. The Rubin architecture will have new GPUs to launch AI systems, CPUs and networking chips. It will also have new features like a central processor called Vera. Rubin is expected to be introduced in 2026.The automative industry may become another growth driver for NVIDIA in the future. In the last reported quarter, Automative segment revenues came in at $570 million compared with the consensus estimate of $472.35 million, up 102.9% year over year. The Automative segment\u2019s growth was primarily driven by NVDA\u2019s self-driving platforms. The company is increasingly focusing on powering ADAS, autonomous vehicles, and robotics.Excellent Estimate Revisions for NVDA StockNVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 45% and 41.1%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2026). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% in the last seven days.It has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 21.7% and 25.5%, respectively, for next year (ending January 2027). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 0.4% in the last seven days. NVDA has a long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth rate of 20%, outpacing the S&P 500 Index\u2019s 12.2% growth rate.  Zacks Investment Research  Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLucrative Valuation of NVDA SharesNVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. The company has a return on equity (ROE) of 122.83% compared with the S&P 500\u2019s ROE of 17.1% and the industry\u2019s ROE of a mere 6.4%.NVDA has a current net margin of 55.85% compared with the industry\u2019s net margin of 8.4% and the S&P 500\u2019s net margin of 12.57%. It has forward P/E (price/earnings) of 31.14% compared with the industry\u2019s P/E of 31.01% and the S&P 500\u2019s P/E of 18.9%.As of Jan. 26, 2025, NVDA\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $43.2 billion, up from $38.4 billion as of Oct. 27, 2024. The increases primarily reflect higher revenues partially offset by stock repurchases. As of Jan. 26, the total long-term debt was $8.46 billion, which remained unchanged sequentially. NVIDIA generated $16.6 billion in operating cash flow, up from the year-ago quarter\u2019s $11.5 billionThe short-term average price target of brokerage firms for the stock represents an increase of 35% from the last closing price of $120.15. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $220-$135. This indicates a maximum upside of 83.3% and no downside.  Zacks Investment Research  Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInvestment Thesis for NVDAShares of NVDA have seen a growth rate of -10.5% year to date. However, given that earnings estimate revisions are likely to trend higher in the coming weeks, many analysts are expected to raise their price targets. This will make NVDA\u2019s risk/reward ratio more favorable.NVIDIA represents a rare opportunity to invest in a company with proven execution and substantial unrealized potential in the AI revolution. At this stage, it will be prudent to buy this stock on every dip. Create a systematic investment plan for this stock to do a cost average.Hold this stock for the long term as the company\u2019s strong execution of the last several quarters and robust future projections will generate more value. Consequently, the stock price of NVIDIA should witness an attractive upside.The chart below shows the price performance of NVDA year to date.

Upgrade Now           Nvidia's margins outlook is 'a little concerning.' Here's why.         Julie Hyman   ,  Josh Lipton    and Brian Sozzi      Thu, Feb 27, 2025, 6:10 AM                  In This Article:    NVDA          Nvidia (NVDA) announced quarterly results that beat Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines, posting $39.3 billion in revenue (vs. forecasts of $38.25 billion) and adjusted earnings of $0.89 per share (vs. forecasts of $0.84 ) in its fourth quarter. The artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker's CEO Jensen Huang says AI is evolving at \"light speed\" as Nvidia reported data center sales topping estimates and issued slightly better-than-expected first quarter guidance.   Benchmark Company managing director and senior research analyst Cody Acree joins Yahoo Finance's Nvidia earnings special to talk about the earnings print with a focus on margins. \"It was a strong number really across the board,\" Acree says of Nvidia's figures, noting, \"I think the gross margins coming in at 73.5% is key\" as \"that was a level threshold that they had to hit to keep investors even modestly happy.\" Looking to the next quarter, Nvidia's gross margins outlook of 71% is \"a little concerning,\" the analyst says, explaining, \"I think that's indicative of more pricing pressure, more competition from AMD (AMD), and more price sensitivity at their customers as they're investing their own dollars to create their own ASICs [application specific integrated circuits].\" Related Videos      01:19  Tariffs Uncertainty Kicks the Risk Can Down the Road: BlackRock   Bloomberg \u2022 2 hours ago       02:55  Sectors worth investing in now (and one to avoid)   Yahoo Finance Video \u2022 11 hours ago       04:42  Tesla Struggles in China   Bloomberg \u2022 14 hours ago       07:32  Rivian Spins Off 'Micromobility' Startup Also   Bloomberg \u2022 15 hours ago    Acree says increased competition and pricing pressures are \"just the future that Nvidia has to live in\" but highlights that \"demand for their products looks to be extremely strong, and that's really going to be the key for Nvidia going forward.\" Watch Yahoo Finance's full Nvidia earnings special here or catch the replay on streaming platforms at 8 pm E.T.

Upgrade Now          Joshua Brown on DeepSeek Impact: \u2018End of Nvidia Corp (NVDA)\u2019 Rhetoric is \u2018Overdone\u2019      Fahad Saleem   February 27, 2025 5 min read        3   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of Analysts Are Talking About These 10 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0 stands against other stocks that analysts are talking about. Gene Munster from Deepwater Asset Management said in a latest program on CNBC that the AI hardware trade is still intact and the analyst believes DeepSeek is a net positive for the industry. \u201cThe consensus DeepSeek has been a positive for AI. I think when it comes to the cost of AI inference, it\u2019s going to go through the floor. Sam Altman said after DeepSeek that they expect the cost of tokens to go down 10 to 12x per year for their second-tier model. I mean, that\u2019s basically through the floor. And I think the third piece to this, if those two happen, we get this hardware build-out, we the cost of compute or the cost of inference declining. I think you\u2019re going to see some just profound impacts. And so I\u2019m still bullish on this market. I think that what we\u2019re seeing right now is a funk, and I think that we still got two great years left of this AI trade.\u201d  READ ALSO:\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently making moves on the back of the latest news. With each stock, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).   Joshua Brown on DeepSeek Impact: \u2018End of Nvidia Corp (NVDA)\u2019 Rhetoric is \u2018Overdone\u2019   A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 223 Joshua Brown, the CEO and Co-founder of Ritholtz Wealth Management, said while talking to CNBC following the DeepSeek-triggered selloff that the Chinese breakthrough will increase the usage of AI. However, he believes the chances of major companies using the Chinese model for their Cloud operations are thin. Overall, Brown believes the hype around the potential impact of DeepSeek on Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was overdone. \u201cMost of this conversation about the impact of deep seek is happening on Twitter. If you know anything about Twitter\u2014X\u2014if you know anything about X, you know it\u2019s loaded with hedge fund managers and asset managers who absolutely loathe the Mag 7. They\u2019ve been waiting for this moment for two years. These stocks, Nvidia in particular, have been making them look bad for 24 straight months, and they\u2019re dying for this moment where small caps are up, Europe is flat, value stocks are outperforming growth. They view this as comeuppance for the people who have been riding these giant tech stocks to huge gains. I think because there\u2019s that desire to see these investors get beaten up a little bit, maybe that\u2019s why some of the rhetoric about this being the end of Nvidia is getting so overdone.\u201d    Story Continues Mairs & Power Growth Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q4 2024 investor letter:\u201cWe prefer to invest in our backyard, as Minnesota and the Upper Midwest are blessed with a rich and diverse business community. As such, seven out of our 10 largest relative bets are based in our region (MN, WI, IA, SD, ND, IL). That said, we are unafraid to look beyond our geographic area if we find exceptional opportunities. In 2019, we found such an opportunity in a graphics processing technology company called\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA). At the time, we felt NVIDIA would be a good way to leverage the growing interest in video games, as most of its chips were popular amongst \u201cgamers\u201d to enhance graphics. But what really grabbed our interest was its smaller, albeit faster-growing, data center business that was positioned to benefit from the emergence of high-performance computing, such as deep learning and machine learning, and the related field of AI. The rest, as they say, is history. NVIDIA is one of a number of Technology holdings that we have added over the past decade, which has raised eyebrows since our Firm was well-known for avoiding the Tech Bubble in the late 1990s. Unlike the dot-com companies that operated at the turn-of-the-century, many of today\u2019s technology companies are established businesses with significant cash flows. We have argued, and continue to argue, that many of these investments are perfectly aligned with our investments process in that they embody durable competitive advantages, above-average growth prospects, and excellent management teams.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of stocks that analysts are talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Why NVDA Stock Is Rising Today      Larry Ramer   March 1, 2025 2 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       Nvidia (NVDA) is advancing 1.6% after Bank of America and WestEnd Capital Management expressed bullishness about the company and its shares in the wake of its fourth-quarter results. WestEnd Is Upbeat on NVDA's Blackwell Chip \"Based on (Nvidia's) Q4 numbers and also on (its) guidance, it seems like the demand for (its new) Blackwell\" chips \"is very, very strong,\" WestEnd Capital Management Senior Equity Analyst Ali Mogharabi told Yahoo Finance late yesterday.   Jim Cramer NVIDIA (NVDA)\u2019s Jensen Huang \u2018Should Be Able\u2019 to Speak More on DeepSeek Situation   Mogharabi believes that the overall \"demand for more customized chips could actually increase...as inference continues to improve, (and) the application of all of this AI technology widens.\u201d Bank of America Called NVDA \"a Top Pick\" Labeling NVDA stock a \u201ctop pick on AI dominance,\u201d Bank of America increased its price target on the shares to $200 from $190. The bank believes that the chip maker's data center business, whose revenue reached record levels in Q4, can benefit from \" strong, long-term demand dynamics.\u201d More Information About NVDA Stock The shares are changing hands at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 28 times. NVDA is up 2% in the last month and it is down 12% in the last three months, while it has dropped 9% so far in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 Earnings Report Preview: What To Look For      Radek Strnad   February 25, 2025 2 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%    QCOM   -0.36%         Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 Earnings Report Preview: What To Look For   Leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) will be reporting earnings tomorrow after market hours. Here\u2019s what investors should know. Nvidia beat analysts\u2019 revenue expectations by 5.3% last quarter, reporting revenues of $35.08 billion, up 93.6% year on year. It was a strong quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 EPS estimates and a solid beat of analysts\u2019 adjusted operating income estimates. Is Nvidia a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it\u2019s free. This quarter, analysts are expecting Nvidia\u2019s revenue to grow 73.5% year on year to $38.34 billion, slowing from the 265% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.85 per share.   Nvidia Total Revenue   Analysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Nvidia has a history of exceeding Wall Street\u2019s expectations, beating revenue estimates every single time over the past two years by 8.1% on average. Looking at Nvidia\u2019s peers in the processors and graphics chips segment, some have already reported their Q4 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Qualcomm delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 17.5%, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by 6.7%, and Intel reported a revenue decline of 7.4%, topping estimates by 3.3%. Qualcomm traded down 3.8% following the results while Intel was also down 3.3%.  Read our full analysis of Qualcomm\u2019s results here and Intel\u2019s results here. Investors in the processors and graphics chips segment have had steady hands going into earnings, with share prices flat over the last month. Nvidia is up 9.2% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $171.64 (compared to the current share price of $130.52). Today\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): A High Growth Mega Cap Stock You Can Buy and Hold for the Next 5 Years      Jabran Kundi   February 25, 2025 3 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently compiled a list of the 20 High Growth Mega Cap Stocks You Can Buy And Hold For Next 5 Years.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other high growth mega cap stocks. Exactly 5 years ago, the world struggled to deal with a black swan event: the COVID-19 pandemic. There was so much uncertainty that people didn\u2019t even know if they\u2019d be alive in the next few weeks, let alone figure out where the market was heading. Anyone who invested in the S&P 5 years ago would have gained 83%. If you had bought at the exact bottom, you\u2019d have gained twice that amount.  What the above proves is that the present isn\u2019t necessarily an indicator of what the future holds. All companies that had their workflows disrupted have recovered, some more than others. Some companies have strengthened their supply chains. Others have improved their work-from-home capabilities. Industries like airlines and restaurants have modified their business models to cater to the new dynamics. These companies have been able to deal with the changing dynamics because of their financial strength and innovation. A company\u2019s past performance and its finances give a good idea of whether it will be able to survive bad times. That\u2019s why when we look at the best mega-cap stocks to hold for the next 5 years, we look at how well they have grown in the last 5 years. To come up with our list of top 20 mega-cap stocks to hold for the next 5 years, we considered stocks with a market cap of at least $200 billion and a 5-year sales growth rate of at least 10%.   NVIDIA (NVDA) Gears Up for Pivotal AI Earnings as Analysts Stay Bullish   A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a compute & networking and graphics solutions provider that operates through the graphics and compute & networking segments.\u00a0 It supplies its products to system integrators and distributors, consumer internet companies, distributors, original equipment manufacturers, and others. The emergence of SeepSeek AI forced people to question Nvidia\u2019s expensive technologies and whether they were really needed. There was a moment when everyone thought the huge investments in nuclear energy and GPUs would go to waste if AI models could be trained cheaply. However, Nvidia\u2019s innovation, ecosystem, and financial strength, together with the support of a strong US government that seems determined to win the AI race against China should be enough to negate the doubters.  The short-term effects of DeepSeek may be forgotten as soon as 26th February when the company announces its earnings. Long-term investors should, however, keep an eye on how Broadcom and Marvell progress, two companies that make custom GPUs that are more attractive for hyperscalers to perform their repetitive and high-performance AI training requirements.   Story Continues Overall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the high growth mega cap stocks you can buy and hold for the next 5 years. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia earnings, outlook top Wall Street forecasts as CEO Jensen Huang touts 'light speed' AI advances      Daniel Howley   \u00b7 Technology Editor Updated February 27, 2025 4 min read        584   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   AMZN   +1.00%    META   +1.67%    NVDA   +1.63%    MSFT   +1.81%     GOOG   +1.70%      Nvidia (NVDA) reported its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, beating analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines and issuing solid Q1 guidance. Nvidia's stock rose 2.5% before the bell on Thursday, coming back from small loss earlier in premarket trading as investors digested the report.  Nvidia's earnings come as the company girds itself for potential 25% tariffs on chips imported into the US and the threat of increased export controls on its shipments to China. The AI giant is also contending with the fallout from claims that Chinese startup DeepSeek developed its AI models using less powerful Nvidia chips than its US rivals, putting into question whether Big Tech companies are over-investing in AI. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    110.15 +1.77 (+1.63%)  At close: 4:00:00 PM EDT  109.40 -0.75 (-0.68%) Pre-Market: 5:40:13 AM EDT   Advanced Chart    For the quarter, Nvidia reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.89 on revenue of $39.3 billion. Wall Street was expecting EPS of $0.84 on revenue of $38.2 billion. The company said it expects Q1 revenue of $43 billion plus or minus 2%, better than the $42.3 billion expected. Data center revenue clocked in at $35.6 billion versus expectations of $34 billion in the quarter. \"We\u2019ve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,\" CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. \"AI is advancing at light speed as agentic AI and physical AI set the stage for the next wave of AI to revolutionize the largest industries.\u201d  According to Nvidia CFO Colette Kress, cloud service providers made up 50% of Nvidia's data center revenue in the quarter. The company reported similar results in Q3. The company's Blackwell line of chips contributed billions in sales for the quarter, Kress said. Read more: How does Nvidia make money? \"We delivered $11.0 billion of Blackwell architecture revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the fastest product ramp in our company\u2019s history.\" Nvidia's gaming revenue, however, fell 11% year over year in Q4 due to supply constraints around its latest gaming chips.  Nvidia is the reigning champion of AI chips, and it\u2019s not losing that crown anytime soon. Its chips are the envy of Silicon Valley and beyond, and its competitors are still far from overtaking its performance advantage. Big Tech companies Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) are spending billions of dollars building out their AI data centers, and a chunk of that is going straight to Nvidia.  But shares of those same companies are also struggling in the early months of 2025.   Story Continues Google parent Alphabet is off more than 8% year to date, Amazon is down 2.5%, Microsoft has fallen 5.3%, and Apple (AAPL) has dropped more than 4%.Meta is the sole outlier in the group, with shares up over 14%.Huang also alluded to fears that DeepSeek's AI models, which were developed using lower-powered Nvidia chips while still matching the performance of top US-made AI models, would hurt Nvidia's sales.\"Demand for Blackwell is amazing as reasoning AI adds another scaling law \u2014 increasing compute for training makes models smarter and increasing compute for long thinking makes the answer smarter,\u201d he said.  Threats ahead? Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia, at SIGGRAPH 2024. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)  \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESSNvidia is staring down President Donald Trump's threat of 25% tariffs on chips imported into the US, which could force it to either raise prices or eat some of the cost of the tariffs, cutting into margins. Nvidia works with TSMC to build its processors, which produces many of those chips in Taiwan.Trump has also threatened to put further export restrictions on Nvidia chips destined for China, which would cut into the company\u2019s revenue from the region.Wall Street has also raised concerns about the impact of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta using their own custom AI chips versus those developed by Nvidia. If those companies\u2019 chips can match Nvidia\u2019s in performance, the thinking goes, they\u2019ll be less dependent on Nvidia\u2019s offerings.But Morgan Stanley Research analyst Joseph Moore cautioned overreacting to the potential of these ASICS, or application-specific integrated circuits.\u201cSpending time with 20-25 Nvidia alternatives over the years, most of which failed to get traction, we saw initial enthusiasm based on price and potential performance, which [brought] an initial deployment,\u201d Moore wrote. \u201cThen there is almost always a pull back to Nvidia, which has the most mature ecosystem, and the alternatives are put on hold, sometimes never to return.\u201dGoogle's and Amazon\u2019s chips have proven to be the exception to that rule so far, but Moore says Nvidia is still gaining share in the AI space.

Upgrade Now          Why Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Is Down Today      Adam Hejl   February 28, 2025 2 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       What Happened? Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 6.9% in the afternoon session after the company reported Q4 2024 earnings: Additionally, concerns about the company's performance in China may be weighing on sentiment. Management highlighted declining sales in the region, and new trade tariffs imposed by the Trump administration could further exacerbate this downturn, making it more difficult to reverse the trend. The quarter itself was fine as Nvidia beat analysts' revenue, EPS, and adjusted operating income expectations. Next quarter's revenue guidance also topped Wall Street's estimates.  On the other hand, its inventory levels increased materially. Still, this quarter had some key positives. The shares closed the day at $120.02, down 8.8% from previous close. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free. What The Market Is Telling Us Nvidia\u2019s shares are very volatile and have had 27 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 29 days ago when the stock dropped 6.9% after Bloomberg News reported that the Trump administration is considering curbing sales of the company's chips to China following the emergence of the DeepSeek AI model. According to the sources, the restriction might apply to some of Nvidia's cutting-edge chips, including the H20 AI chips. Nvidia is down 12.5% since the beginning of the year, and at $121.03 per share, it is trading 19% below its 52-week high of $149.43 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $19,170. Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia earnings, outlook top Wall Street forecasts as CEO Jensen Huang touts 'light speed' AI advances      Daniel Howley   \u00b7 Technology Editor Updated February 27, 2025 4 min read        584   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   AMZN   +1.00%    META   +1.67%    NVDA   +1.63%    MSFT   +1.81%     GOOG   +1.70%      Nvidia (NVDA) reported its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, beating analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines and issuing solid Q1 guidance. Nvidia's stock rose 2.5% before the bell on Thursday, coming back from small loss earlier in premarket trading as investors digested the report.  Nvidia's earnings come as the company girds itself for potential 25% tariffs on chips imported into the US and the threat of increased export controls on its shipments to China. The AI giant is also contending with the fallout from claims that Chinese startup DeepSeek developed its AI models using less powerful Nvidia chips than its US rivals, putting into question whether Big Tech companies are over-investing in AI. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    110.15 +1.77 (+1.63%)  At close: 4:00:00 PM EDT  109.40 -0.75 (-0.68%) Pre-Market: 5:40:13 AM EDT   Advanced Chart    For the quarter, Nvidia reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.89 on revenue of $39.3 billion. Wall Street was expecting EPS of $0.84 on revenue of $38.2 billion. The company said it expects Q1 revenue of $43 billion plus or minus 2%, better than the $42.3 billion expected. Data center revenue clocked in at $35.6 billion versus expectations of $34 billion in the quarter. \"We\u2019ve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,\" CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. \"AI is advancing at light speed as agentic AI and physical AI set the stage for the next wave of AI to revolutionize the largest industries.\u201d  According to Nvidia CFO Colette Kress, cloud service providers made up 50% of Nvidia's data center revenue in the quarter. The company reported similar results in Q3. The company's Blackwell line of chips contributed billions in sales for the quarter, Kress said. Read more: How does Nvidia make money? \"We delivered $11.0 billion of Blackwell architecture revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the fastest product ramp in our company\u2019s history.\" Nvidia's gaming revenue, however, fell 11% year over year in Q4 due to supply constraints around its latest gaming chips.  Nvidia is the reigning champion of AI chips, and it\u2019s not losing that crown anytime soon. Its chips are the envy of Silicon Valley and beyond, and its competitors are still far from overtaking its performance advantage. Big Tech companies Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) are spending billions of dollars building out their AI data centers, and a chunk of that is going straight to Nvidia.  But shares of those same companies are also struggling in the early months of 2025.   Story Continues Google parent Alphabet is off more than 8% year to date, Amazon is down 2.5%, Microsoft has fallen 5.3%, and Apple (AAPL) has dropped more than 4%.Meta is the sole outlier in the group, with shares up over 14%.Huang also alluded to fears that DeepSeek's AI models, which were developed using lower-powered Nvidia chips while still matching the performance of top US-made AI models, would hurt Nvidia's sales.\"Demand for Blackwell is amazing as reasoning AI adds another scaling law \u2014 increasing compute for training makes models smarter and increasing compute for long thinking makes the answer smarter,\u201d he said.  Threats ahead? Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia, at SIGGRAPH 2024. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)  \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESSNvidia is staring down President Donald Trump's threat of 25% tariffs on chips imported into the US, which could force it to either raise prices or eat some of the cost of the tariffs, cutting into margins. Nvidia works with TSMC to build its processors, which produces many of those chips in Taiwan.Trump has also threatened to put further export restrictions on Nvidia chips destined for China, which would cut into the company\u2019s revenue from the region.Wall Street has also raised concerns about the impact of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta using their own custom AI chips versus those developed by Nvidia. If those companies\u2019 chips can match Nvidia\u2019s in performance, the thinking goes, they\u2019ll be less dependent on Nvidia\u2019s offerings.But Morgan Stanley Research analyst Joseph Moore cautioned overreacting to the potential of these ASICS, or application-specific integrated circuits.\u201cSpending time with 20-25 Nvidia alternatives over the years, most of which failed to get traction, we saw initial enthusiasm based on price and potential performance, which [brought] an initial deployment,\u201d Moore wrote. \u201cThen there is almost always a pull back to Nvidia, which has the most mature ecosystem, and the alternatives are put on hold, sometimes never to return.\u201dGoogle's and Amazon\u2019s chips have proven to be the exception to that rule so far, but Moore says Nvidia is still gaining share in the AI space.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Among Stocks to Invest In from Israel Englander\u2019s Portfolio      Sajjl Nooranne   February 28, 2025 6 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of Israel Englander\u2019s Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks to invest in from Israel Englander\u2019s portfolio. Millennium Management\u00a0is a globally recognized investment firm specializing in multi-strategy hedge fund offerings. Founded in 1989, the firm has established itself as one of the largest alternative asset management firms. With headquarters in New York, Millennium Management has expanded its operations across North America, Europe, and Asia, with 18 primary offices in financial hubs such as London, Dubai, Singapore, and Tokyo. The firm employs a platform-based investment approach, consisting of approximately 330 investment teams operating under a decentralized model. These teams deploy diverse strategies across various asset classes, including equities, fixed income, commodities, and derivatives. Millennium\u2019s core strategies encompass fundamental equity research, equity arbitrage, macroeconomic-driven fixed-income investments, and commodity-based trades. By leveraging a data-driven and diversified approach, the firm seeks to generate consistent, high-quality returns for its investors while effectively managing risk across global markets.  Millennium was co-founded by Israel A. Englander and Ronald Shear, both of whom had extensive experience in the American Stock Exchange (AMEX). The firm initially launched with $35 million in capital, with Englander contributing $5 million and securing additional investment from Canadian financiers, the Belzberg brothers. However, the firm faced early struggles, leading to Shear\u2019s departure just six months after its inception. Despite these challenges, Millennium Management evolved into a powerhouse in the hedge fund industry, consistently ranking among the top-performing firms. Over the years, Millennium has adopted an institutionalized structure, attracting seasoned executives such as Bobby Jain, who served as co-CIO alongside Englander until his departure in 2023. By implementing a disciplined risk management framework and continuously refining its investment strategies, Millennium has remained at the forefront of alternative asset management. Israel Englander, the driving force behind Millennium, has built a reputation as one of the most successful hedge fund managers in modern finance. A graduate of New York University, Englander pursued an MBA before leaving early to trade at AMEX, where he gained valuable experience in market-making and derivatives trading. His expertise and strategic vision enabled Millennium to grow rapidly, managing approximately $13 billion in assets by 2011. In recent years, Englander has explored opportunities to sell a minority stake in the firm, signaling a shift towards institutional ownership. His approach to hedge fund management prioritizes capital allocation to specialized teams rather than making direct investment decisions himself. This model has allowed Millennium to maintain a highly competitive edge, attracting top talent and fostering a dynamic investment environment.   Story Continues Millennium\u2019s outstanding performance has positioned it as one of the most successful hedge funds globally. As of Q4 2024, the firm reported $204.64 billion in managed 13F securities, with its top ten holdings comprising 15.5% of its portfolio. Notably, Millennium has consistently ranked among the highest-grossing hedge funds, posting the fourth-largest net gains of any fund since its inception. Its commitment to risk-adjusted returns, diversification, and strategic innovation has earned it a strong reputation among institutional investors. With a proven track record, an expansive global presence, and a disciplined investment approach, Millennium Management continues to be a dominant force in the hedge fund industry.Our MethodologyThe stocks discussed below were picked from Millennium Management\u2019s Q4 2024 13F filings.

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Among Stocks to Invest In from Israel Englander\u2019s Portfolio  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q4: 223Millennium Management\u2019s Equity Stake: $1.34 Billion\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) posted remarkable financial results for the quarter ending October 27, 2024, with revenue surging 94% year over year to $35.08 billion and earnings per share increasing 103% to $0.81. This growth underscores the company\u2019s strong leadership in AI, gaming, and data center technologies. Additionally, the company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share, reflecting its commitment to shareholder value while sustaining its rapid expansion. These results reinforce NVIDIA\u2019s dominant position in the evolving semiconductor industry.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently recovered from a market dip triggered by concerns over competition from Chinese AI company DeepSeek, with its stock rebounding after a temporary 21% decline. Investors are now focused on Nvidia\u2019s upcoming fiscal Q4 2025 earnings report expected on February 26, with analysts estimating revenue of $38.13 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $0.85, representing year-over-year growth of 72.5% and 63.5% respectively. The company\u2019s management has projected Q4 revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. Key factors supporting Nvidia\u2019s strong performance include high demand for its Blackwell GPU chips and continued AI infrastructure investments from major clients like Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms.Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q4 2024\u00a0investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. In our view, Nvidia\u2019s computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption. Shares contributed to performance during the quarter, driven by strong demand for its data center products, especially the Hopper H200 chips, which generated double-digit billions in revenue, marking the fastest product ramp in the company\u2019s history. Management provided fiscal fourth-quarter revenue guidance above analyst estimates, along with resilient operating margins supported by robust demand and limited competition. In our view, Nvidia\u2019s leadership in scaling AI infrastructure, including advancements in inference and test-time scaling (i.e., reasoning during inference), is driving adoption among enterprises and startups, providing continued demand for its high-performance chips and software solutions. As older-generation chips are repurposed for inference and new clusters are deployed, we believe Nvidia is well-positioned to capitalize on growing compute needs across AI applications.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of stocks to invest in from Israel Englander\u2019s portfolio. While we acknowledge the potential for NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

He thought out loud about the factors that can weigh on US companies after the breakthrough achieved by DeepSeek: \u201cThere could be some serious buyer\u2019s remorse now. Maybe all the spending going to (Jensen Huang\u2019s company) was needless overpay. Maybe the gigantic number of data centers being built, which are a huge driver of growth in our country, simply aren\u2019t needed. Maybe all the cooling process expenses are a big mistake. Maybe the rush to reopen old nuclear plants, put up more renewable generation, and even bring back coal is totally unnecessary. Today, the air went out of every one of these balloons.\u201d  Cramer said he\u2019d be looking out to know how many chips DeepSeek required to reach this software breakthrough to gauge the impact on demand for US AI chip companies. He said stocks could either rebound from all of this or continue to slide: \u201cAnd whether numbers now have to come down because there will be a freeze in spending as clients reassess those multi-billion dollar orders. Maybe it\u2019ll be like the pause in the internet build-out of 2000 that turned out not to be a pause at all, but a collapse.\u201d  READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about in his programs on CNBC. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).   Jim Cramer After DeepSeek: \u2018If You're NVIDIA (NVDA), You\u2019re in a Jam Here\u2019   NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Jim Cramer in a recent program on CNBC talked about the massive selloff that rocked NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares after the launch of DeepSeek. Cramer was frank about the confusion and concerns around NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock and said a lot needs to be known before making any claims about the Nvidia story. Cramer was worried about why NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) did not emphasize its software focus and its chip demand in its statement after the DeepSeek launch.   Story Continues \u201cIt\u2019s part of the confusion and the real quandary is why did NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) say that it\u2019s become much more of a software company and that you need the hardware to run their software. It also would have been good to find out how many chips DeepSeek is really using. But it isn\u2019t. Think about it\u2014if it was a lot, right, then our government would simply ban all exports to China. What a high-risk situation. If you\u2019re NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), you\u2019re really in a jam here.See, if DeepSeek really didn\u2019t need many chips to make its AI platform work, that could be very negative for the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) story because then you don\u2019t have to order as many chips. But if it turns out that DeepSeek had hundreds of thousands of chips like the American hyperscalers, then you\u2019d have to believe the new president would make it much harder for Chinese companies to buy anything.\u201d Infuse Asset Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\u201cWe do still own some NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the forward multiple isn\u2019t egregious and it powers over 90% of AI workloads. This company is only becoming increasingly important though the hyperscalers are actively trying to save money through their own ASIC programs. The moat CUDA provides has been underestimated time and time again. While I don\u2019t think Nvidia has quite the upside as some of the other companies in the portfolio, it has a product that the best companies in the world literally can\u2019t get enough of.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia Slides After Subdued Growth Fails to Wow Investors      Ian King   February 28, 2025 5 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       (Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp., the chipmaker at the center of an AI spending boom, delivered good-but-not-great quarterly numbers, disappointing investors accustomed to blowout results. Most Read from Bloomberg How Upzoning in Cambridge Broke the YIMBY Mold Remembering the Landscape Architect Who Embraced the City NYC Office Buildings See Resurgence as Investors Pile Into Bonds Hong Kong Joins Global Stadium Race With New $4 Billion Sports Park US Tent Facility is Holding Migrant Families Longer Than Recommended   Sales will be about $43 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which runs through April, Nvidia said on Wednesday. Analysts had estimated $42.3 billion on average, with some projections ranging as high as $48 billion. Subscribe to the Bloomberg Daybreak podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b The company also warned that gross profit margins would be tighter than anticipated as it rushes to roll out a new chip design called Blackwell. And there\u2019s the risk of US tariffs weighing on results. Nvidia\u2019s stock slid 8.5% in New York on Thursday, marking the steepest single-day decline in a month. The stock had already been down 2.2% this year, following stratospheric gains in 2023 and 2024 that turned Nvidia into the world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker. The mixed outlook comes at a shaky time for the AI industry. Nvidia shares have dipped this year on concerns that data center operators will slow spending. Chinese startup DeepSeek also has sparked fears that chatbots can be developed on the cheap, potentially reducing the need for Nvidia\u2019s powerful chips for AI.  Though Nvidia executives addressed most of those issues, it\u2019s become harder for the company to produce blockbuster earnings reports. \u201cGuidance was slightly underwhelming,\u201d Edward Jones analyst Logan Purk said in a report. But early sales of the Blackwell chip should help ease investor concerns after earlier reports of production delays, he said. The company got $11 billion of revenue from Blackwell in the fourth quarter, something Nvidia described as the \u201cfastest product ramp\u201d in its history. \u201cDemand for Blackwell is amazing,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said in the statement. Though the company\u2019s fiscal fourth-quarter sales topped analysts\u2019 estimates, they did so by the smallest margin since February 2023. Earnings, meanwhile, had the narrowest amount of upside since November 2022, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of a massive surge in AI spending, doubling the size of its revenue the past two years. Many of the largest technology companies are pouring tens of billions of dollars into data center hardware, and Nvidia is the dominant seller of processors that create and run AI software.   Story Continues Along the way, Nvidia and its CEO have become synonymous with the AI revolution \u2014 and the biggest bellwether for how it\u2019s progressing. Huang has spent much of the past two years crisscrossing the world as an evangelist for AI technology and believes it\u2019s still in the early stages of spreading throughout the economy.Sales in the fourth quarter, which ended Jan. 26, rose to $39.3 billion. That matched estimates, though some projections ranged as high as $42 billion. Underlining just how quickly the company has grown: Its latest quarterly sales were bigger than Nvidia\u2019s annual revenue two years ago, when it totaled $27 billion.Profit was 89 cents a share, minus certain items. Wall Street was looking for 84 cents.\u201cWe will grow strongly in 2025,\u201d Huang said during a conference call with analysts.The data center unit, by far Nvidia\u2019s biggest source of revenue, generated sales of $35.6 billion. That beat the average estimate of $34.1 billion. Gaming-related sales \u2014 once Nvidia\u2019s core business \u2014 amounted to $2.5 billion. Analysts projected $3.02 billion on average. Automotive was $570 million.The data center division alone now has more revenue than rivals Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. generate in total, combined.Nvidia made its name by selling graphics processors, but discovered that the technology also has applications for AI. Its chips help software models during the training process, when they learn to recognize and respond to real-world inputs. Nvidia\u2019s components are also used in systems that then run the software, a stage known as inference, and help power services such as ChatGPT.Heading into the earnings report, analysts had expressed concern about near-term growth in Nvidia\u2019s biggest business, which serves data center customers. The big question was whether supply constraints and a shift to Blackwell would slow growth. The new technology is more sophisticated, bringing manufacturing challenges.DeepSeek added to the worries after releasing a powerful AI model that it said required far fewer resources to create. The announcement in late January led to a widespread selloff in AI-related shares. Nvidia shed a staggering $589 billion of capital in one day of trading, a record for the markets.But key Nvidia customers, such as Microsoft Corp., have maintained their capital expenditure plans, suggesting that the AI spending surge will remain strong.During the conference call, Huang argued that DeepSeek will stoke interest in a new approach to AI, expanding demand for Nvidia products. The DeepSeek model relies on fine-tuning, so it will require more computing sessions than the \u201cone shot\u201d training of other software, he said. In fact, the approach might require millions of times more computing power than today, he said.\u201cFuture reasoning models can consume much more compute,\u201d Huang said, calling DeepSeek\u2019s model \u201can excellent innovation.\u201dThough Blackwell will help handle those computing tasks, the rollout has come at a cost. The expense of getting the product to market has weighed on profit margins, Nvidia said. The savings will come later when the company is able to refine its supply chain, according to Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress. Gross margin, or the percent of revenue remaining after deducting the cost of production, will return to a \u201cmid-70s\u201d percentage by the end of the year.In the current quarter, that measure will be about 71%, Nvidia said, about a point below the average of analysts\u2019 estimates.Nvidia has only missed analysts\u2019 estimates on quarterly revenue once in the past five years. And it has exceeded expectations by more than 10% in recent periods, creating a high bar for its performance.\u201cWe think it will be challenging for management to continue to significantly beat expectations for future growth,\u201d Edwards Jones\u2019 Purk said.--With assistance from Vlad Savov.(Updates shares in fourth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekRich People Are Firing a Cash Cannon at the US Economy\u2014But at What Cost?

Upgrade Now          Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Hand Over Fist Before Feb. 26?      Keith Speights   February 23, 2025 5 min read              In This Article:  NVDA       AMD         The DeepSeek dip is nearly over for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). I'm referring, of course, to the thrashing Nvidia's share price took last month when many investors panicked about the threat presented by Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company DeepSeek. Although Nvidia's stock sank as much as 21% below its previous high, most of that loss has evaporated. But while it's too late to buy Nvidia on the DeepSeek-induced dip, another potential catalyst beckons. The GPU maker is scheduled to announce its fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter and full-year results later this week. Should you buy Nvidia stock hand over fist before Feb. 26? The underlying premise of the question People concerned about whether to buy Nvidia stock in the next three trading days might be focusing on whether there's a good possibility that Nvidia's share price will jump after its Q4 update after the market closes on Feb. 26. History does signal that a post-earnings jump could be coming. Especially following OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, Nvidia has a great track record of exceeding Wall Street's earnings expectations. And its share price has often performed well afterward. The \"E's\" on the above chart show when Nvidia reported its quarterly earnings. After six of those nine updates, the stock rose afterward. However, astute readers will notice that Nvidia's shares didn't rise immediately after its two most recent quarterly updates. Will Nvidia stock jump after its Q4 update? The short answer to this question is that there's no way to know for sure. However, we can make an educated guess. First, it's important to understand what it will take for Nvidia to beat Wall Street's expectations. The average Q4 revenue estimate of analysts surveyed by LSEG is $38.13 billion. The average earnings per share (EPS) estimate is $0.85. To hit these numbers, Nvidia must deliver year-over-year revenue growth of roughly 72.5% and EPS growth of 63.5%. Nvidia could top analysts' estimates even with slowing growth. The company reported year-over-year revenue growth of 94% in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and EPS growth of 103%. However, management's Q4 guidance projects revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. Nvidia will have to be near the upper end of the range to perform better than Wall Street expects.  For the stock to jump enough to justify buying it hand over fist before the Q4 update, though, Nvidia can't merely scrape by with a revenue and earnings beat. It will either need to handily exceed estimates and/or provide an especially encouraging outlook for fiscal 2026. Can the company do this? I think the chances are pretty good for three main reasons.   Story Continues First, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said in the company's Q3 earnings call, \"Blackwell demand is staggering.\" She added that Nvidia was on track to top its previous revenue estimate for the new GPU chips even though it couldn't keep up with demand.Second, several of Nvidia's biggest customers revealed in recent weeks that they're continuing to invest heavily in AI infrastructure. Amazon, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, and Meta Platforms were all singing from the same page in their latest quarterly updates. That bodes well for Nvidia.Third, those huge customers aren't flocking to Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia's primary rival. AMD reported strong Q4 revenue growth earlier this month but lower than expected.The longer-term questionI won't be surprised at all if Nvidia beats Wall Street's Q4 estimates and provides a strong outlook, with its shares popping when the market opens on Feb. 27. But investing is not about the short term or trying to jump in and out of stocks ahead of a certain move. The long-term question is: Can Nvidia's momentum continue much longer?Some believe the answer to that question is \"no.\" They point to Nvidia's valuation (shares trade at 32.6 times forward earnings). They predict the demand for AI chips will wane, perhaps in part due to more efficient models such as DeepSeek's that require fewer GPUs.I'm more optimistic, albeit cautiously so. My hunch is that advances in AI will spur greater demand for Nvidia's chips rather than lead to lower demand. I also fully expect Nvidia will continue to out-innovate the competition.Sure, Nvidia's momentum will eventually slow. It's inevitable. However, buying the stock before Feb. 26 is probably a smart move, in my view. Even if you don't invest in Nvidia by then, the stock could still have plenty of room to run afterward.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Upgrade Now          Why Nvidia stock looks super cheap compared to other AI names, according to Yahoo Finance readers      Brian Sozzi   \u00b7 Executive Editor  February 25, 2025 3 min read        15   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%    AVGO   +0.65%    AMD   +0.04%     MRVL   +1.79%    ARM   +0.18%      We asked about one of the biggest mysteries surrounding Nvidia's (NVDA) stock in the Morning Brief newsletter, and you responded with insightful analysis. Why does the stock still look so cheap on a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple basis? Nvidia isn't some struggling also-ran tech company like Intel (INTC) \u2014 it's an artificial intelligence juggernaut that is dominating its industry. And it has a strong double-digit percentage earnings growth outlook for 2025, 2026, and beyond to show for it.  On a forward price-to-earnings multiple basis, Yahoo Finance data shows Nvidia trading at 31 times. Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL) are valued at 35 times and 41 times, respectively. Arm Holdings (ARM) clocks in at 72 times. \"It's become the proverbial canary in the coal mine,\" one Yahoo Finance reader emailed me on Monday morning, pointing to economic risks ahead, such as tariffs impacting corporate profits. \"In short, many of the high P/E, stratospheric valuation companies, already priced-for-perfection ... and beyond! (such as Palantir) will plummet back to Earth in a swath similar to Skylab junk over Western Australia in a rotation stampede back to defensive value,\" the reader added.   I suspect this valuation disparity may be more easily explained seconds after Nvidia earnings hit on Feb. 26 after the market close. The Yahoo Finance team will aim to put Nvidia's earnings and outlook in the context of its valuation, similar to the approach of longtime Nvidia investor Louis Navellier. Listen: Why Nvidia may be unstoppable We are having a live Nvidia earnings special on Feb. 26, starting at 4 p.m. ET and running until 6 p.m. ET. The next day, we will have a live episode of the Opening Bid podcast with a great roundtable of Nvidia pros. You can tune in on the new Streaming Now section on the Yahoo Finance homepage, our app, or major streaming platforms. In the meantime, here are some of the responses about Nvidia's valuation you sent me on X.                         Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Upgrade Now          Microsoft's Bill Gates issues this key reminder to Nvidia bulls      Brian Sozzi   \u00b7 Executive Editor Updated February 4, 2025 3 min read        102   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   QCOM   -0.36%    AMD   +0.04%    NFLX   -0.45%    AAPL   +0.48%    AMZN   +1.00%       Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. Staying on top in the AI chip race won't be easy for market darling Nvidia (NVDA) and its founder Jensen Huang, reminds one fellow tech billionaire. \"The fact that Jensen doesn't even make his own chips \u2014 that everyone has Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) available \u2014 is all the more credit to him at the design level, the way they have done things is pretty fantastic. I would say I wouldn't want to be Jensen necessarily because wow, other people are working on the same things,\" Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below). Added Gates, \"But so far he has stayed way ahead and Microsoft is an incredible customer and is always wanting to get as many of his chips as they possibly can. At the same time other big tech companies are working on their own AI chips.\"  Competition for Nvidia is sprouting up, as Gates correctly points out. With giants like Amazon (AMZN) announcing an $8 billion partnership with Anthropic to enter the AI chip space and Google (GOOG) dropping a supercomputer with an AI chip called Willow, it's evident Big Tech companies want in on the action. Further, Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell (MRVL) have released advanced custom chips. At the same time, the long-term demand for Nvidia's powerful AI chips is being questioned arguably for the first time.  DeepSeek is a Chinese company that has bursted onto the tech landscape seemingly out of nowhere. It surprised markets and those trading hot AI names like Nvidia and AMD (AMD) after unveiling RI, its AI model that gave a ChatGPT-esque performance at a cheaper price tag. RI costs a reported $5.6 million to build a base model, compared to the hundreds of millions of dollars incurred at US-based companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic. Watch: Why billionaire investor Ray Dalio is concerned about tech valuations Fears mounted instantly that US companies are overspending on AI infrastructure, which includes Nvidia chips. See more from the Opening Bid podcast        Why meme stocks like GameStop could cause you headaches     How this 'furry friends' maker that produces in China is navigating Trump tariffs     What Elon Musk and DOGE should slash next, according to Trump's former top economic adviser     \"So what this [news] basically does is two things. One, it says there's still a lot of innovation left and many companies can aspire to train these models. But, two, it also raises the really interesting question of do you need to spend billions of dollars in order to train cutting-edge, world-class models? I think the jury is still out there for things like that, but it's basically upended our assumptions about where AI is going,\" Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy told me on Opening Bid podcast.   Story Continues Nvidia's stock is now down 15% year to date, the second worst-performing member of the Magnificent 7 behind Apple (AAPL) with an 8.9% drop.Three times each week, I field insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia stock drops ahead of earnings as investors weigh potential Trump export rules, Blackwell delays      Laura Bratton    Updated February 26, 2025 3 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   AMZN   +1.00%    MSFT   +1.81%    META   +1.67%    NVDA   +1.63%     GOOG   +1.70%      Nvidia (NVDA) stock continued its recent slide on Tuesday as investors weighed potential delays in the ramp-up of its AI Blackwell chips and a report of possible new export rules from the Trump administration. The stock dropped 2.8% Tuesday after Bloomberg News reported late Monday night that the Trump administration is looking to further tighten US export rules on the chip sector in an effort to restrict China\u2019s advancement in the AI space.  Trump is looking to sanction specific Chinese companies and further restrict international companies from maintaining semiconductor gear in the country, Bloomberg reported. The news comes more than a month after Chinese firm DeepSeek introduced new, cost-efficient AI models that rocked US markets. Over the last five trading days, Nvidia stock has lost over 9%, a decline that comes ahead of the chipmaker's fourth quarter earnings report scheduled for Wednesday after the bell. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    110.15 +1.77 (+1.63%)  At close: 4:00:00 PM EDT  109.40 -0.75 (-0.68%) Pre-Market: 5:40:13 AM EDT NVDA ^GSPC   Advanced Chart    Nvidia stock dropped 4% Friday and an additional 3% Monday as macroeconomic uncertainty surrounding Trump\u2019s trade policies stoked fears of inflation and drove down major stock indexes. Another challenge for Nvidia investors ahead of the report came in a note to investors on Monday from Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis, who suggested Nvidia\u2019s ramp-up of its latest Blackwell AI chips could be delayed. \u201cOur checks suggested Blackwell ramp [was] pushed to mid 2025 from 1H25 [the first half of 2025],\" he wrote.  Lipacis added, \u201cWe believe some hyperscalers will likely push some purchases from NVDA, however many noted demand for NVDA GPUs [graphics processing units, or AI chips] still outstrips supply, and absent B100 [Blackwell] availability, NVDA\u2019s current solution, H100 would be purchased instead.\u201d Lipacis maintained his Buy rating on the stock. Nvidia declined Yahoo Finance's request for comment. Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell chips have faced overheating issues and glitches. The Information reported in December that some of Nvidia's top customers \u2014 Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and Meta (META) \u2014 had cut orders of its Blackwell products due to those issues. Those four customers alone purchased an estimated $44 billion worth of Nvidia GPUs in the 2024 calendar year, according to a DA Davidson analysis. Still, Wall Street analysts maintained their bullish outlooks on the stock ahead of its fourth quarter earnings call Wednesday, despite concerns related to export controls, DeepSeek, and delays of its Blackwell chips.   Nvidia logo is seen in this illustration taken, January 27, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo  \u00b7 Reuters / Reuters DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria said commentary on Blackwell delays should be taken \u201cwith a grain of salt.\u201d   Story Continues \u201cSince there is so much excess demand for Blackwell, NVIDIA is rationing orders which may seem like a delay in production even if it is not,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance in an email. Luria holds a Neutral rating and $135 price target on Nvidia stock.Truist Securities' William Stein also addressed the Blackwell concerns in a note to investors late Monday: \u201cSince NVDA announced Blackwell at its 2024 GTC event, our contacts have been talking about volume shipments as if they were always right around the corner, waiting for a yield improvement or a design challenge to be addressed.\u201dStein added: \u201cNVDA is still the AI leader and the one to own.\u201dFor Nvidia\u2019s fourth quarter, analysts expect the chipmaker to report adjusted earnings per share rising roughly 64% from the prior year to $0.84 and revenue jumping 73% to $38.2 billion.Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Set to Deliver Strong Q4 Results, Eyes Future AI Growth      Ghazal Ahmed   February 27, 2025 5 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently compiled a list of the 10 Hot AI Stocks to Watch Right Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. As AI continues to redefine the workforce, companies such as DeepSeek are at the forefront of this revolution. The R1 model, in particular, has made investors realize how AI models can be developed with lower costs and less advanced software. Nevertheless, AI enablers continue to create AI-specific semiconductor chips, build out compute power, and develop platforms that foundation models can use to operate. READ ALSO:\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks Dominating Headlines\u00a0and 10 AI Stocks Worth Watching Today \u201cOn one hand, the DeepSeek approach showed that you can optimize your model building process so that you require much lower compute power. That has a negative impact on Nvidia. However, the obvious thing is now you\u2019ll find a lot of people building foundation models. Foundation models are not going to be just for the top five companies or so that have hundreds of millions of dollars to build the infrastructure.\u201d  The gist of it all remains that even though DeepSeek marks a shift toward accessible AI development, powerful computational resources are still going to be needed as AI adoption scales. However, AI's impact extends beyond the tech world, also disrupting the way people are going to work in the evolving landscape. Generative artificial intelligence isn\u2019t just another invention, Aneesh Raman, chief economic opportunity officer at LinkedIn, recently remarked. Now that it is disrupting entire industries and economies, it may also hold the power to set up an entire economy in motion. \u201cBut [generative AI] isn\u2019t just another invention. It\u2019s a turning point, forcing us to rethink not just what work is, but what it means to be human at work.\u201d  That\u2019s right, artificial intelligence is pushing us into a new work era. \u201cFor centuries, work was about our physical abilities on farms, and then again in the factories. It\u2019s only been the past couple decades that work has been about our intellectual abilities\u2026  According to Raman, physical tasks are now being handled by automation, and intellectual ones are being taken over by AI. This leaves humans to be defined by their social abilities, he said. He further noted that in this era, human innovation and unique human skills, such as social and emotional intelligence, are going to be key determinants.   Story Continues For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points \u00a0(see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) the Tech Stock with Best Earnings Growth in 2025?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services.\u00a0One of the biggest analyst calls on Tuesday, February 25, was for Nvidia Corporation. Truist Securities analyst William Stein reiterated a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the stock with a $204.00 price target, stating that Nvidia is \u201cstill the AI leader and the one to own\u201d ahead of earnings on Wednesday.\"Heading into CQ4 (Jan) results, NVDA is still the AI leader and the one to own; Lots of noise, but the data we trust most is encouraging. NVDA reports its CQ4 (Jan.) result on Weds 2/26. We expect NVDA will (1) deliver upside vs. consensus in its CQ4 (Jan) results & CQ1 (Apr) guidance, (2) highlight a narrowing of SKUs around the NVL72 configuration, (3) express confidence in CY25 owing to very robust backlog, and (4) focus on the next drivers of growth after LLMs: data processing, and physical AI. Our CY26 EPS is $5.84; PT is $204 based on 35x P/E (15x discount to hi-growth semis). Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the hot AI stocks to watch right now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a020 Best AI Stock To Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a0Complete List of All AI Companies Under $2 Billion Market Cap.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Wall Street Analysts See a 34.97% Upside in Nvidia (NVDA): Can the Stock Really Move This High?         Zacks Equity Research   February 27, 2025 4 min read              In This Article:  NVDA         Nvidia (NVDA) closed the last trading session at $131.28, gaining 6.1% over the past four weeks, but there could be plenty of upside left in the stock if short-term price targets set by Wall Street analysts are any guide. The mean price target of $177.19 indicates a 35% upside potential. The mean estimate comprises 42 short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $18.48. While the lowest estimate of $135 indicates a 2.8% increase from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 67.6% to reach $220. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.  While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice. But, for NVDA, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside. Here's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price Targets According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading. While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?  They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts. However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.   Story Continues That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why NVDA Could Witness a Solid UpsideThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current year, one estimate has moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 0.2%.Moreover, NVDA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much NVDA could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Upgrade Now          Nvidia posts earnings beat, but future margins are a 'little concerning': What Wall Street is saying      Brian Sozzi   \u00b7 Executive Editor Updated February 27, 2025 5 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   QCOM   -0.36%    AMZN   +1.00%    NVDA   +1.63%    AVGO   +0.65%    AMD   +0.04%       Only in the world of AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) are hypersonic growth rates not seemingly enough for the beloved stock's bulls. Shares of the $3.2 trillion market cap chipmaker had reversed losses and were up nearly 4% in early trading on Thursday as investors digested a host of Nvidia earnings headlines. In its earnings release on Wednesday evening, Nvidia said it expects gross profit margins of 70.6% to 71% in the first quarter as it contends with the production ramp-up of its new Blackwell chip. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    110.15 +1.77 (+1.63%)  At close: 4:00:00 PM EDT  109.40 -0.75 (-0.68%) Pre-Market: 5:40:13 AM EDT   Advanced Chart    The margin outlook of 71% is \"a little concerning,\" Benchmark Company managing director and senior research analyst Cody Acree said on Yahoo Finance's Market Domination. \"I think that's indicative of more pricing pressure, more competition from AMD (AMD), and more price sensitivity at their customers as they're investing their own dollars to create their own ASICs [application-specific integrated circuits].\" Shares of chip rivals AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), and Qualcomm (QCOM) rose slightly in premarket trading. Listen: Why Nvidia may be unstoppable Nvidia execs sought to push back on the bears on its earnings call. The bears have put forth a narrative that there will be a digestion period for AI investments by hyperscalers such as Amazon (AMZN) and Nvidia's margins may have peaked.  \"We're going to have to continue to scale as demand is quite high, and customers are anxious and impatient to get their Blackwell systems,\" Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said. Huang teased several new powerful chips set to be unveiled at the company's March 17 GTC conference. Added CFO Colette Kress: \"Once our Blackwell fully rounds, we can improve our cost and our gross margin. So, we expect to probably be in the mid-70s later this year.\" Lost in the intense focus on the outlook was another strong quarter from Nvidia. Quarterly revenue rose 12% sequentially and 78% from the prior year. Data center sales more than doubled from the prior year. Earnings handily beat analyst estimates. Here is what Wall Street is saying about Nvidia's quarter and outlook. Citi analyst Atif Malik Rating: Reiterated Buy Price Target: $163, reiterated  \"Blackwell sales of $11 billion exceeded expectations (Citi $10 billion) as ramp seems to be on track now after hiccups last year and Nvidia expects strong growth in 2025. Inference demand is accelerating post reasoning models like DeepSeek as long reasoning requires 100x more compute per task vs one shot inference. \"While [Nvidia's GTC conference] is typically a catalyst for the stock, overhang of potential new China restrictions, semis tariffs, and gross margins will likely keep the stock range bound in the near term. For long-term investors willing to look through these concerns, valuation looks attractive at 23 times calendar year [earnings per share] and stock offers an attractive entry point.\"   Story Continues HSBC analyst Ryan MellorRating: Reiterated Buy Price Target: $175, reiterated \"Management did not give an explicit first quarter Blackwell revenue target but we raise our Blackwell revenue higher to $20 billion (from $10 billion). However, management's first quarter revenue target of $43 billion was not enough to surprise the market given the strong fourth quarter Blackwell revenue beat and near-term China strength from H20 GPU shipments post the DeepSeek frenzy. First quarter gross margin guidance of 71% was also weaker than expected but management is still guiding for gross margin to recover to the mid-70% level by the end of FY26.\"D.A. Davidson analyst Gil LuriaRating: Reiterated Neutral Price Target: $135, reiterated \"Despite demand in the near-term continuing to be strong, we still believe a decline in demand for Nvidia compute is inevitable as customers begin to scrutinize their return on investment on AI compute.\"Stifel analyst Ruben RoyRating: Reiterated Buy Price Target: $180, reiterated \"We view Nvidia results and outlook positively, particularly given the better than expected Blackwell revenue outcome fourth quarter at about $11 billion. Data center segment revenue increased 16% sequentially and 93% year over year with data center compute up 18% sequentially and 2x year over year while Networking revenue declined 3% sequentially and roughly 8% year over year.\"We believe that the networking segment decline (two quarters in a row) is transitory as Blackwell systems ramp. In aggregate, we believe the pace of the Blackwell ramp is notable given expectations for strong growth in first quarter following the strength seen in fourth quarter within the context of technical issues early in the production cycle.\"We believe that the transition to B300/GB300 is likely to prove less challenging with the potential to drive accelerated revenue growth during the second half of the year. Management commentary on diverse customer adoption and cluster sizes (100K+ for many deployments) was notable given recent DeepSeek related concerns.\"KeyBanc analyst John VinhRating: Reiterated Overweight Price Target: $190, reiterated \"Nvidia is currently trading at 30 times consensus forward [price-to-earnings]. By comparison, peers are trading at a median consensus 2025 P/E multiple of 31 times. Nvidia remains uniquely positioned to benefit from AI/ML secular data center growth within the industry.\"With significant barriers to entry created by its CUDA software stack, we see limited competitive risks and expect Nvidia to continue to dominate one of the fastest growing workloads in cloud and enterprise. While early days, Omniverse represents an emerging software subscription revenue stream for metaverse applications that is likely to support further re-rating of the multiple, as it grows and scales.\"JPMorgan analyst Harlan SurRating: Reiterated Overweight Price Target: $170, reiterated \"Bottom line, the team continues to maintain a 1- 2 step lead ahead of competitors with its silicon/hardware/software platforms, and a strong ecosystem (4M CUDA software developers) and the team is further distancing itself with its aggressive cadence of new product launches and more product segmentation over time.\"  StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Tech Stock with Best Earnings Growth in 2025?      Rizwan Siddiqui   February 26, 2025 5 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of 15 Tech Stocks with Best Earnings Growth in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other tech stocks with best earnings growth in 2025. Earnings growth plays a vital role in global markets and equity investments, directly influencing stock prices and overall market performance. Companies with steady earnings growth are often considered more stable and reliable, attracting investor confidence and strengthening market sentiment. According to FactSet, the S&P 500 is expected to report a 9.5% earnings growth for 2024, surpassing the 10-year average annual growth rate.  Looking ahead, 2025 is projected to outperform 2024 in terms of earnings expansion. In a January 14, 2025 interview on Bloomberg\u2019s \u2018Open Interest\u2019, Racquel Oden, HSBC\u2019s U.S. Head of International Wealth and Private Banking, forecasted a 14.8% rise in corporate earnings for the year. She expressed optimism about broader market gains, particularly among the \u201cforgotten 493\u201d in the S&P 500\u2014stocks beyond the high-performing \u201cMagnificent 7.\u201d Oden highlighted that technological advancements will enhance productivity, ultimately driving profitability and economic growth. Similarly, in another Bloomberg interview in early January, Stephanie Guild, Head of Investment Strategy at Robinhood, discussed the challenges posed by elevated yields on valuations. She emphasized that equities are primarily influenced by three factors: market sentiment, valuation, and earnings growth. While high yields create hurdles, the key question remains whether corporate earnings can outpace the pressure from persistent interest rates. She also pointed out that the direction of earnings growth will largely depend on policies introduced by the new administration. In the short term, interest rates will steer market movements, but over the long run, earnings growth will be the main driver. Guild also highlighted mid-cap stocks as an attractive investment due to their favorable valuations.  Further reinforcing this outlook, FactSet\u2019s February 14 report revealed that eight sectors have reported year-over-year revenue growth for Q4, with the IT sector leading the gains. Conversely, three sectors, led by Industrials and Materials, have shown a decline in revenue. This trend suggests a solid close to 2024 earnings. For 2025, FactSet analysts estimate a 12.7% year-over-year earnings growth. Our Methodology To determine the 15 technology stocks with the best earnings growth in 2025, we began by analyzing all U.S.-listed tech companies with a market capitalization of at least $2 billion. To exclude unprofitable companies, we considered only companies that reported a positive net profit margin over the trailing twelve months period. From this refined list, we further narrowed our selection to those expected to achieve greater than 25% EPS growth this year. Regarding next financial year (FY), for firms with more than six months remaining in their fiscal year, we used FY 2025 earnings estimates, while for those with six months or less left, we relied on FY 2026 estimates. Additionally, we considered only stocks with a projected upside of more than 10%. Finally, we ranked the companies in ascending order based on their expected earnings growth for next financial year (FY). We also included data on hedge fund holdings in these companies as of Q4 2024 to provide further insight into investor interest.   Story Continues Note: All pricing data is as of market close on February 21.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) the Tech Stock with Best Earnings Growth in 2025?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Expected EPS Growth Next FY: 50%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) designs and manufactures graphics processing units (GPUs), system on a chip units (SoCs), and AI hardware and software. Over the years, the company has expanded its offerings from gaming GPUs to include data center solutions, AI computing, and deep learning technologies. The company\u2019s GPUs are widely used in data centers for high-performance computing, AI training, and inference, making it a critical player in the data center ecosystem. Its products are essential for powering advanced applications in AI, machine learning, and data analytics. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) boasts the best margin profile among the companies in this list.Without a doubt, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) experienced substantial gains from the AI-driven enthusiasm, as evidenced by its 180% share price increase in 2024. However, in 2025, the shares have been sluggish and have not delivered any returns as of the close on February 21. The company is set to report its Q4 2024 results on February 26, and it is expected to be a highly anticipated event. Analysts have expressed concerns about the significant investments made by mega-cap companies in AI and related technologies and the extent of earnings benefits from these investments.A few days before the results, on February 21, Deutsche Bank released a cautious report on the company. While the analyst anticipates a strong set of quarterly results, he is not very optimistic about the guidance for the next quarter, which he believes offers limited potential upside from current levels. The ongoing complexities of the Blackwell ramp may restrict the guidance from exceeding the current consensus. The analyst also questions the sustainability of high demand levels in the coming years.Overall, NVDA ranks 7th on our list of tech stocks with best earnings growth in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\u00a0Disclosure: None.

NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    110.15 +1.77 (+1.63%)  At close: 4:00:00 PM EDT  109.40 -0.75 (-0.68%) Pre-Market: 5:40:13 AM EDT   Advanced Chart    The AI chipmaker\u2019s earnings results are a major test for the AI trade as investors closely watch whether Big Tech is maintaining its torrid pace of spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure, including investments in Nvidia\u2019s $40,000 GPUs (graphics processing units). Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and Meta (META) together purchased an estimated $44 billion worth of Nvidia GPUs in the 2024 calendar year, according to a DA Davidson analysis. Watch live: Nvidia earnings insights, call snippets, and in-depth analysis  Wall Street once again has high expectations: Analysts expect revenue to rise 73% to $38.2 billion and earnings per share to jump 63% to $0.84 for the quarter. Nvidia stock has stalled over the last six months. Shares slid 9% over the five trading sessions ending Tuesday amid inflation fears linked to President Donald Trump\u2019s trade and immigration policies that drove down major indexes. Adding pressure to Nvidia stock were reports of the Trump administration considering tighter export controls on the chip sector and fears of further delays related to Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell AI chips and servers.

Of the 60 analysts tracked by Yahoo Finance, 56 have Buy ratings on the stock and, on average, see shares rising to $171.64 over the next 12 months. With Nvidia\u2019s gain early Wednesday, shares stood just above $132. Read more: How does Nvidia make money? As Yahoo Finance\u2019s Jared Blikre writes, investors\u2019 reaction to Nvidia earnings \u2014 which are historically volatile \u2014 may not reflect the bigger picture. According to Yahoo Finance\u2019s analysis, buying Nvidia stock just before the earnings announcement has yielded a medium return of up to 4% on the one-month time frame over the last decade, but holding for three months yielded nearly 18%.

Upgrade Now          Jim Cramer on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): \u2018While We Still Have To Worry About Tariffs And Export Restrictions, I Have To Tell You, The Numbers Were Excellent\u2019      Syeda Seirut Javed   February 28, 2025 5 min read        5   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Shed Light on These 10 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, pointed out that ongoing uncertainty around tariff policies is likely to continue influencing market movements. He highlighted that stocks saw a decline on Wednesday after President Donald Trump raised the issue of tariffs during a cabinet meeting. \u201cWe were flying high\u2026 when President Trump started talking in a televised cabinet meeting and it didn't take long for him to be, to talk about his obsession: tariffs.\u201d  READ ALSO: 7 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar and Jim Cramer Commented on 12 Stocks Linked to Data Centers Trump has long been determined to address trade imbalances, often pointing out that many countries have trade surpluses with the United States, a situation he intends to change. Cramer noted that this tariff talk has become such a recurring theme that it is beginning to wear on investors. He expressed concern that the constant mention of tariffs, especially in the presence of a camera, is increasingly shaping the market environment. As a citizen, Cramer said he has no issue with tariffs if they are used to protect against unfair trade practices. \u201cBut as someone who cares about the stock market, I can tell you that we're entering a new, more mercurial world where we have to start worrying about the president's public appearances because we don't know which country, which continent, which ally he is going to attack next.\u201d  Cramer also emphasized that the unpredictability of tariff discussions has overshadowed other major economic concerns. For example, the bond market, which had dominated financial conversations for years, has taken a back seat due to the overwhelming focus on tariffs. He pointed to a significant drop in long-term interest rates, noting that the 10-year treasury bond, which had seemed on track to approach 5%, has now fallen to 4.25%. He commented that the change in the bond market is striking considering that the U.S. government has continued to hold large bond auctions. He added: \u201cLong-term interest rates have plummeted. The 10-year treasury, which not that long goes seemed to be headed toward 5%, is now slouching toward 4%, finishing at 4.25% today. That's insane, especially when you remember that we have kept, keep having gigantic bond auctions\u2026 A couple months ago, if we got this kind of action, the bond market stocks would've exploded higher, probably making new all-time high after all-time high after all-time high.\u201d    Story Continues Our MethodologyFor this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on February 26. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Magic Formula Stock for 2025?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was mentioned during the episode and here\u2019s what Mad Money\u2019s host had to say:\u201cNow, I don't wanna obscure the company where the stock\u2026 that I always say own, don't trade Nvidia. After the close, it was a very good quarter. Everyone thought this would be the most eventful quarter of earnings season, but it was a non-event. Why? Because it was terrific and Jensen Huang gives us terrific numbers. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), recognized for its innovations in graphics, computing, and networking technologies, is experiencing notable growth driven by its GPUs and the CUDA software platform, which are important components of AI infrastructure.Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA (NVDA) Gears Up for Pivotal AI Earnings as Analysts Stay Bullish      Ghazal Ahmed   February 25, 2025 4 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of 10 AI News Updates Making Waves on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news updates making waves on Wall Street. OpenAI has recently said that it has removed accounts of users from China and North Korea, who the company believes were using technology for malicious purposes. These include surveillance and opinion-influence operations, it said.  In the report, the company said that several accounts were using ChatGPT to write sales pitches and debug code for a suspected social media surveillance tool. In particular, they were using the technology to advertise and augment an AI assistant capable of collecting real-time data and reports about anti-China protests in the US, UK, and other Western countries. READ NOW:\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks Dominating Headlines\u00a0and\u00a015 AI Stocks Every Investor Should Be Watching Using AI tools to detect the operations, OpenAI said that authoritarian regimes use these activities and tactics. While the exact number of accounts that have been banned hasn\u2019t been revealed, it said that in one instance, users used ChatGPT to generate news articles in Spanish, denigrating the United States. Mainstream news outlets in Latin America published these under a Chinese company\u2019s byline. Other instances involved using ChatGPT technology to generate resumes and online profiles for made-up job applicants, to fraudulently get jobs at Western companies. These findings come at a time when China has been seen advancing in AI by using American technology. \u201cThis is a pretty troubling glimpse into the way one non-democratic actor tried to use democratic or US-based AI for non-democratic purposes, according to the materials they were generating themselves,\u201d  Nimmo further stated that OpenAI has published such cases to shed light on how \u201cauthoritarian regimes may try to leverage US-built AI, democratic AI, against the US and allied countries, as well as their own people.\u201d In recent months, the company has been warning politicians in the US about the potentially growing economic and national security threats coming from Chinese-built artificial intelligence. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.  Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).   Story Continues   NVIDIA (NVDA) Gears Up for Pivotal AI Earnings as Analysts Stay Bullish  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services.\u00a0One of the biggest analyst calls for Friday, February 21, was for Nvidia Corporation. Morgan Stanley reiterated the stock as \u201cOverweight\u201d, stating that \u201canother pivotal moment for AI\u201d is coming when the company reports earnings next week.\u201cNVIDIA remains the mainstay for whether AI stocks advance or move lower.\u201d With the company reporting earnings on February 26, investor sentiment isn\u2019t as ecstatic as the previous year. However, some analyst firms such as Morgan Stanley and Keybanc are still highly optimistic about the stock. A day before the Morgan Stanley rating, KeyBanc raised the firm\u2019s price target on the stock to $190 from $180 and kept an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating on the shares.The firm said that even though concerns remain regarding constraints associated with the ramp of GB200 NVL servers, the company is still likely to report strong Q4 results.Overall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of AI news updates making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          What Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) Data Center Spending Cuts Mean For Nvidia (NVDA)      Jabran Kundi   February 25, 2025 3 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%    MSFT   +1.81%       The most anticipated earnings report of the quarter is just around the corner. Nvidia is set to announce its earnings report on the 26th of February, with many expecting an earnings beat on both the top line and the bottom line. We still don\u2019t know if there will be any substantial impact from the delay in the Blackwell line of GPUs and whether the company has started shipping it out at scale. However, there are now fears that the product may not be as in demand as initially expected.   Analyst Explains NVIDIA (NVDA)\u2019s \u2018Tricky Problem\u2019   TD Cowen came out with an analyst note stating Microsoft has canceled data center leaders with at least two operators and is scaling back international spending. This is going to spook investors as the company was expected to be the biggest AI infrastructure spender in 2025. The fact that Microsoft was Nvidia\u2019s largest customer in terms of GPUs bought in 2024 means the development is significant. Even if it doesn\u2019t immediately impact the Nvidia earnings, it will dampen the optimism heading into the earnings and possibly result in EPS revisions, especially if the Nvidia earnings surprise to the downside.  The Windows software maker has also walked away from multiple data center deals while letting over 1 gigawatt worth of deals expire. This could all of course be just business as usual and small delays instead of outright cancellation. Microsoft was quick to clarify that the company\u2019s plans of spending $80 billion in 2025 are still on. This would settle some nerves among investors but the fear has already set in and may creep into Nvidia\u2019s earnings lead-up. Nvidia is expected to post an EPS of $0.85 on revenue of just over $38 billion. While future GPU demand isn\u2019t a concern for now, there are question marks over the company\u2019s ability to deliver Blackwell GPUs in time. KeyBanc analysts are confident of the company\u2019s ability to get over these issues and deliver strong earnings and guidance: Despite prior concerns regarding constraints associated with the ramp of GB200 NVL servers, we expect NVDA to report strong F4Q results, which we anticipate will solidly beat, and to guide F1Q conservatively and moderately higher than consensus.  Some customers have increased their orders of H20 GPUs while they wait for the company to resolve the Blackwell GPU execution issues. If that\u2019s the case, the company may be able to withstand any negative effects of the delay and report both a strong quarter and a strong guidance. Nvidia is 5th on our latest list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 223 hedge fund portfolios held NVDA at the end of the fourth quarter which was 193 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Upgrade Now          Is Nvidia (NVDA) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?      Zacks Equity Research   February 26, 2025 4 min read           In This Article:  NVDA         Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter? Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nvidia (NVDA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.  Nvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.23, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 44 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.23 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy. Of the 44 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 38 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 86.4% and 4.6% of all recommendations. Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NVDA   Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for NVDA   Check price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>The ABR suggests buying Nvidia, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation. Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.  This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements. Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision. ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether. The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.   Story Continues Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is NVDA a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the past month to $2.94.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nvidia.

Upgrade Now          Why Nvidia (NVDA) Is Climbing Today      Larry Ramer   February 26, 2025 2 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%     CSCO   +0.15%      Nvidia (NVDA) is advancing 2.5% after the tech giant announced yesterday that it was widening its alliance with Cisco (CSCO). Also importantly, NVDA is slated to unveil its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings today after the market closes. Ahead of the company's results, investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald remained bullish on its longer-term outlook.   NVIDIA (NVDA) Sees Strong AI Demand Despite GB200 NVL Server Constraints   NVDA's Enhanced Alliance With Cisco The two companies disclosed that they will utilize more of each others' technology going forward. Their partnership seeks to make it easier for firms to utilize AI by facilitating the enhancements of their data centers. Under the extended deal, NVDA will increase the competitiveness of its networking offerings by including Cisco's chips in it. The chips will increase the functionality of NVDA's offerings, according to the companies. Nvidia also uses the partnership, which launched a year ago, to sell its own chips to Cisco's customers.  Cantor Fitzgerald Kept a $200 Price Target on NVDA Ahead of Its Q4 Results In a note to investors on Monday, the investment bank maintained a $200 price target and an Overweight rating on NVDA. Cantor Fitzgerald noted that the chip maker typically surpasses its quarterly revenue guidance by about $2 billion, while its sales usually rise by $2 billion to $2.5 billion each quarter. On the other hand, this performance has led to elevated expectations, and Cantor believes that the company may not raise its guidance much above analysts' average outlook later today. The investment bank thinks that the stock may break out of its current range when NVDA reports its fiscal Q1 results, since its new Blackwell chip is slated to be fully launched around that time. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Poised for AI Growth as GPU Demand Surges      Bob Karr   February 27, 2025 6 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. DWS, an expert in active, passive, and alternative asset management, believes that expectations around the usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\u00a0across industries acted as one of the critical stock market drivers over the previous 2 years. In 2025, AI developments are expected to make significant strides throughout various domains. The firm anticipates a shift from generalized applications to industry-specific solutions. Notably, companies are expected to refine their strategies to target specific use cases providing measurable results. Generative AI CapEx Will Continue to Increase, Says DWS DWS, while quoting Bloomberg estimates, highlighted that some of the big technology firms can collectively increase capex to ~$200 billion in 2025. More than $90 billion in incremental capital spending in 2024-25 vs. 2023 is projected to be earmarked mainly for expanding Gen AI infrastructure. On a related note, Goldman Sachs Asset Management believes that the AI capex from well-established hyperscalers is projected to surpass $250 billion in 2025. This hints at optimism that hyperscalers remain confident in the ROI (Return on Investment) they will witness from such significant investments.  DWS sees the de-globalization movement spreading to data and AI, with countries spending a significant amount to subsidize \u201csovereign AI.\u201d To provide a brief overview, it refers to a nation\u2019s capabilities to establish, control, and deploy its own AI technologies. It spans both physical and data infrastructures. Notably, in the past year, the governments of the US and China have pledged $40 billion - $50 billion each dedicated towards AI investments.

Key AI Trends to Watch Out Appinventiv\u00a0believes that conversational AI, Predictive Analytics, AI Democratization, Agentic AI, and Generative AI, among others, are some of the key trends to watch out for. While conversational AI focuses on streamlining customer interactions, generative AI has been revolutionizing content creation across fields including healthcare. Additionally, multi-modal Al remains one of the most popular AI trends in business. It focuses on leveraging machine learning trained on multiple modalities, including speech, images, and traditional numerical data sets. As a result, there will be a more holistic and human-like cognitive experience.   Story Continues Appinventiv\u00a0opines that companies can capitalize on multi-modal Al and develop intelligent systems analyzing diverse data streams, which can help improve natural language understanding and voice recognition for better user experiences.Our MethodologyTo list the 10 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket, we sifted through several online rankings and shortlisted the companies catering to the broader AI sector. Next, we chose the ones that analysts see significant upside to. Finally, the stocks are arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of February 24. We also mentioned hedge fund sentiments around each stock, as of Q4 2024.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) the Tech Stock with Best Earnings Growth in 2025?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Average Upside Potential: 35.6%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) offers graphics and compute and networking solutions. Mark Lipacis, an analyst from Evercore ISI, maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the company\u2019s stock with the same price objective of $190.00. As per the analyst, the company continues to be a preferred platform for hyperscalers because of its strong ecosystem, and demand for its GPUs has been outstripping supply. Additionally, the advancements in AI, including improved cost efficiencies and higher computational needs for multi-modal models, can fuel the adoption of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s technology, aiding its long-term growth thesis. Elsewhere, DBS also maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating with a price objective of $160.00.The build-out of AI infrastructure has been a major tailwind for the company. Cloud service providers, enterprises, and even sovereign states have been fueling demand for AI computing power. This trend can help NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) sustain its growth. The accelerated adoption of AI throughout industries, spanning healthcare to finance, can fuel strong demand for the company\u2019s products and services. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s dynamic position in the AI ecosystem places it well to improve its share of the growing market.Baron Funds, an investment management company, released its Q4 2024 investor letter.\u00a0Here is what the fund said:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company specializing in compute and networking systems for accelerated computing and AI. Shares increased 10.6% for the quarter and were up 170.3% in 2024, on strong quarterly results, with record data center revenue, which surpassed $30 billion, driven by demand for its Hopper GPUs, while Gaming and Automotive also beat expectations. Key investor debates include the continued progress on improving the capability of AI models (e.g. scaling laws \u2013 see more in the outlook section below), transition from AI training to inference and the potential impact on competitive dynamics, and the pace of adoption of AI across industries. Despite near-term uncertainties, we maintain conviction in NVIDIA\u2019s leadership in accelerated computing, driven by its ability to innovate and adapt to market shifts. With robust margins, a dominant data center presence, and a growing ecosystem across hardware and software, we believe NVIDIA is well positioned to capitalize on the structural growth in AI and high-performance computing.\u201d Overall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks that will skyrocket. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a020 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a0Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.

GuruFocus News   February 27, 2025 4 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       Revenue: $39.3 billion for Q4, up 12% sequentially and 78% year on year; fiscal 2025 revenue was $130.5 billion, up 114% from the prior year.

Release Date: February 26, 2025 For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript. Positive Points NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported a record revenue of $39.3 billion for Q4, up 12% sequentially and 78% year-on-year, surpassing their outlook. Data center revenue for fiscal 2025 was $115.2 billion, more than doubling from the prior year, driven by strong demand for Blackwell and Hopper 200 products. The Blackwell product ramp is the fastest in the company's history, with $11 billion in revenue generated in Q4 alone. NVIDIA's inference demand is accelerating, with Blackwell offering up to 25x higher token throughput and 20x lower cost compared to previous models. Enterprise revenue increased nearly 2x year-on-year, driven by demand for model fine-tuning and AI workflows.  Negative Points Networking revenue declined 3% sequentially, although it is expected to return to growth in Q1. Gaming revenue decreased 22% sequentially and 11% year-on-year, impacted by supply constraints. GAAP gross margins were down sequentially due to the initial deliveries of the Blackwell architecture. China's data center sales remain well below previous levels due to export controls, with no expected change in the near future. The complexity and customization of Blackwell systems present challenges in manufacturing and gross margin improvements.    Story Continues Q & A HighlightsQ: As test-time compute and reinforcement learning show promise, how does this impact the potential for inference-dedicated clusters and NVIDIA's strategy? A: Jensen Huang, CEO, explained that there are multiple scaling laws, including pre-training, post-training, and test-time compute. The demand for post-training and reasoning AI is increasing, requiring more compute power. NVIDIA's architecture is designed to handle these demands, making it versatile for various AI models and ensuring a unified architecture for data centers.Q: Can you discuss the ramp-up of the GB200 systems and any bottlenecks at the systems level? A: Jensen Huang, CEO, stated that the ramp-up of Grace Blackwell systems has been successful, with significant shipments since CES. Despite the complexity, NVIDIA has managed to scale production effectively, meeting high demand from customers like CoreWeave and Microsoft.Q: Is Q1 the bottom for gross margins, and what gives you confidence in sustaining strong demand into next year? A: Colette Kress, CFO, noted that gross margins will be in the low 70s during the Blackwell ramp, with improvements expected later in the year. Jensen Huang, CEO, highlighted the ongoing capital investment in data centers and the shift towards AI-based software, which supports sustained demand.Q: How do you manage the simultaneous ramps of Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra, and is the launch on track? A: Jensen Huang, CEO, confirmed that Blackwell Ultra is set for the second half of the year. The transition from Blackwell to Blackwell Ultra will be smoother due to similar system architectures, and NVIDIA is working closely with partners to ensure a successful rollout.Q: Can you discuss the balance between custom ASICs and merchant GPUs, and the potential for heterogeneous superclusters? A: Jensen Huang, CEO, emphasized that NVIDIA's architecture is general and flexible, supporting a wide range of AI models and applications. The performance, software ecosystem, and rapid deployment capabilities make NVIDIA's GPUs a preferred choice over custom ASICs.For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

The enterprises have been entering 2025 with a transition to the cloud, and they are slowly accelerating their investments in GenAI projects. The rating agency opines that hardware spending is expected to improve significantly in 2025. The server shipments are expected to increase ~4% but revenue growth will be significantly higher considering high AI server ASPs. The firm sees network equipment and mobile telecom equipment makers returning to growth while storage sales are expected to grow ~4%. Hyperscale cloud providers are expected to sustain strong revenue growth of over 20%, and the rest of IT services can recover with a growth of ~5% after lackluster performance over the previous 2 years. S&P Global sees this recovery due to the early signs of demand stabilization during Q2 2024 and Q3 2024, with several IT service providers reporting growth in bookings for large transformation projects and improving annual contract values in critical verticals.

Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Long Term Tech Stock to Buy Right Now?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)10-Year Revenue Growth: ~37.8%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) offers graphics and compute and networking solutions. Tristan Gerra, an analyst from Robert W. Baird, maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the company\u2019s stock. The associated price target stood at $195.00. The analyst\u2019s rating is backed by a combination of factors reflecting NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s healthy market positioning and future growth potential. As per the analyst, the company\u2019s advancements in\u00a0AI\u00a0data centers and their healthy relationships with renowned enterprise customers such as Ali and Tencent continue to drive the surge in orders.Furthermore, the company\u2019s integration of DSP on ASIC also showcases its support for emerging technologies such as CPOs and LPOs. Overall, the firm\u2019s price target is backed by NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s healthy positioning and performance gains. The AI infrastructure build-out has been a major tailwind for the company. Notably, cloud service providers, consumer internet companies, and sovereign states continue to fuel demand for AI computing power. These favourable measures are expected to help NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s growth trajectory over the upcoming years.Mairs & Power, an investment advisor, released the Q4 2024 investor letter.\u00a0Here\u00a0is what the fund said:\u201cWe prefer to invest in our backyard, as Minnesota and the Upper Midwest are blessed with a rich and diverse business community. As such, seven out of our 10 largest relative bets are based in our region (MN, WI, IA, SD, ND, IL). That said, we are unafraid to look beyond our geographic area if we find exceptional opportunities. In 2019, we found such an opportunity in a graphics processing technology company called\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA). At the time, we felt NVIDIA would be a good way to leverage the growing interest in video games, as most of its chips were popular amongst \u201cgamers\u201d to enhance graphics. But what really grabbed our interest was its smaller, albeit faster-growing, data center business that was positioned to benefit from the emergence of high-performance computing, such as deep learning and machine learning, and the related field of AI. The rest, as they say, is history. NVIDIA is one of a number of Technology holdings that we have added over the past decade, which has raised eyebrows since our Firm was well-known for avoiding the Tech Bubble in the late 1990s. Unlike the dot-com companies that operated at the turn-of-the-century, many of today\u2019s technology companies are established businesses with significant cash flows. We have argued, and continue to argue, that many of these investments are perfectly aligned with our investments process in that they embody durable competitive advantages, above-average growth prospects, and excellent management teams.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of best long term tech stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          3 reasons why Nvidia is underperforming the S&P 500 going into its earnings      Brian Sozzi   \u00b7 Executive Editor Updated February 10, 2025 3 min read        50   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%    AMD   +0.04%    AMZN   +1.00%       Nvidia (NVDA) investors are navigating through an un-Nvidia-like start to the year. Shares of the AI chip darling are off by 1% this year, lagging all three major US indexes, which have notched gains. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) by over 5% in the past month. Ahead of Nvidia's results expected on Feb. 26, the Street has been out and about explaining the surprising weakness to clients and mostly defending the stock. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    110.15 +1.77 (+1.63%)  At close: 4:00:00 PM EDT  109.40 -0.75 (-0.68%) Pre-Market: 5:40:13 AM EDT NVDA ^GSPC   Advanced Chart    In a note on Monday, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis pointed to three reasons for the weakness after talking with clients: 1) DeepSeek lowering AI demand in aggregate, 2) DeepSeek shifting AI compute cycles away from Nvidia GPUs and to ASICs [custom chips], and 3) Blackwell chip delays. Despite the concerns, Lipacis said he would be a buyer of the stock into Nvidia's earnings. The analyst reiterated an Outperform rating and a $190 price target. \"Nvidia remains the platform of choice for hyperscalers\u2019 customers,\" Lipacis explained. \"The robustness of its software ecosystem and breadth of its development community put it 5-10 years ahead of anything else in the market. AMD and Amazon AWS ecosystems are a distant #2 and #3.\"  The concerns about Nvidia aren't unfounded, however. China-based DeepSeek surprised markets in late January after unveiling RI, its AI model that it says gives a ChatGPT-esque performance at a cheaper price tag. RI cost a reported $5.6 million to build a base model, compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars incurred at US-based companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic. Fears mounted instantly that US companies are overspending on AI infrastructure, which includes Nvidia chips. \u201cConventional wisdom all of last year was that training amazing models was going to be possible for only a handful of companies,\u201d Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast. \u201cWhat DeepSeek has done over the past few weeks is shatter that belief by saying they can train a model for $6 million.\u201d  Meanwhile, Amazon has announced an $8 billion partnership with Anthropic to enter the AI chip space, and Google (GOOG) has dropped a supercomputer with an AI chip called Willow. With those moves, it's evident Big Tech companies want in on Nvidia's hefty market share. What's more, Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell (MRVL) have released advanced custom chips. Watch: What Bill Gates thought of Steve Jobs Lipacis isn't alone in staying bullish on Nvidia going into earnings despite the less-than-favorable news flow this year. Bank of America's Vivek Arya reiterated the chipmaker as his top pick for 2025 last week.   Story Continues Arya has a $190 price target, which assumes about 57% upside from current trading levels. It's one of the highest price targets on Nvidia on the Street.\"The [earnings] call could mark the trough in investor sentiment as: 1) we expect Nvidia to reassure on Blackwell execution, 2) Signal confidence around fiscal year 2026/calendar year 2025 with 60%+ year over year growth in data center sales (still leaves headroom vs. Taiwan Semiconductor's call for AI to grow 100%+ year over year in calendar year 2025 end), and 3) create excitement ahead of flagship GTC Conf. (Mar 17) where focus shifts to solid pipeline (GB300, Rubin), and physical AI (robotics),\" Arya wrote in the note to clients.The Street hasn't baked sector worries into Nvidia's financial estimates just yet.Data from Yahoo Finance shows there have been five upward revisions to Nvidia's estimates for 2025 earnings over the past 30 days. There have also been seven upward revisions in the past 30 days to Nvidia's EPS estimates for 2026.

Upgrade Now          Calculating The Fair Value Of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)      editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)   February 28, 2025 6 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       Key Insights Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, NVIDIA fair value estimate is US$107 NVIDIA's US$120 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate Our fair value estimate is 39% lower than NVIDIA's analyst price target of US$175  Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine. Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.  View our latest analysis for NVIDIA  Step By Step Through The Calculation We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast  2025202620272028202920302031203220332034  Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$64.6bUS$98.8bUS$124.5bUS$147.5bUS$149.0bUS$164.0bUS$174.7bUS$184.2bUS$192.7bUS$200.5b Growth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x19Analyst x16Analyst x17Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 6.55%Est @ 5.41%Est @ 4.61%Est @ 4.06%  Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$59.7kUS$84.3kUS$98.2kUS$107.4kUS$100.2kUS$101.9kUS$100.3kUS$97.7kUS$94.4kUS$90.8k  (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$935b   Story Continues We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.8%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$200b\u00d7 (1 + 2.8%) \u00f7 (8.2%\u2013 2.8%) = US$3.7tPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.7t\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$1.7tThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$2.6t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$120, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.  NasdaqGS:NVDA Discounted Cash Flow February 28th 2025  The AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NVIDIA as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.270. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for NVIDIAStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry. Debt is not viewed as a risk. WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market. OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market. Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio. ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year. Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For NVIDIA, we've put together three additional factors you should further examine:Risks: We feel that you should assess the 2 warning signs for NVIDIA (1 is a bit unpleasant!) we've flagged before making an investment in the company.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia sells $11 billion of next-gen Blackwell AI chips in 'fastest product ramp in our company\u2019s history'      Laura Bratton    Updated February 27, 2025 3 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%    MSFT   +1.81%    AMZN   +1.00%    META   +1.67%     GOOG   +1.70%      Nvidia (NVDA) said Wednesday that its latest Blackwell AI chips have reached full-scale production, generating $11 billion in revenue during its fourth quarter. \"We delivered $11.0 billion of Blackwell architecture revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the fastest product ramp in our company\u2019s history,\" said Nvidia CFO Colette Kress in comments released with the chipmaker's earnings results Wednesday after the bell.  Watch live: Nvidia earnings insights, call snippets, and in-depth analysis \"Blackwell sales were led by large cloud service providers which represented approximately 50% of our Data Center revenue.\" Nvidia\u2019s fourth quarter earnings surpassed Wall Street's high expectations. The chipmaker reported revenue of $39.3 billion, beating Wall Street\u2019s estimate of $38.2 billion, with data center revenue reaching $35.6 billion, ahead of the $34.1 billion expected, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.89, more than the $0.84 expected.   CEO Jensen Huang waves after delivering the keynote address of Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif., Monday, March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)  \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS CEO Jensen Huang said in a separate statement, \"We\u2019ve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter.\" The commentary dispelled fears of further Blackwell delays. Production of massive server racks using Nvidia's latest AI chips had been pushed back amid reports of overheating issues and glitches, which reportedly prompted Nvidia's top customers \u2014 Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and Meta (META) \u2014 to cut orders of Blackwell products. Those four customers alone (known as \"hyperscalers\") purchased an estimated $44 billion worth of Nvidia GPUs in the 2024 calendar year, according to a DA Davidson analysis.   Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis had suggested in a note earlier this week that Blackwell production could be pushed back to the middle of 2025. Nvidia's commentary Wednesday addressed such concerns. \"Based on the Q4 numbers and the guidance, it seems like demand for Blackwell ... is very, very strong, and one can assume is coming from the hyperscalers,\" Ali Mogharabi, senior equity analyst at WestEnd Capital Management, told Yahoo Finance in an interview after the earnings report.  On the company's earnings call, Kress added that sales to hyperscalers doubled year over year, adding, \"Large CSPs [cloud service providers] were among the first to stand up Blackwell, with Azure, GCP [Google Cloud Products], AWS, and OCI [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure] bringing 200 [Blackwell] systems to cloud regions around the world to meet surging customer demand for AI.\"   Story Continues Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google parent Alphabet are expecting to spend a cumulative $325 billion in capital expenditures and investments in 2025 driven by a continued commitment to building out artificial intelligence infrastructure.Nvidia said it anticipates its first quarter revenue will hit $43 billion, plus or minus 2%, above the $42.3 billion expected by Wall Street analysts, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\"Initially, we are focused on expediting the manufacturing of Blackwell systems to meet strong customer demand as they race to build out Blackwell infrastructure,\" Kress said.Huang added that \"customers are anxious and impatient to get their Blackwell systems.\"NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    110.15 +1.77 (+1.63%)  At close: 4:00:00 PM EDT  109.40 -0.75 (-0.68%) Pre-Market: 5:40:13 AM EDT   Advanced Chart   Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
