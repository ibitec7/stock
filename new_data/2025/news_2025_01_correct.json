Upgrade Now          NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Why Should You Buy This Growth Stock For The Next 5 Years?      Maham Fatima   January 19, 2025 5 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 5 Years.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other growth stocks. Kevin Mahn, President & CIO at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management, recently appeared on CNBC on January 6 to discuss the current market momentum and emphasize the need for investors to be selective in 2025 to find growth opportunities. He highlighted that while the MAG7 have led the market recently, their leadership may not continue. Mahn referenced historical data, noting that since 1950, there have been nine instances where the market rallied by 20% or more, with the market rising in eight of those cases. However, he pointed out that gains in the following year averaged only 3.6%, indicating a need for careful selection. He also acknowledged recent market trends, including a decline in the S&P 500's performance and a potential shift in investor sentiment following events like the Santa Claus Rally.  He predicted a path of lower interest rates, expecting 50 basis points of cuts this year instead of the previously anticipated 100 basis points. Mahn suggested that this environment would create favorable conditions for stocks and bonds but urged investors to diversify beyond mega-cap tech stocks into sectors like biotech and aerospace. Earlier on January 3 as well, Mahn noted that after two consecutive years of gains, a third year of strong performance appears unlikely. He remarked that it seems the Grinch got in the way of the Santa Claus rally this year. He also addressed concerns from investors tempted to time the market or sell their holdings. He warned against trying to time the market, describing it as often futile. Instead, he advocated for rebalancing portfolios to align with long-term goals and risk tolerance. He suggested that the economic landscape is changing, with lower interest rates and stagnant economic growth expected moving forward. Mahn advised investors to take profits from sectors that previously led the market and consider reallocating those funds into different areas poised for future growth. He highlighted biotech as a promising sector, noting bipartisan agreement on the need to lower drug prices. This shift could lead large-cap pharmaceutical companies to seek new revenue sources, making smaller biotech firms attractive.  Methodology We first sifted through online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years. We then selected the stocks with high 5-year revenue growth and high analysts' upside potential. From those we picked 15 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024.   Story Continues Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) The Stock That Will Go to the Moon According to Reddit?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 1935-Year Revenue CAGR: 62.43%Upside Potential as of January 15: 30.72%NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a technology company that designs and manufactures GPUs for gaming and professional markets. It also develops AI platforms, high-performance computing solutions, and self-driving car technologies to power industries like gaming, data centers, and automotive.Bank of America maintained its $190 price target for the company recently, suggesting a 27% upside potential. This optimism is driven by the release of Blackwell GPUs, which have already secured 12 months of orders. At CES 2025, the company unveiled Project DIGITS, a personal AI supercomputer powered by the new GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip. This compact system delivers petaflop-level AI performance while operating on standard household electricity. Project DIGITS is designed to empower researchers, data scientists, and students to develop and run large AI models locally. With 128GB of memory and up to 4TB of storage, the system is well-equipped to handle demanding AI workloads.In Q3 2024, NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) achieved record revenue of $35.1 billion, a 94% year-over-year surge. This was driven by a 112% increase in Data Center revenue to $30.8 billion. GPU revenue has demonstrated robust growth, surging 67% annually over the past three years. This performance is fueled by the demand for computing power necessitated by advancements in AI and ML.Manole Capital Management noted that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) more than tripled in value over the past year, due to strong AI-related demand and continued revenue growth that exceeds market expectations. Here's what it said in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\u201cAs of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date.\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.\u201d Overall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years. As we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Ali Hassan   January 24, 2025 4 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%     ^DJI   -0.03%      We recently published a list of 12 Best Dow Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best Dow stocks to buy right now. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is among the most popular stock market indices globally. Known as the Dow, the index monitors the performance of 30 blue-chip companies listed on the US stock exchanges. In 2024, the Dow index returned over 16%, compared to a 25% return for the broader market.  Historically, the Dow has performed better compared to the broader market. According to S&P Global, in the past 30 years up until June 2021, the Dow index returned approximately 11.16% compared to the market\u2019s return of 10.6%. This growth is mainly due to the Dow\u2019s stable, industry-leading companies that offer reliable dividends and returns.

Since the beginning of 2025, Dow Jones has soared over 4% as mega-cap tech stocks surged following their positive earnings. Whereas, the S&P 500 index has jumped by 3.70% year-to-date, as of January 23. Trump\u2019s AI startup initiative is already pumping the tech stocks. The $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure project led by Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank will accelerate the AI demand. Tech stocks are already dominating the market driven by the huge demand for AI. Nasdaq Composite returned nearly 30% in 2024, outperforming the Dow and the S&P 500. The U.S. economy is expected to perform better this year compared to 2024 followed by lower interest rates and PCE inflation expected around 2.1%. Economists anticipate a suitable atmosphere for mergers and acquisitions. Investing in Dow Jones stocks can be appealing in 2025 as they offer huge dividends and returns. The Dow stocks have strong balance sheets and have a proven track record of high yields. Our Methodology We shifted through the Dow Jones Index and selected the 12 best Dow stocks based on hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024. The best Dow stocks are ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund holdings. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Dow Stocks to Buy Right Now?   A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.   Story Continues NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the most discussed company in this AI boom, renowned for its semiconductor business and its groundbreaking AI GPUs, gaming, and data centres.NVIDIA continues to grow its earnings driven by high demand for its AI products and services. The company delivered another record quarter in Q4 2024. NVIDIA Corporation posted quarterly revenue of $22.1 billion, up by 265% year-over-year and well above the $20 billion quarterly outlook. The full-year 2024 revenue was $60.9 billion, up 126% from a year ago.For the first quarter of 2025, the company expects revenue to be around $24 billion, above or below 2%. NVDA expects sequential growth in data centres, mainly driven by the seasonal decline in gaming. Barclays analyst Tom O\u2019Malley expects NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s GPU sales to reach $100 billion in 2024 and projects them to grow to $160 billion in 2025. The analyst pointed out that custom silicon will grow at a faster CAGR of 55% in the next three years, and NVDA will significantly benefit from it.Overall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of best Dow stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Why Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Among the Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now?      Bob Karr   January 20, 2025 5 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other best semiconductor stocks. In an updated forecast, The World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) revised its 2024 projections upward, expecting a strong 19.0% YoY growth in the broader semiconductor market. The global market value for 2024 is now pegged at $627 billion, demonstrating improvement in performance in Q2 2024 and Q3 2024, mainly in the computing sector. Growth in 2024 is expected to be aided by 2 Integrated Circuit segments- Memory, which can increase by 81.0%, and Logic, which is expected to grow by 16.9%. Region-wise, the Americas and Asia Pacific are well-placed to lead the recovery, with expected growth rates of 38.9% and 17.5%, respectively. What Lies Ahead for The Semiconductor Market? WSTS expects broad-based improvement for the semiconductor market in 2025, with an 11.2% growth, resulting in an estimated $697 billion in global market valuation. This growth is expected off the back of the Logic and Memory sectors, which together are expected to surpass $400 billion in value. This consists of a YoY growth of more than 17% for Logic and 13% for Memory. Notably, other semiconductor categories are projected to grow at more modest, single-digit rates, demonstrating a steady expansion for the broader industry. WSTS believes that, in 2025, all the regions will be well-placed for continued expansion. The Americas and Asia Pacific regions will maintain their double-digit growth year over year.

Key Trends Likely to Aid Semiconductor Market in 2025 IDC predicted some critical trends in the semiconductor market. While AI-driven rapid growth continues to be on top of the list, the Asia-Pacific IC (Integrated Circuits) design market will continue to heat up. The memory segment is expected to be aided by the increased penetration of high-end products including HBM3 and HBM3e, which are needed for AI Accelerator, and the new generation of HBM4, which is expected to be rolled out in H2 2025. The non-memory segment is expected to be supported by healthy demand for advanced node ICs for AI servers, high-end mobile phone ICs, and WiFi7.  As per IDC, Asia-Pacific IC design product lines remain rich and diversified. Since inventory levels have been stabilizing, demand for personal devices is picking up, and AI computing continues to extend to a wide range of applications, the overall demand for IC design is expected to increase. Mature nodes (22nm-500nm) continue to have a wide range of applications spanning consumer electronics, industrial control, automotive, and other industry segments. Looking ahead, the demand is anticipated to improve after the correction and oversupply. This is expected to be aided by consumer electronics and periodical inventory replenishment across automotive and industrial control sectors.

Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) The Stock That Will Go to the Moon According to Reddit?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the leading players in the semiconductor business, with expertise in designing and manufacturing advanced graphic processing units (GPUs) and related technologies. The semiconductor industry\u2019s growth is being driven by the global adoption of AI and ML, with the company\u2019s GPUs, such as A100 and H100, critical for AI model training and inference. With the broader industry scaling to meet AI demand, NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is expected to benefit from supplying cutting-edge hardware and software.Furthermore, the expansion of data centers and analysis needs more powerful and efficient semiconductors. Thus, NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s leadership in data center GPUs places it well to capture this increasing demand. The company continues to make strides in the AI and semiconductor sectors. It launched new generative AI models and blueprints to further enhance its Omniverse platform, targeting advancing robotics, AVs (autonomous vehicles), and vision AI applications.Robert W. Baird upped its target price on the shares of NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) from $150.00 to $190.00, giving an \u201cOutperform\u201d rating on 21st November. Infuse Asset Management, an investment management company, released its Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\u201cWe do still own some\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the forward multiple isn\u2019t egregious and it powers over 90% of AI workloads. This company is only becoming increasingly important though the hyperscalers are actively trying to save money through their own ASIC programs. The moat CUDA provides has been underestimated time and time again. While I don\u2019t think Nvidia has quite the upside as some of the other companies in the portfolio, it has a product that the best companies in the world literally can\u2019t get enough of.\u201d Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the best semiconductor stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): A Bull Case Theory      Ricardo Pillai   January 30, 2025 3 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We came across a\u00a0bullish thesis\u00a0on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) on Substack by Charly AI. In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on NVDA. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)'s share was trading at $128.99 as of Jan 28th. NVDA\u2019s trailing and forward P/E were 50.92 and 30.12 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.   Nvidia, Software   Photo by Christian Wiediger on Unsplash NVIDIA, a leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) and AI hardware, has long been at the forefront of the technological revolution in gaming, AI, and high-performance computing. Known for its pioneering CUDA platform, NVIDIA has cemented its position as the go-to company for AI development, providing essential tools for training deep learning models and powering data centers worldwide. The company\u2019s GPUs, particularly its H100 and A100 models, are critical to training large language models (LLMs) and supporting the heavy computational demands of AI, data analytics, and gaming applications.  However, as AI becomes more widespread, NVIDIA's stronghold is being challenged. The rapid rise of open-source AI models, like DeepSeek\u2019s R1, has introduced a new dynamic in the industry. These models can be run on local hardware or rented through third-party providers, drastically reducing the cost of inference, which is now seen as more important than training. With open-source models offering superior performance at a fraction of the price, the economic moat that NVIDIA once enjoyed is eroding, particularly as AI labs and smaller players increasingly turn to cheaper, more efficient alternatives. NVIDIA\u2019s current model relies heavily on high-margin GPUs, and the increasing competition from companies like AMD, Google, and Intel, who are developing specialized chips for AI workloads, poses a threat. AMD\u2019s MI300X, for example, is already optimized for open-source models like DeepSeek R1, providing a cheaper alternative to NVIDIA\u2019s high-end GPUs. This new wave of chipmakers, along with the growing demand for cost-effective inference, could force NVIDIA to adapt its pricing strategies and hardware offerings, which may impact its margins and overall growth trajectory in the short term.  Despite these challenges, NVIDIA\u2019s long-term prospects remain strong. Its CUDA platform, which is integral to the development of AI models, robotics, and self-driving cars, continues to be a key differentiator. There\u2019s no direct alternative to CUDA at scale, and its ubiquity in AI development ensures that NVIDIA remains a foundational player in the AI ecosystem. While its margins may face pressure in the short term due to competition and changing market dynamics, NVIDIA\u2019s critical role in AI development means it will likely continue to dominate the market for years to come. However, with stock prices currently at elevated levels, investors may want to consider the potential risks and opportunities before making long-term investment decisions, especially in the face of growing competition and shifting market forces.   Story Continues NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is on our list of the\u00a030 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 193 hedge fund portfolios held NVDA at the end of the third quarter which was 179 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): AI Leadership and Blackwell Growth Amid Challenges      Affan Mir   January 23, 2025 4 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of 10 AI News Making Waves on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news making waves on Wall Street. Semiconductor Trends Show AI as a Key Driver Chris Caso, a senior analyst at Wolfe Research, discussed key trends in the semiconductor industry in an interview with CNBC. He highlighted TSMC\u2019s strong performance. While the company\u2019s recent results are largely driven by older chips, it is forecasting 25% revenue growth in 2025, with 60% of that tied to AI. Caso noted that AI is the primary growth driver for the industry, while demand for other segments like PCs, handsets, and traditional servers remains sluggish due to inventory build-ups during the pandemic. Regarding U.S.-China tensions, Caso mentioned that U.S. export controls have effectively limited China\u2019s access to advanced chip manufacturing and AI technologies. He characterized China\u2019s retaliatory actions as attempts to respond where possible. Broad Market Growth Opportunities with AI Advancements Joe Davis, Vanguard\u2019s Global Chief Economist, advised against focusing solely on tech stocks to capitalize on AI-driven growth in an article posted on January 14. Instead, he recommends diversifying across the U.S. equity market to capture productivity gains in sectors like healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. Tech stocks, already highly valued, may not provide the best opportunities for growth. Davis noted that past technological shifts spurred growth across multiple industries, not just their core sectors. If AI\u2019s impact is slower than expected (30%-40% likelihood), fixed-income or value stocks may offer better returns in a low-growth environment. For a balanced strategy, Davis suggested investing in a broad U.S. stock market index fund or working with skilled managers to identify long-term winners, preparing for both AI\u2019s potential and the possibility of slower adoption.  For this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).   Story Continues   NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): AI Leadership and Blackwell Growth Amid Challenges  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven technologies, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud computing.On January 21, UBS noted that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has shown little movement since its last earnings report, partly due to supply chain concerns and uncertainty surrounding Blackwell server rack production. Despite these issues, UBS has a Buy rating and a $185 price target and is confident that Nvidia will report strong Q4 results and Q1 guidance, and sees worries about a potential Blackwell slowdown as exaggerated.Analyst Timothy Arcuri stated that Blackwell chipset and compute board yields have improved, with revenue for Blackwell expected to reach approximately $9 billion in January, up from a prior estimate of $5 billion. Supply chain capacity could support up to $14 billion, though Hopper revenue is anticipated to decline in January. UBS maintained its forecast of $42 billion in revenue for FQ4 2024, including $38 billion from the Data Center segment, and $47 billion for FQ1 2025.Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of AI news making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia (NVDA) Advances But Underperforms Market: Key Facts         Zacks Equity Research   January 24, 2025 3 min read              In This Article:  NVDA         Nvidia (NVDA) closed the latest trading day at $147.22, indicating a +0.1% change from the previous session's end. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.53%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.93%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.22%. The maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence's shares have seen an increase of 4.89% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.02% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.69%.  The upcoming earnings release of Nvidia will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on February 26, 2025. On that day, Nvidia is projected to report earnings of $0.84 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 61.54%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $37.72 billion, indicating a 70.68% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. NVDA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.94 per share and revenue of $129.02 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +126.15% and +111.78%, respectively. Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Nvidia should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Why Are Hedge Funds Bullish On This Revenue Growth Stock?      Zarah Hamid   January 18, 2025 4 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Revenue Growth Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other revenue growth stocks. Outlook for the Year 2025: A Positive Year for Equities? Citigroup has forecasted 2025 to be a positive and strong year for global stocks. Citi expects a rally in global equities to extend into the year 2025 and estimates a 10% EPS growth for global equities which is slightly below analysts' consensus of 13%. The stance was that declining interest rates and easing inflation could help boost corporate earnings. The major world stock benchmark, MSCI All Country World Index Local, is expected to reach 1,140 points by the end of this year which signals a 10% increase from its previous close of 1,035.46. Citi added that the United States and emerging market regions could witness the most robust earnings per share growth of about 15%.  Citi remains 'overweight' on U.S. equities but believes that the new Trump administration brings a lot of uncertainty with potential tariffs, tax cuts, and deregulation resulting in a \u2018complicated mix of favorable and adverse economic effects\u2019. In 2024, the S&P 500 index rallied 24%, driven by the expected Fed rate cuts, optimism relating to Artificial Intelligence, and the potential deregulation under the new US President-elect. Regarding the effect of these drivers on 2025, Citigroup analysts stated: \"While AI is no longer expected to provide as much EPS growth advantage vs. the rest of the index, any continuation of USD strength and policy uncertainty on tariffs could extend its outperformance\"  Our Methodology: In order to compile a list of the 10 best revenue growth stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we first used a stock screener to screen stocks that have more than $2 billion market cap and at least 25% revenue growth over the past 5 years. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 10 stocks from our list which had the highest revenue growth and were the most popular among hedge funds. The 10 best revenue growth stocks to buy according to hedge funds have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3.  At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   Story Continues   Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) The Stock That Will Go to the Moon According to Reddit?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 1935-Year Revenue Growth: 62.43%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in products and platforms for the gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive markets. The chip maker is a pioneer of GPU-accelerated computing and is well known for its GPU technology. As of 2024\u2019s third quarter, the firm had 90% of the global GPU market share.Based on the rising interest in AI and a strong demand for its AI-centric chips across various industries, NVIDIA ended up being the largest global gainer in market capitalization for 2024. Among the most valuable global stocks, the chip maker witnessed its market value increasing by more than $2 trillion last year and hitting $3.28 trillion at the close of 2024. Amid the booming demand for AI chips, NVDA beat Wall Street's expectations in its recent quarter.Recently, a risk started hovering over NVDA's sales of GPUs for data centers which account for a major portion of its revenue. The company\u2019s shares fell nearly 2% as the Biden administration released stricter rules on AI chip exports, capping the number of AI chips called GPUs that can be ordered by most countries without a special license. Nvidia vice president of government affairs Ned Finkle referred to the rule as being \u201cdrafted in secret and without proper legislative review\u201d. Previously, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya reiterated his Buy rating on NVDA shares while mentioning the stricter rule muddying the water for the company.Overall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best revenue growth stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Among the Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years?      Ashar Jawad   January 25, 2025 6 min read        4   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of 15 Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years. 2024 was a stellar year for the US markets, driven by a strong performance in the technology sector. The broader market expanded by more than 23% during the year, marking two consecutive years of over 20% growth\u2014something that had not happened in nearly three decades.

The stock market benefited from a resilient economy that avoided recession, declining interest rates, and waning inflation. Analysts are projecting continued growth in 2025 amid strong economic data and optimism about a business-friendly Trump administration returning to power. In a note on December 30, Wedbush Securities analyst, Dan Ives, wrote that he expects a 25% surge in tech stocks as the new government focuses on slashing unnecessary regulations. On the other hand, Todd Rosenbluth, the head of research at VettaFi, anticipates that ETFs specializing in small-caps will make gains as investors broaden their market exposure with interest rates dropping. While the general outlook for 2025 is encouraging, analysts are also cautious about the potential downsides of the new administration\u2019s promised tariffs. Following his election victory, Trump has vowed to impose steep tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, which could increase manufacturers\u2019 costs. Ongoing geopolitical tensions in different parts of the world could also hurt the stock market. Can ChatGPT predict the stock market? A growing number of investors are turning to ChatGPT for stock suggestions. According to a 2023 survey, around 53% of the Millenials and 50% of Generation Z respondents had used the AI chatbot for investing advice. In contrast, older Americans were skeptical of the recommendations, with only 25% of the Baby Boomers saying they had used ChatGPT to buy stocks. While most financial analysts question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, Alejandro Lopez-Lira, a finance professor at the University of Florida, says that the chatbot may be able to predict stock movements. He used the platform to parse negative and positive headlines for stocks and predict returns for the following day. Lopez-Lira was surprised to find how good the results were. Whether or not tools like ChatGPT are effective in recommending stocks and predicting their trajectory remains a debate. However, they can be useful for investors researching the companies they want to invest in or when looking up definitions of financial terms they are unfamiliar with.   Story Continues MethodologyWe prompted ChatGPT to predict 15 stocks that could make investors wealthy in 10 years and cite the reasons behind its analysis. The stocks are ranked in this article in the same order as provided by ChatGPT. The platform said it based its rankings on several factors, including market dominance, revenue and earnings growth, innovation, and industry growth potential.For perspective, we have also shared the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock, based on Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 900 prominent hedge funds as of Q3 2024.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Trades Down, Here Is Why      Jabin Bastian   January 27, 2025 4 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%         Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Trades Down, Here Is Why   What Happened? Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 13% in the morning\u00a0session as stocks heavily tied to the AI market took a hit after Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek released a new large language model (DeepSeek-R1) that ranks competitively on key global benchmarks (coding competitions, math evaluations), uses less advanced semiconductor chips, costs significantly less to build (at $5.5 million - excluding non-compute costs), and has already achieved strong adoption after topping the iPhone App Store for AI apps.  Notably, the company has also open-sourced this model, a move that may make it harder for rivals to justify huge upfront expenditures on hardware, software, and expertise to develop similar systems. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella praised DeepSeek's efforts, calling the new model \"super impressive\" for its open-source design, efficient inference-time computing, and high compute efficiency. \"We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously,\" he added. Nadella's comments suggest that upstarts like DeepSeek could reshape the competitive landscape of AI. DeepSeek's announcement disrupts long-held assumptions in key ways: 1.) It undercuts the narrative that bigger budgets and access to top-tier chips are the only ways forward for AI development. 2.) By using less advanced hardware, DeepSeek opens the door for innovators who face high chip costs or export restrictions, reaffirming they can still compete. 3.) The model's success questions the growth narrative of chipmakers like Nvidia\u2014whose soaring valuations depend on the demand for cutting-edge, high-performance hardware.  Overall, DeepSeek's model demonstrates that AI innovation is no longer a race fueled solely by how much you spend, but rather by how resourceful you can be with what you have. The shares closed the day at $118.51, down 16.9% from previous close. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free. What The Market Is Telling Us Nvidia\u2019s shares are very volatile and have had 24 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for Nvidia and indicate this news significantly impacted the market\u2019s perception of the business. The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 11 months ago when the stock gained 15.5% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results with a meaningful revenue beat, strong gross margin improvement, and EPS outperformance vs. Wall Street's estimates. Notably, revenue grew 265% year-on-year and 22% sequentially. The strong top line performance was mostly driven by the data center segment, which was up 409% year-over-year and 27% sequentially as demand for Nvidia processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs (large language models), and other AI workloads continued to accelerate. Notably, the company estimated that roughly 40% of Data Center revenue was driven by AI-related applications. Guidance for the next quarter was also good, with revenue, gross margin, and implied operating profit coming in ahead of expectations. The company noted that growth in the data center and professional visualization segments is expected to more than offset the anticipated seasonal decline in gaming. Zooming out, we think this was a great quarter that shareholders will appreciate.   Story Continues Nvidia is down 13.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $119.97 per share, it is trading 19.7% below its 52-week high of $149.43 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $19,978.Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

Upgrade Now          Tigress Upgrades NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) to Strong Buy, Raises Target to $220 on AI Growth Potential      Affan Mir   January 29, 2025 4 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently compiled a list of the 12 AI News Investors Probably Missed.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. AI is evolving rapidly with recent breakthroughs making it more accessible and efficient than ever. Smaller, cost-effective models are emerging, which are challenging the idea that cutting-edge AI requires massive resources. DeepSeek seems to be a great example of that.  Moreover, Tech Crunch reported that barely a week after DeepSeek unveiled its R1 reasoning AI model, Hugging Face has launched Open-R1, a project to replicate and fully open-source DeepSeek\u2019s R1 reasoning AI model, addressing concerns about its lack of transparency. While R1 has gained attention for its efficiency and top performance, Hugging Face aims to demystify its training process to promote responsible use and innovation. Using its Science Cluster, the team plans to recreate R1 and make it a foundation for future open-source models, emphasizing the collaborative benefits of openness in AI. Rethinking AI Dominance in a Multi-Model World At CNBC\u2019s WorldWide Exchange, Zack Kass, an AI futurist and former Head of GTM at OpenAI, discussed the implications of a Chinese firm creating a GPT-4 equivalent model with remarkable efficiency. He highlighted how this reflects a shift from reliance on capital and scale toward innovation driven by necessity. Kass noted that while U.S. firms have benefited from abundant resources, China's limitations spurred creative breakthroughs, such as building a competitive model at a lower cost. He addressed skepticism about claims regarding the model's development cost and chip usage and suggested that it is reasonable to assume the information is largely accurate. Kass also commented on the evolving role of national security in AI, emphasizing the private sector's growing involvement. While a U.S. executive order aimed at restricting China's access to chips may not have achieved its intended impact, it may have unintentionally fueled innovation.  Kass argued that the research behind AI models is becoming increasingly accessible, which could lead to more discoveries worldwide. He dismissed concerns over U.S. dominance in AI, framing this development as an opportunity for cheaper, widely available technology. On open source, Kass noted that the future likely involves a diverse ecosystem of models, rather than dominance by a single proprietary approach. For this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.   Story Continues Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Driving AGI Advancements with Test Time Scaling and DeepSeek  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) develops AI platforms for data centers, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and cloud computing. On January 28, Tigress Financial's Ivan Feinseth upgraded Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to Strong Buy with a raised price target of $220, viewing the recent selloff as a significant buying opportunity. While DeepSeek's R1 AI model claims competitive features at lower costs, the firm highlighted unknown capabilities and security concerns. Tigress emphasized Nvidia\u2019s key role in AI and data center growth and considers it as a long-term beneficiary of ongoing investments in these areas.Overall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks investors probably missed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock for 2025: Nvidia vs. Microsoft      Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool   January 20, 2025 7 min read              In This Article:  NVDA       MSFT         Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are pioneers in artificial intelligence (AI) as both companies have played central roles in bringing this technology mainstream. While Microsoft-backed OpenAI kicked off the AI craze when it launched the highly popular ChatGPT in November 2022, the chatbot may not have seen the light of the day without Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), which were used for training the large language model (LLM) powering ChatGPT. As other major tech giants joined the AI race, the demand for Nvidia's chips went through the roof, and sent its revenue and bottom line soaring.  Meanwhile, the impact of AI on Microsoft's business has been gradual. The company is\u00a0spending billions to build its AI data center infrastructure -- benefiting Nvidia in the process -- and believes\u00a0its AI-focused investments will \"support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond.\" This explains why Nvidia stock has outperformed Microsoft's by a massive margin in the past couple of years.   NVDA Chart   NVDA data by YCharts. But will Nvidia continue to outperform Microsoft in 2025? Let's find out. Microsoft's AI-driven growth should gain momentum, while Nvidia faces challenges As already mentioned, Microsoft is benefiting gradually from AI. The company's revenue in fiscal year 2024 (that ended June 30) was up 16% from the previous year to $245 billion. Its adjusted earnings increased 20% year over year to $11.80 per share. The company's estimated revenue growth rate of 14% for fiscal 2025 to $278.6 billion isn't all that great, while its earnings are expected to increase by 10.5% to $13.04 per share. The forecasts for fiscal 2026, which will begin in July 2025, don't point toward a major improvement either. Consensus estimates are projecting a 14% increase in Microsoft's revenue in the next fiscal year, along with a 15% jump in earnings.   MSFT Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year Chart   MSFT Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YCharts. Nvidia, on the other hand, is expected to finish the current fiscal year (ending January 2025) with outstanding revenue growth of 112% to $129 billion, followed by a 52% increase in the next fiscal year to $196 billion. Nvidia's bottom line is also expected to jump an impressive 128% in the ongoing fiscal year followed by a 50% jump in the next one. All this indicates that Nvidia could continue to grow at a much faster pace than Microsoft over the course of the next year. What's more, the 12-month median price targets of both companies suggest that Nvidia stock could rise 33% while Microsoft is expected to deliver 20% gains. So, the odds seem in favor of Nvidia outperforming Microsoft in 2025, and that's not surprising considering that the chipmaker continues to witness outstanding demand for its AI data center GPUs.   Story Continues However, investors would do well to note that a few concerns could weigh on Nvidia stock. From potential restrictions that could be imposed on sales of its AI chips to foreign countries to an expensive valuation to the efforts being undertaken by major Nvidia customers to reduce their reliance on its chips, there are multiple reasons why Nvidia shares may remain under pressure.Moreover, the company's growth rate -- though still impressive -- is gradually slowing down. These are the reasons why Nvidia stock may lose its shine in 2025. Microsoft, on the other hand, is slowly but steadily stepping up its game in key AI-focused niches that could set it up for outstanding growth in the long run.The tech giant is already gaining share in the cloud computing market thanks to AI. Microsoft's Azure cloud and other services revenue increased by 33% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, with AI contributing 12 percentage points of that growth. More importantly, AI is helping Microsoft build a solid revenue pipeline by driving an increase in the number of big contracts that the company is signing for its Azure cloud solutions.This is evident from the 22% increase in Microsoft's commercial remaining performance obligations (RPO) in fiscal Q1 2025 to $259 billion. The faster growth in RPO as compared to the revenue bodes well for Microsoft, as this metric refers to the total value of a company's unfulfilled contracts. Microsoft expects to recognize 40% of its RPO as revenue in the next 12 months, which would be an increase of 17% on a year-over-year basis.As a result, the possibility of Microsoft growing at a faster pace than Wall Street's expectations in the coming year cannot be ruled out. A similar story could unfold at Nvidia, and the company could overcome the adversity that it is facing right now.Though the outgoing administration's potential curbs on Nvidia chip exports could post a threat to its remarkable revenue growth -- 56% of its revenue is from customers outside the U.S. -- investors should note the rules will be enforced 120 days from now, giving the incoming administration time to weigh in on the new rules.Looking at the positive side of things, Nvidia's focus on significantly enhancing the production capacity of its latest Blackwell AI processors to meet the red-hot demand from its customers, along with the massive increase in AI infrastructure spend by its U.S. customers, could be enough to help the company grow at an impressive pace once again in 2025. As such, the possibility of Nvidia stock retaining its mojo despite the potential challenges it faces cannot be ruled out.What should investors do?The uncertainties surrounding Nvidia may tempt investors to put their money into Microsoft stock to capitalize on the AI boom, especially considering the latter's valuation. After all, Microsoft is trading at a much cheaper 34 times earnings as compared to Nvidia's earnings multiple of 52.However, Nvidia's forward earnings multiple of 31 is in line with Microsoft's, and that's not surprising considering the outstanding growth that the company is expected to deliver. This makes Nvidia an attractive AI stock to buy right now, and investors can consider using the negative press surrounding it as a buying opportunity considering that its huge addressable market could be enough to help it overcome any potential regulatory challenges.But at the same time, even Microsoft looks like a top AI stock to buy for the long run considering the massive opportunities in cloud computing and workplace collaboration that could supercharge its growth.So, investors can consider buying any one of these two AI stocks right now depending on their risk appetite, and there is a good chance that they may not go wrong in 2025, as well as in the long run, as both Microsoft and Nvidia are sitting on lucrative end markets thanks to AI.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Upgrade Now          Analyst: Custom AI Chips Market Can \u2018Outgrow\u2019 NVIDIA (NVDA)      Fahad Saleem   January 28, 2025 4 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks Everyone is Talking About These Days. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks everyone is talking about these days. President Donald Trump\u2019s $500 billion investment plan to build AI infrastructure, Stargate, is making waves as analysts believe the project provides a new growth catalyst for major tech companies. Sasha Ostojic, Playground Global venture partner, said in a latest program on CNBC that the plan is just the beginning of AI \u201crenaissance\u201d in the country: \u201cStargate is just the beginning, I think, of this renaissance of AI technology in this country, even though it seems like we\u2019ve been in it for a few years. And, you know, it reminds me of the Apollo program from the 50s and 60s. In that case, it was a government-run program that created a bunch of technology, propelled the world forward, created a bunch of companies, and set us up for a lot of prosperity in the decades to follow.\u201d  Ostojic also talked about the Jensen Huang-led company and said its stock has been going \u201csideways\u201d and the market is waiting for the next big \u201ctrigger.\u201d He is bullish on the company and thinks the $500 billion plan with the company at its center could be the next growth catalyst investors were waiting for.

With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   Analyst: Custom AI Chips Market Can \u2018Outgrow\u2019 NVIDIA (NVDA)   NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) bull Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein Research managing director, was recently asked on CNBC what could be the biggest competitor to Jensen Huang\u2019s company. The analyst said custom AI chips space, or ASICs, can \u201coutgrow\u201d NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, this does not worry the investor for now. \u201cI actually do think the ultimate shake is probably NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs, and then for captive workloads at hyperscalers, it\u2019ll likely be ASICs\u2014they\u2019re all working on their own. I suspect ASICs, frankly, will probably outgrow in the sense that they\u2019re coming from a much smaller base. But you can do the math today. If I was, you know, it\u2019s a little bit of monkey math, but I bet ASICs relative to GPUs are probably low double digits\u201410, 11, 12% of the spend today. Could that number be 20% of a much bigger pie in 5 years? Yeah, I think it could.    Story Continues Manole Capital Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\u201cAs of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date.\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of AI stocks everyone is talking about these days. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia Stock Investors Just Got Good News From President Donald Trump and Wall Street      Trevor Jennewine   January 30, 2025 5 min read        28   In This Article:  NVDA         Last week, Chinese startup DeepSeek published a research paper in which it claimed to have trained a large language model rivaling the performance of leading U.S. models, while spending much less money than U.S. companies. Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) fell sharply on the news because of its dominant position in artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator chips.  However, Wall Street has some good news: Several analysts thinks the efficient training techniques DeepSeek employed may actually benefit Nvidia by reducing costs and accelerating AI adoption. For instance, software companies may be able to integrate AI features into applications without spending as much money to train models. But running the applications would still require powerful chips, which could create more demand for Nvidia GPUs. Importantly, several Wall Street analysts have updated or reiterated their forecasts since DeepSeek published its research paper last week, and they all see upside in Nvidia stock from its current price of $128 per share. Gil Luria at D.A. Davidson set his target price at $135 per share, implying a 5% upside. Joseph Moore at Morgan Stanley set his target price at $152 per share, implying a 18% upside. Atif Malik at Citigroup set his target price at $175 per share, implying a 36% upside. Stacy Rasgon at Bernstein set his target price at $175 per share, implying a 36% upside. C.J. Muse at Cantor Fitzgerald set his target price at $200 per share, implying a 56% upside.   In addition, Dan Ives at Wedbush Securities recently told CNBC the Nvidia sell-off that followed DeepSeek's announcement creates a \"golden buying opportunity.\" I completely agree with that assessment, especially because President Trump wants to cut corporate taxes and boost investments in AI infrastructure. President Trump wants to reduce the corporate tax rate President Trump during his first term signed the Tax Cut and Jobs Act in 2017. That legislation reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which led to a record-breaking increase in stock buybacks in 2018, according to Goldman Sachs. And companies have continued to repurchase shares more quickly than in previous years. Trump during his most recent presidential campaign proposed lowering the corporate tax rate even further for companies that manufacture goods domestically, this time to a 90-year low of 15%. In theory, that would boost corporate profit margins, potentially leading to even more aggressive stock buybacks. I think Nvidia would lean into that opportunity.  The chipmaker spent nearly $13 billion on stock buybacks in the third quarter of calendar year 2024, according to data from S&P Global. Only two S&P 500 companies allocated more money to share repurchases: Apple spent $25 billion and Alphabet spent $15 billion. Importantly, Nvidia's Board of Directors has already given authorization for another $46 billion in buybacks.   Story Continues Here is the big picture: If the Trump administration does cut the corporate tax rate, letting Nvidia lean into buybacks, its earnings per share, currently forecast to increase at 39% annually in the next two years, would probably grow faster than Wall Street anticipates. And upward revisions to earnings estimates tend to drive share price appreciation.  President Trump speaking with reporters. Image source: Official White House Photo by Shealah Craighead.  President Trump recently announced the Stargate ProjectPresident Trump last week announced the Stargate Project, which aims to maintain American leadership in artificial intelligence with up to $500 billion in private-sector investments in U.S. infrastructure during the next four years.Stargate is a joint venture involving OpenAI and SoftBank. The former assumes operational responsibility and the latter assumes financial responsibility. They plan to build 20 U.S. data centers, each a half-million square feet and optimized for AI. The first data center is already under construction in Texas, and other potential sites are being evaluated.Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are the industry standard in accelerating AI tasks, so the company is likely to provide all the necessary GPUs. Indeed, an OpenAI press release states: \"As part of Stargate, Oracle, Nvidia, and OpenAI will closely collaborate to build and operate this computing system.\"Details are still lacking, but Ben Reitzes at Melius Research estimates Nvidia could collect over $100 billion in Stargate spending. That theoretical revenue has not been factored into Wall Street's estimates, meaning the Stargate Project is yet another reason Nvidia's earnings may grow faster than anticipated in the years ahead.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Usman Kabir   January 22, 2025 4 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of Billionaire Steve Cohen\u2019s Top 15 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other Billionaire Steve Cohen\u2019s top stock picks. Steve Cohen is one of the most prominent and successful hedge fund managers in the world, known for his extraordinary trading acumen and ability to generate consistent returns. As the founder of\u00a0Point72 Asset Management, Cohen has built a reputation as a pioneer in the hedge fund industry. He was born in 1956 into a middle-class family. His father worked in the garment industry, while his mother was a piano teacher. Cohen showed an interest in finance early on, even dabbling in poker, which honed his skills in risk-taking and probability analysis. He graduated from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1978 with a degree in economics. Shortly after, he began his career on Wall Street as a junior trader at Gruntal & Co, where he quickly gained recognition for his ability to generate profits through equities trading.

In 1992, Cohen founded SAC Capital Advisors with $25 million, including $10 million of his own savings. The hedge fund, named after his initials, focused on long/short equity strategies and became known for its aggressive trading style. Over the years, SAC Capital emerged as one of the most successful hedge funds in history, consistently delivering double-digit returns. At its peak, SAC Capital managed over $16 billion in assets. Cohen reportedly generated annualized returns of approximately 30% for his investors, an extraordinary achievement in the hedge fund industry. Cohen\u2019s trading style emphasized speed, precision, and a deep understanding of market dynamics. In 2014, Cohen launched Point72 Asset Management, a firm focused on managing his personal fortune and eventually reopening to external investors. Point72 has since grown into a major player in the hedge fund industry. As of the third quarter of 2024, Point72 manages over $39 billion in 13F securities. The firm employs over 1,800 people and operates across multiple global offices. Point72 combines Cohen\u2019s expertise in active trading with investments in technology, data analysis, and artificial intelligence, positioning itself at the forefront of modern finance.

These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Among Billionaire Steve Cohen\u2019s Top Stock Picks?  Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset ManagementNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193\u00a0Point72 Asset Management\u2019s Stake: $448 million\u00a0\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. As per the report of the third quarter of 2024, GAAP earnings per diluted share was $4.93, up 33% from the previous quarter and up 765% from a year ago, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $5.16, up 28% from the previous quarter and up 486% from a year ago. These higher earnings per share (EPS) reflect the company\u2019s improved profitability per share, directly benefiting shareholders and potentially leading to higher dividends or share buybacks in the future. Secondly, NVIDIA released NIM microservices to safeguard applications for agentic AI \u2013 NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails includes new NVIDIA NIM microservices to enhance accuracy, security and control for enterprises building AI across industries. This initiative expands the market share of the company and reinforces its reputation as an innovator in the AI industry. Moreover, the company also plans to launch its first consumer CPU-GPU platform in 2025, integrating its AI and graphics expertise to offer a comprehensive computing solution. This initiative may hold potential for investors as it aims to challenge existing market leaders by providing high-performance alternatives for consumer PCs.Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of Billionaire Steve Cohen\u2019s top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Upgrade Now          Why Nvidia Stock Is Taking a Hit Today?      Nauman khan   January 30, 2025 1 min read        38   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       Thursday morning, Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) shares plunged nearly 2.5% after the start of trading on concerns in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): A Leading Investment in AI Supercomputing, Telecom Innovation, and Exceptional Financial Growth      Usman Kabir   January 19, 2025 7 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%     BLK   -0.25%    ^GSPC   +0.38%      We recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. In the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.  The investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025. The BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.

Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.Read more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.For this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) The Stock That Will Go to the Moon According to Reddit?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions.\u00a0The following factors make NVIDIA a prime avenue for investment. Firstly, as per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.78, up 16% from the previous quarter and up 111% from a year ago, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.81, up 19% from the previous quarter and up 103% from a year ago. Secondly, the company launched Denmark\u2019s largest sovereign AI supercomputer, an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD driven by 1,528 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs and interconnected using NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking. Moreover, the company introduced the NVIDIA AI Aerial platform for telecommunications providers and began working with T-Mobile, Ericsson and Nokia to accelerate the commercialization of AI-RAN, which may hold great potential for investment. Lastly, the company has announced that SoftBank is building Japan\u2019s most powerful AI supercomputer with the NVIDIA Blackwell platform and has successfully piloted the world\u2019s first combined AI and 5G telecom network using NVIDIA AI Aerial.Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Upgrade Now          1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks Nvidia Stock Is Going to $175. Is It a Buy?        Howard Smith, The Motley Fool   January 21, 2025 3 min read           In This Article:  NVDA         Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock may have soared by about 170% in 2024, but shares of the leading artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductor maker haven't done much in the most recent three months. But one Wall Street analyst thinks investors should take advantage of that lull. Oppenheimer's Rick Schafer just made the company one of his top picks for 2025 in the semiconductor sector. His firm's price target of $175 per share would represent a 27% gain from recent levels. A $4 trillion company That price would put Nvidia into elite territory, with a market cap of about $4.25 trillion. But that would make sense, according to Schafer. That's because he believes revenue just from Nvidia's data center segment will reach $172 billion in 2025. That would be an increase of about 50% compared to calendar year 2024. In his recent note to investors shared by Barron's, Schafer wrote: \"Nvidia is the largest volume producer of AI accelerators and the cost/bit leader in AI training. NVDA dominates the AI infrastructure market with their full-stack hardware/software.\"  It's notable that Schafer mentioned software, too. Most investors consider Nvidia's dominance from its Hopper and Blackwell GPU (graphics processing unit) chips. But it also has software architecture meant for AI computer factories. Software solutions like those included in its DGX platform for enterprise AI and its CUDA platform for developers are used along with its GPU accelerators. Sales of those products will also be boosted as tech companies and others increase capital expenditure for data centers and the AI architecture built into them. While competition is coming along, demand for its latest Blackwell architecture appears to be very strong. And with its next-generation Rubin coming in 2026, there looks to be a long runway for growth. The recent lull in Nvidia stock does look to be a good opportunity to buy shares before they go even higher.

Upgrade Now          Jim Cramer Says \u2018More Out Of China Means Less For NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)\u2019      Ramish Cheema   February 1, 2025 5 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 10 Stocks & Says He's In Waiting For AI GPU Spending Clarity.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. In his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on whether the low AI development costs demonstrated by China's DeepSeek AI models would upend investor expectations of AI spending. Ever since the AI wave kicked off in November 2022, businesses have committed and spent hundreds of billions of dollars to procure AI GPUs and develop data centers to host them. The high spending requirements also led President Trump to announce a massive $500 billion Stargate project earlier this month.  However, data center stocks crashed on Monday and wiped out a trillion dollars of value as investors worried whether low AI development costs would mean that this spending would not materialize. Cramer is divided about the overall sentiment when it comes to AI spending after the DeepSeek selloff. He commented that the lower costs are \"the theme of the moment because some people saw it coming.\" Cramer added \"and yet they still ordered. That would be the Zuckerberg case, maybe the Musk piece.\" On the other hand, he outlined that others \"just say oh my, what am I in, I'm gonna go buy a double short NVIDIA.\" Finally, the CNBC host also shared a third category of people \"who think that it's [Wall Street's favorite AI GPU stock] a hand cream.\" While investors fretted about lower AI costs translating into weaker demand for items such as GPUs, another narrative questioned whether lower costs meant that AI development would open up to more firms and entities than the higher costs had previously permitted. Cramer admitted that this was possible, but added that it also meant that perhaps \"the monopoly rent that people feel that\" the premier GPU company \"was charging is gone.\" He added that he was in wait-and-watch mode when it came to AI spending.  Cramer noted several events that could signal to him that perhaps the narrative shift surrounding AI spending was permanent. One of his tests \"test would be, uh, is, Three Mile Island not going to be reopened? That would be one I need to hear.\" The second driver that might convince the CNBC TV show host of a paradigm shift for AI spending would be reports of \"any [GPU] order pullback. And I have not heard that yet.\" Cramer added \"But that's not, necessarily, what people are going to announce, 'listen, I've decided. . . If this thing only needs one-tenth of the power, one-tenth of the compute, well I'm going to cut my orders by nine-tenths.' I've not heard that yet, but this thing is. . . a steamroll.\"   Story Continues Our MethodologyTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 29th and mentioned in his Morning Take from his Investing Club morning meeting.For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Revolutionizing AI and High-Performance Computing  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193Cramer started his show once again by commenting on AI GPU giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The firm's shares have lost 12.6% this week after paring back some of their losses during the DeepSeek selloff. The tepid sentiment surrounding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is driven by investors' re-calibration of AI spending as they fear that lower costs demonstrated by China's DeepSeek might lead to significantly lower demand for the firm's GPUs. Here's what Cramer said about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA):On whether DeepSeek uncovers NVIDIA's liabilities \"Look I think that there's a perception that more is less. More chips, more people who know how to use them, more out of China means less for NVIDIA. NVIDIA's been quiet. But they may have advised people who look at CES, uh, post-interview. Not good enough. I think people have decided that we had a rebound. But the reality is that the order will decline. By the way therefore the power will decline. Because people are figuring out how to use more with less. And David, that's the big negative thesis. Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): AI Revenue Soars with Data Center Growth      Usman Kabir   January 31, 2025 8 min read        26   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%     ^GSPC   +0.38%      We recently published a list of Coatue\u2019s 35 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks. Artificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.  Investment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors. Companies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.  Read more about these developments by accessing\u00a010 Best AI Data Center Stocks\u00a0and\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Philippe Laffont of\u00a0Coatue Management\u00a0argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.   Story Continues Since the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.The growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.Read more about these developments by accessing\u00a030\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and\u00a0Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.Some investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.AI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.Some investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.As inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): AI Revenue Soars with Data Center Growth  NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. In the report for the fourth quarter of 2024, GAAP earnings per diluted share was $4.93, showing an increase of 33% from the previous quarter and up 765% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $5.16, showing an increase of 28% from the previous quarter and up 486% from a year ago. These metrics indicate strong financial performance driven by higher revenues and improved margins, positioning the company for continued success. Also, record quarterly data center revenue was $18.4 billion, showing an increase of 27% from the third quarter, indicating heightened demand for data center products or services, possibly driven by trends like cloud computing expansion. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has also launched AI foundation Models for RTX AI PCs. These models offered as NVIDIA NIM microservices, are accelerated by new GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, which feature up to 3,352 trillion operations per second of AI performance and 32GB of VRAM.Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Most Promising AI Stock According to Wall Street Analysts?      Bob Karr   January 25, 2025 6 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of 12 Most Promising AI Stocks According to Wall Street Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other most promising AI stocks according to Wall Street analysts. Artificial intelligence\u00a0(AI) continues to accelerate rapidly, moving from emerging technologies to influencing how businesses carry out operations. As per SAP, the changes occurring in 2025 revolve around autonomous AI agents, specialized AI models, user interface design, and enterprise adoption patterns. On 13th\u00a0January, an AI behemoth highlighted that the first Trump Administration focused on America\u2019s strength and success in AI, boosting an environment where the broader US industry can compete.  Therefore, mainstream AI is now a critical part of every new application, which helps fuel economic growth, promote US interests, and make sure that America can sustain its leadership in cutting-edge technology. On a related note, Trump announced billions of dollars in private sector investment focused on building AI infrastructure in the country. Trump Announces $500 Billion Investment for AI Infrastructure US President Donald Trump announced a private sector investment of up to $500 billion focused on financing infrastructure for AI, targeting to outperform rival nations in the business-critical technology. Mr. President went on to add that ChatGPT\u2019s creator OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle are discussing a JV called Stargate, which is expected to build data centers and create over 100,000 jobs in the US. Notably, these companies, together with several other equity backers of Stargate, decided to commit $100 billion for immediate deployment. The remaining investment is expected to take place over the upcoming 4 years.  As per Trump, this is the largest AI infrastructure project in history. Also, Stargate is expected to build the physical and virtual infrastructure which will focus on powering the next generation of AI, including data centers around the US.

AI Rally to Continue in 2025, Says UBS As per UBS, the AI rally has aided in driving 2 straight years of healthy returns for the NASDAQ Composite, which also includes a 28% rally last year. The Mag 7 group of technology stocks drove more than half of the S&P 500\u2019s gains in 2024. In the previous year, continued upward revisions in AI capex from the Big 4 tech giants supported keeping the AI rally on track. UBS expects the upward revisions to continue over the near term.   Story Continues Even though AI revenues might again lag behind capex in 2025, UBS expects that AI monetization will improve sharply in 2025. The AI adoption continues to accelerate across industries and is well-placed to broaden in 2025. Also, the arrival of more clearly useful AI agents is expected to further support return on investment (ROI).Our MethodologyTo list the 12 Most Promising AI Stocks According to Wall Street Analysts, we conducted extensive research and scanned through several online rankings. After getting an initial list of 15-18 stocks, we shortlisted the ones in which analysts saw upside potential. Finally, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of January 21, 2025. We also mentioned hedge fund sentiments around each stock, as of Q3 2024.At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Most Promising AI Stock According to Wall Street Analysts?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Average Upside Potential: ~20.2%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading player in the Al industry as its technology plays a key role in powering Al applications, primarily deep learning and machine learning. The company\u2019s stock was again in the news after Trump\u2019s announcement to invest significantly in Al infrastructure. Analysts at UBS expect that results for the current quarter and guidance for the fiscal first quarter will be healthy. Furthermore, the analysts also see revenue streams for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) from OEMs as they build inventory. Blackwell, which was launched last year, is expected to act as a critical revenue driver for the company over the upcoming years.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has made numerous strides in the Al and semiconductor sectors. It launched new generative Al models and blueprints in a bid to enhance its Omniverse platform, targeted at advancing robotics, AVs, and vision Al applications. Also, it announced a partnership with Arbe Robotics, focused on enhancing automotive free space mapping and Al-driven capabilities. The company will integrate Arbe\u2019s ultra-high-definition radar technology with its in-vehicle computing platform.Notably, JPMorgan Chase & Co. upped its price objective on shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) from $155.00 to $170.00, giving an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating on 21st\u00a0November. Infuse Asset Management, an investment management company, released its Q4 2024 investor letter.\u00a0Here\u00a0is what the fund said:\u201cWe do still own some\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) as the forward multiple isn\u2019t egregious and it powers over 90% of AI workloads. This company is only becoming increasingly important though the hyperscalers are actively trying to save money through their own ASIC programs. The moat CUDA provides has been underestimated time and time again. While I don\u2019t think Nvidia has quite the upside as some of the other companies in the portfolio, it has a product that the best companies in the world literally can\u2019t get enough of.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 10th on our list of most promising AI stocks according to Wall Street analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          AI Stocks Defy DeepSeek Panic: NVDA & 2 Other Top Picks         Nilanjan Banerjee   January 29, 2025 4 min read        5   In This Article:  NVDA       AVGO         Technology and artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have staged a powerful rally, boldly defying the DeepSeek hysteria. This remarkable rebound comes after DeepSeek AI, a low-cost Chinese AI startup from Hangzhou, sent shockwaves through U.S. tech stocks and global markets, triggering widespread uncertainty. Does this suggest that Wall Street views the frenzy as a golden opportunity to buy fundamentally strong technology stocks NVIDIA NVDA, Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Twilio Inc. TWLO? DeepSeek Frenzy & its Initial Market Impact Recently, DeepSeek became the most downloaded free app on Apple\u2019s AAPL U.S. store. This caused a big shake-up in the stock market. Investors panicked, thinking DeepSeek\u2019s AI technology could compete with OpenAI (creator of ChatGPT) while using less computing power. This scared people because companies like NVIDIA make expensive chips used for AI, and if a competitor can do the same with cheaper tech, it could hurt NVDA\u2019s business. Because of this fear, technology and AI-related stocks like NVIDIA, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google) and others significantly declined on Monday. The Nasdaq Composite index (which includes many technology stocks) also fell more than 3%. Now\u2019s the Chance to Buy Big While DeepSeek claims to have developed a cost-efficient AI model, its performance doesn\u2019t match that of AI systems from established U.S. companies like OpenAI and Alphabet. DeepSeek's AI struggles with basic tasks and delivers inconsistent results when handling complex data, making it less accurate and reliable than the cutting-edge models developed by leading tech firms. Moreover, creating a truly competitive AI system isn\u2019t just about using cheaper chips. It requires massive infrastructure, including data centers, high-performance servers and specialized technologies like cooling systems and software optimizations. Additionally, significant research and development investments are necessary to refine and scale AI capabilities. Without these critical components, an AI model may appear impressive on the surface but lack the depth and robustness needed for widespread adoption.  Given these challenges, some Wall Street analysts view the recent market dip as a prime buying opportunity. They argue that despite DeepSeek\u2019s advancements, U.S. companies are unlikely to shift toward Chinese AI infrastructure. Instead, major tech players will continue to rely on high-performance chips from industry leaders like NVIDIA and AMD to power their AI projects. Furthermore, AI investment remains on an upward trajectory, further reinforcing confidence in the sector. The U.S. government is committed to a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative, known as Project Stargate, underscoring the ongoing demand for advanced AI technologies. With these factors in mind, analysts believe that the current pullback in Technology and AI stocks presents a strategic entry point for long-term investors.   Story Continues Think Long Term & Bet on 3 Tech Stocks: NVDA, AVGO, TWLOAfter a decline of more than 3% on Monday, the Nasdaq Composite bounced back 2% yesterday, showcasing the resilience of AI and technology stocks amid the DeepSeek hysteria. This highlights the importance for investors to focus on long-term gains and tune out short-term market fluctuations. Three tech stocks that investors should consider continuously adding to their portfolios are:NVIDIAThe long-term prospects of NVIDIA, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), remain strong as it is integral to the AI revolution, providing critical infrastructure for AI model training and inference. The company\u2019s graphic processing units (GPUs) and accompanying software ecosystems dominate this space, rapidly ramping up AI-specific workloads and cloud infrastructure demand.The nearly 9% surge in stock price during the last trading session, followed by a 17% drop on Monday, indicates that Wall Street is optimistic about the company's long-term potential.BroadcomBroadcom is a key player in the semiconductor space, which continues to see high demand, especially with the ongoing growth of AI, cloud computing and 5G technologies. As these technologies advance, Broadcom\u2019s diverse product portfolio, including networking chips, storage solutions and wireless communication components, positions the company for sustained growth.The nearly 3% jump in stock price during the last trading session, coupled with a 17.4% decline on Monday, suggests that Wall Street remains optimistic about the #2 Ranked company's long-term prospects.TwilioTwilio, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is increasingly integrating AI-driven capabilities into its platform, which enhances its offerings. This positions it well for future growth as more businesses adopt AI technologies for automation, customer support and personalized communication. You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The impressive nearly 6% rise in stock price during the last trading session, highlights Wall Street\u2019s unwavering confidence in the company\u2019s resilient growth potential and long-term success.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Upgrade Now          Investors Heavily Search NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Here is What You Need to Know         Zacks Equity Research   January 21, 2025 5 min read              In This Article:  NVDA         Nvidia (NVDA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term. Over the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned -1.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has gained 2.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Revisions to Earnings Estimates Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.  For the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.84 per share, indicating a change of +61.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.94 points to a change of +126.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.21 indicates a change of +43.1% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.1%. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).   Story Continues The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $37.72 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +70.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $129.02 billion and $191.84 billion estimates indicate +111.8% and +48.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNvidia reported revenues of $35.08 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +93.6%. EPS of $0.81 for the same period compares with $0.40 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.33 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.27%. The EPS surprise was +8%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Upgrade Now          Jim Cramer on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): \u2018When You Are As Visible With NVIDIA As I Am, You\u2019re Like A Magnet\u2019      Ramish Cheema   January 26, 2025 6 min read        3   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 18 Stocks & President Trump's $500 Billion AI Plan.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. In his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it's different from the previous one. Cramer shared, \"If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.\" According to him, \"These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation\" to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.  Commenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, \"Now, by the way, there's a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?\" This means wondering where he is \"in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.\" Cramer believes that Musk \"doesn't seem to have them\" and added, \"If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don't want a seat at the table, I want a table.\" The CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to \"forget healthcare.\" He believes \"Healthcare's gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it's not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there's a call center that's better.\" Cramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, \"Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there's a lot more room.\" Cramer believes \"there's a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that's coming on.\" He doesn't like small-cap stocks either. \"And I'm not a small cap aficionado,\" Cramer commented. He believes, \"That stuff doesn't work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.\" The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes \"companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn't think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off. The semis that haven't done anything lately.\"   Story Continues As for President Trump, Cramer believes that he needs to look at insurance costs that affect a large number of Americans. According to him:\"The President has to take a look at these issues. Because this is where the, the copay, your insurance, your group insurance, your property, casualty insurance. That's where the President's going to put it. If he wants to put a stake in the inflation. He goes after the pharmacy benefits managers.\" Our MethodologyTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 22nd.For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193Over the past two years, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has shaped into one of the most dominating technology companies in the world. Its newfound glory is entirely due to its GPUs, which form the backbone of global AI computing. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s latest AI GPUs, the Blackwell lineup, have dominated its narrative recently. Investors have differed over whether the firm can ship them regularly and sufficiently to maintain market dominance. Cramer believes that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is ushering in a new industrial revolution. Here are his latest remarks:\"Well had there been a doubt in people's minds about NVIDIA, which is at the same price it was in June. That NVIDIA may not have the orders it needs. Well that was ended yesterday. Because obviously this team up would want everything it could. I also think that the whole sovereign nation kerfuffle that Biden put in at the last minute with 18 friends who can get NVIDIA. That's going to be put aside. I don't think that there is any sense that there is any water being held by that. By the way, NVIDIA maybe crucial in something that we haven't thought of. The President wants a smaller trade deficit with China. One way to do it is to have them have all the NVIDIA chips they want, provided they're not used militarily. Now, you could argue how could that ever be. I think this President is trying to get everybody's trade deficit to go to a surplus for us. And NVIDIA is the crucial way to do it. Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Stock to Buy for High Returns in 2025?      Talha Qureshi   January 27, 2025 5 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy for High Returns in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025. Market Outlook 2025 On December 17, 2024, J.P. Morgan released its market outlook 2025. The report expects the global economy to continue growing at a robust rate, however a sharp slowdown in China is expected. Regarding the equity market, the firm anticipates depressing trends across stocks, sectors, and themes. Analysts at the firm estimate the S&P 500 to be around 6,500 in 2025 with earnings per share of $270. The head of Global Market Research, Hussain Malik noted that the policies of the United States regarding trade, immigration, and regulatory policy will play a critical role in defining the year\u2019s outcome for the country and globally.  The report further elaborated on its anticipation of a depressed stock market by highlighting de-coupling central bank policies, uneven progress in disinflation, and ongoing technological innovation. Moreover, increased geopolitical tensions are also likely to add unusual complexity to the global stock market. Despite all this, the firm has bright expectations for the United States. It believes that the country will remain a key driver of growth due to factors such as an expanding business cycle, a robust labor market, increased capital spending related to AI, and active capital markets. On the other hand, Europe is expected to grapple with structural challenges, while emerging markets may face headwinds from persistent high interest rates, a strong US dollar, and trade policy issues. Lakos-Bujas, head of Global Markets Strategy at J.P. Morgan warned that a key risk to their base case involves disinflation stalling or reversing, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to consider interest rate hikes later in 2025 or early 2026. Such developments would necessitate a reassessment of their market outlook. Our Methodology To curate the list of the 10 best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s third-quarter hedge funds database. We checked the 25 most widely held stocks by hedge funds for 10-year growth rates from Seeking Alpha and ranked these stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).   Story Continues   Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Stock to Buy for High Returns in 2025?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)10-Year Revenue Growth: 37.84%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the key companies leading the development of AI with its semiconductors and highly powered AI GPUs. Its latest Blackwell GPU series, which is the successor to the H100 and H200 GPUs, is said to be the world\u2019s most powerful chip for AI workloads.On January 2, BofA maintained a Buy rating on NVDA, naming the stock to be one of their top picks for 2025. Vivek Arya, who is an analyst at BofA kept his price target of $190 stating that he believes the company\u2019s project valuations can grow up to $4 billion in the near future. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its fiscal fourth quarter of 2024 grew its revenue by 265% year-over-year to $22.1 billion, which easily surpassed the $20 billion outlook.Analysts expect that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) can be amongst the top gainers in 2025, particularly due to the recent announcement of a $500 billion AI project by newly inaugurated President Donald Trump. The President along with Oracle, SoftBank, and OpenAI has announced this project to assure the United States take leadership in this technology. This could be a potential opportunity for the company as OpenAI in its statements has named NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) to be one of the main technology partners for the project. It ranks 4th on our list of best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025.Infuse Asset Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q4 2024 investor letter:\u201cWe do still own some\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) as the forward multiple isn\u2019t egregious and it powers over 90% of AI workloads. This company is only becoming increasingly important though the hyperscalers are actively trying to save money through their own ASIC programs. The moat CUDA provides has been underestimated time and time again. While I don\u2019t think Nvidia has quite the upside as some of the other companies in the portfolio, it has a product that the best companies in the world literally can\u2019t get enough of.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Cheap AI Stock to Buy in 2025?      Ali Hassan   January 29, 2025 4 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of 12 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other cheap AI stocks to buy in 2025. Artificial Intelligence (AI) was a buzzword around Wall Street for most of 2024. AI has shown immense promise but comes with significant risks. Big AI players are dominating the broader market, but there will be opportunities for other companies to explore as the AI market continues to expand. For instance, the new administration is keen on technological advancement, and recently, President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion AI initiative, a joint venture known as Stargate between OpenAI, Softbank, and Oracle.  However, DeepSeek\u2019s introduction shocked the U.S. companies after it released a new AI model, a much better alternative to GPT-4. DeepSeek claims to have designed the AI model in just two months and at around under $6 million using Nvidia\u2019s less-advanced H800 chips, as reported by Reuters on January 27. Since the news broke out, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have plunged over 16%, wiping away $600 billion in market capitalization, the biggest one-day loss in U.S. history. Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead, speaking to Market Domination, shared his views on DeepSeek. Moorhead was impressed by the efficiency of DeepSeek\u2019s AI. He pointed out that the Chinese have used different techniques compared to American developers, where they were able to parse or train maybe 5% of the data, which is a 95% reduction. However, Moorhead also addressed the U.S. market drop as an \u201coverreaction.\u201d\u00a0\u201cI think the market overall should be going crazy because [this is the] uplift of what we were looking for [from AI],\u201d\u00a0said Moorhead. He added that the investors\u2019 focus should be on the progress in inference. It might be a good time to invest in AI stocks, especially cheap AI stocks during the market\u2019s overreaction. Our Methodology To determine the list of cheap AI stocks, we went through various news articles and stock analyses. We shortlisted the AI stocks with the minimum analyst upside of 30%, as of January 27. Cheap, in the context of this article, means stocks that Wall Street analysts believe are undervalued and will surge to higher share prices. We have ranked the cheap AI stocks to buy based on their popularity among hedge funds, as of Q3 2024, in ascending order. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).   Story Continues   Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Cheap AI Stock to Buy in 2025?  NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Analyst Upside (as of January 27): 47.78%No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions offering platforms and chips for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services. Chinese AI startup, DeepSeek, sent shockwaves to the U.S. stock market after revealing its AI tool that is potentially more efficient than the GPT-4-level model, designed at a fraction of the cost of Open AI\u2019s model. NVDA shares plunged over 16% following the announcement of DeepSeek\u2019s AI model on January 27. Is it game over for NVDA?Analysts see this as an opportunity to buy NVDA shares as they believe the market has overreacted to the Chinese AI model. Bofa analysts believe this worry is overstated. Whereas, Wedbush analyst, Dan Ives called it a buying opportunity for American tech stocks. He wrote in a post on X:\u201cDeepSeek is a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases\u2026launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.\u00a0 It\u2019s about AGI for Big Tech and DeepSeek\u2019s noise. Also, no US tech using this tech. Buying oppy.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of cheap AI stocks to buy in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) High Growth Semiconductor Stock That Is Profitable?      Bob Karr   January 23, 2025 5 min read        4   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of 10 High Growth Semiconductor Stocks That Are Profitable Heading into 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other high growth semiconductor stocks that are profitable. Semiconductors have led industrial advancements and aided key applications such as personal computing, data centers, and cloud computing. As per PwC, Memory ICs were the fastest-growing semiconductor category over the previous 2 decades, with DRAM and HBM standing out.\u00a0The broader DRAM market is supported by cost and scale, while HBM, because of its advanced technological requirements, reflects a high-barrier, closed-loop ecosystem. Global Semiconductor Sales Rose 20.7% YoY in November 2024 The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) announced that global semiconductor sales touched $57.8 billion during November 2024 month, demonstrating 20.7% growth as compared to November 2023 total of $47.9 billion and 1.6% growth as compared to the October 2024 total of $56.9 billion. As per the report published by SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International), the semiconductor industry is expected to begin 18 new fab construction projects\u00a0in 2025. These new projects will include three 200mm and fifteen 300mm facilities. Notably, the majority will begin operations from 2026 \u2013 2027.  In 2025, the Americas and Japan will be the leading regions with 4 projects each. Next, China and Europe & Middle East regions have 3 planned construction projects. Finally, Taiwan has 2 planned projects, with Korea and Southeast Asia having 1 project each for this year. As per SEMI\u2019s President and CEO, investments have been fueling leading-edge and mainstream technologies to cater to dynamic global demands. Gen-AI and high-performance computing continue to fuel advancements in the leading-edge logic and memory segments. However, mainstream nodes have supported crucial automotive, IoT, and power electronics applications.

Semiconductor Capacity to Ramp Up SEMI projects semiconductor capacity to accelerate further, with a 6.6% yearly growth rate to a total of 33.6 million wafers per month (wpm)\u00a0for 2025. This expansion is expected to primarily stem from leading-edge logic technologies in high-performance computing (HPC) applications and higher penetration of generative AI in edge devices. Overall, the broader semiconductor industry continues to focus on building advanced computing capabilities, and responding to the increased computational demands of LLMs.   Story Continues Moving forward, foundry suppliers are expected to be the leaders in purchases of semiconductor equipment. The Foundry segment can increase capacity by 10.9% YoY, increasing from 11.3 million wpm in 2024 to 12.6 million wpm in 2025.Our MethodologyTo list the 10 High Growth Semiconductor Stocks That Are Profitable Heading into 2025, we conducted extensive research and scanned through several online rankings to shortlist companies having ~10% revenue growth over the previous 5 years and TTM net income of at least $400 million.

Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) The Stock That Will Go to the Moon According to Reddit?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)5-year Sales Growth: ~62.43%TTM net income: $63,074 MillionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is a renowned player in the semiconductor business and is known for innovative GPUs and expanding portfolio of products for AI, gaming, and data centers. As per Barclays analyst Tom O\u2019Malley, NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) GPU sales touched ~$100 billion in calendar 2024 and are projected to grow to ~$160 billion in calendar 2025. The analyst further added that custom silicon has just started to become more significant and is expected to grow at a faster compounded rate over the upcoming 3 years (at 55%).Considering the ongoing focus on the AI compute end-market, the analyst remains optimistic about NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s growth prospects. For calendar 2025, the analyst anticipates the company to grow its data-center compute business by ~60% YoY. Therefore, Tom O\u2019Malley reiterated\u00a0an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating and upped his price target to $175 from $160 on the company\u2019s shares.Furthermore, NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s strong position in the AI computing market offers a strong foundation for continued growth. Its comprehensive technology stack, which includes hardware and software solutions, provides a significant advantage in catering to the growing demand for AI infrastructure. Infuse Asset Management, an investment management company, released its Q4 2024 investor letter.\u00a0Here\u00a0is what the fund said:\u201cWe do still own some\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) as the forward multiple isn\u2019t egregious and it powers over 90% of AI workloads. This company is only becoming increasingly important though the hyperscalers are actively trying to save money through their own ASIC programs. The moat CUDA provides has been underestimated time and time again. While I don\u2019t think Nvidia has quite the upside as some of the other companies in the portfolio, it has a product that the best companies in the world literally can\u2019t get enough of.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of high growth semiconductor stocks that are profitable heading into 2025.\u00a0While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Barclays Raises NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Price Target to $175, Highlights AI Leadership in 2025 Semiconductor Outlook      Affan Mir   January 21, 2025 4 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News You Probably Missed.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. AI Boosts Data Center Market to New Heights According to Synergy Research Group, data center M&A activity set a new record in 2024, with deals totaling $57 billion, compared to the previous high of $52 billion in 2022. While 2023 saw a sharp decline to $26 billion, the rebound in 2024 included two major equity investments in Vantage Data Centers worth $9.2 billion combined. Moreover, equity investments in data center solutions providers, EdgeConneX and DataBank contributed to the rise. Private equity played a dominant role, accounting for 80-90% of deal values since 2021. With $29 billion in pending deals and a $15 billion future pipeline, the trend is expected to continue in 2025, fueled by increasing demand for cloud services, digital platforms, and generative AI.  Moreover, the firm believes that global spending on data center hardware and software in 2024 probably rose by 34%, reaching a record $282 billion. Public cloud infrastructure spending, up 48%, now makes up 55% of the market, due to the increasing demand for GPUs to support generative AI workloads. Enterprise spending also saw a significant 21% increase after years of marginal growth. According to Synergy, public cloud spending is expected to grow further and could reach 65% of the market within five years.

U.S. Boosts AI Infrastructure with New Executive Order As the global AI infrastructure landscape is rapidly evolving, the U.S. is positioning itself at the forefront. On January 14, former President Joe Biden signed an executive order to boost U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence by fast-tracking the development of domestic AI infrastructure. The order directed the Department of Defense and Department of Energy to lease federal sites for gigawatt-scale AI data centers powered by clean energy, with developers covering all costs. Requirements include using U.S.-manufactured semiconductors, adhering to labor standards, and ensuring AI safety and national security. Agencies will streamline permits, upgrade energy transmission, and support global AI infrastructure expansion while promoting clean energy technologies. For this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.   Story Continues Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) The Stock That Will Go to the Moon According to Reddit?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving vehicles, robotics, and cloud services.Barclays analyst Tom O\u2019Malley raised Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) price target to $175 from $160, maintaining an Overweight rating as part of its 2025 outlook for the semiconductor sector. The firm expects 2025 to continue to be shaped by the divide between companies benefiting from AI and those that are not. Barclays remains selective in its AI stock picks, favoring those with proprietary serializer/deserializer technology, while being less optimistic about cyclical semiconductors, analog, PC, and handset stocks, noting that recoveries in these areas may take longer to materialize.Overall NVDA ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks that investors probably missed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Will NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Dominate the AI Market with DeepSeek\u2019s Breakthroughs?      Affan Mir   January 29, 2025 4 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of 10 AI News You Should Take a Look At. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news you should take a look at. DeepSeek has gained attention for creating a high-performing model, R1, at a fraction of the typical cost. Its efficient use of resources and open-source approach has prompted discussions on the traditional reliance on expensive AI chips. Despite concerns about reduced demand for high-end semiconductors, experts argue that the growing need for compute power, driven by large-scale AI models, continues to fuel demand for advanced AI infrastructure. Growing AI Competition Promises Exciting Advancements and Opportunities As AI continues to evolve, new advancements are pushing the boundaries of performance, cost-efficiency, and accessibility, creating a dynamic landscape for both established players and new competitors. Bernstein analyst Peter Weed highlighted DeepSeek\u2019s potential to drive AI adoption by offering cost-efficient inferencing, which could lead to increased demand. While some speculate on the impact on AI infrastructure vendors, the firm suggested that software vendors providing data infrastructure, identity management, observability, and communications may be the key beneficiaries. Lower AI model costs could accelerate enterprise adoption, moving projects from proof-of-concept to production faster, and benefit a range of software vendors that have previously lagged behind hyperscalers in growth. Weed noted: \u201cIf Deepseek puts pressure to further bring down model cost, it may not only increase the number of viable projects but also may accelerate the pace of new projects going into production. This would benefit all the software consumption infrastructure above the hyperscaler level.\u201d  Additionally, in a post on X, Sam Altman acknowledged DeepSeek\u2019s R1 model as impressive, especially for its cost, but emphasized that OpenAI plans to release superior models. He expressed excitement about the competition and reiterated OpenAI\u2019s focus on its research roadmap, highlighting the growing demand for AI and the importance of increased computing power to achieve advancements, including AGI. For this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.  Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).   Story Continues   NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Driving AGI Advancements with Test Time Scaling and DeepSeek  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) focuses on AI-powered solutions, providing platforms for data centers, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and cloud computing.On January 27, Nvidia posted its comments about Deepseek. It highlighted it as a prime example of Test Time Scaling, showcasing how new models can be developed using existing resources while requiring extensive GPUs and high-performance networking for inference. The firm said:\u201cDeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek\u2019s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.\u201d Additionally, Cantor Fitzgerald views DeepSeek\u2019s V3 LLM release as highly positive for compute demand and NVIDIA, dismissing concerns about peak GPU spending. It believes the push toward AGI and Jevons Paradox will drive increased demand for compute and suggests NVDA shares are a buy during any weakness.Overall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of AI news you should take a look at. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA (NVDA): Is the DeepSeek Sell-Off a Wake-Up Call for AI Bulls?      Ramish Cheema   January 30, 2025 7 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Breaks Silence On DeepSeek AI Sell-Off & Discusses These 12 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks discussed by Jim Cramer with insights on the DeepSeek AI sell-off. On the day that Wall Street\u2019s favorite AI GPU stock bled 17% in the wake of investors panicking about Chinese AI startup DeepSeek\u2019s low development costs for AI, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about the topic. Cramer has been one of the biggest fans of the GPU company, and right off the bat, he started out by sharing that the key thing to consider now is whether the GPU orders for the firm will materialize.  He also commented on \u2018traveler stocks\u2019 or those that have benefited from the broad AI sentiment. Cramer shared \u201cWhat I find most interesting is that, the fellow travelers to these are the nuclear stocks that have been up a lot. . . .Are the memes. Are the crypto.\u201d He commented that the fact that these stocks were all simultaneously losing value was not great for the market. According to Cramer, \u201cSo looks [like] they are all you know one stock and that is not good. That\u2019s not good because that says you have hype and froth in here that has to come out no matter what.\u201d The CNBC host also shared his experience using DeepSeek\u2019s R-1 model. In his previous remarks, Cramer revealed that he was a fan of ChatGPT and had used OpenAI\u2019s product to research stocks ahead of his appearances on CNBC. However, he wasn\u2019t impressed by R-1. Cramer outlined that he \u201ctried to do a couple of, I tried to get it to give me Netflix\u2019s performance from 2010. And it says I can\u2019t do that. Well I mean, honestly? I can do that.\u201d  Another aspect of R-1 that left him unimpressed was censorship. \u201cThis is a Chinese product,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cSo when I put into my very helpful DeepSeek, what famous picture has a man with grocery bags in front of a tank? And it initially says, the famous picture you are referring to, Tank Man, unknown rebel, June 5, 1989,\u201d he added. While this is all good, soon after the initial response, R-1 \u201ctakes that back and says sorry, can\u2019t help you with that. And then secondarily it says sorry that\u2019s beyond my current scope,\u201d according to him. When co-host Carl Quintanilla asked him whether it was worth buying any of the AI stocks, Cramer was rather direct. He shared \u201cI don\u2019t have the knowledge to be able to make that decision. It\u2019s better to own that.\u201d Cramer also noted that before Monday\u2019s appearance, there was a debate about whether \u201ccan we just make a determination, or is the determination that we don\u2019t want to let anybody down so we can\u2019t make that?\u201d Given the absolute bloodbath in the premarket that day, he felt \u201clike, whatever you do, maybe twisted between now and the opening.\u201d As a result, Cramer shared \u201cBut sometimes you have to admit, like if you were at the hedge fund you\u2019d just say, you know I\u2019m not sure what to do, it\u2019s not a cop-out. I\u2019m not sure what to do.\u201d   Story Continues However, with respect to the doubt surrounding AI, he added \u201cWhen in doubt do you go against Zuckerberg? Do you go against Ellison? And I come back and say, I don\u2019t know. Sometimes it\u2019s better to say I don\u2019t know.\u201dLike social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s AI, DeepSeek is also open source. When asked about whether being open source threatens the ecosystem, Cramer replied \u201cYeah I know that, again, I don\u2019t want to front row Mark Zuckerberg on what he\u2019s saying, but I would say that we do have tremendous chip allocation problems here. And I know that David, we, if you have open source, would you think, that you do not need as many chips. Right. Not necessarily.\u201dThe sell-off in tech stocks did make him feel that \u201cit\u2019s not such a bad idea to look away from one moment and go back and say the healthcare rotation was so powerful last week.\u201dOur MethodologyTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 27th.For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Here's Why  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193AI chip darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was at the center of the DeepSeek sell-off as it lost more than $600 billion in market value. The drop occurred because investors were worried that billions of dollars in spending by big tech to buy NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s GPUs might not materialize if the low development costs from DeepSeek\u2019s R-1 model were accurate. Cramer has been one of the biggest proponents of the stock, and he started his morning show by explaining that what really mattered for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was whether its orders would be cut:\u201cLet\u2019s talk about something else. So against the idea that you\u2019re spending too much on NVIDIA, is the censorship [On DeepSeek R-1] that I don\u2019t really think any of the American companies can trust. Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of stocks discussed by Jim Cramer with insights on the DeepSeek AI sell-off. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Why NVDA Is Sinking Today      Larry Ramer   January 30, 2025 2 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%     BABA   +0.36%      Nvidia (NVDA) is falling 4% after Alibaba (BABA) reported today that its new AI model performs better than DeepSeek's offering. The latter Chinese start-up's model, which reportedly performed better than OpenAI's product in a number of areas, cost only about $5.6 million to train, according to DeepSeek. BABA's news may be renewing fears, first ignited by DeepSeek, that Chinese companies have discovered ways to launch highly advanced AI models without using NVDA's recently made, very expensive chips.   Jim Cramer Recommends Buying Nvidia (NVDA) on \u2018Inevitable Pullbacks\u2019   More Information About BABA's AI Model Called Qwen 2.5-Max, BABA's model \"demonstrated significant advantages across most benchmarks\" relative to Meta's (META) Llama-3.1-405B, BABA reported. Llama-3.1-405B was launched last July. BABA added that \"Qwen2.5-Max outperforms DeepSeek V3 in (a number of) benchmarks.\" Since the U.S. government has heavily restricted China's access to America's most advanced AI chips, the Street may fear that BABA created Qwen 2.5-Max using relatively old, cheap GPUs from Nvidia. As a result, Alibaba's announcement could be renewing worries about NVDA's outlook that were first sparked by DeepSeek earlier this week. The Price Action of NVDA In the last month, the shares have sunk 8%, while they are down 11.5% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Upgrade Now          Did Billionaire Chen Tianqiao Dump or Bet on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)?      Usman Kabir   January 22, 2025 4 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%     SNDA   -1.16%      We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Chen Tianqiao Dumped 3 Tech Stocks and Betting On These 4 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0 stands against the other stocks. Chen Tianqiao is a prominent Chinese entrepreneur and investor, best known for founding Shanda Interactive Entertainment, one of the leading internet and gaming companies in China during the early 2000s. Tianqiao also heads Shanda Asset Management, a hedge fund that managed more than $1.7 billion in 13F securities at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Through his innovative approach to technology and business, Chen has become one of the pioneers of the online gaming industry and a significant figure in the global tech and neuroscience communities.  Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Chen Tianqiao was born in 1973 in the Zhejiang province of China. Raised in a modest family, he excelled academically and earned admission to Fudan University, one of the top institutions in the Asian country, where he studied economics. His early years were marked by a strong interest in technology and business, which would later define his career. After graduation, Chen began his career in the investment arm of the state-owned conglomerate Jinjiang Group, where he honed his business and financial skills. However, his entrepreneurial ambitions led him to leave the corporate world and pursue opportunities in the burgeoning internet industry. In 1999, Chen co-founded Shanda Interactive Entertainment with his wife, Luo Qianqian, and younger brother, Chen Danian. The company initially focused on developing and distributing multimedia content but quickly shifted its focus to online gaming. In 2004, Shanda became the first Chinese online gaming company to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange, raising $152 million. By the mid-2000s, Chen was one of the richest individuals in China, with Forbes naming him one of the wealthiest self-made billionaires under 40.

For this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of Shanda Asset Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).   Story Continues   Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) High Growth Semiconductor Stock That Is Profitable Heading into 2025?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193\u00a0Shanda Asset Management's Stake: $121.4 millionNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The company's investment potential is driven by following several factors. To begin with, the investors may consider the company\u2019s financial growth as a top factor. As illustrated in the report of the third quarter of 2024, GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per diluted share was 0.78 dollars, up 16% from the previous quarter and up 111% from a year ago. Additionally, the company\u2019s quarterly net income was 19.3 billion dollars, up 16% from the second quarter and up 112% from a year ago. The second most compelling factor that may attract investment is the launch of its project DIGITS, the world\u2019s smallest AI supercomputer capable of running 200B-parameter models. Moreover, the firm has launched the NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform of APIs, SDKs, and services that enable developers to integrate OpenUSD, NVIDIA RTX rendering technologies, and generative AI into existing software tools and simulation workflows for industrial and robotic use cases.Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Billionaire Chen Tianqiao dumped and bet on. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Jim Cramer: NVDA Stock Doesn\u2019t Tell The \u2018Whole Story\u2019      Fahad Saleem   January 27, 2025 5 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Calls: 10 Stocks to Buy or Sell. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks to buy and sell highlighted in Jim Cramer's latest calls. Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC reminded viewers about the Trump playbook in the story market and said that he never believed the President would start a new trade war with China. Cramer explained that Trump\u2019s rhetoric has been \u201chot\u201d but the reality is \u201ccool\u201d and his much-feared tariffs against Canada and Mexico might also not realize as the new administration said it will \u201cstudy\u201d the matter. \u201cThe president loves the stock market; he always loves to send signals that all hell is going to break loose, and when it doesn\u2019t, well, guess what? The market flies. This rally is built on the back of tariffs, more specifically small-than-expected tariffs that could grow bigger if countries don\u2019t play ball. It\u2019s built on the backs of new projects like Stargate, a new AI infrastructure initiative.\u201d  Cramer then explained in detail why he believes Biden and his government were against top companies and how it affected the market and economy. Cramer said Trump is better for stock portfolios. \u201cHe knows business people in Silicon Valley; he knows how things work. You may like him, you may hate him, but the bottom line is, if you\u2019re a tech titan, Trump will take your call. In fact, he\u2019ll call you. Biden, I don\u2019t know if he knew who they even were, and he certainly didn\u2019t bother to call them. In the end, I think he preferred to sue them. If you own stocks, which is why you watch me, Trump\u2019s method is a heck of a lot better for your portfolio.\u201d  READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about during his programs on CNBC. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   Jim Cramer: NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Doesn\u2019t Tell The \u2018Whole Story\u2019   NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Jim Cramer in a latest program explained the reasons why NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares fell after the CES tech show. Cramer called this decline \u201chideous.\u201d   Story Continues \u201cSometimes the stock doesn\u2019t tell the whole story, particularly this stock. First of all, the whole tech sector rolled over today, even as other parts of the market like healthcare and banks held up well. Second, I\u2019d argue the tech stocks were victims of the flailing 10-year Treasury, as I said at the top of the show. Finally, this stock was up huge going into Jensen\u2019s speech last night. At its highs, it was shocking NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) managed to open up strongly in the morning. It only fell from those levels because the yield in the 10-year Treasury spiked.\u201d Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore, and the impact of high expectations will continue to weigh on the stock as growth cools. An EPS surprise of 8.5% was not able to help the stock. A similar trend occurred following the second-quarter earnings after a 5.6% EPS surprise. It\u2019s difficult to see Nvidia maintaining a mid-70s gross margin by the end of 2026. Over the last two quarters, Nvidia has already reported a drop in its gross margin from 78% to 74.5%.Then there\u2019s competition. Amazon (AMZN) recently disclosed its Trainium 3 chip, which is set to be released by the end of 2025. The chip is expected to be twice as fast with 40% more power efficiency than the previous generation, manufactured on TSMC\u2019s (TSM) cutting-edge N3 technology. Reportedly, technology giant Apple (AAPL) will be a consumer of Amazon\u2019s new silicon.Manole Capital Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\u201cAs of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date.\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of stocks to buy and sell highlighted in Jim Cramer's latest calls. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Bull of the Day: NVIDIA (NVDA)         Kevin Cook   January 30, 2025 5 min read              In This Article:  NVDA       VRT         Is NVIDIA (NVDA) a buy in the $120s or has the DeepSeek invasion delivered a serious re-rating to its growth and valuation?The biggest lever to answer this question revolves around whether the world suddenly needs less (and less-expensive) GPUs to power their LLM (large language models) and HPC (high-performance computing) models.As I write this on Wednesday afternoon, we await earnings calls from two of NVIDIA's biggest customers, Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META), that may indicate if their capex plans are being downsized after the suddenly cheaper, better, faster chatterbot from China.\u00a0The Data Will Now SpeakEven though I remain a long-term NVDA bull and added shares near $120 on Monday when it fell 17%, the stage is set for a potential near-term peak in its growth trajectory.Coming into the week, the stock was still a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) because the consensus EPS estimate for the coming fiscal year (begins February) had moved up 11.7% to $4.21 since the company's last earnings report in November.\u00a0The full-year topline consensus is for $192 billion. I was projecting that number would be over $200B by now. So $192B and $4.21, representing 49% and 43% growth, will be the numbers to watch today. If they get hit, so too might the stock.So far, I haven't heard even a single downgrade or negative estimate revision. But, again, the analysts have been waiting for the Microsoft and Meta conference calls (last night) to deliver their model adjustments this morning.I'll tell you this, the analysts are going to be chomping at the bit to get answers. This won't be your average quarterly call and I wouldn't want to be Microsoft or Meta brass having to explain and justify their respective AI capex budgets of $80 billion and $65 billion, respectively.  Tesla Too And as if that wasn't enough excitement today, Tesla (TSLA) will also have reported their quarter on Wednesday. Telsa and Musk are very big players in the GPU-AI market for self-driving cars and for his own chatterbot Grok. Elon Musk's new xAI data center in Memphis achieved something remarkable when his team assembled 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs in only a matter of months.Nicknamed \"Colossus,\" it was considereed in September the largest and one of the most powerful supercomputers in existence. I don't think Musk's appetite for GPUs will slow down much in the next five years.My NVDA Bull CaseHere's what I told my TAZR Trader members on Tuesday night...I have read a dozen different experts on AI and the DeepSeek invasion in the past 72 hours and sometimes my head was just spinning.\u00a0Because often they don't even agree with each other on the impacts.That's when I just go back to my thesis on NVIDIA: they dominate the technology stack that enterprises want, and the next stacks they don't even know they need yet (Isaac-Gr00t Robotics, Omniverse, Cosmos, NIMS, DIGITS, etc).(If you watched Jensen Huang's keynote at CES earlier this month, you got a clinic on all the latest innovations in these platforms.)I also told my group that the DeepSeek invasion has put the \"AI arms race\" back in the spotlight....Even bigger picture: forget the Jevon's Paradox stuff (lower cost + higher efficiency = more demand) for a moment and think about who is competing here.\u00a0It's USA vs. China, just like I made content around in 2019 after reading Kai-Fu Lee's book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order.(end of notes to TAZR members)So when I put together the innovative platforms coming from NVIDIA with the fact that the AI \"arms race\" is back in focus, I think NVIDIA sales estimates will not be revised lower.To round out my view, on Tuesday I also bought Vertiv (VRT), a high-growth provider of datacenter infrastructure, when the stock was down over 30% off its highs. I did this because I don't think the 2-4 year plans to build datacenters are being scrapped.Finally, part of my NVDA bull thesis after ChatGPT took the world by storm in early 2023 was that every large corporation would want to build their own internal LLMs.China definitely delivered a wake-up call to hyperscalers and LLM builders about cost efficiency. But I don't think it changes their plans to build on the model that Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta have established just because China tweaked an existing model that probably cost 100X what they claimed.Here's what I posted on X about my \"50,000 foot view\" of the panic...In May 2023 when Jensen revealed at Computex that GOOG, MSFT, and META were already in line for the coming GH200-DGX systems, I said \"Here we go to $200 billion in sales!\"Why? Because the other 1996 corps in Global 2000 would want to build their own INTERNAL LLMs. Same story today.What I mean is that no major corp wants to have their proprietary data in the hands of any outside entity. They want their own Magic Kingdoms of OZ to mine and model what only they know to serve employees and customers.The story might change at the margins. But the big builders (MSFT, AMZN, META, GOOG, Tesla, OpenAI, Oracle) are nowhere near done with their grand datacenter plans because their visions of serving the autonomous vehicle, robotics, energy, biotechnology, and custom AI markets are bigger than most of us can imagine.\u00a0They will pay for the NVIDIA GPU-DGX systems and clusters now because they see the ROI as massive in five years.\u00a0By the time you are reading this on Thursday morning, we should know a lot more as analysts react to MSFT and META.

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Unstoppable Tech Stock to Buy Right Now?      Rizwan Siddiqui   January 31, 2025 5 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%     ^GSPC   +0.38%      We recently published a list of 10 Unstoppable Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other unstoppable tech stocks to buy right now. The technology sector continues to be driven by rapid innovation and the adoption of cutting-edge technologies. Advances in technology are significantly impacting lives, industries, and economies worldwide, with the integration of AI and ML revolutionizing workflows, enhancing productivity, and creating new revenue opportunities. Organizations around the globe are undergoing digital transformation to stay competitive, streamline operations, improve customer engagement, and drive innovation in their products and services.  With substantial growth potential, the technology sector has consistently outperformed other sectors. In 2024, the S&P 500 Information Technology Sector Index rose by approximately 37%, outpacing the broader S&P 500 Index by an impressive 11.5%. This performance has led to skyrocketing market capitalizations for tech sector companies, prompting caution regarding high valuations. Following the market downturn triggered by DeepSeek\u2019s emergence, JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America, stated in an interview with BNN Bloomberg that while the market had reached incredibly high levels, macroeconomic concerns such as inflation and high interest rates persist. He also suggests that developments related to DeepSeek provided an excuse for profit-taking with a \u2018reset\u2019 occurring in tech stocks. Now the focus should shift to earnings and the actual benefits derived from those substantial investments. On a positive note, in his report on December 13, Adam Benjamin, Sector Portfolio Manager at Fidelity Investments, highlighted that the sector benefited in 2024 from outstanding results in the semiconductor industry, reflecting major corporate investments in AI infrastructure. He remains optimistic for 2025, as evident from his positive outlook: \u201cThe outlook for the sector in 2025 and beyond may be bright, as tech companies continue to innovate and digitization and automation become increasingly important in our lives. I believe the next phase of development could present opportunities for software firms, as the application layer begins to roll out generative AI agents across end markets, and as the full benefits of AI begin to be realized. Progress may not be linear, though, and investors must be mindful of stock valuations and the timing and potential impact of further technological advances in the field, as well as the broader macroeconomic environment.\u201d    Story Continues Our MethodologyTo identify the 10 best unstoppable stocks, we conducted extensive research to compile a list of fundamentally strong U.S.-listed companies that performed well in 2024 and are expected to continue their success in 2025. Our focus included technology companies with a market capitalization of $2 billion and above. We screened our coverage based on the following criteria: 1. Stock price should have outperformed the S&P 500 Index in 2024 (+22% rise in share price); 2. must have reported positive revenue growth over the last 5 years; 3. EPS growth for the next year is expected to be over 25%; 4. It should have a potential upside of at least 10%. Ultimately, the stocks were ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as per Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds, as of Q3 2024.Note: All pricing data is as of market close on January 28.At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) the Unstoppable Tech Stock to Buy Right Now?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Upside Potential: 36%Number of hedge funds: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) designs and manufactures graphics processing units (GPUs), system on a chip units (SoCs), and AI hardware and software. It primarily serves four major markets: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. For data centers, NVIDIA provides accelerated computing platforms and end-to-end networking solutions, including Quantum for InfiniBand and Spectrum for Ethernet, along with platforms for automated driving and AI Enterprise.NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) has evolved from a PC gaming GPU company to a dominant player in the accelerated computing space, offering full-stack computing infrastructure with data-center-scale solutions. The company\u2019s strength is evident in its commanding over 80% market share in GPUs. NVIDIA has greatly benefited from the growing adoption of AI and machine learning technologies, driving strong demand for its chips. The company\u2019s revenue, profitability, and market capitalization have surged since the introduction of GenAI models like ChatGPT.In the past year, NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock rose 109%, significantly outperforming the broader S&P 500 Index, which increased by only 24%. Despite a recent selloff triggered by news related to Deepseek, the stock remains a consensus Buy among analysts, who still see an upside of around 36%. Theo Mass, portfolio manager at Northcape Capital, recently remarked that the 17% overnight plunge in Nvidia shares was \u2018wildly overdone,\u2019 as it did not fundamentally change the growth outlook for NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA). Addressing concerns about Deepseek potentially hampering demand, Northcape Capital remains bullish on NVIDIA\u2019s outlook. As Mr. Mass stated:\u201cThe biggest game in town that these mega-cap tech companies and US chip suppliers are pursuing is still inference AI over the next five to 10 years. While training has been a significant start to the AI phenomenon, in five or 10 years, Deepseek will be a small start-up in the grand scheme of things. Nvidia has noted that 40% of their revenue is already related to inference AI, and they welcome some competition and optimization in these models. So, I\u2019m still bullish on Nvidia.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of\u00a0unstoppable tech stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Jim Cramer on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): \u2018It\u2019s Doing Nothing!\u2019      Ramish Cheema   January 30, 2025 8 min read        23   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discussed These 11 Stocks Before The DeepSeek Sell-Off. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks. In a fresh appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer cautioned viewers to not be caught up by the energy that's gripped the US stock market since President Donald Trump resumed charge. \"Things are happening very fast. And I want so much to slow it down,\" he stated. Cramer mentioned an article that mentioned \"the burst of energy, some good, some bad,\" adding that not every remark made by the President is investment advice. He believes that \"a lot of people want to do that. [treat all of Trump's remarks as investable]\" They wanna do oil and gas, they wanna do with interest rates,\" he added and shared \"They have to remember that he doesn't have the authority\" particularly when it comes to determining interest rates.  Cramer further commented on the state of America's non-tech industrial economy and how it tied in with the President's desire for lower rates. According to him \"I just think the industrial economy justifies everything that Trump wants to lower rates.\" Yet, as consumer spending has remained robust despite high rates, Cramer added that \"the consumer economy, says don't lower rates.\" He believes that if the president took a look at \"how great things are at small to medium-sized business. Where the real strength's coming since his election,\" he would be hard-pressed to press for further rate cuts. Energy was another topic on the CNBC host's mind. Commenting particularly on natural gas and its demand in today's era of AI data centers, Cramer shared \"People only want to be in this business. Want to own stocks in this business because it's going to be the biggest thing that we export.\" However, he believes that these investors need to ask themselves \"Are we going to export so much that domestically because we need it for the data centers, that the customer's going to be squeezed by uh nat gas prices.\" The surge in exports and data center demand could very well lead to higher natural gas prices for consumers. According to Cramer \"Nat gas could go to five. That would be something.\" Not only is Cramer interested in energy, but the President ran his election on the promise of increasing America's oil production and requiring oil companies to drill more. However, the CEOs that he's spoken to \"are all saying listen, we're going to hold.\"   Story Continues \"It's kind of a Braveheart thing,\" Cramer added. He believes \"They're not going to break. And they all are kind of united, but they don't fix prices. Some people, the FTC felt that they fixed prices. That's nonsense. But I do think that they've all said listen we're making a ton of money. We're not going to go down the path the President wants. So there's going to be a test of wills.\"Another topic that Cramer touched on was SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service. Starlink is powered by thousands of small satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO) launched by SpaceX. Over the past year, it has grown its presence in the commercial aviation industry by providing airlines with internet connectivity. Cramer revealed, \"You know the rap about Starlink I'm getting from, the push back that I'm hearing from some of the. . . that when you put em all up, like even when United starts, it's going to slow down the latency, they can't handle that.\"One of the hottest topics on Wall Street these days is Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. Investors' worries about the firm's R1 model being purportedly cheaper than American models led to Wall Street's favorite AI stock crashing by a whopping 17% on Monday. However, Cramer dismissed the worries of US companies pouring too much money into AI on Friday. He shared that he wasn't worried \"because I'm a huge believer that this is the industrial revolution, and there are going to be so many uses that you just have to be in.\"A mere industrial revolution isn't the only reason why Cramer was dismissive of the firm that led the AI GPU stock to lose all gains made since October 2024. Commenting on the firm's GPUs and their potential he revealed:\"I think that what we're not thinking about, like when I went to Jensen Huang's panel on healthcare. It's so much bigger than anything involving AI PC. I mean they're really just talking about having the data to really attack every single disease and changing it from fatal to maintenance. You have tremendous number of people involved in trying to do that. Then you have Stripe there working with [the GPU company] to be able to do something revolutionary in finance. And then you have the banks working doing some revolutionary things trying to get people who're doing S1s. . . .\" Cramer also believes that Fed chair Jerome Powell will be 'perplexed' by the amount of spending in America. According to him:\"The amount of people traveling. The bump up to first class, from commercial, from the, you know what second class we'll call it, David. Uh, the amount of people just, the frequency at which people are having a dinner out. I don't know what to say, there's a burst of optimism that is being translated into spend. And particularly for younger people that I'm just flabbergasted about. It just can't stop!\" The spending has left him flabbergasted. \"We're spending so much I don't know how they can cut!\" Cramer explained. \"I want them to cut . . . I wanted to cut like a thousand times!\" he added.Our MethodologyTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 24th.For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193Not a show goes by without Cramer talking about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). This time around, he commented on the firm on Friday, which was the last day before the DeepSeek sell-off. During the day, Cramer discussed reports that technology stock valuations were overstretched. For that day's specific moves, the host pointed at other sectors, such as healthcare, that were doing well and contributing to strong index performance. Naturally, and in eerie foreboding, he commented on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s overstretched valuation on the last trading day before the stock sank by 17%:\"[on reports of markets being stretched] We're in a good time. And yet of course we have to have everyone saying, well it's over, it's stretched. It's been stretched now since when I, since August of 1981 when I started. It was very stretched. You know it went up like eighty points in five weeks. Stretched. I am just saying don't play that game. Find good stocks. Find stocks that are winning and they are going, higher. NVIDIA by the way was at one forty two when I woke up at three o clock. Well one forty six. Then it went down to one forty five. Now it's back to one forty seven. It's doing nothing!\"\"Why, the stock's trading down on what, what phrase in that thing is negative. What phrase. Look, Microsoft's doing eighty, it's good for NVIDIA.\" Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer talked about before DeepSeek wreaked havoc on the stock market. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Why Nvidia (NVDA) Shares Are Sliding Today      Max Juang   January 30, 2025 3 min read        1   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%         Why Nvidia (NVDA) Shares Are Sliding Today   What Happened? Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 6.9% in the afternoon session after Bloomberg News reported that the Trump administration is considering curbing sales of the company's chips to China following the emergence of the DeepSeek AI model. According to the sources, the restriction might apply to some of Nvidia's cutting-edge chips, including the H20 AI chips. The shares closed the day at $123.81, down 4% from previous close. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free. What The Market Is Telling Us Nvidia\u2019s shares are very volatile and have had 26 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 2 days ago when the stock dropped 13% on the news that stocks heavily tied to the AI market took a hit after Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek released a new large language model (DeepSeek-R1) that ranks competitively on key global benchmarks (coding competitions, math evaluations), uses less advanced semiconductor chips, costs significantly less to build (at $5.5 million - excluding non-compute costs), and has already achieved strong adoption after topping the iPhone App Store for AI apps.  Notably, the company has also open-sourced this model, a move that may make it harder for rivals to justify huge upfront expenditures on hardware, software, and expertise to develop similar systems. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella praised DeepSeek's efforts, calling the new model \"super impressive\" for its open-source design, efficient inference-time computing, and high compute efficiency. \"We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously,\" he added. Nadella's comments suggest that upstarts like DeepSeek could reshape the competitive landscape of AI. DeepSeek's announcement disrupts long-held assumptions in key ways: 1) It undercuts the narrative that bigger budgets and access to top-tier chips are the only ways forward for AI development. 2) By using less advanced hardware, DeepSeek opens the door for innovators who face high chip costs or export restrictions, reaffirming they can still compete. 3.) The model's success questions the growth narrative of chipmakers like Nvidia\u2014whose soaring valuations depend on the demand for cutting-edge, high-performance hardware.   Story Continues Overall, DeepSeek's model demonstrates that AI innovation is no longer a race fueled solely by how much you spend, but rather by how resourceful you can be with what you have.Nvidia is down 11.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $123.19 per share, it is trading 17.6% below its 52-week high of $149.43 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $19,984.Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Reports 33% QoQ EPS Growth in Q3 2024, Driven by Exceptional Profitability and AI Innovation      Usman Kabir   January 30, 2025 6 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs\u2019 35 AI Superstars. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. In September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.  Although the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.

Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.   Story Continues While dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom.Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.However, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector.Bruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.Our MethodologyFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs.

NVIDIA (NVDA): Is the DeepSeek Sell-Off a Wake-Up Call for AI Bulls? Here's Why  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. There are various reasons why this company makes an excellent investment. For instance, the report for the third quarter of year 2024 reflects the company's exceptional growth in profitability. For the quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share was $4.93, increasing 33% from the previous quarter and a 765% increase from a year ago. Additionally, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $5.16, increasing 28% from the previous quarter and 486% rise from the previous year. Moreover, the NVIDIA Cosmos platform plans to advance physical AI with new models and video data processing pipelines for robots, autonomous vehicles and vision AI. Lastly, the company aims to revolutionize graphics with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 GPU, the most powerful GeForce RTX GPU so far, with 92 billion transistors and delivering 3,352 trillion AI operations per second (TOPS).Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market CapDisclosure: None.

Usman Kabir   January 19, 2025 4 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently compiled a list of the Louis Navellier's Top 15 Long-Term Stock Picks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0 stands against the other stocks. Louis Navellier is a prominent American investor, author, and financial analyst, best known for his quantitative approach to stock selection and his long-standing track record in the investment industry. As the founder and chairman of Navellier & Associates, a private investment management firm, he has built a reputation for identifying high-growth stocks with significant upside potential. Navellier\u2019s approach blends rigorous quantitative analysis with a focus on fundamental factors, positioning him as a leading voice in growth investing.  Born in 1957, Navellier developed an early interest in the stock market. He honed his analytical skills while studying at California State University, where he earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Finance. It was during his college years that Navellier discovered his passion for quantitative analysis, developing a stock-picking system as part of a class project. This project laid the foundation for his career, as he created a system to identify market-beating stocks using specific growth and valuation criteria.

Navellier is also widely known for publishing the Navellier Growth newsletter, where he shares stock recommendations and insights into market trends. In his newsletter-based recommendations, many stocks have achieved annualized returns exceeding 20% during high-growth market periods.  Navellier\u2019s approach focuses on finding stocks that exhibit strong growth characteristics while maintaining sound fundamentals. He relies heavily on quantitative analysis, utilizing algorithms and statistical models to screen for stocks with high revenue and earnings growth, solid profit margins, and favorable valuation metrics. Unlike many value investors who prioritize underpriced securities, Navellier embraces growth investing, emphasizing companies with strong momentum and the potential for rapid expansion.

For instance, as per the report of the third quarter of 2024, the total revenue reported was $35.1 billion, up 17% from the previous quarter and up 94% from the previous year. This high growth is driven by the demand for the Hopper computing platform, which is necessary for all AI applications. Subsequently, there was also a 15% rise in gaming revenue, which also played its part in boosting sales of GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs. Moreover, NVIDIA Corp has announced the project DIGITS, a personal AI supercomputer powered by the GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, capable of providing generative models with up to 200 billion parameters.

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Among the Best Humane Stocks to Invest in Now?      Mashaid Ahmed   January 25, 2025 6 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Humane Stocks to Invest in Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best humane stocks to invest in now. In recent years, the investment landscape has seen a significant shift towards socially responsible investing strategies. Among these, humane investing has gained considerable traction. Humane investing is a comprehensive socially responsible investing strategy that encompasses several key aspects. Firstly, it involves the reduction of animal products. This can range from food and fashion to pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, focusing on companies that minimize or eliminate the use of animal products. Secondly, it ensures that businesses respect human rights and address any adverse outcomes. This includes fair labor practices, anti-discrimination policies, and ethical supply chain management. Thirdly, it promotes environmental conservation, such as reducing carbon footprints, sustainable sourcing, and waste reduction. Lastly, it involves shareholder activism, where investors engage with companies to improve welfare practices.

On January 24, Morningstar reported that the landscape of sustainable investing is entering a new era of complexity, characterized by a stark divide between the United States and Europe. This shift was precipitated by a series of significant events, including President Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement. The decision underscores a growing divergence in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) priorities, with Europe taking a leading role and the US moving in the opposite direction. Europe has positioned itself as a leader in sustainable investing, with a pledge to achieve \u201cclimate neutrality\u201d by 2050, or net-zero emissions. The European Union has also implemented ambitious mandatory ESG and sustainability reporting requirements, setting a high bar for corporate transparency and responsibility. This regulatory framework not only supports sustainable investing but also creates a fertile ground for asset managers to develop and market ESG-focused products with higher profit margins and a global reach.  Conversely, the US under the Trump administration has taken a different path. Trump\u2019s inaugural speech signaled a pivot toward promoting fossil fuels and scaling back support for renewable energy sources. This shift is reflected in the actions of major financial institutions, such as the world\u2019s six largest banks withdrawing from a major climate coalition, and BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, pulling out of a similar group. This move is seen as a significant setback\u00a0by sustainably-minded investors as\u00a0the financial industry plays a crucial role in financing companies and achieving net-zero emissions targets set by the Paris Agreement.   Story Continues For asset managers, this two-speed world presents both challenges and opportunities. European managers, who operate in a market where sustainability is mainstream, are likely to gain a competitive advantage. They can leverage their expertise in ESG to attract asset owners, such as pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, who are increasingly allocating to ESG-focused strategies. This could lead to a preference for European managers, especially in impact investing, where they can demonstrate greater commitment and expertise.US-based managers, on the other hand, are likely to adopt a more pragmatic approach, aligning their strategies with local market demands and avoiding vocal advocacy for ESG. This \u201cgreenhushing\u201d strategy is necessary to navigate the regulatory and political headwinds in the US while maintaining a global presence, particularly in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.As the demand for ethical and sustainable investment options grows, humane investing provides a compelling pathway to drive positive change while achieving financial growth.  Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Among the Best Humane Stocks to Invest in Now?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.Our MethodologyTo compile our list of the 8 best humane stocks to invest in now, we used environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ETFs to compile a list of 25 companies.

The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment.Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Upgrade Now          Why NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Is Among the Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy for the AI Boom      Maxim G.   January 23, 2025 4 min read        2   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy for the AI Boom.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other semiconductor stocks. More than two years have passed since the proliferation of the disruptive Artificial Intelligence (AI) megatrend, symbolically marked by the launch of OpenAI\u2019s revolutionary product \u2013 ChatGPT. Since then, the AI revolution has accelerated rapidly, with 2023 and 2024 seeing a surge in demand for advanced AI applications across industries. This transformation has driven companies to increasingly rely on robust data centers that can support the computational power required by the intelligent algorithms.  In tandem with the rise of AI, the data center sector has experienced substantial growth. The need for larger, more efficient, and scalable data storage and processing capabilities has created a boom in infrastructure investments. Data centers, which house the powerful servers needed for AI workloads, have become critical enablers of this technology's expansion. This increase in demand for data center capacity is a key factor that has propelled semiconductor stocks, as these centers rely heavily on cutting-edge semiconductors to deliver the speed, efficiency, and power necessary to process vast amounts of data in real time. Our Methodology We shortlisted 35 semiconductor stocks using the holdings of iShares' Semiconductor ETF. Then we merged these stocks with Insider Monkey's proprietary hedge fund holdings database and identified the 10 most popular hedge fund semiconductor stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).   NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): AI Leadership and Blackwell Growth Amid Challenges   A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading developer of GPUs, traditionally used to enhance computing experiences, particularly in PC gaming. Over time, GPUs have become critical for artificial intelligence applications, with NVDA providing both AI-focused GPUs and its CUDA software platform for AI model development and training. The company is also expanding its data center networking solutions, enabling GPUs to work together efficiently to handle complex workloads.   Story Continues NVDA clearly had an explosive FY2024 as the stock price returned 146% in the last twelve months alone. While bears argue that the upside from accelerating GPU demand for data center applications has largely been realized and is priced in, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to tap into new markets, thus perpetually expanding its TAM and fueling growth. The company is partnering with IQVIA to develop custom AI models and agentic platforms for clinical trials using its proprietary AI foundry services and DGX Cloud capacity. It also introduced GenMol, a new foundation model for goal-directed molecular generation, as part of its BioNeMo platform for AI-driven drug discovery. Furthermore, NVDA is collaborating with the Arc Institute to develop large-scale foundation models for biology using NVIDIA DGX Cloud infrastructure and BioNeMo. A partnership with Illumina was announced to combine Illumina's sequencing platforms with NVIDIA's Clara toolset to expand genomics accessibility and utility. Another partnership with Mayo Clinic is set to accelerate AI-driven digital pathology using NVIDIA DGX Blackwell and applying Cosmos for multimodal vision to understand biology more deeply. The company is advancing physical AI capabilities through its Holoscan healthcare AI robot platform, Cosmos Nemotron vision language models, and Omniverse for creating physics-aware virtual worlds to train robots.Management of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has thoroughly discussed its new healthcare opportunity during the 43rd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. Here is what they said:\u201cNow if you think about the $10 trillion industry that health care has become, a very large portion of that is in labs, hospitals, and operations.\u00a0And\u00a0we're still in a huge labor shortage, 10 million to 15 million to 20 million labor shortage.\u00a0AI can help.\u00a0AI is going to help through the delivery of AI agents who can be knowledge workers working on your behalf.\u00a0They can be in the form of delivery robots, offloading nurses from delivering sheets to a different room.\u00a0They're going to become all forms.\u00a0And this digital intelligence is going to be built on AI factories, just as I described.\u00a0Data comes in, models get built and refined, assembled into agents, and intelligence comes out.\u201d Overall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best semiconductor stocks to buy for the AI boom. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a020 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a0Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia stock plummets, loses record $589 billion as DeepSeek prompts questions over AI spending      Laura Bratton    Updated January 28, 2025 3 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%    AVGO   +0.65%    AMD   +0.04%     ^SOX   +0.28%    MU   +2.09%      Nvidia (NVDA) stock dropped nearly 17% Monday, leading a sell-off across chip stocks and the broader market after a new AI model from China's DeepSeek raised questions about AI investment and the rise of more cost-efficient artificial intelligence agents. Nvidia's decline shaved $589 billion off the AI chipmaker's market cap, the largest single-day loss in stock market history.  Chinese startup DeepSeek released a new AI model on Jan. 20 viewed as a threat to OpenAI. American venture capitalist Marc Andreessen called the model \u201cone of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d The news came just a month after DeepSeek said one of its latest AI models cost just $5.6 million to train. OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 model cost more than $100 million to train.   The announcements spurred fears that AI models may begin to require fewer chips and energy than they currently use. Nvidia has become the world's largest company on the back of exploding demand for its high-end chips that help train and use AI models. \u201cIf DeepSeek\u2019s innovations are adopted broadly, an argument can be made that model training costs could come down significantly even at U.S. hyperscalers, potentially raising questions about the need for 1-million XPU/GPU clusters as projected by some,\u201d wrote Raymond James semiconductor analyst Srini Pajjuri in a note to investors Sunday evening. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    110.15 +1.77 (+1.63%)  At close: 4:00:00 PM EDT  109.37 -0.78 (-0.71%) Pre-Market: 5:38:44 AM EDT   Advanced Chart    Chip stocks also dropped across the board Monday, with Broadcom (AVGO) down over 17%, Micron (MU) off almost 12%, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) down more than 6%. However, Pajjuri continued, \u201cA more logical implication is that DeepSeek will drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers to leverage their key advantage (access to GPUs) to distance themselves from cheaper alternatives.\u201d NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)   Follow    View Quote Details    102.78 +0.04 (+0.04%)  At close: 4:00:01 PM EDT  102.14 -0.64 (-0.62%) Pre-Market: 5:37:24 AM EDT AMD AVGO MU   Advanced Chart    Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon also called into question the $5.6 million training cost for DeepSeek\u2019s model, which \u201cdoes not include all the other costs associated with prior research and experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data.\u201d Rasgon believes DeepSeek's announcement was \"not really worthy of the hysteria that has taken over the Twitterverse over the last several days.\"   DeepSeek and Nvidia logos. (Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images)  \u00b7 NurPhoto via Getty Images Nvidia itself didn't seem too worried about the DeepSeek buzz, calling R1 \"an excellent AI advancement\" in a statement. Tightened US export restrictions announced in former President Joe Biden\u2019s final days in office could also add a threat to DeepSeek\u2019s ability to continue training new models. The new rules limit China\u2019s ability to buy Nvidia\u2019s AI chips through resellers and access chips in remote data centers. And China is restricted from importing the most advanced chipmaking machines required to make artificial intelligence semiconductors from the Dutch firm ASML (ASML).   Story Continues At the same time, the US is ramping up investment in its own AI infrastructure.President Trump last week announced the Stargate AI project, which plans to immediately invest $100 billion to build US data centers and other infrastructure \u2014 with funding from SoftBank, Oracle, OpenAI and UAE-based MGX \u2014 to power generative artificial intelligence.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's CES keynote: Top 3 takeaways      Daniel Howley   \u00b7 Technology Editor Updated January 7, 2025 3 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%    META   +1.67%    MSFT   +1.81%    AMZN   +1.00%     TSLA   +3.59%      Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang kicked off CES 2025 with a keynote outlining the company's artificial intelligence ambitions for consumer and enterprise users for the year ahead. Huang debuted a number of new software technologies designed to help train humanoid robots and power a variety of AI applications. The company also announced new gaming hardware, including its high-flying $1,999 GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card for desktop PCs. Huang covered a lot of ground during his speech, but these are the biggest takeaways from the event. A new AI chip Nvidia has a new AI superchip. No, it's not the successor to the company's latest Blackwell chip, which it debuted during its GTC 2024 conference last March. This is a pint-sized version of its high-powered GB200 platform. Called the GB10, the chip is based on the GB200, which customers including Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) are snatching up in droves. But while the GB200 pairs two Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs) with one of Nvidia's Grace central processing units (CPUs), the GB10 marries one Blackwell GPU to a Grace CPU.

FALLON via Getty Images \"This little thing here is in full production,\" Huang said during the keynote. \"We\u2019re expecting this computer to be available in the May time frame.\u201d Nvidia also isn't touting the GB10 as a data center platform. Instead, the company says it will be available in a desktop it's calling Project DIGITS. Project DIGITS combines the GB10 with 128GB of unified memory and 4TB of storage to create an AI computing system that can sit on your desk. Robots and self-driving cars In addition to its new chip and desktop, Nvidia showed off its new Cosmos platform for developing physical AI systems like robots and self-driving vehicles. The platform uses world foundation models, or WFMs, which are AI models that simulate conditions in the real world. The idea is for companies to use Cosmos to help develop the software needed to power robots and self-driving cars by simulating various usage scenarios in a virtual setting without having to use pricey robots or putting cars on the road in the real world.

As for vehicles, Nvidia said Toyota, Continental, and Aurora are using its automotive suite of technologies to power their advanced driving and autonomous driving systems.   Story Continues \"The [autonomous vehicle] revolution has arrived,\" Huang said during the keynote. \"I predict that this will likely be the first multi-trillion-dollar robotics industry.\u201d  StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.  Gaming graphics cardsNvidia owes its incredible performance over the past year to its early investments in AI technologies. But that doesn't mean it's leaving its gaming roots behind. The company on Monday showed off its new GeForce RTX 50 series of graphics cards for desktop and laptop computers.The top-of-the-line RTX 5090 promises twice the performance of last generation's top dog, the RTX 4090, while Nvidia says its new entry-level RTX 5070 can match the RTX 4090's gaming capabilities thanks to advances to its proprietary DLSS software, which can do things like render and generate frames for games using AI.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia stock begins recovery after DeepSeek AI frenzy prompted near $600 billion loss      Laura Bratton    Updated January 29, 2025 2 min read        301   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%    AVGO   +0.65%     ^IXIC   +0.87%      Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose nearly 9% Tuesday as the AI chipmaker began to recover from a massive decline the prior day that shaved nearly $600 billion off its market cap. Nvidia\u2019s 17% freefall Monday was prompted by investor anxieties related to a new, cost-effective artificial intelligence model from the Chinese startup DeepSeek. Some Wall Street analysts worried that the cheaper costs DeepSeek claimed to have spent training its latest AI models, due in part to using fewer AI chips, meant US firms were overspending on artificial intelligence infrastructure. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    110.15 +1.77 (+1.63%)  At close: 4:00:00 PM EDT  109.37 -0.78 (-0.71%) Pre-Market: 5:38:44 AM EDT   Advanced Chart    That created a concern among the investment community that Nvidia\u2019s high GPU (graphics processing unit, or AI chip) prices could come under pressure and that demand for semiconductors could wane. Nvidia\u2019s $589 billion market cap decline was the largest single-day loss in stock market history. The DeepSeek announcements drove down not only Nvidia but the market at large, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) dropping 3%. Chip stocks dropped across the board Monday, but some names began to recover. After dropping more than 17% to start the week, Broadcom (AVGO) rose 2.6% Tuesday. Nvidia itself didn\u2019t express much anxiety over the DeepSeek buzz, calling R1 \"an excellent AI advancement\" in a statement Monday.   Jensen Huang speaking at NVIDIA Keynote at Michelob Ultra Arena in Las Vegas, NV, on Jan. 6, 2025. Credit: DeeCee Carter/MediaPunch /IPX  \u00b7 DeeCee Carter/MediaPunch/MediaPunch/IPx Wall Street analysts continued to reflect on the DeepSeek-fueled market rout Tuesday, expressing skepticism over DeepSeek\u2019s reportedly low costs to train its AI models and the implications for AI stocks. JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur and Citi analyst Christopher Danley said in separate notes to investors that because DeepSeek used a process called \u201cdistillation\u201d \u2014 in other words, it relied on Meta\u2019s (META) open-source Llama AI model to develop its model \u2014 the low spending cited by the Chinese startup (under $6 billion to train its recent V3 model) did not fully encompass its costs.  \u201cWe believe it is crucial to validate these costs before drawing conclusions,\u201d Sur wrote. Danley added: \u201cGiven Deepseek is based on leveraging cloud service providers [Meta] and AI is still in its infancy, we lean towards the argument of continued strong growth in AI spending.\u201d Even so, DeepSeek \u201cclearly doesn\u2019t have access to as much compute as US hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,\u201d Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri wrote in a note to investors Monday.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia Positioned For $400 Billion AI Boom With Advanced GPUs, New Product Launches Driving Revenue Growth, Say Analysts    Nvidia Positioned For $400 Billion AI Boom With Advanced GPUs, New Product Launches Driving Revenue Growth, Say Analysts      Anusuya Lahiri   January 30, 2025 4 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       Wall Street analysts rerated NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) after U.S. tech stocks\u00a0plunged Monday as Chinese open-source artificial intelligence platform\u00a0DeepSeek made the market jittery over the AI technology investment prospects in the U.S. tech firms. Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth upgraded Nvidia from Buy to Strong Buy and raised the price target from\u00a0$170\u00a0to\u00a0$220.  DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria maintained a Hold rating on Nvidia with a price target of\u00a0$135. Don't Miss: Nancy Pelosi Invested $5 Million In An AI Company Last Year \u2014 Here's How You Can Invest In Multiple Pre-IPO AI Startups With Just $1,000 Built on the trusted network of Fortune 500 companies, this blockchain company partners with Salesforce to uproot lengthy and expensive B2B transactions, and you can invest with just $100.  Tigress Financial: Nvidia continues as a core holding in the powerful AI investing theme and the industry-leading beneficiary of significant capital investment in AI development. This drives the ongoing acceleration of AI adoption across all industries and enterprises, which will continue to drive substantial revenue and cash flow growth, as well as better shareholder value creation, viewing yesterday's sell-off as a significant buying opportunity. DeepSeek's models were trained on less advanced Nvidia chips, leading to a significant drop in the stock value. However, the capabilities of DeepSeek's R1 AI model are unknown, and there are tremendous concerns about security.  Most importantly, AI and the data centers it runs on will require a multiyear ongoing investment in buildout and development. Nvidia will be a key beneficiary as it continues to be the number one supplier of AI-driving GPUs and introduces more advanced and powerful GPUs, including its current Blackwell line of processors and the upcoming Vera Rubin processors. Trending: Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share! Expectations for aggregate AI-driven and data center development capital investment should exceed $330 billion this year, from just under $250 billion in 2024 to over $400 billion next year. Nvidia highlighted multiple new product launches at CES 2025 in Las Vegas earlier this month. In November, Nvidia reported another quarter of strong results. Demand for its industry-leading AI-enabling GPUs remains incredibly strong, and it continues to support the powerful AI-driven investment theme.   Story Continues DA Davidson: DeepSeek R1 has just lowered the market price for best-in-class intelligence, and as a result, OpenAI is reacting costlyly. Sam Altman announced on X that OpenAI would give non-paying users \"hundreds\" of free queries a week to their upcoming o3-mini model.Analyst Luria noted the cost of providing such a service for free would be in the hundreds of millions a week, with his base case assuming $677 million in inference cost per week. Luria noted the most underappreciated takeaway of R1 is the visibility of its reasoning tokens.See Also: This 12,000 RPM Spinning Battery With Over $100 Million In LOIs Could Be The Missing Link For Green Energy \u2014 Here\u2019s Why Early Investors Are Flocking To Invest Before Funding ClosesAnother reason Luria noted sentiment shifting drastically in favor of DeepSeek over OpenAI is the inability to see o1\u2019s reasoning tokens despite paying for them at the $60 per million token cost.DeepSeek already released a leading text-to-image model, Janus-Pro-7B, that outperforms Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 3.Thus, Luria noted OpenAI\u2019s only move is to out-innovate open-source labs faster and find a way to lower inference costs if they are to prevail.While Luria is aware of skepticism about DeepSeek\u2019s training cluster size, he noted this as pure speculation with little evidence to back it.In China, DeepSeek is not alone; Luria flagged developments from Qwen (Alibaba), Doubao (ByteDance), Kimi,and MiniMax as just some of the labs that have released leading models over the past few weeks. Luria expects a flurry of responses from American labs as a response to R1 shortly.Read Next:According to Juniper Research, the total value of B2B cross-border payments stored on the blockchain is projected to exceed $4.4 trillion \u2014 Join the first company to bring blockchain payments to Salesforce early with just $100. \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones.

Upgrade Now          Why Nvidia Stock Skyrocketed 171.2% in 2024 but Is Losing Ground in 2025      Keith Noonan, The Motley Fool   January 14, 2025 4 min read        2   In This Article:  NVDA       MSFT         Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock posted another year of explosive gains in 2024. The company's share price closed out the year's trading up 171.2%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.   NVDA data by YCharts  Nvidia continued to see very strong demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) for artificial intelligence (AI) last year. The company delivered four quarters of sales and earnings beats, and its valuation also soared in conjunction with bullish coverage from analysts, new growth initiatives, and the company's stock split. Nvidia stock delivers another fantastic performance in 2024 Nvidia continued to command a dominating position in AI processors last year. With tech companies increasing their spending on AI infrastructure, Nvidia delivered another year of strong sales and earnings reports. The company managed to beat the average Wall Street sales and earnings targets with each of the four quarterly reports it published in calendar 2024. The table below breaks down the company's top-line performances compared to the average analyst estimates. Fiscal Quarter Wall Street Consensus Revenue Target Actual Revenue Percentage Beat  Q4 2024$20.62 billion$22.1 billion7.2% Q1 2025$24.65 billion$26.04 billion5.6% Q2 2025$28.7 billion$30.04 billion4.7% Q3 2025$33.16 billion$35.08 billion5.8%  Data sources: Nvidia and CNBC. With the business continuing to post very strong margins, sales beats meant that the company's quarterly reports also arrived with earnings results that came in well ahead of Wall Street's targets. In addition to fundamental performance catalysts, Nvidia stock also got a lift from a stock split last year. The company announced a 10-for-1 stock split on May 22 and immediately saw an uptick in bullish momentum. The company's split was carried out on June 10. While its stock didn't immediately see big gains following the completion of the move, it did see subsequent valuation increases that may have been aided by the split. Why is Nvidia stock losing ground in 2025? Nvidia stock actually saw gains early in 2025 thanks to news from Microsoft about its plans for AI infrastructure spending this year. On Jan. 3, Microsoft published a blog post stating that the company planned to spend roughly $80 billion this year to build out its AI data center capabilities. Nvidia's GPUs are the foundational hardware element powering today's most advanced AI training systems and applications, and it likely stands to be the largest beneficiary of Microsoft's big spending push.   Story Continues But Nvidia stock has subsequently seen pullbacks in conjunction with macroeconomic pressures and geopolitical risk factors. As of this writing, the company's share price is down roughly 1.5% across 2025's trading.On Jan. 10, the Bureau of Labor Statistics published U.S. jobs numbers for December. The report showed that the U.S. economy added 256,000 jobs last month, which came in far ahead of the average forecast for additions of 155,000 jobs in the period. The higher-than-expected jobs growth raised concerns that inflation could be trending higher than investors and economists anticipated. If so, that makes it less likely that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates and create a more favorable backdrop for growth stocks.Nvidia stock is facing another bearish pressure following news that the U.S. will expand its restrictions on the export of advanced AI chips to China and other rival nations. Export bans were already in place that prevented Nvidia's most advanced processors from being sold to China, but it looks like the severity and breadth of limitations is poised to increase significantly in the near term.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Upgrade Now          Nvidia stock jumps, leads 'Magnificent 7' gains to start 2025 after end-of-year tech sell-off      Laura Bratton    Updated January 4, 2025 3 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   AMZN   +1.00%    NVDA   +1.63%    AAPL   +0.48%    META   +1.67%    MSFT   +1.81%       Nvidia stock (NVDA) led gains among the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d tech stocks to start the new year after a group-wide sell-off in the last days of 2024. Shares of the AI chipmaker rose 4.5% Friday after gaining roughly 3% the prior day. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    110.15 +1.77 (+1.63%)  At close: 4:00:00 PM EDT  109.37 -0.78 (-0.71%) Pre-Market: 5:38:44 AM EDT NVDA MSFT AAPL   Advanced Chart    That upswing followed a 4% dip between Christmas Eve and New Year\u2019s Eve as megacap tech stocks dropped across the board in the absence of a \u201cSanta Claus\" rally, where the stock market typically enjoys a surge between Dec. 24 and Jan. 2. Tesla (TSLA) stock plunged nearly 13% over that time frame, while Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) dropped more than 4%. Meanwhile, Meta (META) and Google (GOOG) fell just under 4%, and Apple (AAPL) dropped 3%. Even with its December decline, Nvidia shares still ended 2024 up more than 150%. Wall Street analysts have remained bullish on the stock, estimating shares will rise to roughly $173 over the next year from their current level of $138, according to Yahoo Finance data. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    110.15 +1.77 (+1.63%)  At close: 4:00:00 PM EDT  109.37 -0.78 (-0.71%) Pre-Market: 5:38:44 AM EDT   Advanced Chart    Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya told Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid podcast Thursday that broader market forces and company-specific issues drove the sell-off in Nvidia stock late last year. \"What we have seen in the market is a rotation of money from semiconductors to software,\" Arya said, noting that the latter was less exposed to US trade restrictions on goods to and from China. He added that for Nvidia, \"the last two quarters have not been clean, really, because they're going through growing pains from one generation of product that was Hopper to the new generation of product.\"  Arya was referring to concerns surrounding delays in shipments of the company's new Blackwell artificial intelligence chips. \"In our view, these are short-term issues,\" he said. That could create a buying opportunity: While its Magnificent Seven peers are trading at two times their average earnings growth estimates for 2025, Arya noted that Nvidia shares are trading at less than one times the consensus earnings growth for the company this upcoming year. Arya has a Buy rating on Nvidia stock and sees shares rising to $190 over the next 12 months. Shares of Nvidia and its Magnificent Seven peers have benefited from investors' massive bets on artificial intelligence, as well as earnings growth. As Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reported, through roughly three-quarters of reports, the combination of Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, and Nvidia grew earnings year over year by 33% in 2024, compared to just 4.2% growth for the other 493 S&P 500 companies, per FactSet data.

(CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images)  \u00b7 CFOTO via Getty ImagesTo be sure, skeptics warn of a bubble that could burst and send AI-fueled stocks tumbling if hype over the new technology fades and Big Tech's spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure wanes. Wall Street analysts overall remain convinced the AI enthusiasm will continue, however.Tesla also notched a notable gain Friday, jumping more than 8%. Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta rose around 1%, while Amazon spiked nearly 2%. Apple shares were roughly flat.  StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia stock falls after notching record high ahead of CES AI superchip debut      Laura Bratton     January 8, 2025 2 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%     SMH   +0.48%      Nvidia stock (NVDA) tumbled more than 6% Tuesday, a day after shares closed at a record high in anticipation of CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s keynote at the tech industry\u2019s annual CES trade show in Las Vegas. Huang's presentation on Monday night gave a flurry of updates on upcoming Nvidia products, previewing what\u2019s next in the burgeoning artificial intelligence market and for other emerging technologies. Shares jumped as much as 2.5% early Tuesday before reversing direction. The chip maker was the Dow's worst performer of the session. Nvidia stock's decline comes amid a broader slump in stocks Tuesday after November job openings data came in mixed and separate economic data stoked inflation concerns. Nvidia shares are still up roughly 190% from last year. Its updates at CES fueled more bullish takes on the stock. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    110.15 +1.77 (+1.63%)  At close: 4:00:00 PM EDT  109.37 -0.78 (-0.71%) Pre-Market: 5:38:44 AM EDT   Advanced Chart    Analysts at Stifel, Wedbush, and Truist Securities on Tuesday reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock. On average, Wall Street analysts tracked by Yahoo Finance see Nvidia shares rising to $172.80 over the next 12 months. \u201c[T]he company continues to position itself more favorably \u2014 not just in the datacenter but increasingly at all areas of the edge \u2014 from client compute to autonomous vehicles to robotics \u2014 supporting revenue growth and our Buy rating on the stock,\u201d Truist Securities analyst William Stein, who holds a Buy rating on the stock, wrote in a note to investors Tuesday morning.  One of Nvidia's most notable updates at the trade show: a new, pint-sized artificial intelligence superchip called GB10 used in its (also new) client supercomputer. The supercomputer \u2014 sized to fit on the average-sized desk \u2014 is part of Nvidia\u2019s Project DIGITS announced Monday, advertised to developers, researchers, and students, and the device will be available in May for $3,000.   Jensen Huang speaking at NVIDIA Keynote at Michelob Ultra Arena in Las Vegas, NV, on Jan. 6, 2025. Credit: DeeCee Carter/MediaPunch /IPX  \u00b7 DeeCee Carter/MediaPunch/MediaPunch/IPx Nvidia also unveiled major updates about its robotics strategy. The chip giant debuted its Cosmos platform, which offers AI models for developing humanoid robots as well as autonomous vehicles. Nvidia shares closed at a record high of $149.43 Monday ahead of Huang\u2019s keynote \u2014 eclipsing its prior record close of $148.88 reached on Nov. 7. Wedbush analyst and Nvidia bull Dan Ives said he sees robotics and autonomous technology representing a $1 trillion market for the company. Huang put that number higher in his keynote, saying that autonomous driving technologies alone \u201cwill likely be the first multitrillion-dollar robotics industry.\"  Additionally, Nvidia showcased new Blackwell-generation gaming GPUs (graphics processing units) and applications for developers to launch their own custom AI agents. Yahoo Finance\u2019s Dan Howley reported that Nvidia could debut a successor to its Blackwell generation AI chips during its GTC conference in March.
