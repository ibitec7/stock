Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA (NVDA) The Mega Cap Stock Gaining Bullish Momentum This Week?      Jabran Kundi   Sat, March 29, 2025 at 6:37 AM GMT+8 3 min read        2   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%     ^GSPC   +0.38%      We recently published a list of 10 Mega Cap Stocks Gaining Bullish Momentum This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other mega cap stocks gaining bullish momentum this week. The S&P 500 index started the week with a bang after staying under pressure for a few days. There was a realization that Wall Street may have overestimated the impact of tariffs. Once the dust settles, the market will continue to go higher, just like the US economy which continues to grow despite challenges.  When the broader market corrects itself due to uncertainty, such as the one brought about by Trump\u2019s tariff wars, mega-cap stocks also get affected. This provides investors, especially the ones that invest at regular intervals, to take another bite of these impressive stocks. The same situation happened during the last week, and we believe that after Monday\u2019s impressive recovery, the trend is about to reverse. Mega cap stocks like the ones in our list have driven the market in recent months and are therefore likely to be the ones leading it again. We decided to come up with the top 10 mega-cap stocks in the S&P index that have lost a considerable chunk of value in the last month and are now trading at a discount, a valuation gap that could quickly be recovered during this week\u2019s trading. To come up with the list of 10 oversold S&P 500 Mega-Cap Stocks To Trade This Week, we only looked at stocks with a market cap of at least $200 billion that have lost the most value in the last month.   Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) The Mega Cap Stock Gaining Bullish Momentum This Week?   A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) operates as a computing infrastructure company and offers compute & networking and graphic solutions. The company operates in two segments: Compute & Networking and Graphics. Its products are used in data centers, gaming, automotive, and professional visualization markets. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently held a Q&A at its GTC event and that prompted analysts to continue their bullish view on the company. For instance, Morgan Stanley reiterated its $162 price target on the company, saying it was more positive on its prospects than before.  Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) also bought the synthetic data company Gretel for an undisclosed amount, though the figure is expected to be somewhere between $350 million and $500 million. As AI training models use up human-generated data, synthetic data is in demand, and Nvidia is positioning itself to benefit from that.   Story Continues The stock continues to trade at an expensive valuation, though it has come to more reasonable levels recently. It now trades at a P/E ratio of 41, well below its 5-year average of 72. The price-to-cash-flow ratio of 41 is also at a significant discount to the 5-year average of 55.46.Overall, NVDA ranks 6th on our list of mega cap stocks gaining bullish momentum this week. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as a leading investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Top Blue Chip AI Stock to Buy According to Billionaire Cliff Asness?      Neha Gupta   Fri, March 28, 2025 at 9:01 AM GMT+8 5 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of the Top 10 Blue Chip AI Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Cliff Asness. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top blue chip AI stocks to buy according to billionaire Cliff Asness. Cliff Asness is one of Wall Street\u2019s most respected hedge fund managers. The founder and managing principal of\u00a0AQR Capital Management\u00a0has often relied on various strategies to squeeze value in the equity markets. Right from relying on fundamental analysis, Asness has also etched his name by focusing on value and momentum strategies that have often generated solid returns.  AQR Capital Management has generated positive outcomes over the past three years, having recorded its best year in 2022, when it gained 43.5%. Its 16.8% gain in 2021, 18.4% in 2023 and 15.1% in 2024 affirm its status as the best-performing multi-stage hedge fund. The hedge fund is increasingly deploying artificial intelligence to enhance its performance. The technology is used in the core parts of the investing process while helping combine and weigh the various investment factors. AI is also being used to speed up coding and create trading signals from text.

It turns out it\u2019s annoyingly better than me. AI, to be honest, pushes us a little on the spectrum away from some of the traditional things we\u2019ve talked about, and that was uncomfortable for me,\u201d said Asness.  Even as Asness continues to integrate artificial intelligence into the overall investment strategy at AQR Capital Management, he remains wary that the markets have become less efficient over the past 35 years. \u201cOne of my themes is that markets just don\u2019t get efficient on their own. There are our tools, our institutions, our traditions, and ultimately markets are a voting mechanism. So anything we do to make that noisier is going to make markets less efficient,\u201d Asness said.  In a less efficient market, rational value investors need to weather the ups and downs that come into being. Consequently, the AQR Capital Management chief believes rational investors prepared to stay in the game for the long term stand a better chance of navigating the less inefficient markets. The longer an investor\u2019s timeline, the better their capacity to endure the fluctuations of the market and benefit from its reduced efficiency, assuming they can weather elevated risk and potentially prolonged periods of discomfort. Several aspects can assist with this, such as not fixating on every single item in your portfolio, losing sight of the broader picture, and not believing that three to five-year trends are fixed.   Story Continues Asness also advises investors to be wary of over-investing in private assets in an attempt to stabilize their returns. A consistent critic of private equity, Asness contends that firms which do not accurately assess assets against market value are obscuring the genuine level of risk investors are embracing. He expresses confusion as to why investors appear prepared to pay a premium for what he refers to as \u201cvolatility laundering,\u201d arguing that by doing so, they are settling for diminished returns.Our MethodologyTo make the list of 10 Blue Chip AI Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Cliff Asness, we analyzed AQR Capital Management Q4 2024 13F filing. We settled on the top blue chip companies with significant exposure to artificial intelligence. We then analyzed them on why they stand out as Billionaire Cliff Asness\u2019 top stock picks. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on the value of AQR Capital Management equity stakes. Additionally, we have mentioned the broader hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q4 2024.At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Top Blue Chip AI Stock to Buy According to Billionaire Cliff Asness?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)AQR Capital Management Equity Stakes: $2.19 BillionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 223NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a technology giant that designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs) and system-on-a-chip (SoC) units. It is the leading supplier of GPUs needed to power data centers and other electronic devices amid the artificial intelligence race. It is one of the top blue chip AI stocks to buy, according to billionaire Cliff Asness, as it continues to benefit from increased spending on AI infrastructure.Its flagship GPUs, the H100, H200, and the more recent Blackwell series, have become the standard for powering data centres amid the AI boom. Due to its market dominance in the GPU industry, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) already enjoys a competitive advantage that is anticipated to fuel further growth. Additionally, the Blackwell AI processor\u2019s high demand caused NVIDIA\u2019s most recent quarterly sales to surpass Wall Street projections, affirming underlying growth.With data center revenue of $35.6 billion, which exceeded the $34.1 billion forecast, the chipmaker posted revenue of $39.3 billion in FQ4 2025, exceeding Wall Street\u2019s projection of $38.2 billion. Because of AI adoption, NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) data center division has emerged as its most significant and rapidly expanding revenue stream, accounting for almost 88% of total sales.Overall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of top blue chip AI stocks to buy according to billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Among Top High-Risk, High-Reward Growth Stocks To Buy Now      Venkatesh   Mon, March 31, 2025 at 10:47 AM GMT+8 6 min read        2   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently curated a list of 11 High-Risk High-Reward Growth Stocks To Buy Now. Here, we take a detailed look at NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and its ranking among the top picks. The stock market has an ever-changing environment, leaving investors constantly looking for opportunities that promise substantial returns for their investments. Gaining a consistent placement in the portfolio of such investors is a growth stock. These growth stocks have historically been highly valued among investors seeking high investment returns. However, another essential characteristic of a growth stock is the risk proportional to its level of return. In other words, growth stocks may deliver significant capital appreciation but have heightened volatility.  Changes often influence the volatility of growth stocks in market conditions. In this regard, the U.S. market conditions underwent many changes soon after the new U.S. president entered the Oval Office.

Compared to other stocks, their performance must be considered before deciding to welcome these stocks into the portfolio.  During the past decade, growth stocks have significantly outperformed their value counterparts. A report by Vanguard stated that during the last 10 years, the U.S. growth stocks have performed better than the U.S. value stocks by an average of 7.8% per year. The upward trend increases the attractiveness of growth stocks for those seeking high returns. On the other hand, stock markets can be cyclical, with growth and value stocks shifting their leadership roles in the market. The cyclical nature suggests that growth stocks may enjoy periods of dominance, but they are not to be mistaken as immune to market rotations, which may favor value stocks.

The growth stocks may either belong to companies in emerging industries or be in possession of innovative products or services that could quickly attract the market. Though investors may be attracted to the stocks\u2019 potential for substantial gains, they also need to be cautious of the associated risks, and hence, the approach should involve thorough research and a well-considered investment strategy.   Story Continues The list we have created here could offer some assistance in an informed decision-making process for investors with respect to growth stocks.Our MethodologyWe applied a screening approach when curating our list of 11 high-risk, high-reward growth stocks to buy now. The selection criteria primarily focused on companies with strong earnings and sales growth. Since we wanted our list to be comprised of stocks with high historical performance and future potential, we considered only those with an EPS growth rate of 20% in the past five years and as the next five years\u2019 projection. Also, only the companies with a sales growth of more than 20% in the last five years were incorporated into the list. We considered the stocks\u2019 volatility and set the beta threshold at 1.5. Finally, market capitalization was restricted to small-cap and more extensive ($300 million+). Additionally, we looked into the number of hedge funds backing the stocks to understand the institutional interest in the stock. For this purpose, we used the Insider Monkey database of Q4 2024. The stocks are ranked according to analysts\u2019 upside potential.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA (NVDA) The Best Gaming Stock to Invest In According to Billionaires?      Ali Ahmed   Sun, March 30, 2025 at 6:24 AM GMT+8 5 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Gaming Stocks to Invest In According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other gaming stocks. The gaming industry has experienced significant changes over the past few years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the sector saw remarkable growth as more people spent time indoors. However, this momentum did not continue after restrictions eased, which led to lower consumer spending on games and consoles. Economic uncertainties and challenges like inflation further impacted the industry, resulting in layoffs, studio closures, and project cancellations across the industry in 2024. Despite these setbacks, analysts are optimistic about a recovery supported by upcoming major releases.

According to research firm Newzoo, video game consoles are expected to be the biggest growth driver in the market until 2027. The anticipated launches of GTA VI in fall 2025 and the new Switch console in summer 2025 are seen as key factors fueling a rebound. GTA V, the predecessor to GTA VI, is one of the most profitable games ever and has sold over 210 million by December 2024. Analysts believe new releases will encourage players to spend more on consoles and games. This could potentially reverse the industry\u2019s recent slowdown. According to the report by Newzoo, console software revenue is projected to increase 7% from 2024 to 2027 and outperform PC software revenue growth of 2.6%. By 2027, console revenue is expected to account for over 56% of the total PC and console software revenue of $92.7 billion. Total playtime increased by 6% in 2024 and Q4 saw the highest quarterly playtime thanks to blockbuster releases like the new Call of Duty title. Emmanuel Rosier, director of market analysis at Newzoo, told Reuters that major console titles, such as Spider-Man and God of War, are driving engagement on consoles. He also pointed out that these AAA or AAAA releases have less impact on PC gamers, who prefer older titles.

Upgrade Now          Analyst Says NVIDIA (NVDA) AI Pipeline is \u2018Very Much Real\u2019 Across Multiple Industries      Fahad Saleem   March 19, 2025 4 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of 10 Stocks Market Experts are Talking About These Days. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that market experts are talking about these days. Piper Sandler\u2019s Chief Market Technician Craig Johnson said in a latest program on CNBC that despite the recent market volatility and \u201cnegative\u201d headlines, he sees buying opportunities for long-term investors. \u201cThe headlines out here are extremely negative all over the place and the sentiment toward this market is absolutely awful. Typically, you find these readings near sort of bear market lows, which is what you typically see. And if you also start to look at the VIX, it is elevated out here at this point in time. Now, technically we have broken some uptrends, we\u2019ve closed below 50 and 200-day moving averages, but we\u2019re getting to some pretty washed-out levels. I started looking at new highs, new lows, breadth indicators, and all these pieces. And we\u2019re starting to get to levels where you look back and say, \u201cIs this 1989? Is this a period of time that\u2019s like the great financial crisis or the \u201987 market crash?\u201d And I think the answer to that is flat out no. So, we\u2019re setting ourselves up for, I think, a potentially pretty good buying opportunity. All this negativity, and again, as Warren Buffett has said, you\u2019ve got to be greedy when people are fearful. When people are greedy, and definitely a lot of fear out here, that seems to me to be a little bit misplaced on the charts.\u201d  READ ALSO:\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 stocks notable Wall Street analysts were discussing over the past few days. With each company we have mentioned the latest hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).    NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Funds Investors: 193 Todd Gordon, founder of Inside Edge Capital, said in a latest interview with CNBC that he likes NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and expressed surprise that the stock is declining despite strong earnings growth: \u201cIf you look at Nvidia, I mean, what do they grow earnings\u201450, 60, 70%? The shock and awe of Nvidia is off, but the stock is still well supported. I think the pipeline they\u2019re looking at going forward\u2014the AI evolution\u2014is very much real. It\u2019s going to touch multiple industries, multiple sectors. I like Nvidia.\u201d    Story Continues Nvidia stock has not been able to recover from the DeepSeek shock. Why? About 50% of the company\u2019s revenue comes from large cloud providers, which are rethinking their plans amid the DeepSeek launch and looking for low-cost chips. Nvidia\u2019s Q1 guidance shows a 9.4% QoQ revenue growth, down from the previous 12% QoQ growth. Its adjusted margin is expected to be down substantially as well to 71%. Market does not like when Nvidia fails to post a strong quarterly beat. The stock will remain under pressure in the coming quarters when the company will report unimpressive growth.Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q4 2024 investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to outperform the market during the fourth quarter. The technology giant and top position in the fund delivered on sky-high expectations during the quarter and reported quarterly expectations that exceeded expectations. The red-hot company provided forward-looking expectations which were regarded as slightly lackluster as compared to prior quarters that smashed expectations. While the stock did churn a bit in the quarter, the AI giant remains top of mind for investors, especially as the company is on pace to satisfy the \u2018staggering\u2019 demand for its new product, Blackwell, which is poised to enter the market over the next year. The company\u2019s position of owning all the major pieces of the evolving AI data center enables it to strengthen its competitive position and to define the technology roadmap for generations to come.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that market experts are talking about these days. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to BillionairesDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) a Stock That Members of Congress Own?      Maxim G.   March 20, 2025 6 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks That Members of Congress Own. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the stocks that members of Congress own. Members of the US Congress have historically been permitted to own and actively trade stocks, a practice frequently scrutinized and critiqued for potential conflicts of interest and ethical concerns related to insider trading. Although this issue has periodically surfaced in public debate, significant legislative action took place with the introduction of the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act in 2012, which explicitly prohibited members of Congress and federal employees from using non-public information for personal profit and required prompt disclosure of stock trades. Nevertheless, the enforcement of the act has been unclear, as numerous lawmakers have drawn criticism for late or incomplete reporting of transactions.  READ ALSO:\u00a0Why Do Cathie Wood and Nancy Pelosi Love This Small AI Stock? Most recently, in December 2024, President Biden publicly endorsed a full ban on stock trading by members of Congress, asserting that lawmakers should not be able to profit from the stock market while serving in office. The newly inaugurated President Trump has had a similar stance for many years, as he famously stated the following: \u201cWe want a ban on members of Congress getting rich by trading stocks on insider information.\u201d  While it is clear that any US administration has publicly positioned itself against stock trading by high-ranked public officials and members of the Congress, the reality is often much more complex and difficult to enforce. It is even more difficult to prove whether a public official did use non-public information in making his/her investment decisions \u2013 particularly because the official may invoke the Mosaic approach, arguing that their trades were based on many pieces of publicly available information and personal analysis and reasoning. The key takeaway for investors is that we may never witness a perfect world in which members of the Congress do not own and profit from their stock investments.  The topic of stock trading by the members of Congress or other highly ranked officials has been widely discussed by investors and market enthusiasts for many years, driven by the perception that lawmakers\u2019 trades might offer insights into upcoming market-moving policies or future legislation. This ongoing scrutiny has even led to the creation of thematic ETFs that track the disclosed trades of US legislators and weigh the stocks by their popularity among the members of the Congress. This allows retail investors to replicate congressional investment strategies and potentially profit. Anecdotal portfolios of individual Congress members or high rank officials emerged as well, some of which even managed to outperform the broad US market. These products highlight how public attention has evolved from merely ethical considerations to practical investment opportunities, reflecting investors\u2019 belief in Congress members\u2019 informational advantage or superior market timing.   Story Continues We believe that monitoring the trades of lawmakers may be especially useful during times of rapid change, such as a drastic regime change during which the views of the new administration significantly diverge from those of the old one. The Trump 2.0 administration has given investors vertigo so far, as it becomes more and more difficult to predict the next moves related to tariffs, immigration, public spending, healthcare budgets and defense. We believe such periods of massive change would bring significant opportunities for people knowing (or inferring using the Mosaic approach) the next moves of the US administration: for instance, any sudden cuts in Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement policies may drastically hit the Healthcare sector, favoring thematic put options; Defence stocks may witness uplift if President Trump shifts his stance regarding the continuation of military aid to Ukraine; government contractors and consultants, which are currently beaten down, may witness a surge in stock price if the new Government announces any major new projects. All in all, we advise to exercise cautiousness when interpreting congressional trading data, as inferring actionable insights from lawmakers\u2019 investments may lead to misleading conclusions or overlooked risks.  Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) a Stock That Members of Congress Own?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.Our MethodologyWe used the Periodic Transaction Reports that US politicians are obliged to file, as well as thematic ETFs to pick the most widely owned stocks by the members of the US Congress. We then compared the list with Insider Monkey\u2019s proprietary database of hedge funds\u2019 ownership as of Q4 2024 and included in the article the top 10 stocks with the largest number of hedge funds that own the stock.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a global leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) and AI technologies. It designs and manufactures GPUs for gaming, professional visualization, data centers, and automotive markets, as well as system-on-a-chip units (SoCs) for mobile devices. The company\u2019s GeForce GPUs are popular in gaming, while its Tesla and A100 GPUs power AI, machine learning, and high-performance computing applications. The company also develops software platforms such as CUDA and NVIDIA Deep Learning AI to enable innovation in various industries. The US-based company ranked second on our recent list of\u00a010 Hot AI Stocks to Buy Now.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) experienced robust growth in Q4, with data center revenue rising 18% sequentially, driven by strong sales of its Hopper architecture. The company also launched its Blackwell platform, generating an impressive $11 billion in initial revenue, reflecting solid customer demand and efficient supply chain execution. Increasing demand for post-training and model conditioning \u2013 areas requiring significantly more computational power than pretraining \u2013 is driving substantial growth, as reasoning models gain importance in next-generation software solutions. NVDA continues to hold a competitive edge in networking, with anticipated growth in both the InfiniBand and Ethernet segments, as cluster sizes expand to require up to 100,000 GPUs.Software and services are another area of promising expansion for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), with enterprise adoption of NVIDIA AIE and NIMs propelling bookings to a $2 billion run rate. While concerns about competition from custom silicon persist, the company highlights the advanced complexity of its systems, which delivers superior performance and total cost of ownership benefits, keeping most customers reliant on NVDA solutions. Looking ahead, management foresees significant opportunities, pointing to a $1 trillion installed base of general-purpose computing poised for transformation to accelerated computing, alongside further advancements in AI-driven technologies. With that being said, NVDA is one of the stocks owned by the Congress.Overall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of the 10 stocks that members of Congress own. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a020 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Best Stocks To Buy Now According to BillionairesDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA (NVDA) the Top Stock to Buy According to Jericho Capital Asset Management?      Sajjl Nooranne   Mon, March 31, 2025 at 4:17 AM GMT+8 9 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of Top 10 Stocks to Buy According to Jericho Capital Asset Management. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top stocks to buy according to Jericho Capital Asset Management. Jericho Capital Asset Management, founded in 2009 by Josh Resnick, is a New York-based hedge fund manager specializing in long/short equity strategies across developed and emerging markets. Resnick established the firm with a focus on identifying market inefficiencies and capitalizing on both undervalued and overvalued securities. The investment management firm specializes in the global technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) sectors, offering a range of financial planning, advisory, and asset management services to institutional clients and high-net-worth individuals.  As an investment advisor, Jericho Capital provides discretionary investment advisory services to pooled investment vehicles, including hedge funds and private equity funds. These funds are typically structured as master-feeder funds, where feeder funds allocate their capital to a centralized master fund managed by the firm. This structure allows investors to access a diversified portfolio while benefiting from the firm\u2019s expertise in security selection. Given the speculative nature of its strategies, the firm cautions investors about the substantial risks involved, including the potential for significant or complete loss of capital. Jericho Capital employs a long/short investment strategy, aiming to generate returns by purchasing undervalued securities and short-selling overvalued ones. The firm may also pursue special opportunities strategies, which can involve distinct transaction costs and pricing structures. The success of these approaches relies heavily on the firm\u2019s ability to accurately assess market opportunities, a process that is inherently complex and subject to fluctuations. Market volatility and economic disruptions can lead to unforeseen losses, requiring the firm to make strategic adjustments to protect investor capital.  Despite the risks, Jericho Capital\u2019s approach appeals to investors seeking alternative investment strategies with the potential for high returns. By leveraging its expertise in equity markets, the firm positions itself as a key player in the hedge fund industry. While its investment styles involve substantial risks, its track record and disciplined investment framework make it a notable choice for those willing to embrace volatility in pursuit of long-term gains.   Story Continues Currently the founder and managing partner of Jericho Capital, Josh Resnick played a key role at TCS Capital before launching Jericho Capital. TCS Capital was a prominent TMT-focused hedge fund that he joined shortly after its inception in 2001. Resnick\u2019s extensive experience in finance and investment spans multiple industries, with a focus on identifying high-growth opportunities within rapidly evolving markets. Prior to his tenure at TCS Capital, Resnick served as a Managing Director at KPE Ventures, a New York-based venture capital firm dedicated to investments in media, entertainment, and technology. His expertise in business development was further honed during his time at Fox Entertainment Group in Los Angeles, where he was part of a strategic team overseeing expansion initiatives. He began his career in investment banking at Bear Stearns, working in the media and entertainment sector, where he gained critical experience in mergers, acquisitions, and corporate finance.Resnick holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics from Emory University, where he graduated Summa Cum Laude. His academic background provided a strong foundation for his career in investment management, equipping him with analytical skills essential for navigating complex financial markets. Beyond his professional achievements, Resnick is actively involved in philanthropy. He serves on the Board of Directors of the Child Mind Institute in New York City, a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting children with mental health and learning disorders. His commitment to both finance and social impact underscores his well-rounded leadership in the investment world.As of its latest filing for the fourth quarter of 2024, Jericho Capital Asset Management reported managing approximately $7 billion in 13F securities.

Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Top Stock to Buy According to Jericho Capital Asset Management?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q4: 223Jericho Capital Asset Management\u2019s\u00a0Equity Stake: $323.24 Million\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to dominate the high-performance GPU market, reporting record-breaking revenue of $39.3 billion in its most recent quarter. This marks a 12% increase from the prior quarter and a 78% year-over-year growth, largely fueled by a 93% surge in its data center segment. With AI applications driving unprecedented demand for GPUs, NVIDIA remains at the forefront of the industry, leveraging its technological edge to sustain growth.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has projected revenue of $43 billion for the April quarter, reflecting a 9% sequential increase and a 65% year-over-year jump, surpassing analysts\u2019 expectations of $42.1 billion. Despite the emergence of competitors, NVIDIA\u2019s commitment to annual GPU advancements ensures its continued dominance in AI computing. The company\u2019s focus on developing cutting-edge chips for AI workloads and data centers positions it as an indispensable player in the rapidly evolving tech landscape. As AI adoption accelerates, NVIDIA\u2019s strategic innovation and expansion efforts reinforce its long-term growth trajectory.Beyond AI, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is making strides in quantum computing through the launch of the Nvidia Accelerated Quantum Research Center (NVAQC) in Boston. This research effort underscores NVIDIA\u2019s ambition to pioneer next-generation computing technologies despite previous skepticism about the near-term feasibility of practical quantum computing. With rapid advancements in the field, NVIDIA is well-positioned to capitalize on potential breakthroughs that could redefine computational capabilities.In addition to quantum computing, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expanding into robotics through a partnership with OpenAI-backed Norwegian startup 1X. The collaboration focuses on developing autonomous humanoid robots for home use, with a recent demonstration at the Nvidia GTC conference showcasing a robot autonomously loading a dishwasher. Using NVIDIA\u2019s AI models and onboard GPUs, the humanoid robot, Neo Gamma, learned complex tasks through imitation learning, highlighting NVIDIA\u2019s growing influence in AI-powered automation. With 1X planning to test these robots in homes by year-end, NVIDIA\u2019s investment in robotics further cements its role as a leader in AI-driven innovation across multiple industries.Guinness Global Innovators stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q4 2024\u00a0investor letter:\u201cFor a second year running,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) was the Fund\u2019s top performing stock, delivering a stellar return of +177.7% over the year. Since the beginning of last year, Nvidia\u2019s \u2018Hopper\u2019 GPUs have been at the centre of exploding demand for chips powerful and efficient enough to facilitate the energy intensive requirements of AI processes within datacentres. Initially possessing over 95% of market share in these types of chips, Nvidia have been quick to entrench their position as the technological leader in the space, launching the successor to the current \u2018Hopper\u2019 GPU in March, Blackwell, inhibiting the likes of AMD and Intel making meaningful inroads in taking share of the fast-growing market. Compared to the previous iteration (Hopper) which is continuing to fuel Nvidia\u2019s extreme revenue growth, the Blackwell chip is twice as powerful for training AI models and has 5 times the capability when it comes to \u201cinference\u201d (the speed at which AI models respond to queries). Throughout the year, Nvidia\u2019s financial performance has remained resilient. Quarterly revenues hit $35.1 billion in their most recent quarter, beating consensus expectations by 6% and representing a +94% year-over-year increase. Additionally, Nvidia\u2019s data centre segment, driven by the Hopper (H100) chip, grew fivefold over the past year, underscoring the sustained demand for advanced AI infrastructure. The H100 chip, priced at around $40,000, continues to see significant adoption due to its ability to enhance AI model training efficiency while lowering overall costs. This growth is expected to continue as companies invest in upgrading existing data centres and building new ones, with Nvidia well-positioned to capture a significant share of the estimated $2 trillion market opportunity over the next five years. There have been some concerns over Blackwell production delays causing share price volatility however, Nvidia has recovered swiftly, driven by positive earnings results through the year and assurances from management regarding future supply. Additionally, the release of the H200 chip promises to extend Nvidia\u2019s technological leadership, ensuring continued momentum into 2025. While Nvidia\u2019s valuation remains a topic of debate, the stock is not at a significant premium to history, and it still appears reasonable given its dominant market position, innovative prowess, and exposure to long-term secular growth trends in AI, cloud computing, and data infrastructure. As a result, Nvidia remains well-positioned to deliver sustained outperformance over the long term, making it a cornerstone of growth-oriented portfolios.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 7th on our list of top stocks to buy according to Jericho Capital Asset Management. While we acknowledge the potential for NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Here's How Nvidia Stock Has Bounced Back From Previous Dips      Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool   March 24, 2025 5 min read              In This Article:  NVDA         Investors have grown to associate Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) with soaring stock performance -- and for good reason. The shares' climbing more than 2,000% over the past five years has helped investors generate mind-blowing returns as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom fueled growth for the AI titan, pushing revenue to record levels.  But this doesn't mean the path of Nvidia's stock price has been a straight line upward. Nvidia has experienced its fair share of dips along the way -- and one of those is happening right now. The stock has slipped 16% over the past month, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has fallen into correction territory, losing 10% from its latest high in December amid concerns about the impact of President Trump's tariffs. Investors worry that higher prices on imported goods will put pressure on corporate earnings and the consumer's purse. And that's prompted a shift out of high-growth stocks, at least for the moment. Now, the big question is how long shares of market star Nvidia will remain in the doldrums. Let's gather a few clues by considering how Nvidia stock has bounced back from previous declines.   Image source: Getty Images.   The Nvidia of yesterday and the Nvidia of today Nvidia went public quite a while ago, back in 1999, and at the modest price of $12 per share. Back then, the company's business revolved around serving the video games and graphics market with its high-powered chips. The company has evolved quite a bit since. It still designs these chips, known as graphics processing units (GPUs), but in recent years, it's been selling them and related products and services to many industries. And AI has become the company's biggest growth driver, with data center revenue making up almost 90% of total revenue in the most recent quarter.  Considering all this, it's most useful to look at Nvidia's performance after previous dips in recent years -- when the company, though smaller, resembled the Nvidia of today. So, with this in mind, let's look at the down periods as of 2018. The tech giant's shares slipped in 2018 amid concerns about tariffs Trump planned during his first term and as demand for graphics cards used in cryptocurrency mining fell, weighing on Nvidia's revenue growth. The stock declined 31% for the year, with losses primarily in the last three months. Nvidia rebounded as of January 2019, and while the stock dipped periodically, it gained for the full year.   NVDA data by YCharts.   Nvidia's triple-digit gain In February and March 2020, Nvidia stock slid with most of the market during the COVID-19 market crash, but the shares advanced as of April, finishing the year with an increase of 121%. The AI boom was already starting to supercharge the company's growth, with data center revenue advancing 124% in the fiscal year.   Story Continues   NVDA data by YCharts.  Nvidia had a tough time in 2022, along with the Nasdaq, as higher inflation and rising interest rates weighed on growth companies and investors sought stocks less sensitive to economic shifts. The tech giant lost 50% that year, underperforming the Nasdaq.  NVDA data by YCharts.  But as of 2023, Nvidia started its meteoric rise, and from that time through the end of last year, it soared more than 800%. This is as earnings skyrocketed, with revenue and net income both increasing in the triple digits to record levels on a quarterly basis. The AI boom had gained momentum, and Nvidia was benefiting.Rewarding patient investorsSo, as we look at this history of performance, it's pretty clear that Nvidia has generally recovered quickly from difficult times. Even after a bad year, such as 2022, the company went on to more than make up for it. This shows us that Nvidia hasn't slumped for very long in the past, and when it has, it's still rewarded investors over the long run.Does this mean recent declines in Nvidia stock will be short-lived? History suggests that could be the case, but it's important to remember that while history has been known to repeat itself, it doesn't do so in every situation. If general economic uncertainties or pressure continue, Nvidia and other growth players may not be ready to rebound any time soon.The good news, though, is Nvidia's long-term growth prospects remain strong. The AI market is set for explosive growth, tech giants continue to invest billions of dollars in Nvidia's products and services, and Nvidia's focus on innovation should ensure its leadership position. So, even if Nvidia stock struggles longer than we'd like, this top AI player still has what it takes to excel -- from an earnings and stock performance perspective -- over the long term.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Upgrade Now          Analyst Sees \u2018Sign of Momentum\u2019 for NVIDIA (NVDA), Says It\u2019s \u2018Best of Breed\u2019      Fahad Saleem   March 19, 2025 7 min read        3   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of Top 10 Stocks Everyone is Talking About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top stocks everyone is talking about. Investors are on tenterhooks amid the latest selloff as they keep up with President Donald Trump\u2019s volatile tariff policies and assess the slowing enthusiasm in the AI trade. Trivariate\u2019s Adam Parker said in a latest program on CNBC that while he wants to be bullish on the stocks for a rebound, he believes we haven\u2019t seen the bottom yet. The analyst recommends going on the defense: \u201cI mean every part of me wants to get bullish again, right? You know, we had the good call of saying the market will be down in the first half and choppy with concerns about tariffs and all that. And you know, now we\u2019ve seen a lot of people who were bullish before throwing in the towel and getting bearish, and I really want to do it, right? But I can\u2019t. And the reason is because I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen enough of a blowoff on the positioning. I mean, if you look at the companies that were talking at big conferences in March, a lot of things are slowing. And so I think this is more than a growth scare already\u2014this is actually like a growth slowdown. And so the question is, will we get negative guidance in April? Will we see companies guide down and the stocks not go down? If I see that behavior, then I\u2019ll probably want to get more risk on. But until then, I think we have to play a little bit more defense.\u201d  READ ALSO:\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 stocks Wall Street analysts are showing interest in. With each stock, we have mentioned their hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).   Analyst Sees \u2018Sign of Momentum\u2019 for NVIDIA (NVDA), Says It\u2019s \u2018Best of Breed\u2019   NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Funds Investors: 193 LikeFolio\u202c\u2019s Megan Brantley said in a latest program on Schwab Network that her data shows an increased consumer interest in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) products and she believes the company is gaining momentum: \u201cI think that Nvidia has performed so well it\u2019s natural for investors to say, \u201cOkay, how much can this growth keep going at this pace, and at what point is this overvalued?\u201d At these levels, we can look at things and the places that we can look for Nvidia are overall consumer demand. So, are people continuing to talk about Nvidia and its products\u2014specifically its Blackwell line\u2014at a higher rate, and are they visiting sites and showing signs of forward-looking interest for Nvidia? So far, at least in our metrics, they are. We see Nvidia web visits up by about 22% year-over-year, and this is actually accelerating if you look at this on a 30-day moving average versus a 90-day moving average. What\u2019s impressive about this for us is that this is just a sign of momentum. For us, this tells us that demand is continuing to outpace supply. We look at this too, and what\u2019s crazy is that Nvidia already has a really significant market share versus other players in this field, yet its growth rate remains the highest. It is nice to see AMD start to gain some traction there as well when it comes to consumer interests, but Nvidia is already the largest player in the game and it\u2019s just extending its lead. So I think as an investor, that\u2019s really powerful to know that this is the best of breed. At least on our end, the chatter and discussions related to its products continue to grow.\u201d    Story Continues However, web visits does not seem like a good indicator to gauge Nvidia AI chips demand.The market will keep punishing Nvidia for not coming up to its gigantic (and sometimes unrealistic) growth expectations. About 50% of the company\u2019s revenue comes from large cloud providers, which are rethinking their plans amid the DeepSeek launch and looking for low-cost chips. Nvidia\u2019s Q1 guidance shows a 9.4% QoQ revenue growth, down from the previous 12% QoQ growth. Its adjusted margin is expected to be down substantially as well to 71%. Market does not like when Nvidia fails to post a strong quarterly beat. The stock will remain under pressure in the coming quarters when the company will report unimpressive growth.Nvidia is facing challenges at several levels. Competition is one of them. Major competitors like Apple, Qualcomm, and AMD are vying for TSMC\u2019s 3nm capacity, which could limit Nvidia\u2019s access to these chips. Why? Because Nvidia also uses\u00a0 TSMC\u2019s 3nm process nodes. Nvidia is also facing direct competition from other giants that are deciding to make their own chips. Amazon, with its Trainium2 AI chips, offer alternatives. Trainium2 chips could provide cost savings and superior computational power, which could shift AI workloads away from Nvidia\u2019s offerings. Apple is reportedly working with Broadcom to develop an AI server processor. Intel is also trying hard to get back into the game with Jaguar Shores GPU process, set to be produced on its 18A or 14A node.RiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q4 2024 investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA): NVDA was a top contributor in the fourth quarter following blowout 1Q results and guidance driven by strong data center sales (+427% year-over-year). The company reported revenue of $26 billion, up 262% year-over-year, and EPS of $6.12, up 462% year-over-year and 9% ahead of expectations. Revenue guidance for 2Q of $28 billion was 5% above very high expectations. The artificial intelligence arms race, kicked off by ChatGPT and Alphabet\u2019s Bard, among others, has generated tremendous demand for Nvidia\u2019s next generation graphic processors. Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of top stocks everyone is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to BillionairesDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          32-Year-Old Investor With Massive NVDA Gains And $350K Cash Asks Reddit: 'What's Stopping Me From Putting It All In SCHD?'      Paula Tudoran   March 21, 2025 5 min read        15   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   RDDT   +4.91%    NVDA   +1.63%     ^GSPC   +0.38%      Investors are often driven by the pursuit of massive gains and few assets capture this ambition better than individual stocks\u2013like Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2013that have seen a meteoric climb. For many, high returns from individual stocks and/or options trading are irresistible because such investments can turn a modest sum of money into life-changing wealth.  This is the case of a 32-year-old ex-military who made $700,000 in options trading but is unsure of what to do next. After hitting it big, the investor is wondering whether he should double down on high-risk strategies, or pivot to more stable, long-term investments, so he\u2019s taken to Reddit to seek advice. Don't Miss: Hasbro, MGM Resorts, and Sketchers Use this Pre-IO AI Marketing Firm \u2014 and You Can Own a Piece of it From $0.55/Share Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share.  With 4,200 shares of NVDA at a cost basis of $69 and $350,000 in cash, he is at a crossroads. His end goal is to preserve and grow his wealth while minimizing risk because he thinks his options trading run may be coming to an end. Still, he isn\u2019t sure about what to do next.   32-Year-Old Investor With Massive NVDA Gains And $350K Cash Asks Reddit: 'What's Stopping Me From Putting It All In SCHD?'   \u201cI was in the military but I started trading options and just did that for a few years. I think my run is at the end, though. Finishing school and getting a job now in the next year. I've been waiting for a pullback, unsure when to hop in. Kinda just wanna be done with it,\u201d he wrote. He asked whether he should put all his money in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSE:SCHD), which is known for its focus on high-quality dividend-oriented stocks. The community offered plenty of suggestions so let\u2019s analyze the comments and distill the most relevant advice below. Trending: This Startup Is On The Brink Of A Huge Disruption To The $654 Billion Industry \u2013 Invest In It Before It Fulfills 800 Pre-Orders $350,000 in SCHD? Reddit Assesses His Plan and Gives Suggestions Avoid Putting All Your Money in One Asset One of the most prevalent advice in the comments was to avoid putting all the money into a single investment\u2013SCHD in this case\u2013and diversify the portfolio into several assets. \u201cAt age 32, I think you should consider a mix of SCHD, [Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (NYSE: SCHG)], and perhaps [Schwab International Equity ETF (NYSE: SCHF)]. Perhaps 45/45/10 or 50/45/5,\u201d a Redditor advised. A commenter suggested the investor a mix of growth and dividend-paying investments, as well as international exposure.   Story Continues \u201cPersonally though, I\u2019d put $50,000 to $100,000 into ex-U.S. markets. [Vanguard International High Dividend Yield ETF (NASDAQ: VYMI)], [Legg Mason International Low Volatility High Dividend ETF (NASDAQ: LVHI)], [Franklin International Core Dividend Tilt Index ETF (NYSE: DIVI)] are a few dividend-focused options,\u201d he said.Recommending a mix of individual stocks, ETFs, and dividend-paying assets, this Reddit user provided a detailed illustration of how diversification can be achieved in a portfolio.\u201c$50,000 [Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: VOO)], $50,000 growth stocks like [Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)], NVDA, and others, $50,000 SCHD, $50,000 [JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ: JEPQ)], $50,000 [JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSE: JEPI)], $50,000 [Simplify Volatility Premium ETF (NYSE: SVOL)], $50,000 ([Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE)], and other dividend stocks),\u201d his suggestion reads.\u201cAt 30, SCHG 50% VOO 50%,\u201d another comment says.See Also: Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!Consider Tax Efficiency and Long-Term GrowthAnother recurring theme in the thread was the importance of tax efficiency and the possible drawbacks of focusing only on dividend income, with many Redditors suggesting that dividend-paying ETFs might not be the best option when it comes to taxes.\u201cDumping $350,000 in there is a monumentally terrible idea. SCHD underperforms the S&P 500 with dividends reinvested and not even counting the extra tax drag. You\u2019d be creating more taxable income for yourself which is a terrible strategy. You want to minimize income and maximize net worth. Dumping all of your capital into something paying income is the opposite of what you should be doing,\u201d a Reddit user wrote.A Redditor suggested to the investor several other options that he says would yield more returns than SCHD.\u201cSCHD is a good fund, but is it best for you? With $350,000 invested, it will produce about $12,000 a year. Instead, $350,000 invested in [iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF (NASDAQ: PFF)] with a 6% yield, would earn you about $21,000 a year. Or you could invest in [business development companies] using [Putnam BDC Income ETF (NYSE: PBDC)] and earn $31,000. Or [NEOS Nasdaq-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ: QQQI)] with a 23% yield and earn $45,000,\u201d the commenter said.\u201cSCHD 30%, VOO 20%, [Realty Income Corporation (NYSE: O)] 14%, [PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP)] 14%, [Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE: EPD)] 12%, [Ares Capital Corporation (NASDAQ: ARCC)] 10%,\u201d a user recommended.Read Next:It\u2019s no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $250 million in art \u2014 this alternative asset has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia stock sinks 5% amid tech rout, report on China environmental guidelines      Ines Ferr\u00e9   \u00b7 Senior Business Reporter  Thu, March 27, 2025 at 4:08 AM GMT+8 2 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       Nvidia (NVDA) stock fell more than 5% on Wednesday as a new report suggested Chinese environmental rules could impact the AI giant's sales in China. The decline came amid a broader sell-off in tech stocks on fears of an escalating trade war. Nvidia shares sank after the Financial Times reported Chinese regulators are encouraging firms to use data center chips that meet strict environmental requirements. The guidelines exclude Nvidia's H20 chip, its processor compatible with US export controls for the Chinese market. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    110.15 +1.77 (+1.63%)  At close: 4:00:00 PM EDT  109.37 -0.78 (-0.71%) Pre-Market: 5:42:06 AM EDT   Advanced Chart    In response to the report, a Nvidia spokesperson said, \"Our products provide superb energy efficiency and value in every market we serve. As technology moves rapidly, export control policy should be adjusted to allow U.S. firms to offer the most energy efficient products possible, while still achieving the Administration's national security goals.\" The report comes amid escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing after the US imposed additional tariffs on Chinese goods since President Donald Trump took office. Export curbs on advanced semiconductor technologies have also been a sore point between the two countries.  Read more: The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs Also on Wednesday, TD Cowen analysts said Microsoft (MSFT) canceled new data center projects in the US and Europe, a move that heightened investor fears that Big Tech may pull back on artificial intelligence spending. However, the analysts said, \"Positively for third-party data center operators, our checks point to Google (GOOG) stepping into backfill capacity that Microsoft walked away from in international markets, while our checks point to Meta (META) backfilling capacity in the U.S.\" The analysis follows a note from TD Cowen in February stating Microsoft recently canceled an unspecified number of data center leases.   Nasdaq 100 chart at 12:00 p.m. ET on March 26.   Nvidia led the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks lower on Wednesday, cutting short a recent rebound in the sector after the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) entered correction territory earlier this month. Tech stocks have led a broader market sell-off this year as investors weigh the impact of the Trump administration's tariff policy on the economy. Read more: How does Nvidia make money? Fears of an overvaluation in the AI trade sent Nvidia tumbling in late January after Chinese startup DeepSeek launched a chatbot, reportedly with fewer resources than its US rivals. Renewed fears of an overextended AI trade surfaced earlier this month after chipmaker Marvell Technology's (MRVL) revenue outlook failed to impress investors, and semiconductor stocks fell.   Story Continues Year to date, Nvidia is down roughly 15%.  A sign displayed on a Nvidia building in Santa Clara, Calif.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA): One of Philippe Laffont Stock Portfolio\u2019s Top 10 Stock Picks      Bob Karr   March 26, 2025 6 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of Philippe Laffont Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks of Philippe Laffont's Stock Portfolio. Founded by Philippe Laffont,\u00a0Coatue Management\u00a0is a lifecycle investment platform\u00a0that is focused on turning big ideas into world-shaping technology companies. Laffont established Coatue Management in 1999 and has earlier gained experience as a \u201cTiger Cub\u201d while working at Julian Robertson\u2019s Tiger Management hedge fund. The company makes investments across public and private markets and has a focus on technology, media, consumer, telecommunications and healthcare sectors. The company\u2019s lifecycle investment platform expanded across venture, growth, thematic, and structured capital strategies. Coatue\u2019s Investment Approach The company\u2019s investment philosophy revolves around a technology-centric approach. This approach stems from the belief that technological innovation is the key factor fueling economic growth and it possesses the potential to disrupt traditional sectors. \u00a0As investors, the company tends to focus on seeking out the greatest innovators with the biggest ideas. The company has recently announced its continued deep partnership with Norm Ai by leading the latest investment. Norm Ai focuses on enabling regulated businesses to reap the benefits of the GenAI, with their government-grade regulatory AI product. Overall, the mission is to enable companies to do more, and yet maintain robust compliance scrutiny.

Industrial Base is Expected to Transform, says Coatue As per Coatue, for the much of 20th\u00a0century, the defense sector was responsible for technological breakthroughs \u2013 from the internet to GPS. However, in recent decades, its role as a key driver of innovation has diminished. That being said, the investment management firm said that the US industrial base is at a pivotal moment. \u00a0A wave of innovation has been emerging, fueled by new government initiatives, groundbreaking technologies, and an urgent need for modernization. The defense sector, which was once a sector not suitable for startups and innovators, is now opening. The firm believes that organizations and instruments, such as the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and Other Transaction Authorities (OTA), continue to accelerate the pace of partnerships between the government and private companies.   Story Continues The disruptors believe that even the most entrenched systems could be transformed with the help of innovation, placing new standards for agility, cost-efficiency, and impact, says the investment firm. Overall, it expects the industrial base of the future to revolve around unmanned/autonomous systems, nuclear-powered energy, robotic manufacturing, and a completely new space economy.Amidst these trends, we will now have a look at the Philippe Laffont Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks.Our MethodologyTo list the Philippe Laffont Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks, we selected the top 10 stocks in Coatue Management\u2019s portfolio as per its Q4 2024 13F filing. We settled on the hedge fund\u2019s 10 biggest holdings. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on the value of Coatue Management\u2019s equity stakes. Additionally, we have mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q4 2024.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).  NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA): One of Philippe Laffont Stock Portfolio's Top 10 Stock Picks  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Coatue Management\u2019s Stake Value: $1.34 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 223NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on chips as well as several other electronics made in the US. This is expected to happen over the next 4 years, with the company shifting its supply chain back from Asia, reported FT. NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s Chief Executive Jensen Huang\u00a0told the FT that the latest chips which are designed by the company, and Nvidia-powered servers for data centers, could be now produced at the US-based factories. As per Huang, this happens to be a big step forward in supply chain resilience.Elsewhere,\u00a0UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri affirmed a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s stock, with a price objective of $185.00. The analyst observed that sovereign AI, which means AI initiatives led by national governments, remains an overlooked factor that can fuel demand for AI infrastructure.\u00a0Several countries continue to invest in the development of their own AI models as well as applications in a bid to avoid reliance on a few major foundation model developers, primarily located in the US. Overall, the analyst\u2019s comments hint at the significant opportunity for NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA), as the company remains well-positioned to address the expanding global demand for AI infrastructure fueled by sovereign AI initiatives.Columbia Threadneedle Investments, an investment management company, released its Q4 2024 investor letter.\u00a0Here\u00a0is what the fund said:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to outperform the market during the fourth quarter. The technology giant and top position in the fund delivered on sky-high expectations during the quarter and reported quarterly expectations that exceeded expectations. The red-hot company provided forward-looking expectations which were regarded as slightly lackluster as compared to prior quarters that smashed expectations. While the stock did churn a bit in the quarter, the AI giant remains top of mind for investors, especially as the company is on pace to satisfy the \u2018staggering\u2019 demand for its new product, Blackwell, which is poised to enter the market over the next year. The company\u2019s position of owning all the major pieces of the evolving AI data center enables it to strengthen its competitive position and to define the technology roadmap for generations to come.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 7th on our list of top 10 stock picks of Philippe Laffont's stock portfolio. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a020 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to BillionairesDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          3 Cheap Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now      Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool   Thu, March 27, 2025 at 5:50 PM GMT+8 5 min read        1   In This Article:  NVDA       GOOG       TSM         While the broader stock market has bounced back somewhat following its recent sell-off, many tech stocks are still well off their highs and trading at cheap valuations. Let's look at three cheap tech stocks you can buy right now. 1. Nvidia Trading down almost 23% from its highs, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is an attractively valued growth stock. The company has been able to more than double its revenue each of the past two years, while analysts expect the company's revenue to increase by more than 50% this year. Despite that, Nvidia's stock only trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of under 27 times this year's analyst estimates and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) under 0.5. Stocks with PEGs below 1 are usually considered undervalued, so a PEG of 0.5 certainly puts Nvidia in value territory.  Nvidia's chips have become the backbone of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, and it has developed a wide moat through its CUDA software platform. As such, how Nvidia's stock performs moving forward will largely be dependent on how AI infrastructure continues to develop. Right now, spending is still on the rise. The big three cloud computing companies are all increasing their AI-related capital expenditure (capex) budgets this year, while a consortium of companies led by OpenAI and Softbank also plan a massive data center buildout over the next few years. For its part, Nvidia management sees data center capex topping $1 trillion by 2028. As long as AI infrastructure spending continues to ramp up, Nvidia is a cheap stock that investors should look to buy right now.   Image source: Getty Images.   2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Another cheap tech stock to buy right now is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), or TSMC for short. The stock is also down about 22% from its highs and now trades at a forward P/E of 20 times and a PEG of 0.7. Like Nvidia, TSMC is a big winner from the AI infrastructure buildout, as well as the proliferation of semiconductors being used more and more in devices we use every day, like automobiles, appliances, and smartphones. The company is the leading semiconductor contract manufacturer in the world, where it has a commanding market share for making advanced chips.  The company has become an integral partner to its customers, including Nvidia and Apple, given its technological expertise. TSMC has continued to increase chip density, which means its customers can design more powerful chips with lower power consumption. This has also allowed TSMC to increase its prices, leading to expanding gross margins.   Story Continues Right now, the company is investing heavily to increase capacity to meet surging demand. The combination of capacity growth, pricing power, and margin expansion make TSMC a bargain growth stock at current levels.3. AlphabetWith its stock trading nearly 19% below its highs, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is another cheap tech stock. Its forward P/E is just above 18.5 times.The company is the leader in search, commanding around 90% of the market share. Meanwhile, AI is a potential opportunity, as its Google search engine uses the technology to improve search results while also offering AI overviews for certain search queries. The company should have a nice opportunity to eventually monetize these AI overviews through new ad formats, as it has both a huge user base as well as an ad partner network.\u00a0In fact, the company is already the largest digital advertising company in the world, and both Google and YouTube are two of the biggest platforms. It serves ads on third-party sites as well.Alphabet also owns a number of other promising businesses and is in the process of adding fast-growing cybersecurity company Wiz to its fold as well. Its cloud computing business, Google Cloud, is the most prominent of these businesses, where it is seeing strong growth as it helps customers develop their own AI models and applications using its Gemini foundation model. The company also developed its own AI chip to help improve inference times and lower costs.The Wiz acquisition will add an additional way Google Cloud differentiates itself from the competition, by offering top-notch cloud detection and response (CDR) security. The cybersecurity company has been growing quickly, and that should continue, especially with Alphabet providing many cross-sell opportunities.In addition, Alphabet has been leading the way in the autonomous driving market with Waymo. While it's taken awhile for the ride hail service to catch on in its home market of San Francisco, it has begun to gain market share since last year. Waymo has plans to enter Atlanta this year and Miami next year and is beginning tests in other U.S. cities.Finally, the company is at the forefront of quantum computing, where it made a big breakthrough with its Willow chip last year. While quantum computing is still a long way off, this adds even more long-term optionality to Alphabet's stock.Altogether, Alphabet has one of the most attractive collections of market-leading and emerging businesses out there.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop. If you\u2019re worried you\u2019ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it\u2019s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:Nvidia:\u00a0if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009,\u00a0you\u2019d have $312,980!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you\u2019d have $42,421!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you\u2019d have $537,825!* Right now, we\u2019re issuing \u201cDouble Down\u201d alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.Continue \u00bb*Stock Advisor returns as of March 24, 2025Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA (NVDA) the Top Stock to Buy According to Marshall Wace LLP?      Sajjl Nooranne   March 20, 2025 6 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of Top 10 Stocks to Buy According to Marshall Wace LLP. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top stocks to buy according to Marshall Wace LLP. Marshall Wace LLP\u00a0is a prominent British hedge fund established in 1997 by Paul Marshall and Ian Wace. Headquartered in London, the firm has grown to become one of the world\u2019s leading hedge funds. The firm operates as a unified global team, dedicated to fostering long-term client relationships built on trust and integrity, with a culture centered on continuous innovation and improvement.  Sir Paul Roderick Clucas Marshall, known simply as Paul Marshall, serves as the chairman and chief investment officer of Marshall Wace. Born in London, England, he studied history and modern languages at St John\u2019s College, Oxford before earning an MBA from INSEAD Business School in Fontainebleau, France. Prior to co-founding Marshall Wace, Marshall was the Head of European Equities at Mercury Asset Management. Beyond finance, Marshall is best known as a philanthropist and media baron. He expanded his influence into media by owning UnHerd and The Spectator and co-owning GB News. His philanthropic efforts are equally notable; he was named the top donor on The Sunday Times Giving List in 2024 after donating a hefty sum to various causes including the London School of Economics to establish the Marshall Institute. He was knighted in the 2016 Birthday Honours for his contributions to education and philanthropy. Politically, Marshall was initially a member and donor of the Liberal Democrats, co-editing the influential Orange Book in 2004 alongside key party figures. However, his stance shifted in 2015 when he left the party due to his support for Brexit. He later became a major donor to the Brexit campaign and the Conservative Party. His ownership of UnHerd and GB News has positioned him as a significant right-wing media figure in the UK.  Ian Gerald Patrick Wace serves as the firm\u2019s chief executive officer and chief risk officer. Despite not holding a college degree, he has achieved exceptional success in the finance industry, earning recognition as \u201cperhaps the only person without a college degree to ever qualify\u201d for Institutional Investor\u2019s Rich List. Wace began his career at S.G. Warburg & Co., where he spent 11 years and became the firm\u2019s youngest director at the age of 25. His rapid ascent continued as he was appointed head of European equity sales in 1988, head of proprietary trading in 1993, and head of international trading in 1994. In 1995, he joined Deutsche Morgan Grenfell as head of equity and derivative trading, further establishing his expertise in the financial sector before co-founding Marshall Wace in 1997.   Story Continues Marshall Wace LLP manages quantitative, systematic, and fundamental investment strategies, with a primary focus on long/short equity. These strategies are implemented on a global scale, utilizing proprietary systems and processes to optimize performance. For over two decades, technology and data have been central to the firm\u2019s operations. In 2002, Marshall Wace introduced MW TOPS, its Trade Optimized Portfolio System and the world\u2019s first \u2018Alpha Capture\u2019 application. This revolutionized the way investment insights were harnessed and contributed largely to its prominence in the hedge fund industry. Today, the firm remains committed to innovation and excellence, continuously refining its methodologies to maintain a competitive edge in the financial markets. Despite its success, Marshall Wace has faced recent challenges; in the fiscal year ending February 2024, the firm\u2019s revenues declined substantially, leading to a nearly 64% drop in profits.Marshall Wace LLP\u2019s Q4 2024 13F filing reported over $83 billion in managed 13F securities, with its top 10 holdings accounting for 34.5% of the total portfolio.Our MethodologyThe stocks discussed below were picked from Marshall Wace LLP\u2019s Q4 2024 13F filings.

To assist readers with more context, we have included the hedge fund sentiment regarding each stock using data from over 1,000 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Top Stock to Buy According to Marshall Wace LLP?  Paul Marshall of Marshall WaceNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q4: 223Marshall Wace LLP\u2019s Equity Stake: $1.70 Billion\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to dominate the AI chip industry, holding an 80% market share and maintaining its position as the go-to supplier for the world\u2019s leading tech companies. Despite its high GPU prices, demand for its latest Blackwell architecture has outpaced supply, further solidifying its market control. This dominance has fueled remarkable financial growth, with the company consistently delivering double and triple-digit revenue increases. In its most recent quarter, Nvidia reported a record-breaking $39.3 billion in revenue, marking a 12% sequential increase and an extraordinary 78% year-over-year growth, primarily driven by a 93% increase in its data center segment.Despite its financial strength, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s stock has exhibited volatility, declining 16% year to date and 27% from its peak, even after surpassing Q4 earnings expectations. The AI sector\u2019s rapid evolution, along with concerns over tariffs, regulatory restrictions, and cost-cutting advancements in computing, has created uncertainty in the market. However, investor sentiment could shift as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) prepares for its highly anticipated GTC conference on March 18, where CEO Jensen Huang is expected to unveil key developments that could serve as a catalyst for the stock.Looking ahead, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, forecasting revenue of $43 billion for the April quarter\u2014a 9% sequential increase and a 65% rise year-over-year. This outlook surpasses analyst expectations of $42.1 billion, reinforcing the company\u2019s ability to drive AI demand and sustain growth despite external pressures. While some investors worry about potential slowdowns due to rising competition, Nvidia\u2019s commitment to annual GPU updates and continuous innovation makes it difficult for rivals to capture significant market share.Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of top stocks to buy according to Marshall Wace LLP. While we acknowledge the potential for NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to BillionairesDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          \u201cOwn It, Don\u2019t Trade It!\u201d \u2013 Jim Cramer\u2019s Take on Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)\u2019s AI Domination      Dionysis Partsinevelos   March 20, 2025 3 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of Was Jim Cramer Right About These 13 Stocks? In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. During the latest episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer expressed his frustration over the negative outlook he believes the White House is projecting about the economy. He explained that while he felt a sense of optimism and wanted to get excited about positive developments in the stock market, he held back. \u201cI wanted to get excited, but you know what I had to do? I had to hold my breath because when this market\u2019s getting ahead of steam going, you know what you can bet on? The president will post something rancorous, dispiriting, and confusing and the market will immediately get put through the meat grinder\u2026  Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 13 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on March 21, 2024. We then calculated their performance from March 21, 2024, market close to March 13th, 2025, market close. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment for the stocks, which we sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database of over 900 hedge funds. The stocks are listed in the order that Cramer mentioned them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).   \"Own It, Don\u2019t Trade It!\" - Jim Cramer\u2019s Take on Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)'s AI Domination   A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 224 At the time, Cramer was as bullish as ever on Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), urging investors to own the stock, not trade it. He marveled at the company\u2019s dominance in AI, saying: \u201cWe can go to any trade show like the one we went to early this week in Nvidia where we saw the future and we saw how we can own a piece of it. The ripple effects were everywhere today as Nvidia spread pixie dust throughout the averages.\u201d    Story Continues Since the episode aired last March, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has gained 26.41%.Cramer remains supportive of the stock. Here\u2019s what he said on the 13th\u00a0of March:\u201cAnd then a simple one, \u2018I hear Nvidia\u2019s got the Woodstock of Al, can\u2019t wait to hear that Jensen keynote. He\u2019s a COOL guy. I hear he\u2019s a great cook, too. Renaissance man.\u2019\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 13th on our list of\u00a0stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to BillionairesDisclosure: None.

This performance coincides with the company's ongoing strategic partnerships and technological advances. Fluidstack's deployment of Exascale clusters using NVIDIA technologies across Europe and Kasm Technologies' introduction of NVIDIA-powered AI Workspaces illustrate the company's significant collaborations in the AI sector. Meanwhile, macroeconomic influences, such as the broader market uptick in the Nasdaq and minor fluctuations in the S&P 500, provide additional context to NVIDIA's price movement. Amid a general upward market trend of 1.8% over the last week, NVIDIA's developments in AI application continue to position it prominently within the sector. Be aware that NVIDIA is showing 2 possible red flags in our investment analysis and 1 of those is concerning.   NasdaqGS:NVDA Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025   These 14 companies survived and thrived after COVID and have the right ingredients to survive Trump's tariffs. Discover why before your portfolio feels the trade war pinch. Over the last five years, NVIDIA's shares have achieved a total return of 1735.27%, showcasing a very large appreciation, driven by its continued influence in the AI and technology sectors. The company's overall returns well outpaced the US market's performance over the past year, illustrating its robust trajectory.  Several corporate moves and technological advancements played a role in NVIDIA\u2019s remarkable growth. Noteworthy is the partnership with Toyota and Uber, enhancing AI capabilities in the automotive sector (March 2025). Additionally, NVIDIA's launch of the Blackwell series GPUs (March 2025) and the collaboration with Google Quantum AI (December 2024) exemplify its commitment to innovation. These efforts were further supported by strong financial results, such as the increase in full-year sales to US$130.5 billion as of January 2025. Furthermore, the extensive stock buyback program totaling US$62.55 billion by January 2025 reflects confidence in long-term growth potential.

Upgrade Now          Jim Cramer Calls NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) a \u201cWhipping Boy\u201d Amid Market Turmoil      Syeda Seirut Javed   Sun, March 30, 2025 at 4:16 AM GMT+8 5 min read        1   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 9 Stocks Recently. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. On Wednesday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, took a closer look at the state of the market and the stocks that saw gains and losses that day. \u201cIt\u2019s time to praise the winners, the ones that don\u2019t need to wait until April 2nd to find out whether their business will be slammed by tariffs when President Trump announces whose earnings will be cut and who stay the same in a host of industries because tariffs are like taxes and they can cut deep into profits. Today, it all came together even as the averages got hit.\u201d  READ ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 7 Stocks in Focus\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Recently Put These 10 Stocks Under Spotlight He noted that Wall Street, for the most part, chose to rally around domestic companies, especially those in the service sector. The trend, according to Cramer, made sense after the president revealed a 25% tariff on all cars made outside the U.S. The news came after the market closed, and while some had anticipated tariff increases, few had expected such a severe measure.  Cramer noted that he even predicted earlier in the day that it might happen, but he did not find many who agreed with him. Now, with a new tariff on 7.38 million cars coming into the U.S., he suggested it would create a significant disruption in the global market, possibly starting that very evening. Despite the uncertainties caused by these new tariffs, Cramer pointed out that there could still be winners in such a situation once the dust settles. He referenced the S&P leaderboard, highlighting stocks that had shown resilience. He added: \u201cI bet the data center build-out continues to pace, but very few people believe right now in my view. We\u2019re in a curious moment here where any reassurances that the industrial revolution of AI is still on just won\u2019t cut it. Every single stock in the sector is being mauled by the bears.\u201d  Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 9 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on March 26. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).   Story Continues   Jim Cramer Calls NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) a \"Whipping Boy\" Amid Market Turmoil  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223Cramer pointed out that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was at the center of the recent market turmoil, which was reflected in its nearly 6% drop on the day. He noted that the company was the most affected by the events that unfolded. He went on to say:\u201cLet\u2019s start with the White House. There has been a feeling among executives that strictures put on by President Biden against NVIDIA when he did it right on the way out, once that limited the countries that NVIDIA could sell its best chips to, they might be lifted by President Trump. Now all day, I\u2019m hearing that that\u2019s wrong\u2026. This morning, the Financial Time penned a story saying that NVIDIA\u2019s chips somehow ran afoul of Chinese pollution controls\u2026.. It sounded like the typical journalist hit job against NVIDIA\u2026. Nevertheless, along with the rumor, the White House slap down, well, you could expect a stock to get hit.\u201d Cramer reaffirmed his belief in the importance of NVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs in the AI-driven industrial revolution, stating his stance on the company has not changed. However, he also predicted that the stock could continue to decline, noting he has been saying it for some time. He added:\u201cIt\u2019s become a whipping boy, I\u2019ve been saying that. It\u2019ll only get worse with tonight\u2019s tariffs\u2026 I think the stock trades like a wavy inflatable tube man, also known as an air dancer\u2026. My advice, if you think NVIDIA\u2019s cheap and\u2026 the data center, the chief home of NVIDIA chips is spent, well then what? You know, there\u2019s nothing wrong with owning a tube man. Except when you see a move south like this, you have to give it some room. Overall, NVDA ranks 9th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA (NVDA): Among the Best Tech Stocks to Buy According to Goldman Sachs      Soma Dutta   March 25, 2025 5 min read        3   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: 10 Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top Goldman Sachs tech stocks to buy. The technology sector delivered a strong performance in 2024, driven by chip companies, which played a pivotal role in supporting artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. Despite a slowdown in the second half of the year due to concerns over high valuations and the AI development timeline, technology remained one of the best-performing sectors as of mid-December. According to Goldman Sachs Research, as of September 2024, U.S. technology stocks have not entered a financial bubble, despite their rapid ascent fueled by AI enthusiasm. Instead, their growth has been underpinned by strong financial fundamentals, with the global tech sector\u2019s earnings per share rising by approximately 400% since the Great Financial Crisis, far outpacing the broader market.  However, 2025 has presented new challenges for tech stocks. As of March 5, the Information Technology and Communication Services sectors declined by 4.42%, weighing down the broader index. Market volatility has particularly impacted the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d tech giants, which collectively lost approximately $2.7 trillion in market value over 50 days. On March 18th, Reuters reported that major U.S. indices, experienced further declines due to economic uncertainties and Federal Reserve policy expectations, reinforcing concerns about tech sector stability. Despite short-term headwinds, the broader technology outlook remains positive. Deloitte\u2019s 2025 Technology Industry Outlook projects a 9.3% increase in global IT spending, with data center and software segments anticipated to achieve double-digit growth. AI spending is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 29% through 2028, indicating strong long-term demand. A 2024 Morgan Stanley analysis further suggests that hedge funds have increasingly added long positions in technology, media, and telecom (TMT) stocks, particularly in the semiconductor and software sectors, reflecting continued institutional confidence.  While AI-driven investments initially centered on data center infrastructure, Goldman Sachs analysts predict a shift toward software companies as AI monetization matures. The focus is expected to transition from AI model training to inferencing, where applications generate revenue, leading to further software sector expansion. Despite emerging AI competitors such as DeepSeek, major cloud computing and tech firms are ramping up AI-related capital expenditures in pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI).   Story Continues Nevertheless, investors should prepare for further market volatility. Reuters reports that hedge funds exited U.S. tech and media stocks at the fastest pace in six months by February 21, reflecting shifting institutional strategies. Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s portfolio adjustments indicate a slight underweighting of technology stocks.As the technology sector navigates both structural growth opportunities and near-term market turbulence, investors must weigh AI-driven innovation against macroeconomic risks. Goldman Sachs has identified key tech stocks poised for future growth, offering strategic opportunities in an evolving landscape.Our MethodologyTo develop our list of Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: 10 Stocks to Buy, we ranked the top current holdings of the Goldman Sachs US Technology Opportunities Equity Portfolio according to the highest number of hedge funds ownerships. We have used Insider Monkey\u2019s exclusive proprietary Q4 2024 database of hedge funds to arrive at our rankings.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) among the 10 Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks to Buy?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of hedge fund owners \u2013 193Tech giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in the design and manufacture of graphics processing units (GPUs), central processing units (CPUs), and system-on-a-chip units (SoCs). These products serve diverse markets, including gaming, professional visualization, data centers, and automotive industries.In March 2025, at its GPU Technology Conference (GTC), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) unveiled several groundbreaking advancements. The company introduced the Blackwell Ultra AI chips, offering enhanced performance and memory, with availability expected in the latter half of 2025. NVIDIA announced the Vera Rubin AI chip, slated for release in late 2026, followed by Rubin Ultra in 2027.Adding to NVIDIA\u2019s AI expansion, CoreWeave, an AI cloud services provider backed by NVIDIA, has filed for an IPO which is expected to raise $4 billion. This move further solidifies the company\u2019s influence in the AI-driven cloud computing sector. Despite recent setbacks, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) boasts a market capitalization of $2.867 trillion, ranking as the world\u2019s third most valuable company.Macroeconomic uncertainty has created near-term headwinds, leading to a 12.5% decline in NVIDIA\u2019s stock this year. Still, analysts remain bullish, with a consensus price target of $174.19 and 93% Buy ratings. Financially, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to outperform, with trailing twelve-month (TTM) revenue reaching $130.5 billion and EBITDA at $83.32 billion. The company\u2019s five-year return stands at a staggering 2,115.39%, underscoring its long-term growth potential.Overall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of Goldman Sachs tech stocks: 10 stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential for NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Here is Why Jim Cramer Is Bullish On NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)      Ramish Cheema   Sat, March 29, 2025 at 9:45 PM GMT+8 5 min read        15   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Says Trump\u2019s Tariff Strategy Is Working & Discusses These 11 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. In a recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer discussed the outcomes of President Trump\u2019s tariffs and whether Trump is hostile to the markets. March has been marked by a massive stock market selloff which wiped off trillions of dollars in value as investors grew uncertain about the US economy and the tariff narrative. Commenting on these developments, Cramer remarked: \u201cI believe that the President watches CNBC. I think the President recognizes that perhaps it would be good to start narrowing things down. He\u2019s made some real progress. I mean there\u2019s companies that seem to decide to put plants here everyday. Right? I mean, it\u2019s working. And he doesn\u2019t want to destroy the market. I think that there\u2019s this perception that he doesn\u2019t care anymore. I think that\u2019s bogus. I think he cares tremendously. I think that it\u2019s a canard that he doesn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know about our Treasury Secretary, even though he\u2019s 35 years in the market. . .But I do think that the President cares passionately about the market. That was a misdirection play.\u201d  Along with discussing Trump\u2019s thoughts on the markets,\u00a0 Cramer also commented on whether Trump\u2019s strategies are yielding results. The CNBC TV show host has supported tariffs in his previous appearances as he believes that America\u2019s trading partners are being unfair. Cramer believes Trump\u2019s strategy is working: \u201cHis strategy\u2019s working. Because these countries are caving. And these companies are caving. And they\u2019re building things here. You know we see them all the time. Korean companies are now folding. European companies will fold. Because they\u2019re afraid. They\u2019re afraid of him. And it\u2019s working. That strategy\u2019s working. What\u2019s not working is the idea that tomorrow he might change it. He\u2019s gotta stick with this. What he said this week it\u2019s gotta stay. That\u2019s what has to happen. You can\u2019t change again tomorrow, say that you\u2019re not reciprocal, we\u2019re going blunderbuss. Cause reciprocal\u2019s what business wants. Blunderbuss protection they don\u2019t want. Over and over again I heard that this morning. Over and over again.\u201d  As for China, Cramer doesn\u2019t trust the country. He believes that the Chinese government is \u201cplaying one hand military and in the other hand they\u2019re inviting people over,\u201d in regards to major American companies\u2019 executives meeting Chinese government officials.   Story Continues Our MethodologyTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on March 24th.For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q4 2024: 223Despite the fact that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s shares are down by 16.6% year-to-date, Cramer continues to be a bull on the shares. He believes that the firm\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang has the right perspective when it comes to the demand for its AI GPUs. Cramer has also blasted day traders and zero-day options, who he blames for the volatility in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s share price. Fresh off of the firm\u2019s GTC conference, here are his recent thoughts about the firm:\u201cThey will spend $5 trillion if they had it.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to BillionairesDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Best Stock to Buy for the Next 3 Months?      Ahad Tariq   Sun, March 30, 2025 at 8:55 PM GMT+8 6 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next 3 Months. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best stocks to buy for the next 3 months. The year 2025 began with the surprise announcement of DeepSeek AI, launched in China, which shook the markets. Further volatility was experienced when the US government implemented trade tariffs across China and Europe. In March, President Trump suggested that his proposed reciprocal tariff regime would offer \u201cflexibility\u201d, giving investors some relief. Although it is unclear what the term \u201cflexibility\u201d would entail. Rising tensions from conflicts in the Middle East and Europe added to market uncertainty. Looking ahead, investors will be watching closely for fresh economic indicators to assess the Fed\u2019s stance on future interest rates.  The hedge fund industry is seen as a trusted source of investment opportunities. According to a report published by Reuters, assets have grown by nearly 56% since 2015. The industry had $4.51 trillion in assets under management (AUM) in 2024, 9.75% higher compared to the previous year. Total assets were the highest amount since 2021, rising by $401.4 billion in 2024 due to strong performances across different strategies. In terms of returns, hedge funds continued to show improvement year-on-year. As per a report by Pivotal Path, hedge funds returned 5.7% in 2023 and 10.7% in 2024, while some managers showed gains above 50%. This performance substantiates the industry\u2019s influence on markets. Looking ahead, the hedge fund landscape is poised for significant changes in 2025, driven by evolving market conditions, technological advancements, and shifting investor preferences. Mordor Intelligence predicts that the US Hedge Fund Market will have a market size of $2.95 trillion in 2025 and is expected to reach $4.05 trillion by 2030, a CAGR of 6.52%.  Hedge funds have introduced new strategies for mitigating market risks for improved returns to their investors. These include diversifying towards smaller multi-strategy funds. After a decade of fluctuating demand, smaller multi-strategy funds have begun to show interest. In 2024, with traditional asset classes facing challenges from rising P/E ratios and tight credit spreads, the uncorrelated returns of reinsurance-linked strategies have become increasingly attractive. This is expected to drive substantial capital inflows into the sector in 2025, particularly from institutional investors seeking diversification and higher returns. Investors who can assess the market dynamics, adapt to changes, and identify future leaders in the space are well-positioned for success. Hedge funds have the resources to use advanced AI-driven technologies to predict market movements to ensure higher returns on volatile asset classes.   Story Continues Investors seeking to mitigate the impact of such volatility will opt for more stable, low-risk investments such as fixed-income securities. These provide a continuous stream of income in periods of high interest rates. In contrast, those willing to take advantage of high interest rates would opt for sectors benefiting from such a scenario, including banking, real estate, or tech firms, which are geared to take on high market volatility.Our MethodologyThe best stocks to buy over the next three months are chosen based on hedge fund sentiment toward these investments. For this list, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 proprietary hedge fund holdings database and identified the 10 most popular hedge fund stocks. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund positions.At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Best Stock to Buy for the Next 3 Months?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 223Upside Potential: 45.37%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computer, and networking solutions, including GPUs, software, and platforms for gaming, data centers, automotive, and AI. Its hardware-software integration, particularly its DGX cloud offerings, makes it a major player in AI and serverless computing.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s CEO, Jensen Huang, also stated an improvement in their product performance by millions of times over the past decade and expects similar growth over the next decade. While having an established dominance in hardware, it also has an overwhelming presence in the cloud, with 93% of GPU-accelerated instances being powered by the company\u2019s hardware.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s earnings report for the final quarter of 2024 revealed revenue of $39.33 billion, an astounding 77.94% YoY rise, shattering estimates by $1.19 billion. EPS was $0.89, also beating estimates of $0.04.The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), which includes NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as a member, spoke about the importance of the US Trade Commission to look beyond tariffs and work with global allies to offset China\u2019s attempts at dominating the industry.\u201dIn semiconductors, as in other advanced technologies, China has pursued a wide range of policies and practices that seek to frustrate access for foreign products and companies to its domestic market, while offering an array of subsidies, discriminatory standards, preferential government procurement policies, local content requirements, and other measures intended to boost local producers and design-in domestically produced semiconductor chips into downstream products for sale in China\u2019s domestic market as well as for products exported to the rest of the world. Overall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of best stocks to buy for the next 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential for NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Why Nvidia (NVDA) Shares Are Sliding Today      Kayode Omotosho   Thu, March 27, 2025 at 2:35 AM GMT+8 3 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%         Why Nvidia (NVDA) Shares Are Sliding Today   What Happened? Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 6% in the afternoon session after stocks pulled back (Nasdaq -1.5%, S&P 500 -1.2%) amid fresh concerns about trade tariffs. The pullback followed comments from President Trump clarifying the scope of his administration's 25% tariffs on Venezuela. He noted that it would apply to any country that does business with Venezuela. For example, 25% is on top of the already-in-place 20% tariff on China because China imports oil from Venezuela, which could translate to a 45% tariff on some Chinese goods. This announcement could significantly raise the operating costs for affected companies and institutions.  Adding to the market unease, the President announced plans for new tariffs on auto imports before the planned \"reciprocal\" tariffs on April 2, 2025. Also, the Financial Times reported that Chinese regulators prevented the country's tech companies from using Nvidia's H20 chip. The chip was designed to meet U.S. trade ban rules, but it seemed Chinese regulators were worried they could breach energy-efficiency rules. Adding to the worries, there were also reports that the U.S. had added more Chinese companies to its trade blacklist, citing national security concerns. As a result, these companies would now need government approval to purchase American technology. Among those affected were tech firms that depended heavily on advanced chips made by U.S. manufacturers, raising concerns about the US chip makers' ability to maintain strong sales in the Chinese market. The shares closed the day at $113.69, down 5.8% from previous close. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free. What The Market Is Telling Us Nvidia\u2019s shares are extremely volatile and have had 30 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 14 days ago when the stock gained 6.9% on the news that markets experienced a boost after data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that inflation for the month of February 2025 came in better than expected. The CPI rose 0.2% from the previous month (vs estimates for a 0.3% increase), while headline inflation rose 2.8% year on year (vs estimates for a 2.9% y/y increase). The data revealed inflation continued to edge closer to the Fed's 2% target, but not quite there yet. The reaction wasn't anything wild, but the sentiment leaned positive. The Nasdaq led the way, climbing 1.4%, boosting some tech stocks.   Story Continues Separately, Wall Street analysts noted that some of the recently beaten-down Magnificent Seven stocks were now trading at attractive valuations, presenting solid entry points for investors looking to capitalize on their potential rebound.Also, Reuters reported that TSMC reached out to chipmakers, including Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and Qualcomm, about a potential deal for Intel's foundry business.Nvidia is down 17.9% since the beginning of the year, and at $113.49 per share, it is trading 24.1% below its 52-week high of $149.43 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $17,647.Today\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia stock sinks as CEO Jensen Huang keynotes GTC 2025 event, unveils new chip lineup      Laura Bratton    Updated March 19, 2025 3 min read        206   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   AVGO   +0.65%    NVDA   +1.63%     ^SOX   +0.28%      Nvidia (NVDA) stock slid 3.4% Tuesday after the AI chipmaker's annual GTC conference in California kicked off with a keynote from CEO Jensen Huang, who unveiled new and updated AI chips. \"Artificial intelligence has made extraordinary progress,\" Huang said at the start of his speech. The CEO confirmed in a two-plus hour keynote that Nvidia will launch its upcoming AI chip, Blackwell Ultra, in the second half of 2025, as previously expected. Blackwell Ultra follows the chipmaker's current-generation Blackwell GPUs, which achieved full scale production during Nvidia's fourth quarter, raking in $11 billion in revenue, after facing delays and reports of overheating and glitches. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    110.15 +1.77 (+1.63%)  At close: 4:00:00 PM EDT  109.41 -0.74 (-0.67%) Pre-Market: 5:42:32 AM EDT   Advanced Chart    \"Blackwell [the current-generation GPU] is in full production, and the ramp is incredible,\" Huang said. \"Customer demand is incredible.\" \"We'll easily transition into the upgrade [Blackwell Ultra],\" he said. In addition to the Blackwell Ultra chip, Nvidia debuted its GB300 superchip, which combines two Blackwell Ultras and one of its Grace CPUs (central processing units). Huang also said Nvidia will launch its next AI superchip, Vera Rubin, in the second half of 2026 \u2014 and the next-gen superchip after that, Vera Rubin Ultra, in the second half of 2027.  \"We have an annual rhythm of roadmaps that has been laid out for you,\" he said. Huang's updates failed to stem a slide in the company's shares that pervaded through a broader market rout Tuesday, which was led by large-cap tech stocks. Nvidia's decline Tuesday put shares of the AI chipmaker down roughly 14% year to date. Nvidia stock has experienced significant volatility in 2025. Shares started the year with a bang, hitting a record close above $149 in early January. They tumbled when a new AI model from Chinese firm DeepSeek reignited concerns over an AI bubble and shaved nearly $600 billion from the chipmaker's market cap in a single day. In its most recent rout, following its fourth quarter earnings and heightened macroeconomic uncertainty, Nvidia saw its market cap losses from its record close reach $1 trillion. Nvidia bull and Wedbush analyst Dan Ives had hoped GTC would be \"a wake-up moment for the tech bulls,\" as he wrote in a note to investors Tuesday. Overall, tech stocks have led the stock market's recent downturn. The Nasdaq (^IXIC) entered correction territory on March 6, and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) followed suit a week later, as President Trump's tariffs and DOGE-driven cuts to federal jobs fueled concerns over inflation.   Story Continues Read more: How does Nvidia make money?\"We clearly need stable Trump policy and investors need to know the rules of the game ... but that will all happen over the coming months and we do not believe this dramatically changes the trajectory of the AI Revolution,\" Ives wrote.He added: \"We believe this week's Nvidia GTC Conference will be a turning point for tech stocks as the Street starts to refocus on the AI Revolution and the massive tech spending ahead for the coming years.\"Truist analyst Will Stein also stayed bullish on Nvidia ahead of GTC, reiterating his Buy rating and $205 price target on the stock in a note to investors Tuesday.  CEO Jensen Huang talks during the keynote address of Nvidia GTC Tuesday, March 18, 2025, in San Jose, Calif. (AP Photo/Nic Coury)  \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESSStein acknowledged bearish arguments against the AI trade: \"The biggest investor concern (that was magnified by DeepSeek (private)) is that NVDA's customers are deploying too much AI compute capacity today, and that customers will subsequently enter a period of digestion, causing a cyclical downturn. To us, this dynamic is a certainty; the only question is on timing.\"He continued: \u201cWe continue to view NVDA as *the* AI company. Its leadership position is owing less to the architecture, speed, or performance of its chips, and more to the results of its culture of innovation, ecosystem of incumbency, and massive ongoing investment in software, training models, and services.\"Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia Just Took a $17 Billion Hit--and It's Coming From China         Khac Phu Nguyen   Thu, March 27, 2025 at 2:19 AM GMT+8 1 min read        16   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares dropped 5.6% at 12.49am on Wednesday when there are signals of fresh trouble brewing in China. At the heart of it: Beijing is tightening energy efficiency rules for data centers, which could sideline Nvidia's H20 chipa product originally designed to comply with U.S. export restrictions. China accounts for 13% of Nvidia's total sales, or roughly $17 billion a year. That market is now under direct threat. As of Wednesday morning, the stock has been down more than 15% year-to-date.  Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA.  Here's the problem: China's top economic planning agency is pushing local companies to use chips that meet stricter efficiency requirements. Nvidia's H20 doesn't currently make the cut. While demand for the chip in China had been solid, regulators are now reportedly urging tech firms to move away from it entirely. The timing couldn't be worse. Local competitors are ramping up, using cheaper and older processors to power their own AI tools. That's putting Nvidia in a tight spotnot just from a policy standpoint, but from a competitive one too. Nvidia says it's in talks with Chinese partners and working on tweaks to make the H20 compliant. But investors aren't waiting around. The selloff reflects deeper concerns that China is accelerating its push toward self-sufficiencyjust as global demand for AI hardware heats up. The bigger picture? Nvidia remains the dominant player, but this is a wake-up call. The geopolitical headwinds are real, and the next leg of growth may depend on how quickly the company can adapt to shifting sands in its second-largest market.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia GTC 2025: What to expect from Nvidia's biggest event of the year      Daniel Howley   \u00b7 Technology Editor  March 17, 2025 3 min read        64   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   AMZN   +1.00%    NVDA   +1.63%    MSFT   +1.81%     GOOG   +1.70%    QBTS   -2.37%      Nvidia (NVDA) kicks off its annual GTC event on March 18 with a keynote by CEO Jensen Huang from the SAP Center in San Jose, Calif. The event, which runs through March 21, will feature workshops and training for developers and engineers, panels and discussions related to AI and robotics, and exhibits from companies showing off how they're using Nvidia's products in the real world.  Huang is expected to debut the company's latest flagship AI chip: the Blackwell Ultra. A souped-up version of Nvidia's existing Blackwell chip, Blackwell Ultra should get a performance boost over last year's chip to further speed up training and running AI models. We should also learn more about Nvidia's next-generation GPU platform, dubbed Rubin, and the successor to its Grace line of CPUs, Vera. The combined superchip will be called Vera Rubin, named for the American astronomer, and will take the place of the current Grace Blackwell superchip at the top of Nvidia's hierarchy of AI processors. During Nvidia's fourth quarter earnings call, Huang teased that he'd also discuss the follow-up to Rubin. Nvidia, like most chip companies, is known for providing a broad look at its roadmap to help customers and developers prepare for their upcoming products.   Expect Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to cover topics ranging from AI to humanoid robotics at GTC 2025. (Reuters/Ann Wang/File Photo)  \u00b7 Reuters / Reuters In addition to Nvidia's future chips, Huang will dive into the company's latest software updates around its CUDA platform, simulation technologies, and more. During last year's event, Haung talked up Nvidia's software efforts around humanoid robots. And with the company set to host a panel dedicated to the topic, you can expect the CEO to provide even more details about Nvidia's push into the humanoid robotics race. The company will also host its first Quantum Day during GTC, which will include a panel discussion between Huang and executives from quantum computing companies including Alice & Bob, D-Wave (QBTS), IonQ (IONQ), Rigetti (RGTI), and SEEQC.  Read more: How does Nvidia make money? Huang made waves in January when he said practical quantum computers are still between 15 and 30 years away from becoming a reality, sending quantum computing stocks lower. Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) each announced their own quantum computing chips over the past few months, driving increased interest in the technology. Google CEO Sundar Pichai says practical quantum computers are likely five to 10 years away.

Still, the conversation between Huang and leaders at quantum companies should prove interesting.   Story Continues Nvidia is contending with a host of issues ranging from fears over potential tariffs on semiconductors imported to the US to additional export controls on GPUs destined for China.Then there's the rise of DeepSeek's R-1 AI model, which the Chinese company said it trained using less-powerful Nvidia chips. That has fed into Wall Street's growing apprehension over AI spending and a return on those heavy investments in the technology by companies including Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta.Shares of Nvidia were off 13% year to date as of Thursday. Still, the company's stock price is up 28% over the past 12 months.Huang, however, has pushed back against those fears, saying that \"thinking\" AI models like DeepSeek's provide better responses to users' queries when they run on more powerful chips. Chances are the CEO will bring up his thoughts on the topic during his keynote.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says we'll soon see 1 million GPU data centers visible from space      Daniel Howley   \u00b7 Technology Editor  March 19, 2025 3 min read        129   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%     XAAI.PVT        Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang has big plans for the AI data center industry. During the company\u2019s GTC conference, the chip giant\u2019s executive and co-founder debuted Nvidia\u2019s Spectrum-X and Quantum-X silicon photonics networking systems. Networking switches connect multiple Nvidia graphics chips together to act as one giant system. Huang says Spectrum-X and Quantum-X photonics can join hundreds and even thousands of GPUs and will enable data center companies to deploy up to 1 million GPU clusters. That\u2019s a massive jump from the current largest AI supercomputer, xAI\u2019s Colossus, which is made up of 100,000 Nvidia Hopper GPUs. And according to Huang, those million cluster data centers will be connected to other million-dollar data centers nearby to form massive data center facilities.   \u201cOver the next several years, we're going to be building giant AI factories. Not normal AI factories \u2026 ones you see from space,\u201d Huang explained. The CEO spent a good deal of his time on stage during his GTC keynote explaining how Nvidia\u2019s latest advancements, ranging from Spectrum-X and Quantum-X photonics to its Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin superchips, will help the company\u2019s customers, including cloud service providers like Microsoft and Google, operate ever-more-powerful AI systems to drive better revenue opportunities.   Nvidia's Spectrum-X and Quantum-X silicon photonics networking switches. (Image: Nvidia)  \u00b7 Nvidia \u201cAI factories are directly related to revenue, and if the throughput is not good, your revenue is hurt. If you don't have enough capacity, your revenue is hurt. If you're not producing something of great value ... your revenue is hurt,\u201d Huang said. Read more: How does Nvidia make money? The CEO equated AI factories to auto plants, explaining how if automakers don\u2019t have the right factories and products on offer, their revenues will suffer. \u201dThis could apply to a car company. If your capacity is not high enough, your revenue is hurt. If your utilization is not good, your revenue is hurt. if you build a car, nobody wants to buy it, your revenue is hurt,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt's a factory. Except it's a factory of tokens. It's a new world. An industrial revolution.\u201d   That industrial revolution won\u2019t just take place inside of data centers though. In addition to its chips for massive server systems, Nvidia also showed off a handful of smaller AI-centered computers, including its mini desktop-sized DGX Spark and full-size desktop-sized DGX Station. Packed with Nvidia\u2019s Grace Blackwell super chips, the computers are designed for AI developers and researchers. And when paired with the company\u2019s other AI platforms, they make up a new approach to enterprise IT that revolves around AI.   Story Continues According to Huang, enterprise IT represents a half-a-trillion-dollar market opportunity.\"If you look at the world's data center spend, half of it is [cloud service providers], half of it is enterprise,\" Huang said. \"Still, that half of the enterprise, unless somebody does something, it's going to stay not AI. That\u2019s what Nvidia AI enterprise is all about.\"  Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.  \u00b7 yahoofinanceEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia sees robots as its next big market opportunity      Daniel Howley   \u00b7 Technology Editor Updated Thu, March 27, 2025 at 3:31 AM GMT+8 4 min read        38   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   AMZN   +1.00%    META   +1.67%    MSFT   +1.81%    NVDA   +1.63%     GOOG   +1.70%      Nvidia (NVDA) continues to ride the AI wave as cloud giants Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) snatch up as many of its data center chips as they can. And while shares of the chip company are off 10% year to date, they're still up 27% over the past 12 months and more than 700% since 2023. Revenue is also soaring, jumping from $27 billion during the company's fiscal 2023 to $130 billion in fiscal 2025.  But during Nvidia's GTC event last week, CEO Jensen Huang repeatedly made the case for the company's next major AI innovation: robotics. Huang is looking to use Nvidia's digital AI prowess to grow what he calls physical AI, including self-driving cars and humanoid robots. \"We are ... world class with robotic safety. I believe this expertise is going to pay off big someday,\" the CEO said during a press briefing during the conference. \"We've been investing in this area for 10 years now. It's a multibillion-dollar business for us already ... and I think this is going to be one of the largest businesses for the company long term,\" Huang added. Read more: How does Nvidia make money? Nvidia\u2019s physical AI push A quick tour of Nvidia's GTC showcase at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center offered a glimpse at Nvidia's robotics ambitions, with exhibits ranging from robotic arms to human-size bipedal robots. On one side of the large hall, the company displayed its own prototype of a robotic ultrasound machine as an example of how businesses can take advantage of its technologies.   Agility Robotics showed off its Digit robot at GTC 2025. (Daniel Howley)  \u00b7 Howley The voice-activated bot included a single mechanical arm with a camera and scanner. When I told it to perform a liver scan, it quickly located the organ on a dummy torso and performed the procedure. A display mounted behind the setup showed the live results, which I can only assume is what a liver looks like on an ultrasound. I'm a reporter, not a doctor. In the next stall, Agility Robotics showed off its Digit robot as it grabbed items off a faux store shelf and put them into a shopping basket, completing the task over and over again like some kind of Sisyphean nightmare. A litany of other robotic arms and a Boston Dynamics Spot were also on display at the event. A 3-in-1 deal Huang is banking on robot makers relying on a three-computer system that Nvidia has developed to train and run the machines. The first system includes Nvidia's DGX AI systems, which customers use to develop AI robot models. Then there's the Nvidia Omniverse system, which customers use to train their robotic models to navigate the real world in a virtual setting.   Story Continues   A prototype of an AI-powered ultrasound at GTC 2025. (Daniel Howley)  \u00b7 HowleyThe idea is to ensure customers can subject their robots' AI models to a litany of potential scenarios ranging from falling down stairs to crashing into walls to trying to avoid falling air conditioners without having to put them \u2014 or the people around them \u2014 in any real-world danger.\"You want to simulate ... millions of miles of [a car] driving, test it out beforehand, and then deploy it,\" Nvidia vice presidence of Omniverse and simulation technology Rev Lebaredian told Yahoo Finance.\"And [it's] the same for all robots. I'm using cars as an example, but the robots we have in our factories. These are multimillion-dollar factories. Any amount of downtime costs millions of dollars and opportunity cost, or they can be dangerous too. You don't want them hurting the robots themselves or hurting people that are also in those factories.\"The final component is Nvidia's Jetson Thor onboard computer, which runs those trained AI models. Think of it as something of a robotic brain. Vehicles would use Nvidia's AGX Thor.Nvidia faces stiff competition and headwindsNvidia isn't the only company looking to capitalize on the promise of a robot-filled future. Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla are each working on some element of the robot ecosystem.Then there are the practical hurdles companies must overcome before robots become a part of our everyday lives. Humanoid robots are still incredibly expensive \u2014 upwards of tens of thousands of dollars \u2014 and their batteries still don't last very long before needing a top-off.And while self-driving cars continue to expand to more cities, we're still some time from the day when you can hop into your car's driver's seat and take a nap on the way to the office.Nvidia, however, has a history of continuing to develop technologies it believes in until they break into the market. Look no further than its graphics card software and AI capabilities. And if Nvidia can do the same with robotics, it could be a whole new opportunity for the chip giant.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Showcases AI Future at GTC Conference With Game-Changing Chip and Robot Reveals      Ghazal Ahmed   March 26, 2025 5 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of GTC Recap and Beyond: 10 AI Stocks on Investors\u2019 Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks that are on investors' radar. Jensen Huang\u2019s GTC keynote may not have unpacked significant surprises, but his insights and plans reflect his forward-thinking approach.  Together, the announcements and innovations that were revealed at the conference, particularly in areas such as health and autonomous vehicles, demonstrate Nvidia's commitment to leading the sector in AI and technology. The company has also outlined a road map for the next three years, and there are significant new products planned every year. This is an aspiring target to achieve. READ ALSO: 10 AI Stocks You Need to Watch: News & Ratings \u00a0and 10 AI Stocks Making Waves: GTC Highlights & Beyond During his keynote, Huang announced new chips for deploying AI models. These are expected to ship in 2026. However, some investors were underwhelmed, with the stock dropping more than 3% on Tuesday. This has been an unexpected turn for the company, considering the GTC conference has been a positive catalyst for the past few years. Here is what Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis noted about the conference. \u201cThe rate of innovation on all fronts continues to impress and suggests a growing moat vs. peers \u2026 we were hoping for more proof points for TAM expansion and TCO advantages.\u201d  Meanwhile, Benchmark analyst Cody Acree said in a note to clients: \"Investors' attitude toward the speech appeared to be somewhat lethargic. Overall, we thought the keynote was about as expected, with Jensen once again providing a masterclass overview of AI.\"  Some analyst firms are very optimistic about the stock. \u201cWe have long viewed sovereign AI as an underappreciated driver of demand for AI infrastructure, and our sense coming out of this summit is that there is a long runway of AI infrastructure development ahead.\u201d -UBS \u201cWith leading silicon (GPU/DPU/CPU), hardware/ software platforms, and a strong ecosystem, the company is well-positioned to benefit from major secular trends in AI, high-performance computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles, in our view. It continues to remain 1-2 steps ahead of its competitors.\u201d -JP Morgan Analyst  For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points \u00a0(see more details here).   Story Continues   A high-level executive standing at a podium addressing a conference hall filled with C-suite industry leaders.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services. The company has made several groundbreaking revelations at the GTC Conference, underscoring its commitment to advancing AI technology across multiple sectors.CEO Jensen Huang said that the Blackwell architecture, having the ability to significantly enhance AI model training and inference, is in full production. The company has also introduced Blackwell Ultra, an accelerated computing platform having the ability to support even larger AI models, which will be available in the second half of this year.Next, the upcoming Rubin chips and servers, paying tribute to the astronomer Vera Rubin, will offer improved speeds, especially in data transfers between chips. The computing system is expected to outperform the company's Blackwell architecture.Vera Rubin is set to release in the second half of 2026, followed by the launch of Vera Rubin Ultra in 2027. This system will be succeeded by the Feynman architecture, scheduled for release in 2028.The company has also announced new DGX AI computers, powered by its Blackwell Ultra chips. These are designed to assist developers in inferencing large models.In addition, new silicon photonics networking chips have also been introduced, enabling AI factories to connect millions of GPUs across various sites and reducing energy consumption. The Quantum-X Photonics chips are anticipated to be available later this year. This will be followed by the launch of Spectrum-X chips in 2026.Nvidia has also announced a major release of new NVIDIA Cosmos\u2122 world foundation models (WFMs), which are built to power world model training and accelerate physical AI development for autonomous vehicles (AVs) and robots.It is also launching is also two new blueprints \u2014 powered by the NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122 and Cosmos platforms. These blueprints will provide developers with massive, controllable synthetic data generation engines for post-training robots and autonomous vehicles.Huang has also publicized the open Llama Nemotron family of models with reasoning capabilities. The family of models has been designed to provide developers and enterprises with a business-ready foundation for creating advanced AI agents.Meanwhile, NVIDIA\u00a0Dynamo has also been introduced, which is an open-source inference software for accelerating and scaling AI reasoning models in AI factories, and that too, at the lowest cost and with the highest efficiency.Huang also introduced NVIDIA Halos, a comprehensive safety system integrating NVIDIA\u2019s lineup of automotive hardware and software safety solutions with its cutting-edge AI research in AV safety.In the humanoid robots' sphere, NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1 is now available, known to be the world\u2019s first open, fully customizable foundation model for generalized humanoid reasoning and skills.These announcements are setting the standard in each sector for AI-driven innovation.\u00a0Overall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of AI stocks that are on Wall Street\u2019s radar today. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to BillionairesDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          'Death Cross' Panic? Jim Cramer Wonders If Zero-Day Puts Are Driven By Confusion. 'They Don't Know The Difference Between Nvidia and Nivea'    'Death Cross' Panic? Jim Cramer Wonders If Zero-Day Puts Are Driven By Confusion. 'They Don't Know The Difference Between Nvidia and Nivea'      Adrian Volenik   March 26, 2025 3 min read        2   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares flashed a technical warning sign last week, and it didn't take long for the chatter to pick up. The stock triggered what's known as a \u201cdeath cross\u201d on March 20. That signal often suggests a potential downtrend, especially after the kind of monster run Nvidia has had.  Since October 2022, Nvidia has surged 948%, so this kind of chart movement grabbed attention. But not everyone is convinced it spells doom. Don't Miss: Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share! This startup is on the brink of a huge disruption to a $654 billion industry \u2013 invest in it for under $10 before it's too late.  Not The First Rodeo For Nvidia Back in April 2022, Nvidia also flashed a death cross, and the stock went on to fall 47% before bottoming out. Naturally, investors are wondering if history is about to repeat itself. While analysts are debating what the signal means, Jim Cramer took a more blunt approach. On March 21, the CNBC host posted on X: \u201cAre the zero-day put options holders blowing them out or pressing their bet because of the death cross. I ask because they don\u2019t know the difference between Nvidia and Nivea.\u201d      Trending: Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm \u2014 invest pre-IPO from $0.55 per share now. It was classic Cramer\u2014mixing market commentary with sarcasm. His post suggested that many traders are reacting without truly understanding the stock or the signal. In January, Cramer urged investors to consider Nvidia\u2019s stock decline as a buying opportunity, saying, \u201cUnderstand one thing, the keynote dazzled, the new projects are way ahead of any other company, and this new industrial revolution belongs to Nvidia.\u201d  Zero-day options, especially puts, are popular among short-term speculators. Whether they're making sharp calls or just following headlines remains to be seen. But Cramer's point was that not every bearish bet is well-informed. See Also: This platform is reshaping how you invest in private companies \u2014 and you can be a part of it for $0.18 per share For now, Nvidia is holding up. After dipping briefly, shares bounced back a little bit. Whether that death cross turns into something bigger or just becomes a blip on the radar will depend on how the market\u2014and Nvidia's fundamentals\u2014evolve in the coming weeks.   Story Continues What Is a Death Cross and Why Does It Matter?A \u201cdeath cross\u201d happens when a stock\u2019s short-term moving average, typically the 50-day, falls below its long-term average, often the 200-day. It can be seen as a sign that momentum is fading and that the stock might be entering a longer-term downtrend. While it\u2019s not always a sign of trouble ahead, it tends to get attention from technical analysts and traders looking for signals about where the market might be headed next.Read Next:If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones.

Upgrade Now          Ives Remains Very Upbeat on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)      Larry Ramer   Thu, March 27, 2025 at 2:55 AM GMT+8 2 min read        3   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%     GOOG   +1.70%    TSLA   +3.59%      In a recent interview on the Schwab Network, renowned Wedbush analyst Dan Ives was very bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Tesla Inc. (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Ives: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)'s Market Cap Can Reach $5 Trillion Nvidia's market cap can surge from its current level of $2.8 trillion to $5 trillion, Ives stated. \"Developers' feedback \" regarding NVDA's products is \"off the charts,\" while \"the use cases for its products are exploding,\" the analyst reported.    He asserted that NVDA \"owns AI from a chip perspective\" and contended that physical AI, highlighted by autonomous vehicles and robots, will prove to be a \"holy grail\" for the chip giant. Adding that NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is only in the third year of a ten-year advance, Ives called its shares \"cheap.\" Ives: \"It's Not Time to Throw in the Towel on Tesla\" Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), along with NVDA, will be \"one of the two best disruptive tech plays in the next decade,\" Ives predicted. The analyst continues to believe that the key to the company's longer-term future is its efforts in autonomous driving.  Contending that TSLA continues to have a bright future in China despite tough competition in the Asian country, Ives still identifies Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) stock as a top pick and now has a $550 price target on the name. \u00a0Ives: Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) Is \"Way Oversold\" Amid \"antitrust fears,\" Alphabet is \"way oversold,\" the analyst believes. Moreover, the tech giant's recent deal to buy Wiz, an Israeli cybersecurity firm, suggests that Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is \"going on offense,\" he stated. Also importantly, the deal improves the outlook of Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and GCP is well-positioned to benefit from the continued growth of AI, Ives believes. Based on a sum-of-the-parts analysis, GOOG stock is worth $225, the analyst stated. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.

Now, Chief Executive Elon Musk appears to be signaling 2025 could be a middling year for the EV giant, with only slight vehicle sales growth, even as he continues to sound bullish on the possibility for incredible things to come in 2026, 2027 and 2028.  Separately, Musk posted to X on Friday evening that his AI firm xAI has bought his social site X in a stock deal valuing the latter at $33 billion.

Upgrade Now          Bank of America: NVDA Will Ultimately Head Higher, Driven by Very Strong Fundamentals      Larry Ramer   Thu, March 27, 2025 at 11:28 PM GMT+8 2 min read        3   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       Nvidia's (NVDA) fundamentals are \"rock solid,\" and the company's powerful business will ultimately propel its shares higher, Vivek Arya, Bank of America's Senior Semiconductor Analyst told CNBC today. Arya: Fundamentals Will Triumph Over Fears Worries over geopolitical issues and new restrictions that could be placed on the export of Nvidia's chips have been holding its shares down, the analyst reported. For example, in May a new AI diffusion rule, which was initiated by the Biden administration at the end of its tenure, may go into effect and place further limits on the export of NVDA's products, Arya noted.    But NVDA's \"exceptionally strong fundamentals\" and its \"compelling valuation\" will ultimately propel the stock higher, the analyst believes. However, he warned that over \"the next few weeks,\" the shares will likely continue to be volatile due to worries about geopolitical issues. A \"Very Successful\" Conference According to Arya, NVDA's recent GTC conference was \"very successful.\" He noted that NVDA showed how data centers' spending is likely to surge to $1 trillion, while the computing needs of AI reasoning models are poised to surge by 10 to 100 times. The Recent Price Action of NVDA In the last month, the shares have dropped 5.5%, while they are down 19% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Seana Smith and Madison Mills outline what investors need to know about the semiconductor giant on today's Morning Brief. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here. This post was written by Naomi Buchanan.  Video Transcript  00:00 Speaker A Nvidia back in the green this morning following a steep drop earlier this week. Now, the move to the downside coming following a broader market uncertainty. You're looking at gains this morning, just about 7/10 of a percent. Analysts now tracking the 200-day moving average for signs of more trouble ahead. The stock now trading well below the gauge here. When you take a look at ultimately what this means, what that next test level is going to look like, there are a number of numbers out there here from some of the technical strategists, whether or not there's 113, 110, 90. Talking a lot about a range between 103 and 107. But I think one of the key takeaways is just in terms of how fast and how far it has fallen, just the valuation aspect of this. And obviously, Nvidia's valuation now the lowest level that we've seen in over a year. So of course, that begs the question whether or not maybe this could be a buying opportunity. Obviously, that very much up for debate. But again, when you take a look at the degree of the drop, some of those critical levels are really coming into play.02:11 Speaker B I think it's going to be interesting to see, and I wonder if we can throw up what Nvidia stock is doing right now pre-market, just because it is interesting to see a couple of these individual sectors moving to the upside off of those comments from Howard Letnik talking about the fact that we might see carve-outs and exemptions for specific industries. He was speaking specifically about autos. He did mention clarity on tariffs to come for other sectors, including chips and pharmaceuticals, moving forward to that April 2nd deadline. So I am curious to, if we can see the intraday moves on Nvidia here, what the stock is doing ahead of pre-market, uh, and whether or not we're seeing some relief off of that idea that we could potentially be getting a little bit of positive lift to that stock off of that potential of, um, some tariff relief, though also perhaps just kind of revising after such a significant sell-off. Um, but that 200-day moving average was seen as such a technical level that could potentially lead to even more selling. So at least, at least you're not seeing more of that this morning. If you are an Nvidia shareholder, that must be a relief.04:04 Speaker A Yes, certainly. And hopefully it holds. Right. Still very early, and obviously, with so much rhetoric coming out of Washington, obviously very headline-driven market it seems as of late. Obviously could turn on a dime. But again, we are seeing some relief, I guess you can say with that, with the stock up just about 7/10 of a percent right ahead of the open.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Guinness Global Innovators\u2019 Top Performing Stock      Soumya Eswaran   March 24, 2025 4 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       Guinness Global Innovators, an investment management company, released its fourth-quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The fund generated a total return of 21.9% (TR in GBP) in 2024, compared to the MSCI World Net TR Index return of 20.8%. 2024 turned out to be yet another successful year for stocks. For the first time since the 1990s, the S&P 500 has now produced two years in a row with returns of more than 20% (USD). Against a complex backdrop of shifting monetary policy, geopolitical instability, and disparate regional economic performance, global equities markets produced strong returns. To get an idea of the fund's best choices for 2024, check out its top 5 positions.  In its fourth quarter 2024 investor letter, Guinness Global Innovators emphasized stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) offers graphics and compute and networking solutions. The one-month return of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was -9.66%, and its shares gained 23.89% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On March 21, 2025, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed at $117.70 per share with a market capitalization of $2.87 trillion. Guinness Global Innovators stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q4 2024 investor letter: \"For a second year running, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was the Fund\u2019s top performing stock, delivering a stellar return of +177.7% over the year. Since the beginning of last year, Nvidia\u2019s \u2018Hopper\u2019 GPUs have been at the centre of exploding demand for chips powerful and efficient enough to facilitate the energy intensive requirements of AI processes within datacentres. Initially possessing over 95% of market share in these types of chips, Nvidia have been quick to entrench their position as the technological leader in the space, launching the successor to the current \u2018Hopper\u2019 GPU in March, Blackwell, inhibiting the likes of AMD and Intel making meaningful inroads in taking share of the fast-growing market. Compared to the previous iteration (Hopper) which is continuing to fuel Nvidia\u2019s extreme revenue growth, the Blackwell chip is twice as powerful for training AI models and has 5 times the capability when it comes to \u201cinference\u201d (the speed at which AI models respond to queries). Throughout the year, Nvidia\u2019s financial performance has remained resilient. Quarterly revenues hit $35.1 billion in their most recent quarter, beating consensus expectations by 6% and representing a +94% year-over-year increase. Additionally, Nvidia\u2019s data centre segment, driven by the Hopper (H100) chip, grew fivefold over the past year, underscoring the sustained demand for advanced AI infrastructure. The H100 chip, priced at around $40,000, continues to see significant adoption due to its ability to enhance AI model training efficiency while lowering overall costs. This growth is expected to continue as companies invest in upgrading existing data centres and building new ones, with Nvidia well-positioned to capture a significant share of the estimated $2 trillion market opportunity over the next five years. There have been some concerns over Blackwell production delays causing share price volatility however, Nvidia has recovered swiftly, driven by positive earnings results through the year and assurances from management regarding future supply. Additionally, the release of the H200 chip promises to extend Nvidia\u2019s technological leadership, ensuring continued momentum into 2025. While Nvidia\u2019s valuation remains a topic of debate, the stock is not at a significant premium to history, and it still appears reasonable given its dominant market position, innovative prowess, and exposure to long-term secular growth trends in AI, cloud computing, and data infrastructure. As a result, Nvidia remains well-positioned to deliver sustained outperformance over the long term, making it a cornerstone of growth-oriented portfolios.\"    Story Continues   NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Powering the AI Revolution with Unmatched Growth Potential  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is in 5th position on our list of\u00a030 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

Upgrade Now          Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) The Best Extremely Profitable Stocks to Buy According to Analyst?      Talha Qureshi   March 25, 2025 6 min read        1   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%     ^GSPC   +0.38%      We recently published a list of 11 Best Extremely Profitable Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best extremely profitable stocks to buy according to analysts. Fed\u2019s Response to Inflation and Growth Challenges We recently covered\u00a010 Best Stocks to Buy Now For the Long Term,\u00a0where we talked about the market outlook amidst the tariff situation and uncertainty. Here\u2019s a piece from the article: While the S&P 500 is hovering near correction territory, marking five years since its COVID-19 drawdown. Wyne noted that the risks appear evenly distributed between bullish and bearish outlooks. On one hand, the bears argue that softer economic data and rising consumer inflation expectations could worsen with tariff escalations, potentially leading to stagflation. On the other hand, bulls counter that weak sentiment data does not necessarily reflect hard economic indicators such as employment and retail sales, which remain robust. Wyne highlighted that bulls point out that long-term inflation expectations are still anchored near the Fed\u2019s target, mitigating risks of a wage spiral. He pointed out that historically speaking, investing during sentiment troughs has yielded strong returns in subsequent months.  Despite the market volatility, the Federal Reserve has decided to wait and see during the March 2025 Federal Open Market Committee meeting. On March 20, Cristina Dwyer, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Wealth Management, commented on the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to maintain the federal funds rate at 4.5%. She emphasized that this decision reflects the Fed\u2019s cautious approach in light of a resilient economy and moderating inflation trends. While inflation remains above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, core consumer prices have decelerated significantly over the past year, signaling progress in controlling price pressures. Dwyer noted that this steady economic backdrop allows the Fed to adopt a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d strategy, while carefully monitoring the effects of recent policy changes and external factors before making further adjustments.   Story Continues Dwyer also highlighted the Fed\u2019s decision to slow quantitative tightening by reducing its monthly cap on US Treasury redemptions from $25 billion to $5 billion starting in April. This move aligns with the broader efforts to balance monetary policy normalization without disrupting financial markets. However, she pointed out that uncertainty remains high due to recent tariff policies, which have contributed to elevated inflation projections for 2025.For investors, Dwyer underscored the importance of reassessing portfolios in light of these developments. She advised ensuring diversification and alignment with long-term financial goals, as economic uncertainty persists and interest rate adjustments are expected later in the year. Despite weaker economic projections in the Summary of Economic Projections, such as lower GDP growth and higher unemployment forecasts, Dwyer noted that the Fed remains optimistic about continued economic expansion within a resilient macroeconomic environment.Our MethodologyTo curate the list of 11 best extremely profitable stocks to buy according to analysts we used Finviz stock screener, CNN, and Morningstar. Using the screener we aggregated a list of stocks with more than 30% TTM net profit margins and analyst upside potential of at least 20%. Next, we cross-checked the TTM net profit margin for each stock from Morningstar and analyst upside potential from CNN. Lastly, we ranked these stocks in ascending order of analysts\u2019 average projected upside potential. We have also added hedge funds\u2019 sentiment around each stock. Please note that the data was recorded on March 21, 2025.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) The Best Extremely Profitable Stocks to Buy According to Analyst?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)TTM Net Profit Margin: 55.85%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223Analyst Upside Potential: 48.68%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading American multinational technology company that specializes in designing and producing graphics processing units, system-on-a-chip solutions, and artificial intelligence hardware and software. On March 21, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $168.The analyst noted that NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) advancements in AI accelerators, such as the Hopper platform and Blackwell B100/200 GPUs, are driving significant opportunities. Rakesh projects data center revenues to grow substantially, potentially reaching $280 billion by 2027, with NVIDIA maintaining its leadership in AI hardware. Moreover, Rakesh also likes the product innovation of the company. For instance, the introduction of cutting-edge products like the Rubin 3nm GPU and Vera CPU, featuring advanced capabilities like HBM4 support and enhanced networking, is expected to act as growth catalysts. As a result of these innovations, Rakesh has raised NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) fiscal 2025 revenue estimates to $120.4 billion and fiscal 2026 estimates to $159.6 billion, reflecting confidence in its growth trajectory. Moreover, the company has been able to maintain net profit margins of 55.85%, thereby making it one of the best extremely profitable stocks to buy according to analysts.Parnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q4 2024 investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead the market for graphics processing units and semiconductor chips needed to power AI applications. Because our position in the stock is an underweight relative to the nearly 12% of the benchmark it now represents, it was a relative detractor for the year.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of best extremely profitable stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA (NasdaqGS:NVDA) Fuels European AI Growth Through Green Data Centers      editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)   Thu, March 27, 2025 at 1:23 AM GMT+8 2 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       NVIDIA recently announced a collaboration with Fluidstack to deploy and manage Exascale clusters across Europe and Iceland, leveraging cutting-edge AI technology and sustainable energy solutions. This expansion aligns with the growing demand for AI infrastructures. Despite innovative moves, NVIDIA shares noted a 5% decline amidst a broader tech sector downturn, influenced by investor concerns over tariffs and recession fears impacting markets. As the market rose 3% over the past week, NVIDIA\u2019s price move of 4.56% suggests these strategic activities and adverse sector influences played conflicting roles in shaping the company's total shareholder returns. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 possible red flags for NVIDIA (of which 1 is potentially serious!) you should know about.   NasdaqGS:NVDA Earnings Per Share Growth as at Mar 2025   We've found 20 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yeild of over 6% next year. See the full list for free. The last five years have seen NVIDIA's total shareholder returns reach a very large 1738.16%, underlining significant growth. During this period, the company expanded into new sectors such as autonomous vehicles, sparked by partnerships with automotive giants like Toyota and Uber. This expansion into AI reasoning models and scaling of AI infrastructure contributed steadily to revenue growth, especially from data centers and automotive sectors. Furthermore, NVIDIA maintained a continuous stream of product innovations, most notably the launch of its cutting-edge GPUs like the DGX SuperPOD with Blackwell Ultra, which were pivotal in revolutionizing AI capabilities.  Despite regulatory challenges and tariff concerns that impacted growth potential temporarily, NVIDIA's focus on operational efficiency and the rapid ramp-up of Blackwell architecture production sustained its strong performance. As a result, NVIDIA exceeded the US Semiconductor industry and broader US market returns over the past year, showcasing its resilience amidst global industry challenges and investor concerns. In financial terms, NVIDIA reported annual earnings increasing to US$72.88 billion, reflecting a robust fiscal foundation that enhanced shareholder value significantly.

Upgrade Now          Was Jim Cramer Right About Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)?      Dionysis Partsinevelos   March 24, 2025 5 min read        2   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%     ^GSPC   +0.38%      We recently published a list of Was Jim Cramer Right About These 23 Stocks? In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed 12 months ago. In the most recent Mad Money episode, Jim Cramer shared his thoughts on the current state of the market, especially about AI stocks. He noted that despite the enthusiasm surrounding AI, investors are no longer willing to pay high prices for stocks tied to this technology. Cramer explained that on days like Tuesday, people in the market are feeling what he referred to as \u201cpainful shrinkage.\u201d \u201cIn this business, shrinkage means paying less for the same earnings that you were willing to pay up for only just a week or two ago.\u201d  READ ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Thoughts on These 5 Stocks\u00a0and\u00a0Was Jim Cramer Right About These 23 Stocks? He pointed out that this phenomenon is commonly known as price-to-earnings multiple compression, a widespread trend across the market. Cramer asked why this is happening, especially when it seems like nothing has changed with the companies themselves. He explained: \u201cLook, when everyone\u2019s terrified that a piano\u2019s about to fall on their heads, they don\u2019t want to get hit by the baby grand and right now they don\u2019t want to own the falling stocks either. So they sell but they can\u2019t get a good price anymore because too many people want out for the same reasons. They think that stocks are overpriced versus when we consider what could lay ahead.\u201d  Cramer further elaborated that there is a strong sense of apprehension in the market right now, with investors bracing for potential economic challenges. Despite good news that may come out about companies or the economy, people are reluctant to hold onto stocks because they are anticipating weakness down the road. He said that even though they cannot see it clearly, the ongoing concerns about the economy and the administration\u2019s messaging about necessary economic adjustments create a climate of fear. As Cramer put it, \u201cIf the administration keeps talking about how we\u2019re transitioning, how the economy needs to make some painful adjustments, then any big rally that we had Friday and yesterday will become magnets for sellers.\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s the bottom line: This latest round of multiple compression came on a day of wonderment about artificial intelligence, and even with Jensen\u2019s fabulous speech, multiple compression was just much more powerful. You know what? It\u2019s going to stay that way until we get through this environment, either because the White House backs off, or because stocks come down to the point where we simply get used to it.\u201d    Story Continues MethodologyFor this article, we compiled a list of 23 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on March 26, 2024. We then calculated their performance from March 26th, 2024, market close to March 18th, 2025, market close. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment for the stocks, which we sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database of over 900 hedge funds. The stocks are listed in the order that Cramer mentioned them.Please note that this article mentions Jim Cramer\u2019s previous opinions and may not account for any changes to his opinions regarding the stocks that are mentioned. It is primarily an examination of how his previously provided opinions have panned out.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223Continuing his segment on S&P 500 top performers, Cramer covered Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the world\u2019s dominant designer of GPUs and AI chips, as the second-best performer at the time but warned of short-term volatility.\u201cSpeaking of Nvidia, yes, it\u2019s the second-best performer in the S&P for the year even as it was down hard today as part of the broadening of the market [\u2026] One day though there\u2019s not a sell-off make, but I\u2019m just trying to make a point about what\u2019s been working beyond the stock of Nvidia.\u201d Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has performed well, gaining 26.67% since Cramer mentioned it.This past Tuesday, the 18th\u00a0of March, the host of Mad Money gave his thoughts on the stock:\u201cWell, we had a real test case today, didn\u2019t we?\u2026 When you put 17,500 NVIDIAns and friends\u2026 in San Jose, you\u2019d expect some sort of impact on the stock market or at least in the stock of NVIDIA but that sure didn\u2019t happen. Today, we learned that nothing\u2019s more powerful than multiple compression as NVIDIA\u2019s stock actually slid $4 and 10 cents. It declined 3.4%. I say ouch\u2026NVIDIA stock isn\u2019t cheap unless everything goes right and in this climate of fear environment, it\u2019s hard to see everything going right even for a company that is this special.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 22nd on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed 12 months ago. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to BillionairesDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Fund Manager Explains Why He\u2019s Buying Nvidia (NVDA), Admits \u2018Right Now It Looks Stupid\u2019      Fahad Saleem   March 20, 2025 5 min read        1   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending Stocks as AI Hype Fades. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top trending stocks as AI hype fades. The US stock market took a major hit recently due to tariff-related uncertainties and a broader concern about AI stock valuations. Jeff Sonnenfeld, Yale School of Management senior associate dean for leadership studies, recently talked about the latest data showing a decline in CEO sentiment amid President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing with the CEO community, it\u2019s not just the report you had this morning on the plunge in retail sentiment, the plunge in consumer sentiment, and CEO confidence indices by other indices such as Chief Executive Magazine. But we had 100 CEOs across sectors, 60% Republican, about 30% Democrat, 10% independent, and they were overwhelmingly discouraged. There\u2019s a lot of goodwill that had been accumulated after the election. Even though most large CEOs didn\u2019t support President Trump, they did rally and were encouraged to go down to Mar-a-Lago to talk about company-specific issues. The same thing happened in 2017. That goodwill dissipates quickly, and it\u2019s happening right now. 85% think these tariff moves are a disaster, even though they\u2019re in favor of tariffs. They want selective tariffs.\u201d  With tariff deadlines fast approaching, it would be interesting to see how the market reacts to potential changes in President Trump\u2019s policies and stance.

With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).   Fund Manager Explains Why He\u2019s Buying Nvidia (NVDA), Admits \u2018Right Now It Looks Stupid\u2019   Pixabay/Public Domain NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Funds Investors: 193 Jim Lebenthal, Chief Equity Strategist at Cerity Partners, said in a latest program on CNBC that he bought NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares recently. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is Microsoft is a great company\u2014NVIDIA is a great company\u2014you\u2019re getting these stocks now at really good prices. If you just look back from a year from now, you\u2019re going to probably feel these were very good buys. I bought Nvidia two weeks ago\u2014right now it looks stupid\u2014I get it. I\u2019m willing to hang on for a month and see how it looks after that.\u201d    Story Continues NVDA will remain under pressure in the coming quarters when the company will report unimpressive growth.Nvidia is facing challenges at several levels. Competition is one of them. Major competitors like Apple, Qualcomm, and AMD are vying for TSMC\u2019s 3nm capacity, which could limit Nvidia\u2019s access to these chips. Why? Because Nvidia also uses\u00a0 TSMC\u2019s 3nm process nodes. Nvidia is also facing direct competition from other giants that are deciding to make their own chips. Amazon, with its Trainium2 AI chips, offer alternatives. Trainium2 chips could provide cost savings and superior computational power, which could shift AI workloads away from Nvidia\u2019s offerings. Apple is reportedly working with Broadcom to develop an AI server processor. Intel is also trying hard to get back into the game with Jaguar Shores GPU process, set to be produced on its 18A or 14A node.Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q4 2024 investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to outperform the market during the fourth quarter. The technology giant and top position in the fund delivered on sky-high expectations during the quarter and reported quarterly expectations that exceeded expectations. The red-hot company provided forward-looking expectations which were regarded as slightly lackluster as compared to prior quarters that smashed expectations. While the stock did churn a bit in the quarter, the AI giant remains top of mind for investors, especially as the company is on pace to satisfy the \u2018staggering\u2019 demand for its new product, Blackwell, which is poised to enter the market over the next year. The company\u2019s position of owning all the major pieces of the evolving AI data center enables it to strengthen its competitive position and to define the technology roadmap for generations to come.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of top trending stocks as AI hype fades. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to BillionairesDisclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          Analyst Explains Why His Firm Has Sold Its Entire Nvidia (NVDA) Position      Larry Ramer   Wed, March 26, 2025 at 10:03 PM GMT+8 1 min read        10   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       Companies in general and the large cloud infrastructure providers in particular may spend less on Nvidia's (NVDA) chips going forward, Ali Mogharabi, Senior Equity Analyst for WestEnd Capital Management said on Schwab Network yesterday. The transition that's being made from training computers for AI to using them for inference will enable these firms to spend less on Nvidia's \"most recent, most powerful chips,\" Mogharabi theorized.   Analyst Sees \u2018Sign of Momentum\u2019 for NVIDIA (NVDA), Says It\u2019s \u2018Best of Breed\u2019   Against that background, WestEnd has sold all of its NVDA stock, he noted. Other negative catalysts for the chip maker include the fact that the large cloud companies are making their own chips and continued geopolitical issues that could place downward pressure on the multiple of NVDA stock, the analyst stated. Amid all of these factors, along with other macro uncertainties, NVDA's growth could \"decelerate very rapidly,\" the analyst suggested. Mogharabi indicated that he would consider buying the stock again if it falls below $100. Such a price would be \"low enough to account for how pressured the valuation multiples are for various reasons,\" he explained. \"The slowdown in demand from the cloud providers\" for NVDA's newest chips \"could be priced in at that level,\" the analyst added. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. \u00a0 READ NEXT:\u00a020 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires Disclosure: None.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA (NVDA) Introduces Next-Gen AI Chips at GTC Conference      Ghazal Ahmed   March 24, 2025 4 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%     TCEHY   +1.16%      We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks Making Waves: GTC Highlights & Beyond. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks that are making waves with insights on GTC highlights. A new open-source model from Mistral AI is shaking things up in the tech world. This groundbreaking model outperforms comparable models like Gemma 3 and GPT-4o Mini, delivering inference speeds of 150 tokens per second. Mistral Small 3.1 surpasses the performance of leading small proprietary models across dimensions such as handling text, understanding multimodal inputs, supporting multiple languages, and managing long contexts, all that with low latency and cost efficiency.  Shifting focus to China, Tencent has recently captured attention with its suite of new artificial intelligence tools capable of converting text and images into 3D visuals. The company has released five open-source models based on its Hunyuan3D-2.0 technology, including \u201cturbo\u201d versions that can generate 3D visuals within 30 seconds while maintaining high precision and quality. READ ALSO:\u00a010 AI Stocks Turning Heads on Wall Street\u00a0and\u00a010 AI Stocks to Keep on Your Radar Like many other Chinese firms, Tencent is advancing China\u2019s position in the AI arms race by expanding its capital expenditures. According to Tencent President Martin Lau, capital spending would rise to the \u201clow teens\u201d as a percentage of revenue, and artificial intelligence will be a key focus of strategic investments. \u201cWe will continue to increase our AI investments, increasing investment in our proprietary Hunyuan model while expanding our contributions in multimodal and open-source capabilities.\u201d \u2013Martin Lau.  Meanwhile, once an AI leader in China, Baidu is also striving hard to regain its position in the tech world. The company has released two new free-to-use artificial intelligence models, including its first reasoning-focused model. The move comes ahead of its plans to move toward an open-source strategy. According to an article by\u00a0The Financial Times\u00a0on why China is suddenly flooding the markets with AI models, retaliation appears to be the driving force. When the US tightened its grip on advanced artificial intelligence technologies in January, it blocked off China\u2019s access to advanced AI chips and locked proprietary models behind trade barriers.  Even though it seemed that China would retaliate by doubling down on secrecy, it\u2019s doing quite the opposite, and with good reason. Chinese tech groups are seemingly creating an ecosystem where developers can continuously revamp their models. Provided open-source becomes powerful enough, there would be no reason to pay for closed models if free, equally capable alternatives exist.   Story Continues For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points \u00a0(see more details here).  NVIDIA (NVDA) Introduces Next-Gen AI Chips at GTC Conference  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services. The company has announced new chips for building and deploying artificial intelligence models at its annual GTC conference on Tuesday, March 18th. The upgrade to Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell chip \u2014 dubbed Blackwell Ultra, will be shipped in the second half of this year. Meanwhile, Vera Rubin, the company\u2019s next-generation graphics processing unit, or GPU, is expected to ship in 2026.\u201cThis last year is where almost the entire world got involved. The computational requirement, the scaling law of AI, is more resilient, and in fact, is hyper-accelerated.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of AI stocks that are making waves with insights on GTC highlights. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to BillionairesDisclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks that are making headlines this week. China is aggressively working to close the AI competitiveness gap with the United States. According to CEO of Chinese startup 01.AI Lee Kai-fu, the country is now as close as three months in some areas. This is because companies such as DeepSeek have figured out how to use chips and apply algorithms more efficiently.  Lee has told Reuters that startup DeepSeek has said that China has pulled ahead in areas such as infrastructure software engineering, severely challenging the US\u2019s attempts to hold back China's AI sector through its sanctions.

And now I think that's probably three months behind in some of the core technologies, but actually ahead in some specific areas.\"  At the same time, a report by MIT Technology Review reveals how 80% of China\u2019s newly built computing resources remain unused. \u201cThe growing pain China\u2019s AI industry is going through is largely a result of inexperienced players\u2014corporations and local governments\u2014jumping on the hype train, building facilities that aren\u2019t optimal for today\u2019s need.\u201d  That said, energy is being wasted, data centers have become \u201cdistressed assets,\u201d but the country is doing all it can to stay ahead in the AI arms race. While sanctions from the US had been successful in curbing China\u2019s progress toward AI, they were only successful in the short term. The country has now learned to operate under constraints, developing its own algorithms and open-sourcing technologies to reduce reliance on Western technology. Some experts even assert that China\u2019s open-sourcing strategy may become strong enough to challenge the West\u2019s model of AI monetization. \"The fact that DeepSeek are able to figure out the chain of thought with a new way to do reinforcement learning is either catching up with the U.S., learning quickly, or maybe even more innovative now.\"  For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points \u00a0(see more details here).   Story Continues   Gets Bullish Nod From Melius \u2013 Here\u2019s Why the Cisco Deal Matters  A close-up of a computer chip, its intricate components safeguarding digital security.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services. On March 26, Melius reiterated Nvidia as \u201cBuy,\u201d stating that it\u2019s bullish on the partnership between Nvidia and Cisco.\u201cHowever, Cisco\u2019s latest 2 announcements with Nvidia showcase how its customers can invest in Cisco\u2019s front-end networking gear and its software \u2014 and know it will work on the back-end with Nvidia\u2019s [graphics processing units]. Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of AI stocks that are making headlines this week. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to BillionairesDisclosure: None.

Year-to-date, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have tumbled despite bullish analyst calls and a packed GTC keynote. On Wednesday, one wealth manager warned the AI trade is overcrowded and ripe for a pullback.  What Happened: On the day when Nvidia and other chip stocks declined, Michael Landsberg, chief investment officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management, offered a contrarian view on AI-driven tech stocks. \"I wouldn't buy tech here on the dip,\" Landsberg told Reuters' Lisa Bernhard, following Nvidia's GTC 2025 keynote. \"We're in a trend now where the economy is slowing a bit, there's concern about tariffs, and bluntly, everybody and their brother owns these names. So what\u2019s happened is there\u2019s an overexposure to them.\" Don't Miss: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. This Startup Is On The Brink Of A Huge Disruption To The $654 Billion Industry \u2013 Invest In It Before It Fulfills 800 Pre-Orders  While analysts remain bullish on Nvidia's long-term prospects\u2014citing a robust product roadmap, AI leadership, and strong demand\u2014Landsberg believes the short-term picture tells a different story. He added that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang can't simply wave his hand and just kind of get the stock to move higher, noting that macroeconomic pressures and saturation in AI-related holdings are weighing on sentiment.

Why It's Important: Landsberg's comments highlight growing caution around the AI trade, despite Nvidia\u2019s roadmap extending through 2028 and analysts projecting long-term growth in data center spending.  \"There's not really a real impetus to buy,\" Landsberg said, adding that when growth is slowing and tariffs are looming, there are better places to look\u2014like Europe. A series of announcements at the GTC AI Conference in San Jose, California did little to boost Nvidia Corp.\u2019s stock on Tuesday, as shares fell by 3.43% during regular hours. Since the launch of DeepSeek on Jan. 10, the chipmaker has seen its market value shrink by $420 billion.   Story Continues However, JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur believes Nvidia continues to lead in AI acceleration, staying one to two steps ahead of its competitors.Photo Courtesy: Shutterstock.comRead Next:If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

Separately, Musk posted to X on Friday evening that his AI firm xAI has bought his social site X in a stock deal valuing the latter at $33 billion.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA (NVDA) Breaks Barriers with Advanced AI Networking      Ghazal Ahmed   March 25, 2025 5 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI Stocks You Need to Watch: News & Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. Nvidia\u2019s annual software developer conference, GTC, is in full swing. With its latest announcements, the company is doing all it can to assure investors of its dominance in the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence industry. On Tuesday, CEO Jensen Huang delivered a keynote address in front of a packed hockey stadium in San Jose, California.  He noted how he believes that humanoid robots are less than five years away from wide use in manufacturing facilities. In this regard, he unveiled software tools that would reportedly help humanoid robots navigate the world more easily. Huang talked about humanoid robots when asked what signs would show that AI had become ubiquitous. Huang said it may be \"when, literally, humanoid robots are wandering around, which is not five years away. This is not five-years-away problem, this is a few-years-away problem.\"  READ ALSO: 10 High-Flying AI Stocks to Watch Today and 10 AI Stocks to Keep on Your Radar Huang asserted that the manufacturing industry is probably going to be the first to adopt humanoid robots. This is because it has well-defined tasks that robots can easily handle in a controlled environment. \"I think it ought to go to factories first. And the reason for that is because the domain is much more guard-railed, and the use case is much more specific. The value of it is very, very easy to determine. The going rate for renting a human robot is probably $100,000 and I think it's pretty good economics.\"  The chipmaker's CEO reportedly has big plans for the AI data center industry too. Debuting silicon photonics networking systems, Huang noted that their Spectrum-X and Quantum-X photonics can join hundreds and even thousands of GPUs, enabling data center companies to deploy up to 1 million GPU clusters. Huang further noted how those million cluster data centers will be connected to other million-dollar data centers nearby to form massive data center facilities. \u201cOver the next several years, we're going to be building giant AI factories. Not normal AI factories \u2026 ones you see from space.\u201d  The GTC keynote also talked about the company\u2019s latest advancements, from Spectrum-X and Quantum-X photonics to Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin Superchips, which are going to help customers operate powerful AI systems to drive better revenue opportunities. \u201cAI factories are directly related to revenue, and if the throughput is not good, your revenue is hurt. If you don't have enough capacity, your revenue is hurt.

NVIDIA (NVDA) Introduces Next-Gen AI Chips at GTC Conference  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services. With the GTC Conference in full gear, Nvidia has unveiled its latest NVIDIA Spectrum-X\u2122 and NVIDIA Quantum-X silicon photonics networking switches. These switches are designed to enable AI factories to connect millions of GPUs across sites, all while significantly reducing energy consumption and operational costs.NVIDIA photonics switches claim to be one of the world\u2019s most advanced networking solutions, integrating optics innovations with 4x fewer lasers to deliver 3.5x more power efficiency, 63x greater signal integrity, 10x better network resiliency at scale, and 1.3x faster deployment when compared with traditional methods. The company\u2019s silicon photonics ecosystem comprises big names such as TSMC, Browave, Coherent, Corning Incorporated, Fabrinet, Foxconn, Lumentum, SENKO, SPIL, Sumitomo Electric Industries and TFC Communication.\u201cAI factories are a new class of data centers with extreme scale, and networking infrastructure must be reinvented to keep pace. By integrating silicon photonics directly into switches, NVIDIA is shattering the old limitations of hyperscale and enterprise networks and opening the gate to million-GPU AI factories.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of\u00a0 AI Stocks you need to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Upgrade Now          NVIDIA (NVDA): Among the Top Growth Stocks in David Tepper\u2019s Portfolio      Neha Gupta   Mon, March 31, 2025 at 6:52 AM GMT+8 6 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%     ^GSPC   +0.38%      We recently published a list of Top 10 Growth Stocks in David Tepper\u2019s Portfolio. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top growth stocks in David Tepper\u2019s Portfolio. Buy \u201ceverything\u201d related to China has been David Tepper\u2019s investment theme despite the uncertainties about the economy amid a trade spat with the US. The president and founder of\u00a0Appaloosa Management LP\u00a0believes China\u2019s economy is well-positioned to bounce back from the COVID-19-triggered slowdown. \u201cEverything. ETFs, I would do futures \u2014 everything. Everything,\u201d Tepper said during an interview on CNBC when asked about which Chinese equities.  Consequently, Appaloosa Management LP\u2019s portfolio has built significant exposure to Chinese equities, with the biggest holding offering exposure to the country\u2019s internet landscape. The investment strategy is increasingly paying off as Chinese stocks have enjoyed a bull run in response to Beijing unveiling a sweep of measures aimed at boosting economic growth.

With 5.4% growth in the fourth quarter of 2024, China\u2019s economy exceeded expectations thanks to Beijing\u2019s stimulus policies, which included interest rate reductions. Investors are awaiting information on further fiscal assistance for the struggling real estate sector and consumer demand. Increased focus on Chinese equities affirms Tepper\u2019s philosophy, which often revolves around contrarian views on the market. His focus on Chinese equities comes amid growing concerns that they would be hit hard as the US imposes significant trade tariffs on China in a bid to trim the trade deficit between the two economic powerhouses. Amid the concerns, the founder of Appaloosa Management LP insists on the need to deploy significant risk management to offset the impacts of the ongoing trade war. Similarly, Tepper has already emphasized the need to stay invested in bull markets, which appear and remain calm during market downturns, as the one in play in the US. US equities have been under immense pressure in the first quarter of 2025, which is attributed to uncertainties about US trade wars and the reluctance of the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. The S&P 500 has already shed nearly 3% in value and is on course to record its first quarterly decline since July of 2023. The selloff in the US equity markets also comes at the backdrop of disappointing financial results from some companies that have been reported. Market participants have also not been impressed by the guidance that signals potential weakness across the board amid deteriorating macroeconomics.   Story Continues \u201cYou know there\u2019s this negative bias out there. You just don\u2019t know to what degree,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut. Analysts are becoming increasingly wary regarding US corporate profits for the first quarter of this year, as policies from the Trump administration pose a risk of igniting a global trade conflict that could hinder economic expansion. Predictions for the S&P 500\u2019s performance in the first quarter of 2025 have decreased by 4.5 percentage points, marking the most significant downward adjustment since the last quarter of 2023, according to his remarks.Earnings growth for S&P 500 firms is now projected to be 7.7% compared to the previous year, which would represent the lowest rate since the third quarter of 2023 and a substantial drop from 17.1% in the final quarter of 2024, according to data from LSEG released on Friday.\u201cA lot of people are worried about things like tariffs \u2026 Really, it\u2019s a broad economic slowdown that is the one thing that would be very difficult for companies to contend with,\u201d said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.

Shares of Meta (META) and Nvidia (NVDA) rose 3.7% and 3.1%, respectively, while AMD (AMD) stock rose 6.9% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 2.3% to kick off the final full week of trading for the month of March.

The administration is also reportedly set to limit some industry-specific tariffs that were set to take effect, including those on cars and chips. In the tech world, news early Monday out of China that Ant Group, the Jack Ma-backed tech conglomerate, has trained cheaper AI models using Chinese-made chips and those from AMD was the latest sign the AI race continues to push new boundaries.  Speaking last week at its GTC Conference, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the introduction of lower-cost models \u2014 like those most notably put forth by China's DeepSeek \u2014 shows the computing needs for AI are actually higher than previously thought. Nvidia's chips are also subject to an export ban from the US in China. Read more about Nvidia's stock moves and today's market action. Earlier this year, Nvidia stock fell over 16% in a single day after DeepSeek's R1 model matched the performance of higher-cost AI models like those from OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) at a fraction of the cost.   Jensen Huang, head of the chip company Nvidia, appears at the GTC developer event. (Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty Images)  \u00b7 picture alliance via Getty Images In the weeks since these developments, the industry has seen similar breakthroughs in the same vein as that vocalized by Huang. These reflect the larger-than-imagined potential of even deeper AI investments rather than exposing the limits of current plans. (See also: Jevons Paradox.) Also in tech news, a South Korean AI chip startup FuriosaAI reportedly rejected an $800 million offer from Meta. This takes a potential headache away from Meta shareholders, who might have to price in regulatory overhangs and integration costs, and shows AI startups have plenty of confidence to explore the market independently.  Tech-specific developments, though a boost for the AI trade on the margins, still take a back seat to trade news. And though AI may not be the clearest fundamental winner or loser due to Trump's tariffs, tech's central role in the stock market rally since late 2022 has seen these stocks retain their leadership position on the way up and the way down.

Morning Brief Anchors Madison Mills and Brad Smith discuss the report in the video above. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.  Video Transcript  00:00 Speaker A Nvidia facing potentially trick stricter regulations on its chips coming from China. According to a report from the Financial Times, regulators in China have been discouraging the country's tech companies from purchasing Nvidia's H20 chip since it breaches energy efficiency rules. Meantime, the US adding dozens of Chinese companies to a trade blacklist over national security concerns. Now we don't have full clarity over those names that are blacklisted yet. We should be getting that clarity throughout the week here. But I think this is intrinsically tied to the tariff tit for tat that we were seeing between the US and China. I covered this a lot when I was living in the Middle East, uh at my prior position at Bloomberg News here. And one thing that became very clear to me in that time is that China utilizes kind of these soft power rules and things like export controls. They're blaming this on energy efficiency. We know that China is the biggest emitter of carbon in the entire world. So I doubt that they are having an energy efficiency push in their government. It seems like this is a soft power play to put some pressure on the US amid what is an escalating tit for tat with China right now. President Trump has not really focused on China's, instead focusing on tariffs with Canada and Mexico and then metals of course, uh if that tariff tit for tat does kind of escalate, we could potentially see more headlines like this.02:07 Speaker B Yeah, this is essentially part of a reversion to what took place under Trump 1.0 in the establishment of the export control reform act of 2018. And ultimately, as you're looking across some of this in implementation, the reason why it matters this time is because one of the core thesis around the trade for the broader markets or the broader conviction trade had been around semiconductors. And so with that in mind and that now overflowing into semiconductors beyond just what were the, you know, hot topics back then to really reel into this broader export reform control or control reform act back then, I think that's where the markets have to price in a little bit more of, once again, what comes out of Pennsylvania Avenue and what ultimately gets Marlago in some cases and what gets prioritized as the new target, um at least in this interim period. Nvidia has come up in one form or another and especially over the tail end of the Biden administration, plus the early innings of the Trump administration.03:55 Speaker A And kind of the back and forth with these regulations leave companies just running to keep track with the changing rules. Nvidia, as part of this Financial Times reporting, they said that they did prepare a solution to alter their H20 chips to be able to comply with these new energy efficiency rules coming out of Beijing, but that could hurt the performance of those chips, which is everything. Yeah. for Nvidia. So what will that look like for their competitive advantage against any, you know, Chinese tech giants as well. I think it's going to be really interesting to watch.

Upgrade Now          Veteran fund manager offers blunt take after Nvidia stock drop      Todd Campbell   Fri, March 28, 2025 at 7:17 AM GMT+8 5 min read        26   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%       The artificial intelligence spending frenzy has catapulted Nvidia's share price and turned Nvidia into a household name akin to Google and Apple. There's been a tsunami of interest in AI research and development following the highly successful launch of\u00a0OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022, and, as a result, demand for Nvidia's high-end semiconductors, which are better suited to handling the heavy workloads associated with training and operating AI programs than CPUs traditionally found in networks, has ballooned.  Investors have profited handsomely from the revenue and profit growth.\u00a0Nvidia's stock price has gained a remarkable 660%, including a 171% return in 2024, since 2022. Related: AI CEO issues grave warning about the future of Nvidia Those returns have been game-changing for many, but it's been much rockier in 2025. Shares are down 25% since their peak on January 6 on worries demand for its next generation graphics chips are peaking. Nvidia's drop has surprised a lot of investors, but long-time Wall Street hedge fund manager Doug Kass isn't among them. In December, Kass predicted Nvidia's rally would \"abruptly end\" in 2025\u00a0as \"it grows clear that double and tripling ordering buoyed the company's past reported top and bottom lines.\" Kass's prescient prediction stems from experiencing more than his share of good and bad markets over a 50-year career, including as research director for Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors. He's seem plenty of great stocks come and go over the years, making his latest words on Nvidia's stock worth considering.   TheStreet   Nvidia benefits from massive AI-driven demand Artificial intelligence isn't a new concept. The prospect of computers thinking for themselves has been the subject of conversation since mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing researched designing AI computers and the Rand Corporation created the first AI program in 1950s. Related: Fund manager who correctly predicted stocks rally delivers blunt 8-word update Many science fiction books and movies, from Isaac Asimov's iRobot to The Terminator and others, have explored AIs risks and benefits over the past 70 years.  However, only recently has AI's impact on people and business gone mainstream thanks to ChatGPT and the success of competing large language models, including Alphabet's Gemini. Banks like JP Morgan Chase are using AI to hedge risks, drugmakers are examining its use in developing medicines, retailers are evaluating whether it can curb theft and improve supply chains, and militaries\u00a0are exploring AI's use on the battlefield.   Story Continues Every day, millions of Americans are turning to AI chatbots to answer questions and succinctly explain topics, and increasingly, businesses are deploying agentic AI programs to complement or replace workers.To tap into increasing use, big technology companies are plowing incredible sums into IT budgets. For instance,\u00a0Microsoft, Google, and Amazon capital expenditures were $192 million last year, up from $117 billion in 2023.A lot of those extra dollars went to Nvidia to access its software and graphic processing units, or GPUs.\u00a0Sales of H100, H200, and the latest Blackwell AI chips have catapulted annual revenue to over $130 billion (up 114% year-over-year) from $27 billion in 2023. Meanwhile, net income has increased to nearly $73 billion from less than $5 billion in 2023.Nvidia encounters speed bumps in 2025Nvidia markets its AI chips globally, but\u00a0a key market, China, has shrunk following strict export regulations\u00a0designed to limit the sale of next-gen technology from U.S. companies to potential rivals overseas.China represents about 10% Nvidia's data center sales, and according to CEO Jensen Huang, that's \"about half of what it was before the export control.\"Nvidia is also facing competition, including from Advanced Micro Devices and specially designed chips made by Broadcom and others.More Nvidia:Nvidia stock: The AI tailwind could just be getting started Nvidia stakes out aggressive future, despite investor unease AI bet from tech upstart could be a major blow to Nvidia In 2024, AMD's data center segment sales totaled a record $12.6 billion, prompting CEO Lisa Su to say, \"Looking into 2025, we see clear opportunities for continued growth based on the strength of our product portfolio and growing demand for high-performance and adaptive computing.\u201dSu has predicted the AI-GPU market will grow by an average of 73% annually to $400 billion through 2027.Another concern is that Nvidia demand is inflated by companies over-ordering in hopes of getting allocated hard-to-get chips.And worry is mounting that overbuilding capacity will become increasingly evident following the launch last month of DeepSeek, a Chinese ChatGPT rival that was reportedly developed using older chips for just $6 million.If those concerns weren't enough, Nvidia's profit margin has recently been pressured by ramping capacity of its latest Blackwell chips. In the\u00a0fourth-quarter, gross margin shrunk to 73% from 76% a year earlier.Veteran fund manager offers blunt warningKass considers himself a \"contrarian with a calculator.\" He's most comfortable buying stocks when others are selling.Despite Nvidia's poor performance this year, he still thinks there may be more pain to come.\"People are buying four times more infrastructure than they need. The better the GPU, the higher the failure rates and this fragility causes significant cluster under-performance with high cost,\" wrote Kass in his TheStreet Pro diary.Kass's research suggests Nvidia's solution to failure rates is buying more to compensate, a strategy that certainly doesn't sound overly sound.\"This stuff is incredibly expensive and not working right (obviously) and NVDA is just resorting to \u2013 \u201cBUY MORE OF WHAT AIN'T WORKING!\u201d There is massive negative return on investment to the current architecture; how does spending more money solve that problem?,\" said Kass.If Kass is correct that hyperscalers like Amazon and Microsoft have been investing too greedily in AI capacity, then it wouldn't be shocking if there's a major reset in IT budgets, and that wouldn't be good news for Nvidia.Adding to that concern are recent reports that Microsoft, one of the largest hyperscalers, is reining in some of its data center projects. According to TD Cowen,\u00a0Microsoft has cancelled or deferred data center leases on capacity concerns.Related: Veteran fund manager unveils eye-popping S&P 500 forecast  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy Dashboard   More Info  Recommended Stories     These Are The Five Best Stocks To Buy And Watch Now Buying a stock is easy, but buying the right stock without a good strategy is incredibly hard.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia stock rises as GTC leaves Wall Street analysts 'comfortable with long term AI demand'      Laura Bratton    Updated March 20, 2025 4 min read        58   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   +1.63%     ^SOX   +0.28%      Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose more than 2% Wednesday, stemming losses from a two-day slide that saw shares drop 5% as the AI chipmaker\u2019s annual GTC event failed to excite investors amid a broader market downturn. Nvidia stock\u2019s reversal comes as Wall Street analysts walked away from CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s closely watched GTC 2025 keynote Tuesday optimistic about the company\u2019s roadmap and AI demand, doubling down on their bullish outlooks on the chipmaker in notes to investors. Those outlooks counter broader concerns about long-term AI demand and more efficient AI models reducing the need for computing hardware such as Nvidia\u2019s acclaimed GPUs (graphics processing units, or AI chips).

Huang reiterated that he sees data center spending on compute hardware (i.e., Nvidia\u2019s total addressable market) reaching $1 trillion.  \u201cI've said before that I expect data center build-out to reach $1 trillion. And I am fairly certain we're going to reach that very soon,\u201d he told a large crowd. During a Q&A session with analysts, Huang added that he expects companies to pour \"trillions of dollars\" into building what he calls \"AI factories,\" or colossal data centers dedicated to power artificial intelligence. \"The world is moving from the general purpose computing platform to GPU accelerated computing platform,\" he told analysts Wednesday. \"Whatever the capex of the world, it is very, very certain that our percentage of that is going to be much higher going forward.\" Bernstein\u2019s Stacy Rasgon wrote in his own note to investors Wednesday morning, \u201cThe roadmap looks really solid, and their capability gap vs competitors across their entire massive stack continues to widen.\u201d   Story Continues Huang also seemed to convince analysts of his belief that cheaper, cost-efficient AI models (e.g., that of China\u2019s DeepSeek) won\u2019t hurt AI chip demand.Read more: How does Nvidia make money?  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers the keynote for the Nvidia GPU Technology Conference (GTC) at the SAP Center in San Jose, Calif., on March 18. (Reuters/Brittany Hosea-Small)  \u00b7 Reuters / ReutersJPMorgan (JPM) analyst Harlan Sur said in a note early Wednesday, \u201cJensen Huang presented a compelling case on how innovations in AI models, such as DeepSeek, will drive higher compute complexity and necessitate increasing compute demand.\"Some were more skeptical following GTC.\u201cThere was little commentary comparing the use cases [of Nvidia's GPUs] vs. peers or ASICs [custom chips made by companies such as Broadcom seen as competition for Nvidia's GPUs],\u201d Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis wrote late Tuesday, adding that Vera Rubin \u201cwill only be an incremental update in 2026 with Rubin Ultra the more meaningful leap ahead in 2027.\u201dStill, Curtis wrote, \u201cThe pace of innovation throughout the rack from GPU performance to power continues to show why NVDA will remain the leader in AI,\u201d reiterating his Buy rating and $185 price target on the stock.Despite Nvidia's rise on the day, the stock is still down around 15% over the past month.The stock's decline comes amid a broader slump in Big Tech stocks, which has led a wide-scale market downturn as the Trump administration's policies fuel macroeconomic uncertainty and recession fears.Huang attempted to dispel fears over a faltering AI trade, telling analysts Wednesday, \"If there's a recession, I think that the companies that are working on AI is going to shift more \u2014 even more investment towards AI, because it's the fastest growing.\"Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
