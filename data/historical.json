Chinese firms continue to announce AI breakthroughs that create headwinds for US megacaps.The move: Baidu's American depository receipts climbed 1.23% in pre-market trading on Monday, reaching $94.97 per share. The Chinese search engine firm is up 11.62% year-to-date.\n\nWhy: The firm's US-listed shares are gaining after it announced Ernie X1, an artificial intelligence model on par with China's breakthrough DeepSeek tool. Ernie, which can reason, analyze, and generate images, is said to be as capable as DeepSeek but cheaper to run.Baidu also revealed an update to its foundational AI model, Ernie 4.5, which it claims can outperform OpenAI's GPT-4.5.\n\nThe Chinese internet firm has been one of the earliest AI competitors in the country.What it means: Ernie X1 is the latest development in a long line of AI releases coming out of China. In March alone, Alibaba showed off its own DeepSeek rival, while others, such as Tencent, have also revealed AI tools.These haven't been happy developments for American tech mega-caps, which increasingly seem to be cost-inefficient compared to Chinese rivals. When DeepSeek's cheaper model shook Wall Street in January, investors began reassessing the sustainability of massive AI spending.\n\nThat's also sparked questions about hardware demand, creating a headwind for dominant chipmakers, such as Nvidia. The flagship AI chip maker is down 9% this year.Meanwhile, a sentiment shift in Beijing may also be helping Chinese equities, particularly tech. After a lasting regulatory tech crackdown from China's top brass, the government has recently signaled an embrace of its tech sector. The result has been a student resurgence in China's stock market after investors fled in 2024. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Market\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider\n      subscribers.

Register for this free strategy session today.\r\nArista Networks Inc ANET has seen a recent pullback with the stock down about 25% over the past month. But JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee sees it as an opportunity rather than a red flag.\nHe's adding the stock to the firm\u2019s Analyst Focus List, pointing to upside potential fueled by AI-driven Ethernet adoption in data centers. \u201cInvestors are overestimating the risks from Nvidia Corp NVDA and White Box competitors,\u201d\nChatterjee stated, maintaining an Overweight rating with a $140 price target \u2014 implying a significant upside from current levels.\nArista stock closed the trading day, Friday, at $83.51 a share. That\u2019s an upside of approximately 68%.\nRead Also: Cisco, Nvidia, Arista Tackle Tariff Turmoil: Who\u2019s Best Positioned?\nArista Stock: Pullback Presents A Buy Opportunity\nAccording to Chatterjee, the recent decline in Arista stock stemmed from broader AI spending concerns among cloud customers and fears of competition from White Box companies. \nHowever, he argues that these worries are overstated. \u201cArista's AI-driven networking demand remains strong, and market fears are not aligned with long-term fundamentals,\u201d he said. \nTrading at 28x 2026 consensus EPS, Arista stock isn\u2019t cheap, but with earnings growth ahead and potential multiple expansion, the stock remains well-positioned for gains.\nValuation Retraces, But Growth Potential Remains\nWhile Arista stock\u2019s premium valuation reflected its high growth expectations, recent weakness has erased much of that premium. Currently trading at 33x next-twelve-month P/E, close to its historical average, Arista stock still offers room for appreciation as AI-related Ethernet adoption accelerates in 2026 and beyond. \n\u201cWe believe the stock\u2019s premium valuation is justified given its dominant role in high-speed Ethernet switching for AI workloads,\u201d Chatterjee noted.\nSeasonal Weakness, But Second-Half Strength?\nHistorically, Arista stock underperforms in the first half of the year due to conservative guidance practices. However, the second half tends to see stronger performance, with guidance raises playing a key role. \n\u201cOur confidence in Arista's second-half rebound remains high, particularly as AI-driven deployments ramp up,\u201d Chatterjee said. \nInvestors looking for AI-driven upside may find upcoming earnings reports to be the catalyst needed to reinforce confidence in the stock's trajectory.\nArista Vs. Nvidia: Market Share Concerns Overstated\nA key question among investors is whether Nvidia's dominance in AI networking could hinder Arista's growth. Chatterjee pushes back against this concern, highlighting Arista's strong presence in front-end networks and ongoing market share gains. \n\u201cWhile Nvidia dominates the AI accelerator market, Arista continues to win share in the Ethernet switching segment, which remains critical for AI infrastructure,\u201d he explained. \nDespite some revenue moderation from Meta Platforms Inc META in early 2024, Arista remains a critical supplier for AI-driven data centers, positioning it well for future growth.\nThe White Box Question\nWhite Box competitors have maintained a steady market share, but Arista's foothold with major cloud players remains strong. According to Chatterjee, White Box adoption outside top-tier cloud customers is limited due to software complexity, keeping Arista's competitive edge intact. \n\u201cThe software-driven differentiation Arista provides remains a key moat against commoditization,\u201d he added.\nWith AI data centers shifting toward Ethernet adoption and Arista\u2019s long-term growth intact, the current pullback presents an attractive entry point. \n\u201cWe see this as an opportunity for long-term investors, given Arista's clear path to AI infrastructure leadership,\u201d Chatterjee concluded. As market concerns fade and earnings momentum builds, he sees a compelling case for Arista stock's continued outperformance.\nRead Next: \n\nNvidia Dominance Continues As AI Demand Grows: Can Arista, Cisco Keep Up?\n\nImage: ShutterstockANETArista Networks Inc$85.822.77%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock \u2013 anytime.Reveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum72.48Growth47.32Quality75.13Value15.48Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewMETAMeta Platforms Inc$610.900.54%NVDANVIDIA Corp$123.381.40%Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

This includes\u00a0staff cuts to address what\u00a0he sees\u00a0as a slow-moving and bloated\u00a0middle management layer, according to a\u00a0Reuters report\u00a0on Monday.\nRevamping the manufacturing operations, which once exclusively produced chips, but now also cater to external clients like Nvidia, is one of Tan\u2019s key priorities.\nTan, who was previously a member of Intel\u2019s board and\u00a0CEO of chip design software\u00a0firm Cadence Design Systems CDNS is poised to lead the company after a decade of setbacks under previous CEOs. These missteps led to Intel missing out on the booming demand for AI processors and smartphone chips, allowing competitors like Arm Holdings and Nvidia to dominate these markets.\nUnder Tan\u2019s leadership, Intel is striving to enhance the performance of its manufacturing division, Intel Foundry, by actively securing new customers. The company also plans to restart the production of\u00a0chips that drive AI servers\u00a0and explore areas beyond servers, such as software, robotics, and AI foundation models.\nSEE ALSO: IBM CEO Arvind Krishna Says DeepSeek An Indicator Of What\u2019s To Come, Predicts AI Models Will Use Just 1% Of Today\u2019s Energy In 5 Years\nWhy It Matters: Despite the ambitious plans, Tan\u2019s strategy seems to be an enhancement of former CEO Pat Gelsinger\u2018s turnaround plan, which sought to reshape Intel into a contract chip manufacturer. However, Gelsinger\u2019s plan had to be scaled back due to cooling demand for Intel\u2019s core products.\nTan\u2019s appointment as CEO was announced on March 13, and it led to a surge in\u00a0Intel\u2019s stock. His incoming leadership and the proposed changes are seen as a potential turning point for Intel, which has been struggling to keep up with competitors in the rapidly evolving tech industry. In a town hall address held after his appointment, the CEO cautioned employees that the company will need to make \u201ctough decisions.\u201d\nAs Tan steps into his new role, the tech industry will be watching closely to see if his planned changes can turn around the fortunes of the ailing tech giant.\nIntel stock has surged more than 18% over the past 5 days to close at $24.05 on Friday, as per Benzinga Pro.\nIntel holds a momentum rating of 31.37% and a growth rating of 80.60%, according to\u00a0Benzinga's Proprietary Edge Rankings. The Benzinga Growth metric evaluates a stock\u2019s historical earnings and revenue expansion across multiple timeframes, prioritizing both long-term trends and recent performance.

As growing AI applications have been disrupting business, here is a list of AI-linked investment opportunities that investors could consider to increase their exposure.\nWhat Happened: During an interaction at South by Southwest or SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, Cuban said that it was pivotal to learn about AI to integrate it into business.\nAddressing the entrepreneurship-oriented youth, Cuban said, \u201cI would spend every waking minute learning about AI,\u201d when asked about advice for the next generation of business leaders.\nHe also used his own Instagram and TikTok feed as an example, stating that it consisted of AI hacks because of the rapid technological changes and AI adoption.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to have a business and how you integrate AI. But if you\u2019re just getting started, as you learn these things, it\u2019s so much easier to start,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhether you use Perplexity, Anthropic Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini. It doesn\u2019t matter, right?\u201d he said rhetorically stating that AI tools can \u201cspider everything\u201d from writing emails to doing sales calls.\nHowever he added that most people won\u2019t leverage the capabilities of AI, \u201cBut those people who put in the time are going to crush it,\u201d he said.\nSee Also: Warren Buffett Plans To Sell His Real Estate Brokerage, But It's \u2018Not\u2026 A Bet Against US Home Prices,' Says Analyst As Fed Expects To Keep Rates Unchanged\nWhy It Matters: The AI race has been intensifying worldwide. The popularity of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek triggered a selloff in AI-linked stocks and major AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp. NVDA in mid-January.\nWhile companies worldwide are finding a way for AI training and inferencing without using Nvidia\u2019s advanced chips, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that a Tsinghua University-linked team introduced an AI framework that can work on Chinese-made chips. \nQingcheng.AI and Tsinghua University unveiled Chitu, an LLM inference framework for Chinese chips, challenging Nvidia\u2019s GPUs by supporting models like DeepSeek-R1.\nThus, as AI gains more prominence and global firms strive to improve efficiency, here is a list of AI-exposed exchange-traded funds listed in the U.S. that investors could consider in the long term.\nETF NameYTD PerformanceOne Year PerformanceiShares US Technology ETF IYW-8.74%9.36%Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC-9.41%9.04%First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund FDN4.21%13.93%iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF IGM-7.70%10.80%iShares Global Tech ETF IXN-7.21%6.19%\nPrice Action: The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY and Invesco QQQ Trust ETF QQQ, which track the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 index, respectively, dropped in premarket on Monday.

It will run Monday through Friday at the San Jose Convention Center in San Jose, California, the heart of Silicon Valley. This annual happening is widely considered the world's leading AI event. Nvidia expects about 25,000 attendees in-person and 300,000 virtually.\nCEO Jensen Huang will deliver the keynote address at the SAP Center in San Jose on Tuesday, March 18, at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET. Folks who are not attending can watch virtually as the event will be livestreamed for free. (The livestream -- and a recording after the event -- will be accessible on Nvidia's investor relation website.)\nNvidia stock got a modest boost from last year's flagship GTC, as the chart below shows. Given the stock's pullback in 2025, investors are surely hoping for a repeat performance this year. (As of Friday, March 14, Nvidia stock is 18.6% off its all-time closing high, reached on Jan. 6.)\n\nGTC 2024 was held Sunday, March 17, through Thursday, March 21, 2024. Friday, March 22, is included in the chart since many investors would still be digesting the data shared at the event, and some Wall Street analysts might still be tweaking their target prices. Data by YCharts.\nWhat can investors expect from GTC 2025?\nInvestors can look forward to Nvidia announcing many new products and partnerships across its target markets: data center, gaming, automotive/robotics, and professional visualization (pro viz). The data center platform is likely to get the lion's share of conference time because it is Nvidia's largest and fastest-growing business. Moreover, it's the most heavily involved in AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor context, in the company's first quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended Jan. 26, 2025), the data center platform generated 90.5% of Nvidia's total revenue, with gaming, auto/robotics, and pro viz accounting for 6.5%, 1.4%, and 1.3%, respectively, of total revenue. (Total doesn't add up to 100% because Nvidia has a small \"other\" category.) \nMore specifically, investors can expect Nvidia to provide details about its next two generations of graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing AI and high-performance computing workloads: Blackwell Ultra and Rubin. Blackwell Ultra is slated to launch in the second half of this calendar year and Rubin -- which will have a new architecture -- is scheduled for a calendar-year 2026 release. Nvidia recently increased its cadence for launching new generations of data center GPUs to annually from about every other year.\nInvestors can expect Blackwell Ultra to have increased processing power compared to Blackwell, and can anticipate an even greater step-up from Blackwell Ultra to Rubin (named after American astronomer Vera Rubin). Demand for Nvidia's Blackwell chips has been \"extraordinary,\" as Huang said on the company's fiscal Q1 earnings call in late February, and investors should be able to look forward to similarly powerful demand for Blackwell Ultra and Rubin. \n\nImpressive slate of speakers\nThe event includes an impressive slate of speakers from:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia and other big-name public companies ranging from the Big Techs to top consumer goods companies. I'm guessing some of the consumer products companies that will be represented are using Nvidia's tech to deploy AI agents, as the relatively new agentic AI space is taking off rapidly.\nStart-ups that have been garnering much attention recently, including OpenAI. OpenAI's late 2023 launch of its GPT chatbot demonstrated generative AI's amazing capabilities. This event triggered a stampede among companies to obtain Nvidia's GPUs for enabling generative AI.\nAcademics and government officials working in AI and related realms.\n\nFor those interested in autonomous vehicles, I'll call out these speakers: RJ Scaringe, founder and CEO of Rivian and Drago Anguelov, V.P. and head of research at Waymo, Alphabet's driverless vehicle subsidiary.\nI'm particularly looking forward to the speakers who will talk about robotics as I believe humanoid robots will be the next Big Thing (along with self-driving vehicles).\nQuantum Day on March 20\nNvidia is holding its first Quantum Day at GTC on Thursday, March 20. Huang will host a panel of leaders from the quantum computing industry from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. PT. This event will be livestreamed and available on demand.\nThe promise of quantum computing is that it will be able to solve problems that current classical computers cannot, but there are major \"bugs\" to be worked out. Nvidia is doing work in the quantum space along with partners. These partnerships are primarily aimed at developing \"hybrid\" computers that use classical chips (GPUs) and quantum chips (qubits).\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

We're still in the early innings of the AI investment wave. We've barely scratched the surface of integrating AI into business and regular life, and there will be more development in this space over the next five years.\nAs a result, I think investors need to look at which stocks look like strong bargains, as the market is full of many opportunities to purchase the best AI stocks on sale.\nThe AI race is still in full swing\nI'm focusing on four companies that are key suppliers in the AI race: Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 0.64%), ASML (ASML 1.02%), Nvidia (NVDA -0.27%), and Broadcom (AVGO -0.51%). These are critical companies and without them, the AI revolution wouldn't look the same.\nI'll start with Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), as all roads lead to it. Taiwan Semiconductor is the world's leading chip foundry, and clients like Broadcom and Nvidia come to it with chip designs that they want to have fabricated. Because TSMC has leading technology and a strong track record for innovation, it's the top option in this space, which gives it great insight into what trends are occurring in the chip industry.\n\nOver the next five years, Taiwan Semiconductor's management expects AI-related revenue to grow at a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) pace. That's monster growth, but it makes sense in the grand scheme of things. TSMC expects its revenue compound annual growth rate to approach 20%, which is fantastic considering the company's size. \n\n\n\n\n\nThis massive demand is also why Taiwan Semiconductor announced an additional $100 billion investment, on top of the $65 billion it already committed, in building more facilities in the U.S. TSMC's management said the company is building where the demand is, and with its U.S. production facilities already selling out capacity through 2027, it's clear that the U.S. is a great place to build new factories. \nThis also boosts ASML, as ASML makes machines that every high-end chip fabricator needs. ASML's top machine is an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machine that helps lay the microscopic electrical traces on chips. Nobody in the world has ASML's technology, giving it a technological monopoly status. As a result, when TSMC announces capacity expansion, you should automatically think that ASML will benefit.\nNvidia and Broadcom are large customers of TSMC, and they are a large part of the reason it is projecting a massive increase in AI-related revenue growth. Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) that are incredibly useful for handling large and complex computing tasks like AI training. Nvidia has a strong grip on this market and shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nBroadcom has a similar product line, as it has helped some tech giants design custom AI accelerators called XPUs. XPUs can outperform GPUs in specific tasks, as a workload must be set up in a particular way to take full advantage of an XPU design. This makes them critical in developing AI models, but not the greatest at other workloads that GPUs can sometimes be assigned.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's a massive market for both of these products, and although they will be competing for sales, there's a large enough market that both of them can thrive.\nAll four of these companies have incredibly strong tailwinds blowing in their favor, and it would take a lot to derail the AI investment movement in the industry. As a result, I think all of these companies will be just fine over the long term. But right now, each one looks like it can be purchased for a great price.\nAll the stocks are much cheaper than they've been over the past year\nBecause each company is growing so much, I'll focus on its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is a better measure of where a company is going.\n\nASML PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is clearly the cheapest, at less than 20 times forward earnings, which is an unbelievable bargain. If you would make me choose one stock from this group of four, it would undoubtedly be TSMC.\nHowever, the price tags on ASML, Nvidia, and Broadcom are also much cheaper than they've been in the past, giving investors the green light to invest in some of these AI leaders.\nWhile these four could experience some more short-term pain, I have a hard time picturing a future in which they aren't significantly higher five years from now. I'm using today's weakness as an opportunity to scoop up these stocks for a great price. \n\n\n\nKeithen Drury has positions in ASML, Nvidia, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.

It will come in both dual-die (CoWoS-L) and single-die (CoWoS-S) variants, with trial production beginning in the second quarter of 2025 and mass production in the third quarter.\nThe analyst also noted that the GB300 NVL72 server\u2014designed to replace the widely anticipated but delayed GB200 NVL72\u2014will maintain the same rack dimensions and power needs, making it easier for data centers to upgrade without major overhauls.\n\"The market widely recognizes the production hurdles of GB200 NVL72,\" Kuo said. \"If Nvidia could highlight real-world data center deployments of GB200 NVL72, underscore the upgrade advantages from B200 to B300, and clarify the B300 production timeline, it could sharpen market expectations for the B300 investment thesis.\"\nHe added that edge AI devices are another emerging growth vector, though they will likely take a backseat at GTC, with AI PC solutions such as N1X and N1 expected to debut later this year at Computex.\nDespite the conference's strong focus on server infrastructure, Kuo said geopolitical tensions are unlikely to be addressed in any meaningful way.\n\nNvidia GTC 2025: Hardware Predictions and Investment Trend AnalysisClick to readhttps://t.co/C05rJD5O8C pic.twitter.com/7SdS1WiUlx\u2014 \u90ed\u660e\u9324 (Ming-Chi Kuo) (@mingchikuo) March 16, 2025\n\nSubscribe to the\u00a0Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter\u00a0to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox.Play\nWhy It's Important: The upcoming GTC 2025 conference is crucial for Nvidia as it follows a period of fluctuating stock performance. The company\u2019s stock reached all-time highs after CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s keynote at CES but has since seen a decline.\nThe GTC conference, often dubbed the Global AI Conference, is anticipated to be a pivotal moment for Nvidia, potentially sparking another surge in stock value.\nIn GTC 2024, Huang underscored the transformative impact of AI, marking the emergence of a new industry.\u00a0\nPrice Action: Nvidia\u2019s stock rose 0.73% in pre-market trading on Monday to $122.56, following a 5.27% surge earlier on Friday, closing at $121.67.

Futures of all four benchmark indices declined in premarket trading.\nInvestors will focus on the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s decision on interest rates slated to be released on Wednesday this week. The meeting will begin on Tuesday and Chairman Jerome Powell will address a press conference on Wednesday afternoon.\nFebruary\u2019s retail sales data will be released today before the market opens. President Donald Trump\u2018s tariff negotiations continue as traders wait for \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d which go into effect on April 2nd.\nMeanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that the Trump administration is working to prevent a financial crisis caused by years of excessive government spending. \n\"I can guarantee we would have had a crisis if spending had continued at unsustainable levels,\" Bessent said on NBC's Meet the Press. \"We are resetting and putting things on a sustainable path.\u201d\nThe 10-year Treasury yield stood at 4.29%, while the two-year yield was at 4.01%. According to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, there is a 99% chance that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates unchanged for the March meeting.\nFuturesChange (+/-)Nasdaq 100-0.48%S&P 500-0.49%Dow Jones-0.49%Russell 2000-0.63%\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY and Invesco QQQ Trust ETF QQQ, which track the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 index, respectively, dropped in premarket on Monday. The SPY was down 0.39% to $560.64, and the QQQ also declined 0.41% to $477.70, according to Benzinga Pro data.\nCues From The Last Session\nOn Friday, Technology, energy, and financials led a Friday surge in U.S. stocks, with the S&P 500 rising over 2%.\nBig tech shares, particularly Nvidia Corp. NVDA and Tesla Inc. TSLA, rebounded strongly, though overall stocks, including the Dow and S&P 500, recorded weekly losses.\nConversely, consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan, fell to its lowest point since November 2022.\nAs of Friday\u2019s close, the S&P 500 index was 8.27% down from its previous high, which followed a bounce from Thursday\u2019s 10.18% drawdown. Similarly, the Nasdaq 100 was 11.33% lower and Dow Jones was down 7.95% from its 52-week high as of Friday.\nIndexPerformance (+/-)ValueNasdaq Composite2.61%17,754.09S&P 5002.13%5,638.94Dow Jones1.65%41,488.19Russell 20002.53%2,044.10\nInsights From Analysts\nThe CEO of Creative Planning, Peter Mallouk in an X post highlighted that over the last 75 years, the intra-year market drop has been 14% on average.\n\u201cDownside volatility is the price investors pay for long-term outperformance,\u201d he added.\n\nOver the last 75 years, the average intra-year market drop has been 14%. If you are overly stressed out about the current 10% drawdown, the stock market isn't for you. Downside volatility is the price investors pay for long-term outperformance. pic.twitter.com/dB995bwVkU\u2014 Peter Mallouk (@PeterMallouk) March 16, 2025\n\nMallouk further reiterated that market pullbacks are common and a complete recovery is inevitable over time. \u201cStay calm and stick with your long-term plan,\u201d he said.\n\nStock market pullbacks happen every year, and they all have one thing in common: a complete recovery with the passage of time. Stay calm and stick with your long-term plan. pic.twitter.com/fnHfoFUovd\u2014 Peter Mallouk (@PeterMallouk) March 16, 2025\n\nRyan Detrick of Carson Research also highlighted the historical data and underlined this was the fastest period of correction for the S&P 500 after scaling a fresh high on Feb. 19. It just took the index 16 days to slip into the correction territory.\n\nThis was one of the fastest corrections ever.Here are all the times the S&P 500 went from an ATH to down 10% within a month.Higher 3 and 6 months later every time doesn't sound like the worst news. pic.twitter.com/y0mzaMhQo2\u2014 Ryan Detrick, CMT (@RyanDetrick) March 16, 2025\n\nAdditionally, Detrick underscored that the S&P 500 has slid into a correction zone for 12 times since 1950 without going into a bear market.\n\nDo you think this goes into a bear market?Since 1950, I found 12 other times stocks corrected 10% from an all-time high and didn't go into a bear market.6 and 12 month later? Never lower. pic.twitter.com/vAu3GsY8wI\u2014 Ryan Detrick, CMT (@RyanDetrick) March 16, 2025\n\nAccording to the Panic/Euphoria analysis model shared by Jay Kaeppel, the senior market analyst at SentimenTrader, the S&P 500's decline was still not flashing a buy signal. However, from this point, investors could \u201cStart looking for a buy signal,\u201d at the current levels.\n\nIs this a \"Buy\" signal? IMO, no.Is this a \"Start looking for a buy signal\" signal? IMO, yes.Doesn't mean it will come soon or that things can't get worse as the first \"dot\" rarely marks the exact bottom (only in 2018). Still, the numbers are what they are. @sentimentrader pic.twitter.com/6Xq1lk9kNj\u2014 Jay Kaeppel (@jaykaeppel) March 14, 2025\n\nSee Also: How to Trade Futures \nUpcoming Economic Data\nHere\u2019s what investors will keep an eye on this week:\n\nOn Monday, February\u2019s U.S. retail sales and March\u2019s Empire State manufacturing survey will be released at 8:30 a.m., ET.\n\n\nJanuary\u2019s business inventories data and March\u2019s homebuilder confidence index data will be out by 10:00 a.m., ET.\n\n\nOn Tuesday, February\u2019s housing starts, building permits, and import price index data will be announced at 8:30 a.m., ET.\n\n\nAlso, February\u2019s industrial production and capacity utilization data will be released at 9:15 a.m., ET.\n\n\nOn Wednesday, FOMC will announce its decision on interest rates at 2:00 p.m., and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will address a press conference at 2:30 p.m., ET.\n\n\nOn Thursday, the initial jobless claims data for the week ended March 15 and the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey data for March will be out by 8:30 a.m., ET.\n\n\nFebruary\u2019s existing home sales and U.S. leading economic indicators data will be released by 10:00 a.m., ET.\n\n\nNo data is scheduled to be released on Friday this week.\n\nStocks In Focus:\n\nScience Applications International Corp.

This AI chip leader saw its shares surge a mind-blowing 2,000% over the past five years. This is thanks to demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) -- the chips powering key AI tasks like training and inferencing. But it's also due to Nvidia's expansion beyond the GPU to offer an entire portfolio of related products and services, making the company the go-to destination for anything AI.\nIn recent times, though, the stock, along with the general market, has been in the doldrums. This month, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 entered correction territory, falling 10% from their most recent highs, as investors worried about the impact President Trump's tariffs on imports would have on the economy and corporate earnings. Nvidia has slipped about 12% over the past month.\nBut I don't think Nvidia will suffer for very long. In fact, I predict Nvidia stock will soar this year -- and the positive momentum may start after March 18. Let's find out more.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's record revenue\nFirst, a quick summary of Nvidia's story so far. The company's dominance in the GPU market -- it holds 80% share -- and general AI strengths have led to double- and triple-digit revenue growth quarter after quarter in recent years. Last year, revenue surged 114% to more than $130 billion, a record level. And Nvidia has delivered high profitability on sales with gross margin topping 70% even during times of higher expenses, such as the recent launch of its Blackwell architecture.\nImportantly, Nvidia's focus is on innovation, with a pledge to update its GPUs on an annual basis and the company is on the way to showing it can keep the promise. Nvidia just launched Blackwell in the recent quarter and aims to release Blackwell Ultra later this year -- then the Vera Rubin architecture is expected to follow just months after that.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let's consider my prediction. I think that all of these elements will lift Nvidia shares this year, along with the idea that the long-term AI growth story hasn't changed. Even if the Trump administration's tariffs weigh on companies and the economy in the near term, this doesn't change the fact that the world is moving toward accelerated computing. Analysts expect today's $200 billion AI market to reach more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade, and Nvidia is perfectly positioned to benefit as it sells tools and services to address every phase of AI growth and use.\n\nWhy will the stock rise now?\nBut why will this positive momentum begin now? Nvidia's annual GTC AI conference happens this week, and chief executive officer Jensen Huang will keynote on March 18. He's already offered us some clues about what he'll talk about:\n\"Come to GTC, and I'll talk to you about Blackwell Ultra, Vera Rubin, and then show you what we place after that,\" Huang said during Nvidia's recent earnings call.\nSo, it's likely Huang will deliver key details about timing and performance of these upcoming products. This could reassure investors about the potential for Nvidia to keep growth going over the long term -- even through challenging times. On top of this, Nvidia stock has reached bargain levels, offering investors a fantastic entry point. Its recent decline left it trading for only 27x times forward earnings estimates, down from as much as 50 in January.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, Nvidia stock may not take off immediately on March 18 or 19 and steadily roar higher for the rest of the year -- general economic and policy news could get in the way until some of the uncertainty lifts. But news Huang delivers during the conference may offer the stock a lift and get the ball rolling.\nAll of that means now is a great time for investors to look at Nvidia through a long-term lens and pick up shares of this top AI stock.\n\n\n\nAdria Cimino has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

DeepSeek\u2019s success triggered a selloff in U.S. tech stocks, with Nvidia losing $593 billion in market value as investors feared increased competition.\nSee Also: Ross Gerber Shares \u2018Peaceful Display Of Distaste For Elon Musk\u2019 In Santa Monica, His 9-Year Old Observes, \u2018Glad We Don\u2019t Have A Tesla\u2019\nWhy It Matters: Chinese tech giants are rapidly entering the race. Baidu Inc. BIDU on Sunday unveiled ERNIE X1, claiming performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1 at half the price. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA recently launched R1-Omni, an emotion-reading AI model available for free.\nThese initiatives reflect China\u2019s broader push for technological independence after Washington banned sales of Nvidia\u2019s advanced H100 and H800 chips to China-based clients. Backed by Beijing\u2019s municipal AI fund, Qingcheng.AI has partnered with top Chinese GPU manufacturers including Moore Threads, Enflame and Iluvatar CoreX.\nThe AI surge has reignited investor interest in Chinese tech, potentially reversing three years of venture capital decline. \u201cPeople are rushing just to find the next DeepSeek,\u201d said Annabelle Yu Long, founding partner of BAI Capital, as the Chinese government prepares a fund expected to mobilize 1 trillion yuan ($137.7 billion) for tech investment.\nRead Next:\n\nTrump Says He Was \u2018Little Bit Sarcastic\u2019 When He Said He Would End The Russia-Ukraine War In A Day: \u2018What I Really Mean Is\u2026\u2019\n\nImage Via Shutterstock\nDisclaimer:\u00a0This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.BABAAlibaba Group Holding Ltd$139.35-1.24%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock \u2013 anytime.Reveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum96.64Growth65.09Quality67.08Value76.20Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewBIDUBaidu Inc$94.730.97%NVDANVIDIA Corp$122.280.50%Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Specifically, Mark Mahaney at Evercore says cloud revenue growth could accelerate as Amazon monetizes AI, and Brian Nowak at Morgan Stanley sees the company as an underappreciated leader in AI across cloud and retail.\nAmazon stock has fallen 18% from the record high it reached in February. Admittedly, the market environment is currently complicated by trade tensions and worrisome economic data, which means the stock may not recover anytime soon. But I believe the current share price will look like a bargain in three to five years.\nHere's why Amazon is my pick for the best AI stock to buy now.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon is using artificial intelligence across its retail, advertising, and cloud computing businesses\nAmazon has a strong position in three markets. It runs the largest e-commerce marketplace outside China, supported by a logistics network that handles more volume than FedEx and UPS. It is the third largest ad tech company, and its U.S. market share may exceed that of Meta Platforms by 2030, according to eMarketer. And Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leading public cloud as measured by customers and revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon is bringing artificial intelligence (AI) to bear across all three segments to generate more revenue and improve efficiency. In fact, Jassy recently told analysts the company has built or is in the process of building 1,000 different generative AI applications for different purposes.\n\nE-commerce: Amazon uses generative AI to forecast demand and optimize inventory across fulfillment centers. It has added natural language processing to the machine vision robots that sort products in warehouses. And the company leans on AI to optimize last-mile delivery routes, assist sellers in listing items, provide quality customer service, and recommend products on the marketplace.\nAdvertising: Amazon offers generative AI tools that help brands create cost efficient advertising content across different media types, including audio, image, and video. In addition, its ad tech software leans on AI to helps brands target advertising content and optimize campaign performance.\nCloud computing: AWS has designed custom chips called Trainium and Inferentia that provide cheaper alternatives to Nvidia GPUs for AI training and AI inference. The company has also introduced Bedrock, a service that lets developers fine-tune models and build generative AI applications. Finally, Amazon Q is a conversational assistant that helps knowledge workers and programmers work more productively.\n\nLooking ahead, Grand View Research forecasts that through 2030 retail e-commerce sales will increase at 11% annually, digital ad spending will grow at 15% annually, and cloud computing sales will grow at 21% annually. Consequently, Amazon has a good shot at growing revenue in the low- to mid-teen percentages during the same period.\n\nAmazon may struggle in the near term, but the company is likely to beat Wall Street's estimates in the long run\nAmazon reported strong financial results last year. Total revenue rose 11% to $638 billion on particularly robust sales growth in advertising and cloud services. Operating margin expanded more than 4 percentage points, and GAAP net income soared 90% to $5.53 per diluted share.\nImportantly, CFO Brian Olsavsky on the fourth-quarter earnings call said investments in AI infrastructure and software will be a temporary headwind to margins. So, investors should look for earnings growth to decelerate in the current year, perhaps substantially. That may cause the stock to slide, especially if the company misses consensus estimates. But investors should treat any pullbacks as buying opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\nWall Street estimates Amazon's earnings will increase at 17% annually through 2026. That puts the current valuation of 36 times earnings somewhere between reasonable and expensive. But analysts have consistently underestimated the company. Amazon beat the consensus estimate by an average of 29% during the last six quarters. If the company beats by even half that amount in the next few years, the current valuation will look cheap in hindsight.\nThat's why Amazon is my pick for the best AI stock to buy right now.\n\n\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

AAPL supplier Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Technology, has publicly criticized President Donald Trump's tariff policy, warning it's creating chaos for tech giants like Apple and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN.\nWhat Happened: During an earnings call on Friday, Foxconn CEO Liu said the U.S. government\u2019s tariff strategy is causing major disruptions across the global tech supply chain.\n\"The issue of tariffs is something that is giving the CEOs of our customers a big headache now,\" Liu told investors. \"Judging by the attitude and the approach we see the U.S. government taking towards tariffs, it is very, very hard to predict how things will develop over the next year.\"\nLiu said that companies, including Apple and Amazon, are actively exploring U.S.-based manufacturing options with Foxconn. While he declined to disclose details, Liu stated that the company expects \"more and more\" production to move stateside.\nSee Also:\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s New Superchip Delivers 8,470 Times The Computing Performance Of Supercomputer That Jensen Huang Donated To OpenAI\nThe news was first reported by the Financial Times.\nWhy It's Important: Foxconn's manufacturing operations are heavily concentrated in China, India, and Vietnam \u2014 all of which have been impacted or are at risk of being hit by additional tariffs.\nThe company is also building a major Nvidia Corporation NVDA server plant in Mexico.\nSubscribe to the\u00a0Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter\u00a0to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox.\nOn Friday, Foxconn announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024. In the October-December quarter, Foxconn\u2019s revenue surged 15% year-over-year to NT$2.13 trillion, while gross profit climbed 15.7% to NT$131 billion. For the full year, net profit totaled NT$152.7 billion, pushing earnings per share to NT$11.01\u2014the highest in 17 years.\nThe concerns raised by Liu echo broader criticisms of the U.S. tariff policy. Previously, in an interview, Warren Buffett described tariffs as \u201can act of war\u201d and likened them to a consumer tax.\nSimilarly, Anthony Scaramucci criticized the tariffs, stating that the market disapproves of Trump\u2019s trade policies.\nImage via Shutterstock\nCheck out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.\nRead Next:\n\nMark Cuban Was Asked How He\u2019d Invest $100K \u2014 His Answer?

Is It Time to Buy the Dip on the AI Leader?\n\n\n  \n      By Howard Smith\n  \n  \u2013\n  \n    \n      Mar 16, 2025 at 6:44PM\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA market correction has helped drive Nvidia shares down to start 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcerns over economic growth and trade wars have hit the stock hard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's valuation is looking downright cheap compared to the Nasdaq-100's long-term average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$3.0T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(-0.19%)\u00a0-$0.23\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$121.44\n\n\nPrice as of March 17, 2025, 9:55 a.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's been a rough start to the year for Nvidia (NVDA -0.19%) shareholders. As of this writing, shares are down about 12% year to date and 20% below its January highs. The news from the company must be bad, right?\nWell, not exactly. Late last month, Nvidia reported fourth-quarter and full-year earnings for its fiscal 2025 period, which ended Jan. 26. The news was good, not bad. Nvidia impressed analysts and investors once again by exceeding both top- and bottom-line estimates. Guidance called for another jump in revenue in the current quarter to a record $43 billion. So, let's look at what has the stock plunging in 2025.\nMarket correction = opportunity\nSome of the same things that have driven the Nasdaq Composite into correction territory have caused fear and uncertainty around Nvidia stock. The Trump administration has announced -- and changed -- several applications of import tariffs that could affect Nvidia's business. On top of that, national security concerns have raised the prospects for more export restrictions on Nvidia's powerful artificial intelligence (AI) chips.\nThe tariffs themselves could have both direct and indirect implications for Nvidia. There are concerns that tariffs could hinder economic growth and create an inflationary environment. Either of those situations could negatively impact semiconductor chip sales. After all, if a company building out data center capacity believes returns on investments will be impacted, it may very well reduce or delay those investments.\nNvidia's share price skyrocketed over the last 18 months as investors forecast impressive revenue growth to continue. It's been nothing short of amazing. Sales began to soar in 2023. Revenue jumped 126% in fiscal 2024, ending Jan. 28, 2024. It didn't slow down in fiscal 2025, either. Growth of another 114% for that period ended this January, and the stock continued to run higher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is, until recently.\nNvidia investors shouldn't worry\nThe 22% drop from its January high mark might just be a great opportunity for those who feared they missed out on owning Nvidia stock. As of this writing, it was trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just about 25 based on calendar year 2025 earnings. That's pretty attractive compared to the 10-year average P/E of 32 for the Nasdaq-100 index.\nThat's its lowest level since earnings estimates skyrocketed early last year. The stock itself has more than doubled since the start of 2024.\n\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia still has plenty of opportunities for growth. Barring any major development of a trade war or recession, revenue should increase about 50% this year. That's mostly driven by the Blackwell AI architecture, which is now in full production. There are many business development possibilities beyond that.\nNvidia touches most everything\nThe Rubin platform will succeed Blackwell with an even more powerful AI suite of offerings. But AI is more than just data center computing power, too. Companies developing autonomous vehicle (AV) technology are also loading up on Nvidia's products for training purposes. The company says all 30 of the existing top AV data centers are powered by it.\nRevenue in its gaming segment grew to over $11 billion last year. More than 200 million gamers and creators use Nvidia GeForce GPUs (graphics processing units). Millions of developers have downloaded its Monai open-source framework for healthcare imaging AI. Perhaps most potential will come from robotics as businesses utilize that evolving technology to improve efficiency. Nvidia says over 1.3 million developers already use the Nvidia Jetson high-performance computer platform for tasks including robotics, computer vision, and generative AI.\nNvidia has many irons in the fire. While revenue growth will slow to about 50% this year, its lineup of AI chips and software stacks is unmatched and constantly improving. Add in the possible catalysts from other segments, and its very reasonable recent valuation, and it looks like a compelling time to buy the dip in Nvidia stock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHoward Smith has positions in Nvidia.

That tailwind has been the perfect recipe for the creation of numerous trillion-dollar companies. These businesses are in an elite category.\nInvestors are certainly familiar with a smaller innovative, industry-leading enterprise that currently has a market cap of $384 billion (as of March 13). It has quickly climbed up the ranks. And I believe it deserves to be mentioned as a potential new entrant to the trillion-dollar club at some point in the future. \nCan this one unstoppable stock join Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms in the $1 trillion club by 2035?\nA category leader\nIf it's not already, Netflix (NFLX 3.82%) should be on investors' radars. Its shares have catapulted 66,600% higher in the past 20 years, undoubtedly making it one of the best performers during that time. \nThat monumental rise only happened because Netflix completely disrupted the traditional media market. The company deserves credit for having created the streaming industry as we know it today.\n\n\n\n\n\n It focused intensely on innovation to find a way to offer customers a better experience compared to cable TV. As a result, Netflix surely should be talked about in the same breath as those other tech titans.\nThe company's growth has been unbelievable. Five years ago, it counted 167 million customers. Today, that figure has ballooned to 302 million, with a presence in 190 countries. Revenue has soared as well, going from $20 billion in 2019 to $39 billion last year. \nEven at its current size, the business is trying new things to keep the growth going. Netflix has cracked down on password-sharing households. It has introduced a cheaper ad-based tier to target a price-sensitive customer. And it's starting to get more involved in live events and sports. \nNetflix's profitability is noteworthy. The company's huge scale, which comes from its first-mover advantage, puts it well ahead of its rivals in the industry. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2025, executives are targeting a 29% operating margin, with free cash flow expected to total $8 billion. These numbers would represent an improvement from the prior year.\nNetflix has also proved that it has pricing power. The leadership team strives to keep adding more value for subscribers, providing the confidence needed to occasionally raise prices.\n\nGetting to $1 trillion\nThe market cap only needs to rise 160% to reach $1 trillion in 10 years. In the past decade, Netflix's market cap has climbed 1,320%. Expecting a slowdown is reasonable, in my opinion.\nValuation matters, too. The stock currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 45.3. Let's assume the multiple contracts to 25 by 2035, which is not out of the question given the mature phase Netflix will be in then. Earnings per share (EPS) will need to grow by 16.7% per year to get to a $1 trillion market cap.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, EPS has risen at a much faster clip in the past decade. So, it's not crazy to believe that based on its trajectory, the company will enter the $1 trillion club in 10 years.\nDon't buy the stock\nNetflix might be on a clear path to the trillion-dollar mark. However, investors shouldn't take that as a sign that the stock is an automatic buy. The valuation, at that P/E of 45.3, looks too steep. This is true even with the shares trading 15% off their all-time high from February. \nNo one is going to argue with the fact that its business is doing extremely well. But this reality is fully reflected in the valuation, which I think gives investors zero margin of safety. Netflix must exceed the already lofty expectations embedded in the stock price for investors to end up with a satisfactory result. Consequently, the best course of action is to wait for a much better valuation before buying.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The Nasdaq Composite recently entered correction territory, and the index is down 8.1% year to date.\nAmong the Magnificent Seven stocks -- Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, and Alphabet (GOOG 0.09%) (GOOGL 0.07%) -- only Meta is still in the green so far this year.\n\nData by YCharts.\nHowever, it's not time to sound the alarm just yet. If anything, now is the time to think about bargain shopping.\nOne beaten-down Magnificent Seven stock that's looking increasingly appealing is Alphabet. It's down about 20% from February's all-time high, but its business has a ton of momentum behind it. If you're hunting for bargains in this sell-off, here are three reasons to consider Alphabet.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Alphabet continues to be a cash cow\nAlphabet has an impressive portfolio of companies: Google, YouTube, Waymo, DeepMind, and Calico, among others.\nWhile some of these businesses fall into Alphabet's \"Other Bets\" segment because they're more experimental and focused on long-term innovation, companies like Google and YouTube have turned Alphabet into a premier cash cow.\nIn 2024, Alphabet generated over $350 billion in revenue, up 14% and almost $100 billion more than what it reported three years ago. Only 10 other public companies have generated more revenue in their past four quarters.\nAlphabet's impressive revenue and operating income (over $112 billion in 2024) explain how the company has managed to accumulate $96 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving a large cash reserve gives Alphabet a lot of flexibility to make the appropriate investments for growth, putting it in a position to weather most economic storms that come its way. That's key to long-term stability.\n\n2. Google Cloud will be Alphabet's next major money-maker\nGoogle Cloud is Alphabet's fastest-growing segment. In the fourth quarter, its revenue increased 30% year over year to $12 billion, or 12.4% of total revenue. In the same quarter two years ago, its share of the top line was 9.6%. And five years ago, it was just 5.7%.\nIt has a ways to go to catch up to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure in terms of market share, but it's very much trending in the right direction. As of Q4, AWS and Azure had a 30% and 21% market share, respectively, while Google Cloud sat at 12%.\nWith the cloud computing market projected to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 16% through 2032, Google Cloud doesn't need to overtake AWS or Azure to be a lucrative business. Its existing trajectory means it will claim more market share for Alphabet while significantly increasing revenue and profitability.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe profitability part is especially true for this platform. Cloud services have a lot of fixed costs (data centers, server infrastructure, research and development, etc.), so economies of scale play a big role in boosting margins. Google Cloud is already seeing a major improvement on this front as its Q4 operating margin increased from 9.4% to 17.5% on a year-over-year basis. Two years ago, the segment was still reporting a loss.\n3. It's becoming too hard to ignore Alphabet's valuation\nValuation isn't everything when investing in a great long-term business, but an attractive entry point certainly helps. Alphabet is trading at less than 21 times trailing-12-month earnings, far below its average for the past five and 10 years.\nIt's also noticeably cheaper than any of the other Magnificent Seven stocks as you can see below.\n\nData by YCharts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlphabet faces some risks, such as a drop in short-term ad spending if macroeconomic conditions further deteriorate and regulatory hurdles.\nHowever, the business is positioned to flourish in the long term. If the current volatility has you worried, consider dollar-cost averaging as a way to gradually build up your stake.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

MPWR between February 8, 2024 and November 8, 2024, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"), of the important April 7, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Monolithic Power Systems common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Monolithic Power Systems class action, go to\u00a0https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34600 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 7, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Monolithic Power Systems' voltage regulator modules and power management integrated circuits were suffering from significant performance and air quality issues; (2) these defects had, in turn, negatively impacted the performance of certain products offered by Nvidia in which such products were used; (3) Monolithic Power Systems had failed to adequately address and resolve known issues affecting the performance of the power management solutions that it supplied to Nvidia; (4) Monolithic Power Systems' relationship with Nvidia had been irreparably damaged due to the significant performance and quality control problems affecting the products it supplied to Nvidia and Monolithic Power Systems' failure to adequately address such issues; and (5) as a result of the above, Monolithic Power Systems was acutely exposed to material undisclosed risks of significant business, financial, and reputational harm. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Monolithic Power Systems class action, go to\u00a0\u00a0 https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34600 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

But now is actually an excellent time to buy stocks because many of yesterday's highfliers are today's dirt cheap deals. So, a time of market decline represents the perfect moment to get in on a quality company at a discount, with the next step being to hang on for the long term to benefit.\nAnd today, one billionaire investor in particular may be taking advantage of this market moment. Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller has a long track record of success, delivering an average annual return of 30% over 30 years at Duquesne Capital Management without any money-losing years. He now manages $3.7 billion as head of the Duquesne family office.\nBut last fall, Druckenmiller said he was disappointed with one of his latest investing moves. He sold an artificial intelligence (AI) stock that's soared more than 1,900% over the past five years -- and he expressed interest in getting back in on the growth story at the right valuation. Druckenmiller has likely noticed the significant drop in this player's price in recent weeks. In my opinion, he might be buying this stock for a bargain during the Nasdaq correction.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nDruckenmiller's \"big mistake\"\nDruckenmiller holds a number of tech stocks in his portfolio and has spoken favorably of AI, saying he's a long-term believer in the technology.\u00a0So, he clearly aims to be involved in this high-growth story. Yet, last year, Druckenmiller reduced his holding of AI giant Nvidia (NVDA -0.27%) and finally closed out the position in the third quarter. The investor originally bought his Nvidia stake in the fourth quarter of 2022, and it rose about 700% during its time in his portfolio. The reason for Druckenmiller's actions? He thought its valuation had gotten too rich.\n\nLast year, Nvidia traded for as much as 50 times forward earnings estimates. But even with Nvidia trading at that level, Druckenmiller still considered his move \"a big mistake,\" as he said in a Bloomberg interview, adding that he would consider buying the stock again at the right valuation.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince Nvidia stock has fallen 10% in a month, leaving the shares trading at 26 times forward earnings estimates, I believe that moment may be now. I wouldn't be surprised if Druckenmiller took this opportunity to return to Nvidia, aiming to benefit from the next wave of growth ahead.\nA $1 trillion opportunity\nIt's important to remember that even though Nvidia's revenue has soared in the double and triple digits quarter after quarter, the company is still in the early chapters of the AI story. Nvidia chief Jensen Huang has said that $1 trillion of outdated computers need to be updated to accommodate accelerated computing, leaving a lot of room for growth ahead.\nThis buildout is still unfolding, with OpenAI even announcing a project to invest $500 billion over the coming four years to continue adding to AI infrastructure in the U.S. -- and Nvidia's been named a key partner. The AI market is also moving into the next phase: the application of AI to real-world situations through tools such as AI agents. This is software that can reason through problems and apply solutions.\nWhy Nvidia may excel over time\nWith its dominance in the AI chip market, full portfolio of AI products and services, and focus on innovation, Nvidia is well positioned to benefit through these stages of AI growth. The company's ability to generate high profits on sales -- with gross margin consistently surpassing 70% -- shows it can deliver both growth and profitability.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday's economic and political headwinds may weigh on Nvidia in the near term, but the good news is that they don't change the company's long-term prospects. Certain savvy investors may recognize this, and one of them may be Druckenmiller.\nOf course, we can't be certain that the billionaire is buying Nvidia shares right now. Even though he clearly likes the company, any shifts in the economy or the AI landscape could have changed the investor's mind. And we don't know exactly what level he considers reasonable for Nvidia right now.\nBut considering the billionaire's comments last year, an Nvidia purchase at the moment is a reasonable possibility. Whether Druckenmiller has made the move or not, at today's levels, Nvidia still looks like a bargain for investors aiming to get in on a current and future AI winner.\n\n\n\nAdria Cimino has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

It's also a group of tech stocks that led the Nasdaq (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) to double-digit gains over the past two years. I'm talking about Alphabet (GOOG 0.01%) (GOOGL -0.01%), Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms (META 0.08%), Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. These tech players have all demonstrated their ability to deliver growth. In recent times, they've shown their strengths in the high-potential area of artificial intelligence (AI), a market expected to top $1 trillion by the end of the decade.\nSo it's no surprise that these players caught investors' fancy and soared as the AI boom progressed. But in recent times, the Magnificent Seven haven't been leading gains. Instead, they've led declines. As investors worry about the effect U.S. President Donald Trump's import tariffs may have on the economy, companies depending on growth have seen their shares tumble. That's left the Nasdaq in correction territory, and Magnificent Seven players at much lower valuations than a few weeks ago.\nBut here's some reassuring news: Though economic troubles may weigh on these and other companies in the near term, the long-term AI story remains hearty, with companies investing billions of dollars annually in their platforms. So now is a great time to invest in AI players with solid long-term potential. Let's check out these two bargain Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\nMeta is the leader in social media, via owning Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram. More than 3.3 billion people use at least one of these platforms daily. So it's no surprise that advertisers rush to Meta to reach people where they know they can find them. This brings in billions of dollars in revenue annually for the tech giant.\nBut Meta isn't only about social media. The company has big AI ambitions and is investing accordingly. Meta is already on version four of its large language model, Llama. This is a key tool to power its AI systems, such as the AI assistant found on its social media platforms. The efforts may be in their early stages. A few weeks ago, Meta said that capital spending may reach as much as $65 billion this year as the company pursues AI growth. This includes the construction of a data center that will be so big it could cover a good part of Manhattan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow will Meta eventually monetize this? Meta aims to create AI assistants for all of its users, something that could keep people on the apps longer -- and spur advertisers to spend more there. The investment may also lead to new products and services from Meta down the road.\nToday, this ambitious and profitable tech giant only trades for 23x forward earnings estimates. That's down from more than 29x just a few weeks ago, making it an excellent bargain buy.\n2. Alphabet\nYou may know Alphabet best for something many of us use daily: Google Search. The company owns this, the most popular search engine with about 90% market share, and generates revenue as advertisers connect with us there. But Alphabet has another significant source of revenue -- one that's been growing in the double digits. I'm talking about Google Cloud, the company's cloud computing unit.\nIn the recent quarter, this business delivered a 30% increase in revenue to $12 billion. This growth was led by its presence in AI. Alphabet operates a global network of data centers and builds the products and services customers need when they're developing and operating an AI platform. So, by being present across the \"full stack,\" Alphabet can gain in efficiency and keep customers coming back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has delivered solid results. Alphabet says its customers now use more than eight times the compute capacity that they used just eighteen months ago. This is for the key AI tasks of training and inferencing models. So, Alphabet is immediately generating revenue growth as it sells its AI products and services to customers. On top of that, the company's using its AI tools to make its own products -- such as Google Search -- better and better.\nRight now, Alphabet is the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven stocks, trading for 18x forward earnings estimates. That makes it a fantastic -- and bargain -- way to ride the AI investing wave.\n\n\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Here are three reliable alternatives with world-class management and terrific long-term growth prospects.\n\nServer systems builder Super Micro Computer (SMCI 0.66%) was a market darling a year ago. Is it time to turn away from this disgraced industry titan and seek more reliable investment avenues in the artificial intelligence (AI) market?\nWhy I'm not jumping on the Super Micro Computer bandwagon in 2025\nSupermicro's stock had gained 2,760% in the two years leading up to March 13, 2024. Many hyperscale data centers were loading up on the company's hardware to drive their AI operations.\nBut that turned out to be the peak of Supermicro's AI surge. Several financial filings were delayed, raising questions about the company's financial reporting quality. A\u00a0few months later, the company's auditors resigned, citing unreliable data from Supermicro's management and audit committee.\u00a0The stock fell as much as 84.8% from its March highs.\nSupermicro stock is up more than 125% from November's low point, and the company has addressed many of its alleged shortcomings. The belated reports have been filed, and a new auditor was hired in a hurry. But the current auditing firm is a slight step down from global superstars Ernst & Young, and the delayed filings might still need adjustments. For long-term investors who care about reliable management teams and dependable financial reports, the company lost a lot of credibility last year. It will take time to rebuild it.\nLuckily, there are many other ways to tap into the AI opportunity -- with world-class management teams and trustworthy reports. Read on to see why I prefer investing in Alphabet (GOOG 0.21%) (GOOGL 0.18%), IBM (IBM 2.12%), and Nvidia (NVDA -0.19%) right now. Before I start, let me just note that all four rely on one of the Big 4 auditor giants -- Ernst & Young for Alphabet and Pricewaterhousecoopers for IBM\u00a0and Nvidia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia isn't too expensive anymore\nI argued that Nvidia's stock price was too high for most of 2024. I even sold some of my shares in January, locking in a sweet 775% gain in less than three years.\nWell, the stock price is down 14% from that lofty perch, and it's starting to look affordable again. The rising tide of rival processor designers hasn't undermined Nvidia's leadership in the lucrative market for AI accelerators, and maybe they never will.\nMeanwhile, the company scores high in every review of its leadership quality.\u00a0Soaring stock prices surely play a part in reviews based on employee feedback, but Nvidia's top scores have a long history. For example, Glassdoor called it the best place to work in 2022, citing data collected before OpenAI launched ChatGPT.\n\nAlphabet's recipe for lasting success\nAlphabet's Google division is another perennial name on Glassdoor's \"best places to work\" lists. Employees love the generous compensation and innovative company culture. And, of course, Alphabet is a leading provider of AI computing platforms and services.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Alphabet position started at a split-adjusted $15.03 per share in 2010. Apart from converting my vote-less Class C shares to vote-enabled Class A stubs in 2014, I haven't sold a share and am not likely to do it anytime soon. My original position has gained 992% so far, and the stock looks poised to continue growing in the long run.\nAlphabet is quite literally designed for long-term resiliency, bolstering the core operations of online search and advertising with a plethora of loosely related products and services. The next generation might know Alphabet for its self-driving Waymo taxis or maybe as the biggest name in quantum computing. Either way, Alphabet will roll with the punches and lead the technology sector into whatever era is coming up next.\nAnd don't forget that the stock looks very cheap today. Alphabet shares are changing hands at 20.5 times trailing earnings, a valuation ratio that would look modest for a mature, low-growth consumer goods business. Alphabet's sales have increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.3% over the last five years, so it surely deserves a higher price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.\n\nIBM's business-first approach to AI is paying dividends\nLast but not least, IBM tailors its AI product to business-class clients. Its data analytics and large language models (LLMs) come with data safety guarantees and auditable tracking features not found in other solutions. It took a while to clear IBM's WatsonX platform for mission-critical workloads, but Big Blue is making loyal long-term customers with every winning contract.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, IBM's stock has doubled in the last year, as the investor population is starting to catch on to its unheralded AI expertise. As for management quality, IBM is a textbook example of long-term planning and customer focus.\nIBM used to be my favorite low-price investment in the AI sector. Alphabet is a bit more affordable after Big Blue's recent gains, but the stock is still a great long-term investment.\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Nvidia's GPUs are useful not only for AI workloads, but also across academia and industry for running simulations and doing other computing-intensive tasks.\nCUDA, Nvidia's proprietary software toolkit that allows developers to harness the power of the company's GPUs, has been around for nearly two decades. The vast ecosystem around CUDA was an enormous advantage for Nvidia when the AI boom started. With tech giants and start-ups moving fast to pull ahead in the AI race, Nvidia's GPUs were the path of least resistance.\n\nThe tide is starting to turn\nWhen the market for data center GPUs was much smaller, it made no sense for Nvidia's customers to spend the engineering resources necessary to free themselves from their dependence on CUDA. The return on investment just wasn't there.\nWith the AI boom causing an explosion in demand for data center GPUs, the math is starting to change. Nvidia's data center segment generated more than $35 billion in revenue during the latest quarter alone, and the company's profit margins are through the roof. Customers like Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and OpenAI are spending billions, or even tens of billions, of dollars each year on Nvidia's GPUs as they race to meet demand for AI computing capacity.\nThe stakes are now much higher. A company like Meta could save billions by cutting out Nvidia and designing its own AI chip and software stack from the ground up. This push to bring AI accelerators in-house appears to be picking up steam across the tech industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome companies, including Amazon and Alphabet, have already created multiple generations of custom AI chips. Other companies are now following suit. Meta is reportedly testing a custom AI chip aimed at AI training workloads, which are much more computationally intensive than AI inference workloads. OpenAI isn't far behind, reportedly working on finalizing its first custom AI chip design.\nCompanies that design their own AI chips and reduce dependence on Nvidia's pricey AI accelerators could have a major cost advantage over competitors that don't follow the same path. This could compel even more companies to bring AI chips in-house.\nEroding Nvidia's dominance\nWhile Nvidia does have some competition from AMD in the AI accelerator market, its own customers represent a far larger threat. The numbers are now big enough to prompt tech giants and AI companies to rethink their AI hardware and software stacks. Beyond reducing demand for Nvidia's chips, this trend could put pressure on Nvidia's pricing and margins.\nIt's only because the market for data center GPUs became so large that the CUDA stranglehold over accelerated computing is under attack. Nvidia is still selling a lot of AI chips, and it will continue to do so as long as the AI boom keeps going. Once demand for AI computing capacity cools down -- trees don't grow to the sky, after all -- growth will be tough for Nvidia as its market share erodes due to competition from homegrown AI chips.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia stock has already slumped from its all-time high as concerns about the resiliency of AI demand have collided with worries about tariffs and the state of the global economy. As custom AI chips make up a growing portion of the AI accelerator market, the stock could come under additional pressure.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

Should You Buy The Stock?\n\n\n  \n      By Brett Schafer\n  \n  \u2013\n  \n    \n      Mar 16, 2025 at 10:30AM\n    \n  \n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoreWeave is an AI cloud hyperscaler that has filed to start trading publicly soon. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue is growing rapidly, but free cash flow is sharply negative. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost IPO stocks should be avoided by investors right off the bat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$3.0T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(-0.19%)\u00a0-$0.23\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$121.44\n\n\nPrice as of March 17, 2025, 9:55 a.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFast growth doesn't necessarily mean good stock market returns.\n\nThe initial public offering (IPO) market has been ice-cold since 2021. In 2020 and 2021, we saw a deluge of companies entering the public markets, especially via a boom in special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). Many of these ended up being poorly run businesses, and some were even frauds. Ever since then, there has been a mere trickle of new stock listings, as start-ups decided to remain private.\nCould artificial intelligence (AI) be waking the IPO market up? Last week, AI cloud start-up CoreWeave filed its official financial statements in preparation for an IPO and stock listing. This is perhaps the first generative AI stock to hit the public markets. The company is backed by Nvidia (NVDA -0.19%) and will be followed closely.\nLet's take a deeper look at the CoreWeave business and see whether investors should buy shares of this IPO.\nRapid growth thanks to AI\nOriginally, CoreWeave was a cryptocurrency mining operation. Crypto mining requires a lot of computing power, which led the company to acquire a ton of graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia. This led to a fortuitous business model pivot. In late 2022, the cryptocurrency markets were plunging. At the same time, generative AI products were gaining traction due to the rising popularity of Chat GPT, which inspired CoreWeave to flip from being a cryptocurrency miner to being an AI cloud provider utilizing its Nvidia GPUs. In 2023, Nvidia invested $100 million in the company. \nGenerative AI tools -- at least how they are currently constructed -- require tons of computing power to train, operate, and scale. This is why big technology companies are planning to spend hundreds of billions on capital expenditures in 2025. There is a seemingly insatiable demand for cloud computing resources, which has customers lining up at the door urgently looking to spend money with these hyperscalers that provide it.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoreWeave has now positioned itself as an AI-focused cloud hyperscaler, trying to compete with the likes of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud. So far, this focused cloud strategy seems to be working out well. In 2022, CoreWeave generated just $15.8 million in revenue. In 2024, revenue soared to $1.9 billion, making it one of the fastest-growing businesses in the world. It is also already profitable, generating $324 million in operating income last year, just a few years after making its product pivot. \nDemand needs to show up\nCoreWeave is likely to raise billions of dollars from this IPO, in which it will sell shares to the public. It has applied to list its Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market with the symbol CRWV.\nIt needs the money from its IPO because scaling a cloud computing business is highly capital-intensive. In 2024, CoreWeave spent $8.7 billion on capital expenditures and ended with negative $6 billion in free cash flow. In order to finance this upfront spending, the company has taken on $7.9 billion in total debt. \nIn its S-1 filing -- a document every company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before going public -- management highlights $15.1 billion in remaining performance obligations from existing customers that will be paid over the next few years. This looks great and should lead to revenue growth over the next few years.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it doesn't guarantee that revenue is going to show up. CoreWeave's revenue is highly concentrated, with 62% coming just from Microsoft in 2024. Microsoft runs its own competing cloud computing business and could easily take some of its spending in-house if growth in demand slows down. We also could see a broad slowdown in AI spending at any point. With all the capital CoreWeave has laid out in preparation for AI spending to show up, a slowdown could lead things to turn south for CoreWeave, and quickly. \n\nQQQ data by YCharts\nShould you buy the CoreWeave IPO?\nUnless the current market downturn -- the Nasdaq Composite has notched a correction with its drop of more than 10% from a recent high -- continues for many months, it is likely that CoreWeave stock will come out with a premium valuation.  There will be a lot of excitement around this IPO, given that it is the first generative-AI-focused stock to go public, and it wouldn't shock me if the stock rocketed higher on its first trading day.\nThis doesn't mean you should buy the IPO. CoreWeave will likely come to market with a premium valuation while saddled with debt and burning $6 billion in free cash flow a year. That's not a great situation. The company gets over half of its revenue from one customer (Microsoft), who also happens to be a competitor. This is an immature business with a lot of risks that could materialize and bring this stock to the downside over the next few years. Savvy investors will watch how things go instead of jumping into the hype.\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, it is smart to avoid IPO stocks, and this one is no exception. Most IPOs underperform the market in their first year after going public due to restrictive lockup periods and insider selling that can occur after an IPO. The same may end up happening for CoreWeave. Even if you like the CoreWeave business, keep it on your watch list for now.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

(\"Monolithic\") MPWR on behalf of those who purchased or otherwise acquired Monolithic common stock between February 8, 2024, and November 8, 2024, inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The lead plaintiff deadline is April 7, 2025. CONTACT KESSLER TOPAZ MELTZER & CHECK, LLP: If you suffered Monolithic losses, you may CLICK HERE or copy and paste the following link into your browser: https://www.ktmc.com/new-cases/monolithic-power-systems-inc?utm_source=PR&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=mpwr&mktm=r You can also contact attorney Jonathan Naji, Esq. by calling (484) 270-1453 or by email at info@ktmc.com.  DEFENDANTS' ALLEGED MISCONDUCT:The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Monolithic's voltage regulator modules and power management integrated circuits were suffering from significant performance and quality control issues; (2) these defects had, in turn, negatively impacted the performance of certain products offered by Nvidia in which such products were used; (3) Monolithic had failed to adequately address and resolve known issues affecting the performance of the power management solutions Monolithic supplied to Nvidia; (4) Monolithic's relationship with Nvidia had been irreparably damaged due to the significant performance and quality control problems affecting the products it supplied to Nvidia and Monolithic's failure to adequately address such issues; and (5) as a result of the above, Monolithic was acutely exposed to material undisclosed risks of significant business, financial, and reputational harm. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS:Monolithic investors may, no later than April 7, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation.\u00a0 The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP encourages Monolithic investors who have suffered significant losses to contact the firm directly to acquire more information.

It can be a great idea to buy stocks on weakness if you're investing for the long term, but that doesn't mean that every struggling stock is going to recover.\nThree stocks that are down big this year but that investors should think twice about buying right now are SoundHound AI (SOUN 0.77%), Maravai LifeSciences (MRVI 5.71%), and Victoria's Secret (VSCO 4.20%). Here's why these stocks are struggling this year, and why they may not be worth buying despite their discounted valuations.\n\nSoundHound AI\nVoice artificial intelligence (AI) company SoundHound went from being a hot stock in 2024 to now being in a freefall. Investors loaded up on the stock last year when they learned that chipmaker Nvidia had invested in the business. But now, with Nvidia selling its stake, investors are once again following in the tech giant's path and also unloading their shares of SoundHound.\nSoundHound's stock is now down more than 55% since the start of the year. Arguably, some sort of a correction is warranted, given that it spiked a mammoth 836% last year. And there are still big question marks around its operations, such as whether SoundHound will be able to provide a competitive product amid a growing number of AI companies offering similar solutions.\nThe company is undeniably generating strong growth. Last year, its revenue soared 85% to $84.7 million. But that was also with the aid of acquisitions, and it posted an adjusted net loss of $69.1 million -- 19% higher than a year ago. SoundHound faces an uncertain path ahead, and while it is growing, whether it can do so organically is debatable. Investors shouldn't overlook its losses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaravai LifeSciences\nAnother struggling stock is Maravai LifeSciences, which is also down around 55% this year. The healthcare company experienced a boom amid the pandemic as demand for its nucleic acid products soared, helping in the development of mRNA vaccines. But now, sales have been slowing down.\nThe company has postponed the release of its year-end earnings to next week, but the results have been far from impressive of late. Over the nine-month period ending Sept. 30, 2024, its revenue totaled $202.8 million and was down 6% year over year. Meanwhile, the company incurred an operating loss totaling $197.5 million -- including $154.2 million in goodwill impairment charges. \nWith an uncertain path forward and future profitability a big question mark, investors shouldn't assume the stock has reached a bottom. Things could get worse for Maravai as the year goes on.\n\nVictoria's Secret & Co.\nDown 59% so far in 2025, Victoria's Secret is the worst-performing stock on this list. It has taken a beating after releasing disappointing earnings numbers and offering a discouraging outlook ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe retailer is seeing some weakness in the market and projects that for the current fiscal year (which goes up until the end of January 2026), sales will be within a range of $6.2 billion to $6.3 billion. That suggests minimal to no growth compared to its most recent fiscal year, where it posted $6.2 billion in sales -- which were up less than 1% from the previous year.\nInvestors, however, should note that management says this forecast \"assumes that the environment will gradually get better as we move through the year.\" That's a considerable assumption to make at a time when there's a lot of uncertainty in the economy. If economic conditions don't improve, investors shouldn't be surprised to see even lower sales numbers from Victoria's Secret, as the company still appears to be factoring a bit of optimism into its guidance.\nRetail is a tough place to invest in these days. It's easier than ever for people to shift spending to other stores, including online marketplaces, in order to save money. Victoria's Secret stock is likely to continue to have a tough road ahead. Investors should tread carefully with it.\n\n\n\nDavid Jagielski has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Nvidia.

Here's the Biggest Reason Why There's Still Time.\n\n\n  \n      By Jennifer Saibil\n  \n  \u2013\n  \n    \n      Mar 16, 2025 at 8:15AM\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia reported phenomenal results in its most recent quarterly earnings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe market for generative artificial intelligence is rapidly expanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is an essential supplier of AI products and will benefit greatly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$3.0T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(-0.22%)\u00a0-$0.27\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$121.40\n\n\nPrice as of March 17, 2025, 9:57 a.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could be forgiven if you thought that Nvidia (NVDA -0.22%) was a young company. It's rare for the stock of a mature business to suddenly take off after it's been on the market for a few years. But Nvidia actually went public in 1999. It had been a solid gainer for many years before generative artificial intelligence (AI) set it off higher, but it was hardly a household name.\nOver the past two years, though, it's gained 374% as generative AI becomes part of regular parlance. Armchair analysts have been dissecting Nvidia's continued potential. Is the ride over? Is it still worth buying today? No, and yes, in that order. Here's why.\nInestimable potential\nThere are varied estimates for how big the AI opportunity is going to be, but they have one thing in common: It's going to be BIG. McKinsey estimates the long-term opportunity at $4.4 trillion. According to a Harvard Business Review study in collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS), 81% of respondents say Generative AI is going to transform their industry, and 83% feel that if they don't use it, they're going to fall behind.\nNvidia makes the hardware that powers generative AI. There are competitors, but Nvidia is the clear leader, and partners like Amazon and Alphabet rely on it for their competitive AI programs.\n\nThe market was in suspense about Nvidia's latest earnings report, concerned that with new competition and already high sales, growth might decelerate. The company put any idea of a slowdown to rest with a blowout earnings report demonstrating a 78% year-over-year increase in revenue and an 8% increase in earnings per share (EPS).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the DeepSeek news sent Nvidia stock tumbling a few months ago, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang smartly observed that progress in the space was a win for all of the players. As generative AI takes a foothold in almost every industry, Nvidia's products become even more important, and its market becomes that much larger.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

A correction is marked by an index declining 10% from its all-time high, which isn't quite as severe as a bear market. Additionally, stocks aren't necessarily a blanket buy or sell right now. Instead, I think there are certain ones that look like great bargains and others that still seem overvalued.\nTwo stocks that I'm still not buying even after the sell-off are Apple (AAPL 0.23%) and Palantir Technologies (PLTR 2.39%). These are both incredibly popular stocks in the market, but I would need a further sell-off from them to consider buying, as they still have a very expensive price tag even after the drop.\nApple\nApple is one of the most recognizable consumer brands in the world and built a strong ecosystem around its iPhones. However, Apple has struggled to launch a game-changing product over the past few years, and its sales have been flat since 2022.\n\nAAPL Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.\nAlthough Apple's revenue is trending in the right direction, it's only projected to grow revenue by a mere 4.6% in fiscal year 2025 (ending around September 30). That's not quick growth by Apple and barely edges out the effect of inflation. In fact, Apple's $378 billion in revenue in January 2022 has the same buying power as $424 billion in December 2024 (when its last quarter ended), according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This means that Apple's growth over the past three years has fallen behind the rate of inflation, which isn't a good sign.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite this, Apple still has a massive premium over its peers and the stock market.\n\nAAPL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.\nWith the stock trading for nearly 30 times forward earnings, it's still far more expensive than it has been for the better part of two years. It's also valued at nearly 50% higher than the S&P 500, which trades at 21.2 times forward earnings. While brand value deserves some recognition, Apple's growth is projected to be far below the average growth rate of the S&P 500 (10%), which is a big red flag for me.\n\nFurthermore, other members of the Magnificent Seven are valued at much lower price tags (like Alphabet priced at 18.6 times forward earnings, Meta Platforms at 24.4 times forward earnings, and Nvidia at 25.7 times forward earnings), despite growing at a much faster rate. Alphabet, Meta, and Nvidia grew revenue at an 11.8%, 20.3%, and 77.9% pace, respectively, in their most recent quarters. So it doesn't make a ton of sense to be buying Apple stock right now, as it's still highly priced. As a result, I'd rather look at some of Apple's peers than Apple itself.\n\n\n\n\n\nPalantir\nPalantir is nearly the exact opposite of Apple in terms of growth. It makes AI-driven data analytics software used by both government and commercial entities. Its growth has been accelerating as the demand for its AI software ramps up, making Palantir one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street.\n\nPLTR Operating Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts.\nThat growth is expected to persist, with management guiding for $860 million in revenue in the first quarter, indicating a 36% growth rate. Palantir's management has a track record of under-guiding and over-delivering, so don't be surprised if this growth rate reaches nearly 40% when it reports Q1 results.\nDespite this strength, Palantir's stock has fallen over 30% from its all-time high, but I don't think that decline is steep enough. The problem is that Palantir's stock is so highly valued that even 40% growth over the next four years doesn't justify the stock price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Palantir could grow its revenue at a 40% pace over the next four years (Wall Street analysts expect 32% and 26% growth in 2025 and 2026, respectively), it would have revenue of $11 billion. While that's a large increase from the $2.87 billion in revenue it's generating right now, it still isn't enough from a profit standpoint.\nPalantir's current profit margin is about 16%, but let's say it can increase that to 30%, which would place it among the best software companies in terms of profit margin. It would generate $3.3 billion in profits if it can do that. Still, even after monster growth that nobody is projecting and industry-leading margins, Palantir's stock would still trade for 59 times forward earnings.\nThat's a massive premium to pay for a stock, especially when you consider that the stock price can't budge from today's levels over the next four years to fulfill that projection.\nWith so much growth already baked into Palantir's stock, it would have to fall a lot further before I'd consider taking a position in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

But Is It a Buy?\n\n\n  \n      By James Brumley\n  \n  \u2013\n  \n    \n      Mar 16, 2025 at 6:10AM\n    \n  \n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has been the poster child of the artificial intelligence revolution so far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext-generation AI will need solutions beyond Nvidia\u2019s high-powered GPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne well-proven consumer-facing company stands ready to meet the demand for practical AI solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$3.0T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(-0.22%)\u00a0-$0.27\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$121.40\n\n\nPrice as of March 17, 2025, 9:57 a.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AI business is evolving as it matures, creating opportunities for new leaders.\n\nThere's no two ways about it. Nvidia (NVDA -0.22%) has been the proverbial talk of the town since 2023, shortly after OpenAI launched ChatGPT to start what would turn into a heated race for dominance of the artificial intelligence (AI) market.\nWhile Nvidia had been using its graphics processing technology for AI purposes well before that, this was a clear growth catalyst. Now more than 80% of Nvidia's revenue is in its AI data center business, making that division nearly 10 times as big as it was just three years ago.\nThe stock has responded accordingly, of course. Not only has it earned a spot as one of the\u00a0 \"Magnificent Seven\" tickers, but it's outperformed all six other stocks in each of the past two years to become the planet's second-biggest company, as highlighted by The Motley Fool's own research arm.\nBut as the old adage goes, past performance is no guarantee of future results. Is Nvidia ready to repeat the feat, and then repeat it again and again for the foreseeable future? Keep reading.\nThe AI market that Nvidia dominates is changing quickly\nThere's little doubt that the artificial intelligence revolution is still in its early stages. Mordor Intelligence predicts that the AI hardware market alone is set to grow at an average annualized pace of 26% through 2030. Given Nvidia's dominance of the AI accelerator industry, this rising tide bodes well for the company as well as its shareholders.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd all things considered, Nvidia stock's forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio of 26 isn't an unreasonable premium to pay for an equity of this sort. This year's top line is expected to soar more than 50%, after all, pulling per-share profits up the same amount with it.\nBut, there's some thing else to consider.\nIt's not always easy to see, but most veteran investors can -- and will -- attest to the fact that things change in ways that only become obvious after the fact. The problem is, by then it doesn't matter.\nThe brewing change that should concern anyone interested in stepping into a stake in Nvidia at this time is the way the artificial intelligence hardware industry is evolving. While Nvidia is still the king of the industry, changes are surfacing. For instance, other compute-processing architecture designed by chip-design company Arm Holdings (ARM 2.09%) is not only proving more efficient for power-hungry applications like AI, but is proving more functional in terms of how artificial intelligence platforms increasingly operate.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifically, while Nvidia's core technology can successfully power both inference-based and training-based AI, as artificial intelligence tech becomes better developed and more specialized, Arm's inference-processing tech is emerging as a favored approach. Many industry experts consider inference to be the future of AI.\n\nEven to the extent Nvidia can hold its own as inference-based models propagate, Nvidia is also now showing the world that it can't keep competitors at bay forever. Although it's modest progress, a growing number of AI service providers like TensorWave, Cirrascale, Vultr, and even Oracle and Microsoft  are now buying Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD 4.05%) newest artificial intelligence processors -- business that at one point in time would have almost certainly been Nvidia's to lose. Now it is. And AMD is arguably positioned to keep chipping away on this front.\u00a0\nIt's a worry for Nvidia's fans and investors simply because they've never actually seen the company face credible competition like this within the AI arena. Finally seeing it could cast bearish doubts, crimping the premium valuation that most people didn't mind supporting through this point.\nAnd never even mind the looming advent of quantum computing, which has enormous implications for the artificial intelligence industry with its whole new kind of computing potential.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe good news is, there's an alternative Magnificent Seven stock that is a compelling AI buy at this time.\nA better artificial intelligence prospect\nDon't panic if you already own Nvidia. You're hardly doomed. You'll likely be fine, in fact. A lackluster Nvidia is still a better bet than plenty of other companies on their best days.\nIf you're looking for a company with more artificial intelligence growth opportunity ahead of it than behind it, though, that company is Apple (AAPL 0.14%).\nNot everyone sees it. Interest in the company's generative AI solution (called Apple Intelligence) released in October of last year has been ho-hum. It did not spur a great deal of demand for the iPhone 16 introduced in September, even though that device is capable of directly running the Apple Intelligence app rather than punting AI work to the cloud. iPhone revenue for the quarter ending in December fell a bit year over year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a step back and look at the bigger picture, though. Apple's AI product itself is far from finalized, and perhaps more than that, consumers aren't quite ready to embrace the relatively new and unfamiliar technology. They will be, though. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives predicts that Apple's artificial intelligence effort will \"spark a multiyear upgrade cycle that will result in a supercycle and ultimately drive iPhone growth.\"\nThen there's Apple's work on the artificial intelligence chip design and manufacturing front.\nWhile it's still not exactly clear how it intends to monetize them, reporting from last year indicates the company is working with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Broadcom on Arm-based AI processors specifically meant for data centers. Most plausibly Apple will use them to serve iPhone owners and iOS users who choose to use Apple's existing and future artificial intelligence tools, keeping its customers in Apple's typical walled-off silo.\nNever say never, though. Apple has taken a somewhat surprising step by integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT into Apple Intelligence, giving iPhone owners a seamless means of using the third-party AI platform. It may be a hint that the technology giant is willing to entertain other growth-minded partnerships in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what about the rise of quantum computing that poses a threat to Nvidia? Apple's artificial intelligence efforts have always been consumer-focused rather than on institutional needs. Quantum's high-level nature is mostly a non-factor for Apple.\nRegardless of what's in store for Apple, Nvidia isn't likely to remain the rockstar stock it's been until now. You could certainly do worse than Nvidia, but you could very plausibly do better, too. The artificial intelligence hardware is simply changing a bit too much now to not disrupt this vulnerably valued stock's story.\n\n\n\nJames Brumley has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

And that type of ambiguity is making markets nervous.\n\nThere has been a significant reevaluation of risk and a sentiment shift to the downside for markets, said Jim Baird, the chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. He services clients with net worths beginning at $500,000, which he calls the \"millionaire-next-door\" type. In other words, they aren't yet in the ultrawealthy range where they can sit a downturn out or resort to private investments.This group of investors has enough exposure to public markets that it could seriously impact their wealth. It's a predicament that has put money managers at the forefront of rethinking their clients' exposures relative to their needs amid a rapidly shifting economic environment.\n\nBaird isn't expecting a near-term recession but is concerned about the risk of stagflation, when inflation and unemployment both remain high. For that, he's assessing whether clients have enough cash to cover their monthly needs and any big payments they may have coming up. This helps them avoid selling equities when the market is down. It's typically known as the emergency fund. But clients who are retired or nearing retirement should aim to have six to 12 months of their needs in cash. As for those who still have a wage and aren't worried about losing it, carrying too much cash doesn't make sense, he added.He is also coaching clients on strategic asset allocation while reviewing their portfolio positioning. When the stock market is volatile, it could be an opportunity to move some positions around, he noted. But those decisions would be made based on an individual client's needs. For example, if they don't have enough exposure in large caps, this could be a time to top that position while offloading other areas that could be used for tax-loss-harvesting purposes.\"Coming off of the last few years, equity investors, in particular, have done pretty well,\" Baird said. And so they may be in a decent position to reduce portfolio risk without risking their ability to meet their long-term goals and objectives.\"\n\nFor those who don't want to take too much risk on stocks or are already dependent on their investment portfolio, he advises them to lean into high-quality bonds that still provide a good enough yield. But he doesn't suggest longer-duration bonds in case there's an uptick in inflation.Ken Mahoney, the CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, advises those with net wealth between $1 million to $ 10 million in assets. He has been helping clients trim some of their positions since late last year and into 2025. But not because of the trade wars, per se: He was concerned that the stock market hadn't seen a correction in some time and expected a 10% pullback at some point.While things look gloomy right now, he's also prepared for a large change in the president's tone and policy that could bring markets flying back. His strategy with clients has been to remain tactical while watching for positive signs of change.\n\nFor those who feel like they missed the curve and the market has already turned for the worst, Mahoney says it's not too late. Investors can still make some tactical moves. Just see this as a time when the good stuff is on sale and go shopping for high-quality stocks.He expects a rally back into Big Tech stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia when the market begins to recover\u2014 although he can't guarantee when that will happen. But since these names are the most liquid stocks, institutions will add them back into their portfolios as fast as they offloaded them, he said. These companies are also supported by strong fundamentals, big balance sheets, and hefty cash, and they remain key to long-term technological innovations.However, there's still risk in the market, which means sectors like small caps may not be the place to go looking for sales. Mahoney is only sticking to the Mag 7 and potentially other stocks with relative balance sheet strength.\n\n\"We are growth managers, so that is where we will stay focused in looking to nibble at tech, and the key word there is nibble as this is not a place to get aggressive at all,\" Mahoney said. \"We like to buy high and sell higher and buy confirmed strength more in the markets we had in 2023 and 2024.\"Once the indexes start making higher lows, Mahoney would consider becoming slightly more aggressive because it's an early sign that the selling pressure is subsiding. Another sign he'll be looking for is the cooling off of the CBOE Volatility Index, a measure of the S&P 500's expected volatility.In the meantime, for investors looking for broader exposure, he suggests dollar-cost averaging \u2014 buying fixed amounts at regular intervals \u2014 into the indexes if they have time to stay in the market. That's because once we correct, you can gain an extra 10% from the reversal, Mahoney noted. And if we remain in freefall, that means more shares at a lower price, he added.\n\nThat said, you'll want some cash or what Wall Street calls \"dry powder\" to set aside so you can buy. He recommends keeping that cash in money markets that can be liquidated at the par value of $1 at any point, making them a more flexible option over bonds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkets\n\n\nInvesting\n\n\nEconomy\n \nMore \n\n\n\n\nStock Market\n\n\nRecession\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider\n      subscribers.

IDC anticipates spending on AI, including infrastructure and business services, to reach $632 billion by 2028. \nAI promises to bring greater efficiency to business operations and labor productivity, but it will require substantial investment in advanced chips to make AI smarter. The following stocks of leading chip companies could offer upside of 39% to 48% based on the average analyst price target.\n1. Advanced Micro Devices\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD 4.05%) has played runner-up to Nvidia in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market for many years. But these are the main suppliers of general-purpose GPUs, which have left AMD with a profitable market to fill out on its own. The average price target on Wall Street is currently $148.34, implying upside of 51% over the recent $98 share price.\n\nAMD's revenue grew 14% year over year in 2024, while non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share grew 25%. The company has enjoyed strong demand for its Ryzen central processing units (CPUs), in addition to GPUs for data centers. AMD's data center business made up half of its $25.7 billion in total revenue last year. \nStill, Wall Street was disappointed that AMD did not provide specific revenue guidance for its data center GPUs in its fourth-quarter earnings report. After offering guidance throughout 2024, analysts took this as a weak signal for near-term sales momentum.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, AMD's chips made for gaming and other markets are still experiencing weak demand, with revenue down in these segments. It's also not yet clear what impact tariffs might have on the chip industry, but AMD's conservative valuation may already be pricing this risk in.\nConcerns over AMD's sales momentum may be overblown, as management cited strong customer interest for its upcoming Instinct MI350 GPUs launching later this year. The stock trades at an attractive forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21, which is modest for a growing chip company and could justify the shares climbing back toward Wall Street's price target over the next year or so.\n2. Arm Holdings\nArm Holdings (ARM 2.09%) designs chips that are used in virtually every smartphone, cloud computing, and several other markets. After falling 40% off its recent highs, Wall Street analysts are still bullish on the stock's return prospects with an average price target of $158.43, implying 41% upside over the recent $112 share price.\n\nArm-based processors are in high demand for their low cost and high energy efficiency. With the escalating costs of investing in AI infrastructure, in addition to the increasing power needs of large data centers, Arm is in a strong competitive position.\n\n\n\n\n\nArm's revenue grew 19% year over year to $983 million in the most recent quarter. It earns revenue from royalties and licensing fees, which allows the company to convert more than half of its revenue into free cash flow. \nMore products and devices will become more technologically advanced, especially with AI. This could spell significant growth for Arm, which already has a strong presence in edge computing markets including the Internet of Things, smart home devices, and self-driving car systems. \nThe only thing that may keep Arm stock from reaching the consensus price target in 2025 is valuation. The stock trades at an ultra-expensive 191 times free cash flow and 148 times earnings. Even using 2026 earnings estimates, the stock still looks fully valued at 55 times forward estimates. \nA high valuation is why the stock has remained volatile over the last year despite strong demand for Arm-based processors. Investors could remain flat in 2025 until the company's growth catches up to its high earnings multiple.\n\n\n\nJohn Ballard has positions in Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia.

Here's the 1 Worth Buying Right Now.\n\n\n  \n      By Adam Levy\n  \n  \u2013\n  \n    \n      Mar 16, 2025 at 4:15AM\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nasdaq saw a rapid decline as fears of tariffs on Taiwanese imports hit chipmakers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia, Broadcom, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company were some of the worst-hit stocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestors should focus on how tariffs will impact each business long term to find real value today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNYSE: TSM\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$903B\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(0.67%)\u00a0$1.16\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$175.25\n\n\nPrice as of March 17, 2025, 9:59 a.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fears driving the market lower won't have as big of a long-term impact on this chipmaker.\n\nIt's been a long time since investors have had to face the reality that stock prices can, indeed, decline. You have to go back all the way to Oct. 2023 to find the last time one of the major stock indexes fell more than 10% from its all-time high, marking what's known as a correction.\nSometimes those corrections are slow and gradual, as in 2023, and other times the losses come much more swiftly -- as they did recently. From Feb. 19 through Mar. 10, the Nasdaq Composite dropped nearly 13%.\nThe sell-off was fueled by President Donald Trump's trade policies and fears that he would enact additional tariffs on Taiwan, a key supplier of chips used in AI data centers. As a result, some of the biggest movers were the artificial intelligence stocks that pushed the Nasdaq to new all-time highs in February.\nNvidia (NVDA -0.37%), Broadcom (AVGO -0.52%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM 0.67%) all saw huge drops in their stock prices. Combined, they lost $1.16 trillion in market cap during that period.\nWhile it might be tempting to pick up shares of all three companies at these lower prices, one of them stands out as an incredible value with a sustainable competitive advantage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe big fear driving AI stocks lower\nThere are numerous factors that have led to the drop in AI stocks over the last few weeks. Greater economic uncertainty has hurt consumer confidence as U.S. trade policies increase geopolitical tensions. If there's one thing markets hate, it's uncertainty.\nPerhaps the biggest uncertainty hitting chipmakers, though, is the potential for the Trump administration to enact new tariffs on Taiwan, home of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC. Nearly all of the biggest chipmakers, including Nvidia and Broadcom, rely on TSMC to produce and package their chips. The foundry, as chip manufacturers are called, attracts nearly two-thirds of all spending on chip fabrication.\nA tariff on Taiwan would substantially increase costs for Nvidia and Broadcom (and practically every other chipmaker). As a result, they'd have to increase their prices or take a hit to their profit margins (probably both).\n\nHigher prices also means they could see lower demand for their chips. While the big tech companies buying Nvidia and Broadcom chips have massive budgets, they don't have infinite money. And with increasing pressure on those companies to show meaningful returns on their investments, there's probably not much room in the budget to increase spending.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat lower demand works its way back to TSMC, which faces the challenge of substantial fixed costs. Lower utilization rates of its facilities means it could see a big drag on profitability if tariffs go into effect or demand declines for any other reason.\nTSMC has tried to take matters into its own hands to appeal to the Trump administration. It committed to investing an additional $100 billion in the U.S. on top of its plans to expand its facilities in Arizona over the next two years. If the current administration wants more chip manufacturing to take place in the U.S., TSMC is signalling its willingness to make that happen.\nThinking long term\nAmid the current sell-off, it's important for investors to think about the long-term potential of any investment.\nNvidia's position looks most precarious in the long run. Higher costs for its chips could accelerate a shift from its biggest customers to more cost-efficient alternatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeta Platforms is already working on a custom AI accelerator chip for training its Llama foundational models. It's reportedly aiming to use those chips for training by 2026. It currently uses its own chips for machine learning and expanding its use to AI inference this year. The other three hyperscalers have expressed similar aspirations and have seen good results with their custom silicon.\nIt's worth noting Meta and Alphabet both rely on Broadcom's technology to create custom chips. So, rising costs could end up benefiting Broadcom's custom AI accelerator business. Management said it expects that business combined with its network solutions to reach a serviceable addressable market between $60 billion and $90 billion by 2027. However, its networking chips remain a substantial portion of that business, so the effect could be muted.\n\nTSMC, meanwhile, might not be as impacted long term as some might think. It's hard to overstate how big its technology lead is. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called TSMC \"the world's best by an incredible margin.\"\nSwitching from TSMC to another foundry isn't a viable option for Nvidia, Broadcom, or most of its other most core customers. First of all, there aren't many options that have the manufacturing scale they need. Increasing production capacity takes a long time. Second of all, these chips are designed with TSMC's processes. In some cases, they're designed with custom TSMC processes, such as Nvidia's Blackwell platform. It would take months of redesign and validation to switch to a competitor. Lastly, the resulting product would likely decline in quality as other foundries can't match TSMC's capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvest in the AI stock with staying power and great value\nTSMC likely has the most sustainable long-term competitive advantage, and that's a self-reinforcing phenomenon. As TSMC attracts more revenue for high-end chip designs than any other foundry, it's able to invest more in research and development, new equipment, and capacity expansion, thus positioning it to win even more contracts in the future.\n\nWhile the foundry could see a downward blip in demand, it doesn't face a significant competitive threat. What's more, demand should remain relatively stable as hyperscalers switch to lower-cost alternative GPUs or their own custom silicon. TSMC has contracts with all of them, including Meta for its new custom AI chip.\nMost importantly, the stock trades for an absolute bargain. After the sell-off in recent weeks, investors can buy it for less than 20 times forward earnings estimates as of this writing. Even if it does see some margin contraction and slower demand growth in the short term, that's a price that can easily absorb the hit for a company with otherwise incredible growth prospects and strong competitive advantages.\n\n\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

This is an alarming turn of events for a Wall Street darling that has benefited from two big hype cycles: generative AI and the election of Donald Trump. \nLet's dig deeper to find out if this dip is a buying opportunity or a signal to stay far away from an increasingly volatile tech stock.\n\nWhat has changed for Palantir?\nSince hitting public markets through an initial public offering (IPO) in October 2020, Palantir has always enjoyed a bit of a cult following. For years, the CIA-funded start-up made a name for itself by helping government and military clients with big data analytics -- playing a crucial role in the War on Terror when the company helped the U.S. track down Osama Bin Laden in 2011.\nBut even at the start of its public trading, Palantir was more hype than substance. After the IPO boom, shares languished for around four years until the generative artificial intelligence (AI) hype cycle reignited interest in the company. The expectation is that generative AI will allow Palantir to improve its data analytics capabilities -- even offering real-time insights during fast-paced scenarios like battlefields or law enforcement operations.\nThe synergy is undeniable. Large language models (LLMs) need large amounts of data, which Palantir already handles for its clients. General AI will be yet another tool in its tool kit as it helps organizations optimize their operations, detect fraud, and accomplish critical missions.\n\n\n\n\n\nA story of hype over fundamentals \nWhile Palantir has clear synergies with generative AI, that isn't actually translating to booming growth. In full-year 2020 (two years before ChatGPT introduced the world to generative AI), Palantir's revenue grew by 47%. However, by the full year 2024, the growth rate fell to 29%, which indicates that the new tech isn't exactly a game changer.\nFor comparison, an AI winner like Nvidia saw its top-line growth increase from 53% to 114% over the same time frame.\nDespite not being a major AI winner, Palantir's stock price climbed a whopping 722% over the last five years, slightly outpacing Nvidia's 704%. This dynamic shows how much hype is built into Palantir's valuation.\n\nPLTR data by YCharts\n\n\n\n\n\nPalantir's bottom-line situation is also disappointing. While the company reports adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $379.5 million, this adds back a whopping $281.8 in stock-based compensation, which is company equity given to employees. While this allows Palantir to save cash, it can increase the number of shares outstanding and dilute the holdings of existing shareholders.\nDoes Palantir have a Trump card?\nTrump's election victory has been another source of hype for Palantir (shares rose more than 60% since Nov. 5.). But just like with AI, this presents few fundamental advantages for the company. Trump has been working to reduce U.S. federal spending. Under new Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the Pentagon plans to slash its budget by 8% (around $50 billion annually) every year for the next five years.\nU.S. government clients made up around 42% of Palantir's revenue in 2024. With Uncle Sam set to tighten his belt over the coming years, Palantir could be in hot water. \nFurther challenges come from overseas government clients like the armed forces of Ukraine, which uses Palantir's software for targeting in its war with Russia. Trump is working to wind down this conflict, potentially cutting more of the company's vital revenue stream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nPalantir stock is a screaming sell \nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E)\u00a0multiple of 135, Palantir's stock price doesn't account for the company's many challenges. Top-line growth is decent but not spectacular, while extreme stock-based compensation expense eats into its bottom line. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is shaping up to be a challenge, not an opportunity. \nPalantir shares have already fallen 37% from their all-time high, and unfortunately, even more downside looks inevitable.\n\n\n\nWill Ebiefung has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

He also purchased 1.4 million shares of Vistra (VST 1.80%), more than doubling his stake. Vistra is a power-generation company that could benefit if artificial intelligence boosts data center electricity demand.\nImportantly, shares of Amazon and Vistra have declined about 10% since the fourth quarter ended, but Wall Street expects both stocks to rebound sharply in the coming months, as detailed below:\n\nAmazon has a median target price of $270 per share, which implies 36% upside from its current share price of $198.\nVistra's median target price is $192 per share, implying 55% upside from its current share price of $124.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\n1. Amazon\nAmazon has three important growth engines: e-commerce, digital advertising, and public cloud services. And it's using artificial intelligence (AI) to improve revenue and operating efficiency across all three segments. In particular, Amazon is an underappreciated AI leader in retail and cloud computing, according to Morgan Stanley.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, Amazon runs the largest online marketplace in the world outside of China, and it supports its merchants with a vast logistics network. To reinforce its strong market presence, the company uses machine learning models to recommend products, optimize inventory allocation, and plan delivery routes. Those efforts have already led to an uptick in margins.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the leading public cloud in terms of sales and the most popular cloud among developers. That alone positions the company as a winner in the AI boom. But the company is also innovating quickly. CEO Andy Jassy recently said, \"In the last 18 months,\u00a0AWS has released nearly twice as many machine learning and generative AI features as the other leading cloud providers combined.\"\nAmazon looked strong in the fourth quarter, despite missing sales estimates in the adtech segment. Revenue increased 10% to $187 billion,\u00a0operating margin expanded more than 3 percentage points, and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings rose 86% to $1.00 per diluted share. Management also said cloud revenue could have grown faster had AWS not been capacity-constrained.\nWall Street expects Amazon's earnings to grow at 21% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 36 times earnings look quite reasonable. So, why did Tepper sell Amazon in the fourth quarter? I suspect he was rebalancing his portfolio, but I doubt he has lost conviction in the stock. Amazon was still his second-largest holding when the quarter ended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Vistra\nVistra is an integrated power-generation and retail electricity company. Its portfolio of coal, natural gas, nuclear, and renewable energy facilities collectively offers 41,000 megawatts of generation capacity, making Vistra the largest competitive power producer in the United States. It also owns the second-largest nuclear fleet in the country.\nVistra primarily operates in the ERCOT (Texas) and PJM (13 eastern states) markets, which positions it to benefit from increased manufacturing activity, electrification of the Permian Basin, and increased electricity consumption from AI data centers. Demand through 2030 in those regions is forecast to grow nearly three times faster than it did in the past decade.\nVistra reported solid fourth-quarter financial results. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), which excludes the unrealized gains and losses on contracts used to hedge against energy price volatility, rose 107% to $1.9 billion.\u00a0But the stock fell sharply following the report because investors were disappointed that Vistra has yet to sign deals to supply power to big tech data centers.\nOn that point, investors have reason to question how much AI data centers will boost electricity demand. In recent technical papers, Chinese start-up DeepSeek claimed to have trained AI models comparable to those from U.S. companies like OpenAI, but DeepSeek did so with fewer and less powerful Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn short, some of the anticipated electricity demand may not materialize, and I doubt that possibility has been fully priced into the stock. Vistra currently trades at 17.5 times free cash flow, a substantial premium to the two-year average of 11.8 times free cash flow. That makes the stock somewhat risky.\nAdmittedly, Vistra shares could soar if the company signs data center power deals with big tech companies. But right now, I would rather own an index fund that tracks the utilities sector as opposed to this specific stock because the latter strategy involves more concentration risk.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Nvidia is banned by Washington from selling its advanced H100 and H800 chips from the Hopper series to China-based clients.Advertisement"

United States Steel became the first $1 billion company in 1901, and 117 years later in 2018, Apple became the first enterprise to achieve a valuation of $1 trillion. \nApple remains the world's largest company with a market capitalization of $3.3 trillion. But since 2018, several other American organizations have joined it in the trillion-dollar club, including Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Berkshire Hathaway. Tesla and Broadcom were also members until they recently suffered sharp declines in their stock prices.\nI think one more company has the potential to cross the $1 trillion milestone in the coming years. Oracle (ORCL 3.52%) operates some of the best data center infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI) development, and management's guidance suggests this part of its business could grow tenfold over the long term.\nOracle is valued at $403 billion as of this writing, so investors who buy the stock today could earn a whopping 148% gain if it does join the $1 trillion club.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nDemand for AI data centers is through the roof\nThere are two key phases involved in developing an AI model: The training phase is when a developer feeds the model mountains of data for it to learn from, and the inference phase is when the model accepts inputs from users and generates responses (like when you interact with a chatbot). Both require a substantial amount of computing power, and most developers source it from companies like Oracle.\n\n\n\n\n\nOracle operates some of the best AI data centers in the world. They are fitted with state-of-the-art graphics processing units (GPUs) from leading suppliers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, which are chips specifically designed to handle AI workloads. In fact, Oracle is currently building a cluster of 64,000 Nvidia Blackwell GB200 GPUs -- not only is that the most powerful chip in the industry right now, but this will also be one of the largest clusters on offer by any data center operator. \nWhen developers have access to more chips, they can process more data, more quickly, and thus deploy much \"smarter\" AI models. But scale isn't Oracle's only advantage, because its proprietary random direct memory access (RDMA) networking technology allows data to move from one point to another much faster than traditional Ethernet networks. Since developers typically pay for computing capacity by the minute, this can result in significant cost savings.\nOracle opened its 101st data center cloud region during its fiscal 2025 third quarter (ended on Feb. 28), but demand continued to significantly outstrip supply. In fact, chairman Larry Ellison said GPU usage for AI training purposes alone has soared by a staggering 244% over the last 12 months, and the company is also seeing \"enormous\" demand for inference workloads. \nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks next-generation AI reasoning models, which spend more time \"thinking\" before rendering responses, will consume 100 times more computing power than their predecessors. As a result, demand for data center capacity for inference workloads is only just heating up, so it's no surprise Oracle wants to grow its footprint to between 1,000 and 2,000 cloud regions over the long term. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, Oracle could eventually have over 10 times more data centers in operation than it does today.\n\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue is soaring\nOracle generated $14.1 billion in total revenue during the fiscal 2025 third quarter, but the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) segment (which is where the company accounts for its AI data centers) represented just $2.7 billion of that figure. \nHowever, while Oracle's total revenue increased by just 6% year over year, OCI revenue soared by 49%, making it the fastest-growing part of the entire organization by a wide margin. The OCI business would be growing even faster if it had enough data centers to meet demand, which is why the company expects revenue growth to significantly accelerate as more capacity comes online. \nOracle CEO Safra Catz expects OCI revenue to increase by more than 50% for the fiscal 2025 full year (ending May 31), with an even faster growth rate in the cards for fiscal 2026. \n\n\n\n\n\nTo put a fine point on Oracle's future potential, the company's remaining performance obligations (RPOs) soared by 63% to a record high of $130 billion (across all business segments) during the third quarter. RPOs are like an order backlog that is expected to convert into revenue in the future, and Larry Ellison said demand for capacity for AI training and inference workloads were big drivers of the Q3 surge. \nOracle's path to the $1 trillion club\nOracle generated $4.26 in earnings per share (EPS) over the last four quarters, which places its stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33.8. That is roughly on par with the valuations of other AI cloud companies like Microsoft and Amazon, so the stock isn't necessarily cheap, nor is it expensive:\n\nPE Ratio data by YCharts\nHowever, Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo!) suggests Oracle could deliver $6.78 in EPS during fiscal 2026 (which begins in June 2025). That places its stock at a forward P/E ratio of just 21.1, implying it would have to rise by 59% over the next year or so just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 33.8.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf that scenario plays out, it would lift Oracle's valuation to $640 billion. From there, the company could reach the $1 trillion club within five years if it grows its EPS by just 9.3% annually. I think that is very achievable for two reasons: First, the company's estimated EPS for fiscal 2026 represents growth of 13%, and second, management is forecasting accelerating revenue growth, led by the OCI business.\nOracle's data centers rely heavily on automation, which reduces labor and other operating costs. As a result, the company anticipates rising profit margins as the OCI business continues to scale up, which will boost its EPS overall. Remember, Oracle plans to grow its data center footprint more than tenfold from here, which could drive explosive earnings growth over the long term.\nTherefore, I think Oracle has a clear path to joining the $1 trillion club in the coming years, and its stock could be a great addition to any diversified portfolio.\n\n\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

However, that momentum seems lost now, considering the tech-heavy index has declined about 10% in 2025. The U.S. market is now concerned about a potential U.S. recession and the impact of new trade policies -- fears that the Trump administration has failed to calm.\nIn the face of heightened market volatility and low investor confidence, some prominent analysts expect the Nasdaq to see even more selling in the coming days. While this pullback is worrisome, it can also prove to be a smart time to buy stakes in some fundamentally strong Nasdaq stocks that have seen a significant correction.\nHere's why Nvidia (NVDA -0.37%) and Microsoft (MSFT 0.09%) fit the bill. Let's assess why these stocks could prove compelling picks now.\nNvidia\nNvidia released a strong fiscal 2025 performance (ended Jan. 31, 2025) on Feb. 26, with revenue growing 114% year over year to $130.5 billion and operating income rising 147% to $81.5 billion. While the company faces gross margin pressures due to the ongoing ramp of Blackwell architecture chips, it expects gross margins to revert to mid-70s levels in fiscal 2026.\n\nBlackwell architecture chips are undoubtedly a major growth catalyst for Nvidia and contributed $11 billion in sales in the fourth quarter. These chips have been designed mainly for inference (deploying and running AI models) and reasoning workloads, with 25 times higher token output and 20 times lower cost than previous H100 chips. Reasoning is a special use case in inference workloads, involving more computation per task for resolving complicated and multistep problems.\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides inference, Blackwell architecture has been optimized for all other AI workloads, including pre-training and post-training deployed across cloud, on-premise, and enterprise. Unsurprisingly, major cloud service providers, such as Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet, are using Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs) to process their AI workloads.\nNvidia accounted for almost a 92% share of the data center GPU market (AI hardware market) in 2024. The company has also created a strong moat for its hardware business with its Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software stack (a comprehensive parallel programming development environment optimized for running AI and high-performance computing workloads on Nvidia chips).\nSince CUDA is already well-adopted by developers and AI researchers globally, switching to competitors' chips can involve significant costs for client organizations. Subsequently, Nvidia's hardware-software offerings are finding applications in new use cases in areas such as agentic AI, robotics, sovereign AI, and autonomous vehicles.\nDespite the many pros, investors are disappointed with Nvidia's decelerating data center growth and margin pressures amid a difficult macroeconomic environment marked by export controls, tariff wars, and surging geopolitical pressures. Subsequently, Nvidia's shares have tanked by nearly 28% from their 52-week high ($149.43 as of Jan. 6).\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is trading at just under 20 times sales, significantly lower than its historical five-year average of 26.2, and at 36.4 times trailing-12-month earnings, lower than its historical five-year average of 71.6. More impressively, Nvidia's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is just 0.25, which is modest for a company with exceptional growth prospects. Considering Nvidia's AI market leadership, robust hardware-software ecosystem, and corrected valuation, the stock may be a smart buy now.\nMicrosoft\nShares of Microsoft are down by about 10% in 2025. While the fall is not as steep as seen in Nvidia stock, the dip has created an attractive entry point for astute investors.\nMicrosoft came out with a healthy financial performance in the second-quarter of its fiscal 2025 (ended Dec. 31, 2024), with revenue rising 12% year over year to $69.6 billion and net income increasing 10% to $24.1 billion. Despite this, the stock performed negatively due to investor concerns about weak third-quarter guidance and a slowdown in the Azure cloud services business due to capacity constraints.\nHowever, Microsoft is well-positioned to benefit from a phenomenon termed as Jevons Paradox. Accordingly, increased price performance gains for AI hardware and software in inference workloads will lead to exponentially greater access and demand for AI hardware and software services. The company's strategic partnership with OpenAI has also been a major pillar of its AI strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the second quarter, commercial bookings were up by 67% year over year, driven by Azure commitments from OpenAI. With OpenAI's cutting-edge AI models, Microsoft has revamped its entire product ecosystem. Furthermore, since OpenAI's application programming interfaces (APIs) currently run primarily on Azure, it helps Microsoft further attract clients to its cloud platform.\nThe tech giant is also at the forefront of the ongoing agentic AI revolution with its CoPilot offerings. Microsoft 365 CoPilot is seeing strong adoption across enterprises of all sizes. Coupled with CoPilot Chat and CoPilot Studio, Microsoft is aggressively pushing forth the usage of AI agents in organizational workflows.\nMicrosoft's shares trade at just over 30 times trailing-12-month earnings, which seems rich for a company with moderate growth numbers. However, that valuation is cheaper than its historical five-year average of 33.2. The company also returned a hefty $9.7 billion to shareholders as dividends and share repurchases in the second quarter.\nThe company's commercial remaining performance obligations (RPOs, indicative of future revenue that can be earned from existing contracts) were $298 billion at the end of the second quarter. Thanks to high long-term revenue visibility, Microsoft enjoys a premium valuation. Hence, it makes sense to pick at least a small stake in this stock now.\n\n\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

If that is the only source for products, then consumers or businesses may hold out on purchasing them to wait out tariffs in the hope that they will be reduced.\nFurthermore, if products become more expensive in general due to tariffs, it could reduce consumer confidence and cause spending to drop across the board.\nMany investors are worried about this, which is why the stock market has sold off so heavily over the past week. However, I think three companies can weather the storm caused by President Trump's tariff policies, and each looks like a strong buy following the sell-off.\nNvidia and Broadcom are important hardware providers\nMany companies could (and likely will) emerge on the other side of these tariffs just fine, but I'm focusing on AI hardware suppliers, as these are the companies most affected by tariffs. Nvidia (NVDA -0.27%), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.64%), and Broadcom (AVGO -0.51%) are all crucial suppliers for AI hyperscalers, and I think they will be just fine amid the tariffs.\nThe reason? The big AI companies can't live without the hardware suppliers' products. Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) that are deployed in vast quantities to train AI models and then operate them once deployed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIts GPUs and the infrastructure that supports them are the best in the game and have little competition. If you include other competitors, they also source parts from outside the U.S., so they are subject to the same fears as Nvidia. With how vital GPUs are to the AI race, the company will be just fine.\n\nBroadcom is in a similar business: It makes connectivity switches and custom AI accelerators (which it calls XPUs), among many other things, but these two product lines in particular are expected to provide massive growth over the next few years.\nCurrently, only three companies use Broadcom's XPUs, and by 2027, this division will be pursuing a $60 billion to $90 billion market opportunity. However, four more customers are getting their XPUs up and running, which will add to this opportunity. Considering that revenue over the past 12 months totaled $54 billion, this would be huge growth. \nWhile there are some fears centered around tariffs for these two, the push for AI supremacy is much greater. As a result, investors need to look past the short term and realize that there is still a ton of long-term potential with Nvidia and Broadcom.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor looks like it avoided tariffs with its latest announcement\nTaiwan Semiconductor (or TSMC for short) is a major supplier for both of these companies. Neither of them can actually manufacture chips, so they have to get them from somewhere, and TSMC is the best option available for high-end chips.\nPresident Trump threatened to levy a tariff on Taiwan, but that threat seems to have faded away after TSMC announced another $100 billion investment in U.S. semiconductor production facilities.\nTaiwan's president and the CEO of Taiwan Semiconductor denied that President Trump forced this expansion, but the end result is the same: Trump got what he wanted by having TSMC move more of its production to the U.S. \n\nSo, one of the most crucial suppliers that might have driven up prices for Nvidia and Broadcom products doesn't need to worry about tariffs right now -- and these three are free of the burden of tariffs, at least right now.\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil the market is convinced that the threat of tariffs is gone, these three will likely continue to sell off, which gives investors a huge opportunity to buy shares for a fantastic price.\nAll three stocks haven't been this cheap in over a year\nFollowing the sell-off, these three find themselves at price points rarely seen over the past year.\n\nAVGO PE Ratio (forward) data by YCharts.\nFirst, Taiwan Semiconductor looks ridiculously cheap at 18.8 times forward earnings. It's one of the world's most important companies, yet it trades at a lower multiple than the broader S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.47%), which has a 19.8 forward earnings multiple. This pricing mismatch doesn't make much sense, and investors should pounce on the opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is also quite inexpensive considering how vital its GPUs are, and the decline from where it spent most of 2024 is another golden opportunity to buy shares on the cheap.\nLastly, Broadcom is the most expensive, but if the XPU market takes off as predicted, this could be a bargain price for the stock.\nAll three stocks look like fantastic buys, but investors must have a long-term mindset. The companies will likely be successful investments over a three- to five-year time frame. But there could be some more short-term pain since it's impossible to call a market bottom in the middle of a sell-off.\n\n\n\nKeithen Drury has positions in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.
