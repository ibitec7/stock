[+] the Nasdaq MarketSite on September 14, 2023 in New York City. Arm, the chip design firm that supplies core technology to companies that include Apple and NVidia, priced its initial public offering at $51 a share.  (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Getty Images\nNvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) has done exceedingly well this year rising by almost 3x since early January. There\u2019s a lot going on for Nvidia. Technology companies and developers have been rushing to deploy generative artificial intelligence into their applications following the success of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT chatbot and this is driving a windfall of sorts for Nvidia, whose high-end graphics processing chips, such as the A100 and H100, remain the go-to products for AI workloads. Over the most recently reported quarter, Nvidia\u2019s revenue roughly doubled year-over-year to $13.51 billion, beating guidance of $11 billion. Nvidia is also turning incredibly profitable due to the AI surge. Net income rose over 5x compared to last year to $6.7 billion, as gross margins jumped to 71.2% from 45.9% in the year-ago quarter. The momentum is expected to hold up. For Q3, Nvidia has guided that revenues could grow by 170% year-over-year. Nvidia is also in a relatively favorable position with respect to supply. The company has substantially larger commitments from its suppliers to meet demand and has indicated that it expects supply to increase each quarter through next year.\n\n\nNVDA stock had a Sharpe Ratio of 1.1 since early 2017, which is higher than 0.6 for the S&P 500 Index over the same period. Compare this with the Sharpe of 1.2 for the Trefis Reinforced Value portfolio. Sharpe is a measure of return per unit of risk, and high-performance portfolios can provide the best of both worlds.\n\nThat being said, at the current market price of about $420 per share, there are potential risks that investors should be aware of. While Nvidia remains in pole position on the market for AI chips, traditional chipmakers such as Intel\nINTC\n and AMD are investing significantly to catch up in this space given the high stakes. AMD recently unveiled the MI300X chip which is targeted specifically at large language model training and inference for generative AI workloads. The chip\u2019s specs, which include 192 gigabytes of high-bandwidth memory, well ahead of the 120 GB found on Nvidia\u2019s H100 data center GPU, indicate that it could compete favorably with Nvidia. Moreover, big tech players like Google\nGOOG\n are doubling down on AI and machine learning-related silicon. For example, Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Units are specialized integrated circuits focused on machine learning. Although Nvidia\u2019s chips are superior in terms of overall performance at the moment, with the company also using proprietary software and programming languages to better lock in customers, competition will make Nvidia\u2019s current growth and abnormally high margins unsustainable.\n\n\nWith AI viewed as a transformational technology, governments are looking to regulate the sector. The Biden administration has placed export restrictions on the export of advanced chips such as the A100 and H100 GPUs to China. While Nvidia has tweaked the design, offering A800 and H800 AI chips that play within the rules to the Chinese market, this does underscore the risks for the company given that data center sales to China account for between 20% to 25% of the company\u2019s overall data center sales. The U.S. government also recently expanded the ban on high-end AI chips to include some countries in the Middle East. While Nvidia doesn\u2019t see a material impact from these bans, geopolitical risks could remain a factor for the company.\n\nNvidia\u2019s valuation is also relatively lofty. The stock trades at about 40x FY\u201924 earnings and about 18x revenue. This compares to the broader semiconductor industry average price-to-sales multiple of about 4.5x. Tesla\nTSLA\n stock didn\u2019t trade at P/S multiples of these levels at its peak in 2020-2021. Although the company has growth on its side, with sales likely to roughly double this year per consensus estimates, this could prove a risk for investors if growth falters for any reason, particularly in the current high-interest rate environment. We remain neutral on Nvidia stock with a valuation of $408 per share, which is slightly below the current market price.

CoreWeave is oddly run by Wall Street-types with limited experience in building a GPU cloud platform using Nvidia\u2019s highly sought-after chips. Joseph questions what a group of traders and portfolio managers brings to the table for a company as in demand as Nvidia.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really weird that Nvidia and Microsoft Azure would get so deeply involved with them,\"\u00a0Tech analyst\u00a0Ami Joseph\u00a0explains in\u00a0The Call @ Hedgeye.\u00a0\"Why them of all partners to choose? It just seems like a bad choice of partner. There's some sort of smell around it.\"\nHowever, Joseph is quick to point out\u2026 \u201cI don\u2019t think Nvidia has any incentive to go to jail. They are certainly not desperate for buyers. There is a shortage of GPUs out there and they could sell these things to anyone,\u201d continues Joseph. \u201cIf you remove CoreWeave as a customer, my guess is Nvidia\u2019s year is just fine, and there\u2019s no real change in the direction.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIs AI the future? Absolutely, I think it is,\" Joseph concludes. \"Are we in this kind of little over-fueled bubble potentially?

At the forefront among these beneficiaries is Nvidia Corp. NVDA, which has fetched multibagger returns this year.\nNvidia originally designed its GPUs with video games in mind, but researchers would soon discover their handiness in training deep learning models. The company, under the leadership of its President and CEO Jensen Huang, capitalized on the development by launching general-purpose GPUs.\u00a0\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives recently dubbed Huang the \"godfather of AI.\"\nMeanwhile, the popularity of electric vehicle stocks led by Tesla Inc. TSLA among retail traders and investors has been significantly muted.With wider market conditions becoming unfavorable and CEO Elon Musk's heightened focus on social media venture X, which he rebranded from Twitter, Tesla has fallen relatively out of favor as seen with its price trajectory.\n\nFigure: Comparison of market price trajectory of TSLA and NVDA over a period of one year. Credit: Neer Varshney /Benzinga\nTesla\u2019s price has fallen about 16.5% over the past year, from $287.81 on Sept. 28, 2022, to $240.50 on Sept. 27, 2023, the timeframe studied by Benzinga.\u00a0\nIn the same timeframe, Nvidia price has surged about 233.6%, from $127.28 to $424.68.\nAlso Read: S&P 500 Nears Crucial Support: Analysts Warn of Disappointing Returns If 200-Day Average Is Breached\nHow Tesla And Nvidia's Returns Compare\u00a0\nA theoretical $100 investment in both stocks a year ago would have fetched wildly different returns.\u00a0\nThe $100 investment would be worth $333.65 in Nvidia, a handsome $250.09 higher than the $83.56 returned by Tesla stock.\n\nFigure: Comparison of scaled returns delivered by TSLA and NVDA over a period of one year. Credit: Neer Varshney /Benzinga\nDo TSLA And NVDA Price Actions Correlate?\nLinear regression in statistics is considered a fine indicator to measure the correlation between two stocks.\u00a0 The coefficient of determination (R2) for Nvidia stock price's dependency on Tesla comes at about 0.4454, which indicates a moderate positive relationship between the two stocks.This is not a surprise given the wider trend and the tendency of major tech stocks to see similar movements and react to the same events. It is also worth noting that while the coefficient is good for measuring correlation, it doesn't on its own imply any kind of causation.\n\nFigure: Linear regression analysis of TSLA and NVDA to see if there is a correlation in how the stocks move. Credit: Neer Varshney /Benzinga\nTSLA Or NVDA: What About Dividends?\nTesla as a matter of principle doesn't pay dividends. The company has never declared any dividends and says it doesn't plan to either. \"We intend on retaining all future earnings to finance future growth and therefore, do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future,\" the electric vehicle maker declares on its website.\n\nFigure: Comparison of how much dividends TSLA and NVDA have declared over the last three years..\nNvidia like most of its growth-centric tech peers is also not among the dividend aristocrats. The chipmaker has been shelling out a humble 4 cents in revenue each quarter for the past year.\nHow NVDA Vs. TSLA Compare On PE\nThe P/E ratio or price-to-earnings ratio helps us see how much investors are willing to pay for every unit of a company\u2019s earnings.\nInvestors typically seek a stock with a moderate P/E as a value bargain, but there is no hard and fast rule as to whether a higher or a lower P/E is good.\u00a0\nMany investors are willing to bet bigger sums on stocks where they see the potential for growth in the longer term \u2014 these stocks can continue reaching greater heights even after having a higher P/E, as is the case with both the stocks in consideration today.\nSimilarly, a stock with a low P/E could simply be one that investors do not see any growth potential for, and therefore do not consider it a good buy at current prices, despite them being relatively moderate in line with current earnings.\nIn the case of Tesla, the trailing P/E is 69.31, while the forward P/E is 54.91.\u00a0\nIn the case of Nvidia, the trailing P/E is 103.08, and analysts forecast a more moderate forward-looking P/E at 26.93.\n\nThe PEG ratio adds a key dimension to the P/E ratio \u2014 by dividing it by the stock's project growth based on analyst estimates.\nIn the case of Tesla and Nvidia, the stark difference in the PEG ratio is notable.\nNvidia's 0.56 PEG ratio implies that the stock is undervalued in terms of the growth rates projected by the analysts.\nTesla's PEG ratio of 9.41 implies that investors expect the stock to grow significantly above the growth rates that analysts are forecasting.\nAnalyst Forecasts\nAs for which stock is likely to deliver better returns in the coming years \u2014 the analyst consensus is quite clear, according to data from Yahoo! Finance.\nNvidia\u2019s stock has a 39.5% upside from the latest price, according to a consensus of 45 analysts, with an overall Buy sentiment.\nTesla stock has a downside of 5.32%, according to a consensus of 36 analysts, with an overall Hold sentiment.\n\nNow Read: Tesla\u2019s VP Of Vehicle Engineering On New Model 3 Highland: \u2018It\u2019s All A Bit Like Artwork\u2019\nPhoto: ShutterstockNVDANVIDIA Corp$119.68-1.64%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock \u2013 anytime.Reveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum85.55Growth88.64Quality97.50Value6.95Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewTSLATesla Inc$237.20-5.11%Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

To get news like this delivered straight to your inbox,\u00a0click here.\nNvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) second-quarter results on Aug. 23 should have been a triumph for AI enthusiasts. The Silicon Valley chipmaker beat revenue estimates by 20.3% and net profits by 29.5%. These stunning figures would ordinarily send any stock soaring. Or at least give bulls some hope for future earnings growth.\nBut investors would have been disappointed on both counts. Nvidia\u2019s stock rose less than 1% over the following week \u2014 a tiny fraction of what bulls might have expected. And instead of future developments, Nvidia\u2019s management announced a $25 billion stock buyback program. These programs are typically designed to shrink companies and boost earnings per share once growth begins to slow. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), for instance, started its share buyback program in 2013 just as iPhone profits reached a downward inflection point.\nInstead, the real winners of Nvidia\u2019s boom have been options traders\u2026 or at least its market makers. These speculators often care little about what an underlying company does. As long as the underlying asset promises to move in a predictable direction, these gamblers are more than happy to buy in. Activity in Nvidia\u2019s options has risen eightfold since 2021, and InvestorPlace.com contributor Michael Gayed has gone as far as to call Nvidia a \u201csource of liquidity\u201d\u00a0\u2014 a term usually reserved for either the Federal Reserve or \u201cThe Bank of Mom and Dad.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time a new technology has become a zero-sum betting game. In 2017, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) became a de facto casino after its futures were listed on the highly liquid Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Over $50 trillion in Bitcoin has since changed hands despite the crypto\u2019s inability to find many real-world uses. Japanese real estate in the 1990s and Chinese tech stocks of the 2000s share many similarities. At the height of the 2008 and 2014 Chinese stock market bubbles, many day traders admitted to only knowing their investments by their six-digit tickers. As the mystique of artificial intelligence grows, Nvidia\u2019s shares risk falling into the same trap.\nCastles in the Sky\nFirst, it\u2019s important to note that Nvidia has some significant differences from cryptocurrencies. The former is a business that generates cash flow; analysts expect Nvidia to generate up to $30 billion in free cash flow this year. The chipmaker is also a picks-and-shovels play on artificial intelligence, a field with fewer established alternatives to crypto payments. Meanwhile, Bitcoin and other cryptos typically generate no internal cash flows. (Cash generated from staking is more like money-lending). Real-world adoption of these coins also remains limited to a handful of companies and super-fans.\nBut Nvidia and Bitcoin also share a lot in common.\nConsider valuation. Today, Nvidia\u2019s $1.13 trillion valuation represents a 240X multiple of trailing earnings, making it the most expensive tech stock based on normalized figures. Even if the chipmaker raises its net income 8X from $4.37 billion to $37.96 billion by fiscal 2026, the company would have to keep increasing that figure by 7.3% per year for the next two decades to justify its current share price of $470.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs for its lofty $622 Wall Street price target? Nvidia will have to generate $145 billion of free cash flow by 2042 to justify that valuation, 2.5X more than what  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) makes today.\nThere\u2019s also growing evidence that traders are piling into NVDA stock to gamble. According to Fintel, net gamma exposure to Nvidia\u2019s stock reached as high as $636.61 earlier this week after speculators bought an enormous number of bullish call options. For every 1% Nvidia\u2019s stock price rises, market makers will now lose roughly $636.61 million, compared to $0 in 2022. The entire market capitalization of Nvidia now also turns over once every 30 days, compared to 65-80 days in previous years.\nThat makes Nvidia more like Bitcoin than a promising semiconductor stock. As Josh Enomoto notes on our free news site, InvestorPlace.com, target prices are getting driven ever higher by credulous Wall Street analysts.\nManagement Knows Nvidia Isn\u2019t Worth $1.13 Trillion\nNvidia\u2019s management clearly understands the disconnect. During the company\u2019s Q2 earnings call, chief financial officer Colette Kress announced that the board approved an additional $25 billion for stock repurchases to add to its remaining $4 billion authorization. The firm also returned roughly $3.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter through share repurchases and dividends. To them, it\u2019s more important to return cash to shareholders at high valuations than it is to hold onto a large war chest.\nThis tells us that management has little use for the excess cash that the AI gold rush is creating. Nvidia is a fabless chip designer that outsources its production to third-party providers. Unlike Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Nvidia does not need to spend billions on creating \u201cfab\u201d chip factories. It also sees little potential to acquire future growth, like what Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) did in its $49 billion acquisition of networking giant Xilinx.\nBut speculators seem to care little for such truths. To them, Nvidia is an investment in AI. And the only direction it can go is up.\u00a0\nAccording to data from Refinitiv, open interest for bullish call options has exploded in recent weeks. The number of $500 calls due January 2024 has risen more than 175%, even as Nvidia\u2019s stock has flatlined. These risky bets pay nothing unless the stock rises above $500 by early next year.\u00a0\nBitcoin saw similarly bullish bets during its 2021 run. Futures contracts for the cryptocurrency traded as high as $65,900 toward the bubble\u2019s peak as investors continued expecting more gains. That story ended as most bubbles do.\u00a0\nWhat Is Nvidia Stock Worth?\nRealistic estimates now peg Nvidia\u2019s justified value at around $350 per share. This assumes that its free cash flow peaks in 2026 at $52.5 billion before declining to $42.5 billion by 2046 as competitors eat away at the lower end of the market. These figures are still well above Intel\u2019s peak earnings power in the 2010s.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s also a great deal of potential downside. If companies like Microsoft and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) successfully develop in-house GPUs, Nvidia\u2019s free cash flow could recede to the $5 billion to $10 billion range, sending the stock\u2019s justified value into the $200 range. And if free cash flow collapses back to 2020-22 levels, NVDA stock could sink as low as $110.\nOf course, none of this matters in the short term. The chipmaker is riding a tidal wave of positive sentiment, which means its stock could rise to $600\u2026 $800\u2026 $1,000\u2026 or more. Nothing stopped Bitcoin from peaking at a $1.27 trillion valuation, or altcoins from rising even further. We know from history that speculative assets tend to keep going up in the short run.\u00a0\nBut when the AI hangover eventually comes, we can expect financial historians to ask the age-old question:\u00a0\n\u201cWhat were they thinking?\u201d\u00a0\nThat\u2019s why investors should view Nvidia\u2019s near-$500 price tag with deep suspicion. Companies like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Intel trade for roughly a tenth of its valuation from a price-to-earnings standpoint. And though Nvidia is winning the AI revolution so far, history also tells us that no castle in the sky has ever stayed aloft forever.\nAs of this writing, Tom Yeung\u00a0held a LONG position in GOOG, GOOGL.

Just take a look at Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), which has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of investors' increasing enthusiasm for AI. Shares of the chip-making giant have surged 191% year to date, allowing the company to cross $1 trillion in market cap.  But according to ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, there could be better ways to gain access to the booming sector. \"We're really focused on those companies that most people aren't talking about right now. Nvidia is easy, but it's also really expensive and very obvious,\" she said at a conference in Munich, Bloomberg reported. Don\u2019t Miss: Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes and you only need $100. Warren Buffett once said \u201cIf you don\u2019t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\u201d Here\u2019s how to collect $1,000 per month from Buffett\u2019s favorite dividend stock.  While some analysts may disagree with Wood's view on Nvidia \u2014 Wall Street has set significant price targets for the company \u2014 she has identified two less obvious plays on AI. Here's a closer look at the duo. UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH) UiPath is a robotic process automation software company that provides automation solutions for businesses. Its AI-powered UiPath Business Automation Platform is capable of understanding, automating and operating end-to-end processes. In the fiscal quarter ended July 31, the company's revenue grew 19% year over year to $287.3 million. Its dollar-based net retention rate was 121%. Wood said that while UiPath is \"not sexy,\" it is \"very profitable.\" The stock has surged 32% year to date, but it hasn't always been a hot commodity: In 2022, UiPath shares plunged 70%. Wood's flagship fund Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) owns 27,747,702 shares of UiPath. With the position valued at $437.86 million, UiPath is the fifth-largest holding at the fund. Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) Twilio's cloud communications platform allows businesses to develop and integrate various communication channels into their applications. Its application programming interfaces enable developers to incorporate voice, messaging and video seamlessly, helping companies enhance customer engagement. At the end of June, Twilio had more than 304,000 active customer accounts. Meanwhile, second-quarter revenue rose 10% year over year to $1.04 billion. In a conference call with analysts earlier this year, Twilio Co-Founder and CEO Jeff Lawson said he believes that artificial intelligence \"will be a material accelerant over time for Twilio's business.\"   Story Continues Twilio shares have climbed 13% year to date but are still down 21% over the last 12 months.Ark Innovation ETF holds 4,849,250 shares of Twilio, a stake with a market value of $282.61 million.Read next:Elon Musk Is Bullish On Austin.

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Creating 3D scans of physical products can be time consuming. Businesses often use traditional methods, like photogrammetry-based apps and scanners, but these can take hours or even days. They also don\u2019t always provide the 3D quality and level of detail needed to make models look realistic in all its applications.\nItaly-based startup Covision Media is tapping into AI and NVIDIA RTX to enhance 3D scanning processes and 3D-based content creation.\nCovision Media develops AI-based 3D scanners that allow customers to create digital twins of any product, including footwear, eyeglasses, sports equipment, toys, tools and household items. The company is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a free program that provides startups with access to the latest resources and technologies.\nUsing Covision\u2019s technology, customers can quickly create 3D scans and automatically preserve detailed textures, materials, colors, geometry, and more to make images look as realistic as possible.\nThe technology runs on NVIDIA RTX, which allows users to create high-quality, detailed, photorealistic 3D models. Covision Media is also using neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to increase the quality of 3D models while tackling typical challenges like accurately capturing lighting, reflections and transparent surfaces.\nadidas and its partner NUREG, a content creation studio, are among the first to use Covision Media\u2019s 3D scanning technology for automating and scaling e-commerce content production.\n\nUnlocking New Possibilities in 3D With RTX and AI\u00a0\nCovision\u2019s 3D scanners are connected to several workstations that run on NVIDIA RTX A5000 and RTX A6000 GPUs, both of which provide high ray-tracing performance and powerful AI capabilities.\nThe ray-tracing performance of the NVIDIA OptiX framework, coupled with the NVIDIA RT Cores, enables Covision to precisely measure the lighting of a scanned object. This is one of the biggest unique factors that allows customers to put their scanned products into any kind of virtual environment. Covision also harnesses NVIDIA\u2019s software infrastructure to develop state-of-the-art AI solutions for its neural texture approach.\n\u201cWithout NVIDIA RTX GPUs, it would simply not be possible to achieve the level of accuracy and performance that we need,\u201d said Dr. Burkhard G\u00fcssefeld, tech lead at Covision Media. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s hardware and software capabilities are indispensable in pushing the boundaries of our technology.\u201d\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Covision3D-Model-and-Relightability.mp4\nCovision\u2019s technology allows 3D models to be fully relightable, meaning users can adjust and manipulate the lighting in the scene. Users can also merge partial scans together to build a 360-degree scan of the product, which can be used in extended reality (XR) environments.\nThe core technology uses computer vision and machine learning. Covision\u2019s strong expertise in NeRFs has enabled them to integrate it into existing pipelines to overcome traditional challenges like transparencies and reflections. This allows Covision Media to quickly reconstruct 3D shapes and appearances with just a few images.\nThe company has very high requirements for quality, millimetric precision, material separation and relightability. So the team adapted and expanded the capabilities of NeRF technology using data from elements such as precise light poses, controlled environments and accurate geometric cues.\nNeRFs allow the team to create high-quality 3D images from the start of the process. This lets them increase throughput while reducing the amount of post-processing work required.\n\n\u201cOur 3D scanner automatically delivers the highest quality assets at mass production while at the same time helping customers to create value and save costs,\u201d said Franz Tschimben, CEO of Covision Media. \u201cFurthermore, our scanning device will help companies create high-quality 3D assets needed to populate applications and worlds on new spatial computing devices and mixed reality headsets, like Apple\u2019s Vision Pro and Meta\u2019s Quest.\u201d\nCovision is looking to integrate additional NVIDIA products and research projects into its solutions, such as Nvdiffrast for high-performance differentiable rendering and Tiny CUDA as a fast neural network framework. The team is also\u200c deploying a custom NeRF implementation into its system, which will make use of the APIs provided by NVIDIA\u2019s Instant-NGP.\nThe Brand With Three Stripes Brings 3D to Life\nadidas scans thousands of items a year using Covision\u2019s technology for its online websites and apps, where they\u2019re compatible on both desktop and mobile.\nThe 3D models have helped enhance adidas\u2019 Virtual Try-On feature, which allows customers to virtually try on shoes before buying them. adidas also uses the 3D models to automatically create 2D virtual product photos and videos, replacing the need for traditional product photography.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/covision-3d-blog-header.mp4\nAccording to adidas, Covision\u2019s scanning technology has helped the team take a quantum step forward in quality while maintaining its scaled scanning production. With the highly realistic scans, adidas has experienced time and cost efficiencies by switching from traditional content production, such as photo and film, to computer-generated content production.\nTo scale production of 3D assets, adidas relies on Covision\u2019s technology and works with an important set of partners. NUREG is an essential partner in creating and preparing the 3D assets to go live on adidas\u2019 platforms.

The combination provides more memory, bandwidth and the ability to automatically shift power between the CPU and GPU to optimize performance.\nSeparately, NVIDIA HGX H100 systems that pack eight H100 GPUs delivered the highest throughput on every MLPerf Inference test in this round.\nGrace Hopper Superchips and H100 GPUs led across all MLPerf\u2019s data center tests, including inference for computer vision, speech recognition and medical imaging, in addition to the more demanding use cases of recommendation systems and the large language models (LLMs) used in generative AI.\nOverall, the results continue NVIDIA\u2019s record of demonstrating performance leadership in AI training and inference in every round since the launch of the MLPerf benchmarks in 2018.\nThe latest MLPerf round included an updated test of recommendation systems, as well as the first inference benchmark on GPT-J, an LLM with six billion parameters, a rough measure of an AI model\u2019s size.\nTensorRT-LLM Supercharges Inference\nTo cut through complex workloads of every size, NVIDIA developed TensorRT-LLM, generative AI software that optimizes inference. The open-source library \u2014 which was not ready in time for August submission to MLPerf \u2014 enables customers to more than double the inference performance of their already purchased H100 GPUs at no added cost.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s internal tests show that using TensorRT-LLM on H100 GPUs provides up to an 8x performance speedup compared to prior generation GPUs running GPT-J 6B without the software.\nThe software got its start in NVIDIA\u2019s work accelerating and optimizing LLM inference with leading companies including Meta, AnyScale, Cohere, Deci, Grammarly, Mistral AI, MosaicML (now part of Databricks), OctoML, Tabnine and Together AI.\nMosaicML added features that it needs on top of TensorRT-LLM and integrated them into its existing serving stack. \u201cIt\u2019s been an absolute breeze,\u201d said Naveen Rao, vice president of engineering at Databricks.\n\u201cTensorRT-LLM is easy-to-use, feature-packed and efficient,\u201d Rao said. \u201cIt delivers state-of-the-art performance for LLM serving using NVIDIA GPUs and allows us to pass on the cost savings to our customers.\u201d\nTensorRT-LLM is the latest example of continuous innovation on NVIDIA\u2019s full-stack AI platform. These ongoing software advances give users performance that grows over time at no extra cost and is versatile across diverse AI workloads.\nL4 Boosts Inference on Mainstream Servers\u00a0\nIn the latest MLPerf benchmarks, NVIDIA L4 GPUs ran the full range of workloads and delivered great performance across the board.\nFor example, L4 GPUs running in compact, 72W PCIe accelerators delivered up to 6x more performance than CPUs rated for nearly 5x higher power consumption.\nIn addition, L4 GPUs feature dedicated media engines that, in combination with CUDA software, provide up to 120x speedups for computer vision in NVIDIA\u2019s tests.\nL4 GPUs are available from Google Cloud and many system builders, serving customers in industries from consumer internet services to drug discovery.\nPerformance Boosts at the Edge\nSeparately, NVIDIA applied a new model compression technology to demonstrate up to a 4.7x performance boost running the BERT LLM on an L4 GPU. The result was in MLPerf\u2019s so-called \u201copen division,\u201d a category for showcasing new capabilities.\nThe technique is expected to find use across all AI workloads. It can be especially valuable when running models on edge devices constrained by size and power consumption.\nIn another example of leadership in edge computing, the NVIDIA Jetson Orin system-on-module showed performance increases of up to 84% compared to the prior round in object detection, a computer vision use case common in edge AI and robotics scenarios.\n\nThe Jetson Orin advance came from software taking advantage of the latest version of the chip\u2019s cores, such as a programmable vision accelerator, an NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPU and a dedicated deep learning accelerator.\nVersatile Performance, Broad Ecosystem\nThe MLPerf benchmarks are transparent and objective, so users can rely on their results to make informed buying decisions. They also cover a wide range of use cases and scenarios, so users know they can get performance that\u2019s both dependable and flexible to deploy.\nPartners submitting in this round included cloud service providers Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and system manufacturers ASUS, Connect Tech, Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, QCT and Supermicro.\nOverall, MLPerf is backed by more than 70 organizations, including Alibaba, Arm, Cisco, Google, Harvard University, Intel, Meta, Microsoft and the University of Toronto.\nRead a technical blog for more details on how NVIDIA achieved the latest results.\nAll the software used in NVIDIA\u2019s benchmarks is available from the MLPerf repository, so everyone can get the same world-class results. The optimizations are continuously folded into containers available on the NVIDIA NGC software hub for GPU applications.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Cloud Services | Hardware | Inference | Machine Learning | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | NVIDIA Jetson | TensorRT \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And in apps, ray-traced previews and viewports are greatly improved, enabling creators to better visualize the final result before time-consuming renders.\nDLSS 3.5 is available for all GeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX users; for the complete breakdown on this new technology, head to our NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 announcement article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other DLSS news, Lies of P, Party Animals, Warhaven and Witchfire are all launching this week with day-one DLSS support, and gamers can check out an open beta for The First Descendant, an upcoming DLSS 3-accelerated game.\nIn each game, GeForce RTX users will receive the definitive experience - read on for all the details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 3.5 Launches Today \nNVIDIA is advancing rendering technology once more with the introduction of NVIDIA DLSS 3.5, featuring Ray Reconstruction, which is a new AI model that enhances ray-traced images for intensive ray-traced games and apps.\nRay Reconstruction replaces hand-tuned denoisers, which resolve sampled rays in a scene, with an NVIDIA supercomputer-trained AI network that generates higher-quality pixels in between sampled rays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHand-tuned denoisers accumulate pixels from multiple frames to increase detail, in effect stealing rays from the past, but at the risk of introducing ghosting, removing dynamic effects, and reducing the quality of others. They also interpolate neighboring pixels, and blend this information together, at the risk of blending away too much detailed information, or not blending enough, and creating non-uniform lighting effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpscaling is the last stage of the ray-traced lighting pipeline, and is key to experiencing the most detailed and demanding games at fast frame rates. But with denoising removing or decreasing the quality of effects, the limitations of hand-tuned denoisers are amplified, removing fine detail (referred to as high-frequency information) that upscalers use to output a crisp, clean image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrained with 5X more data than DLSS 3, DLSS 3.5 recognizes different ray-traced effects to make smarter decisions about using temporal and spatial data, and to retain high frequency information for superior-quality upscaling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing training derived from the analysis of offline-rendered images, which require far more computational power than can be delivered during a real-time game, Ray Reconstruction recognizes lighting patterns from training data, such as that of global illumination or ambient occlusion, and recreates it in-game as you play. The results are superior to using hand-tuned denoisers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Portal with RTX, with DLSS OFF, the denoiser struggles with spatial interpolation, where it\u2019s not blending enough pixels, creating a blotchy effect. Additionally, it\u2019s not accumulating enough good pixels from previous frames, and the result is a boiling effect in the light. With DLSS 3.5, it recognizes certain patterns associated with reflections and keeps the image stable, accumulating accurate pixels while blending neighboring pixels to generate high quality reflections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following scene from Cyberpunk 2077, the inaccurate headlight illumination which surrounds the car is a result of the hand-tuned denoiser pulling in inaccurate lighting effects from previous frames. DLSS 3.5 accurately generates lighting, so you can make out the beam of the headlights, and see light reflect on the curb in front of the car.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe streets of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Night City are filled with reflections from rotating billboards and neon lights. By activating DLSS 3.5, their quality and clarity is vastly improved city wide:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith DLSS 3.5, we\u2019re delivering a faster, better experience as a free upgrade, building upon the much-loved enhancements already available in your favorite games and most used apps.\u00a0\nCyberpunk 2077 Upgrades To DLSS 3.5\nCyberpunk 2077\u2019s 2.0 update is available now with tons of enhancements, including DLSS 3.5. In Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, DLSS 3.5\u2019s new Ray Reconstruction technique improves the quality and clarity of reflections, global illumination is even more accurate, and lighting is more dynamically responsive, for an even better, more immersive, more realistic experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 40 Series users can benefit from all the performance and image quality enhancements that DLSS 3.5 has to offer - including performance-multiplying Frame Generation for the fastest frame rates - in the demanding Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode.\nAnd on September 26th, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty launches with full ray tracing, DLSS 3.5, and Ray Reconstruction. Phantom Liberty is a new spy-thriller adventure for Cyberpunk 2077. When the orbital shuttle of the President of the New United States of America is shot down over the deadliest district of Night City, there\u2019s only one person who can save her \u2014 you. Become V, a cyberpunk for hire, and dive deep into a tangled web of espionage and political intrigue, unraveling a story that connects the highest echelons of power with the brutal world of black-market mercenaries.\nWitness the power of full ray tracing and DLSS 3.5 for yourself in our new, exclusive Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty RTX Technology video:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Thanks to DLSS 3.5\u2019s smart technology, fuelled by AI rendering power, you can experience Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty\u2019s newest location Dogtown at its very best \u2014 with sharper images, more accurate lighting, and the highest frame rates possible.\" - Jakub Knapik, VP of Art, Global Art Director, CD PROJEKT RED\nThanks to DLSS 3.5 and the leading full ray tracing performance of GeForce RTX, the definitive way to experience Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is on a GeForce RTX graphics card, PC or laptop.\u00a0\nFor even more info about the launch of DLSS 3.5 and Ray Reconstruction in Cyberpunk 2077 and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, head on over to our Cyberpunk 2077 DLSS 3.5 launch article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 3.5 For Creators: Chaos Vantage Upgrades Today, NVIDIA Omniverse This October\nCreative platforms and applications have a wide variety of content that is difficult for traditional denoisers as they require hand-tuning per scene. As a result, when previewing content you get suboptimal image quality. With DLSS 3.5, the AI neural network is able to recognize a wide variety of scenes, producing high quality images during preview, before committing a long time for a final render.\nThe benefit of Ray Reconstruction is particularly noticeable while navigating the viewport, as rendering during camera movement is notoriously difficult. But Ray Reconstruction enables sharper images with significantly reduced noise while panning around a scene, improving the real-time editing experience and allowing creators to share their work with clients and collaborators.\nChaos Vantage is a popular 3D visualization tool enabling creators to explore large scenes in a fully ray-traced environment. Vantage, which is already accelerated on RTX GPUs with NVIDIA\u2019s OptiX denoiser and NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution,\u00a0adds support for Ray Reconstruction to provide further enhancements to image quality, providing a massive boost for creators navigating complex scenes.\nSee the incredible difference DLSS 3.5 makes for 3D designers in Chaos Vantage:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, NVIDIA Omniverse USD Composer, a fully customizable app for OpenUSD world-building that allows users to assemble, light, simulate, and render large scale scenes, will be upgrading to DLSS 3.5 in October.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe First Descendant Open Beta Is Ongoing, Featuring DLSS 3\nNexon Games\u2019 The First Descendant is a free, third-person cooperative action-RPG shooter powered by Unreal Engine 5.

Building, managing and optimizing this new infrastructure while maintaining quality-of-service delivery and maximizing the customer experience is the industry\u2019s next big challenge.\nToday, NTT DOCOMO announced it is deploying a GPU-accelerated wireless solution in its network in Japan. This makes it the first-ever telco in the world to deploy a GPU-accelerated commercial 5G network.\nDOCOMO\u2019s move aims to address the multibillion-dollar problem of driving improvements in performance, total cost of ownership and energy efficiency while unlocking the flexibility, scalability and supply chain diversity promise of Open RAN.\nThe 5G Open RAN solution uses a high-performance 5G virtual radio access network (vRAN) from Fujitsu built on the NVIDIA Aerial vRAN stack and NVIDIA Converged Accelerators. This combination enables telcos to create a fully software- and cloud-defined network that can dynamically allocate resources using industry-standard equipment.\n\u201cOpen RAN offers the opportunity to build next-generation 5G networks with unprecedented flexibility and scalability thanks to multivendor connections,\u201d said Sadayuki Abeta, global head of Open RAN solutions at NTT DOCOMO. \u201cWe look forward to continuing working with NVIDIA on infrastructure solutions that meet those needs.\u201d\nThe 5G Open RAN solution is the first 5G vRAN for telco commercial deployment using the NVIDIA Aerial platform, with a hardened, carrier-grade vRAN stack. The platform brings together the NVIDIA Aerial vRAN stack for 5G, AI frameworks, accelerated compute infrastructure and long-term software support and maintenance.\nCost and Energy-Efficiency Benefits of GPU Acceleration\nWorking with offerings from Fujitsu and Wind River, the new 5G solution uses the NVIDIA Aerial platform to lower costs and reduce power consumption. Compared to its existing 5G network deployments, DOCOMO says the solution reduces total costs by up to 30%, the time required for network design by up to 50%, and power consumption at base stations by up to 50%.\n\u201cDelivering a 5G Open RAN network that meets stringent performance requirements of operators is a significant accomplishment,\u201d said Masaki Taniguchi, senior vice president and head of the Mobile System Business Unit at Fujitsu Limited. \u201cUsing our Fujitsu vCU/vDU, in combination with NVIDIA Aerial platform, will help network operators to efficiently build high-performance 5G networks for consumers and businesses alike.\u201d\nNVIDIA\u2019s contribution to the DOCOMO rollout is part of a growing portfolio of 5G solutions that are driving transformation in the telecommunications industry. Anchored on NVIDIA Aerial vRAN stack and NVIDIA Converged Accelerators \u2014 combined with NVIDIA BlueField data processing units (DPUs) and a suite of AI frameworks \u2014 NVIDIA provides a high-performance, software-defined, cloud-native, AI-enabled 5G for on-premises and telco operators\u2019 RAN.\nFujitsu, NVIDIA and Wind River have been working under the OREX (5G Open RAN service brand), which was launched by DOCOMO in February 2021, to develop the Open RAN 5G vRAN. OREX has been deployed in Japan based on Fujitsu\u2019s virtualized DU (vDU) and virtualized CU (vCU) and leverages commercial off-the-shelf servers, the Wind River cloud platform, Fujitsu\u2019s 5G vRAN software and the NVIDIA Aerial vRAN stack and NVIDIA Converged Accelerators.\n\u201cWind River is delighted to work with NTT DOCOMO, Fujitsu and NVIDIA towards a vision of improved efficiency of RAN deployments and operations,\u201d said Paul Miller, chief technology officer at Wind River. \u201cWind River Studio provides a cloud-native, distributed cloud, automation, and analytics solution based on open source, so that operators can deploy and manage their 5G edge networks globally at high scale with faster innovation. This solution is proven in highly scaled production deployments today.\u201d\nOREX: Building Out From Japan and Beyond\nDOCOMO and its partners in OREX are promoting a multivendor, Open RAN-compliant 5G vRAN to the global operator community. The commercial deployment in Japan is a first step in the vision of OREX, where members can commercially validate their solutions and then promote them to other operators globally.\nNVIDIA is working with DOCOMO and other partners to support operators around the world to deploy high-performance, energy-efficient, software-defined, commercial 5G vRAN.\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | SoftwareTags: 5G | GPU | NVIDIA BlueField | Telecommunications \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Phantom Liberty is a new spy-thriller adventure for Cyberpunk 2077. When the orbital shuttle of the President of the New United States of America is shot down over the deadliest district of Night City, there\u2019s only one person who can save her \u2014 you. Become V, a cyberpunk for hire, and dive deep into a tangled web of espionage and political intrigue, unraveling a story that connects the highest echelons of power with the brutal world of black-market mercenaries.\nWitness the power of full ray tracing and DLSS 3.5 in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty for yourself in our Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty RTX Technology Video:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Thanks to DLSS 3.5\u2019s smart technology, fuelled by AI rendering power, you can experience Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty\u2019s newest location Dogtown at its very best \u2014 with sharper images, more accurate lighting, and the highest frame rates possible.\" - Jakub Knapik, VP of Art, Global Art Director, CD PROJEKT RED\nIf you don\u2019t own the expansion, return to the neon lights of Night City in Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s 2.0 update, available now, featuring support for NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 and its new Ray Reconstruction technology, enhancing the quality of full ray tracing in Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode.\nPress agree that Cyberpunk 2077 with DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction is an incredible leap forward for image quality and immersion:\n\n\u201cNVIDIA DLSS 3.5 In Cyberpunk 2077 Is Breathtaking: The Most Advanced Graphics Ever In A PC Game\u201d - WCCFTech\n\u201cTurning on Ray Reconstruction is like a revelation.\u201d - DigitalTrends\n\u201cIt's really, really good-looking.\u201d - PCGamer\n\u201cNVIDIA's lead in ray-tracing performance and image quality takes a massive leap forward thanks to DLSS 3.5\u201d - TweakTown\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t take long to notice the improvement in not just the gameplay, but visuals, and performance as well thanks to DLSS 3.5.\u201d - TechCritter\n\u201cDLSS 3.5\u2019s Ray Reconstruction is the real deal\u201d \u00a0-\u00a0DSOGaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrank Ray Tracing Up To Overdrive\u00a0\nBoth Cyberpunk 2077 and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty feature full ray tracing in the technology preview for the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode. Full ray tracing, also known as path tracing, accurately simulates light throughout an entire scene. It is used by visual effects artists to create film and TV graphics that are indistinguishable from reality, but until the arrival of GeForce RTX GPUs with RT Cores, and the AI-powered acceleration of NVIDIA DLSS, real-time video game full ray tracing was impossible because it is extremely GPU intensive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor even more info on the making of Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, check out our interview with CD PROJEKT RED\nPrevious techniques separately addressed ray-traced shadows, reflections and global illumination for a small number of light sources. Full ray tracing models the properties of light from a virtually unlimited number of emissive sources, delivering physically correct shadows, reflections and global illumination on all objects.\nOne of the most impactful additions in the technology preview of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode is NVIDIA RTX Direct Illumination (RTXDI), a free SDK that enables developers to closely replicate the appearance of light in scenes with numerous light sources. With RTXDI, thousands of objects can emit ray-traced light.\nIn Cyberpunk 2077, each neon sign, street lamp, LED billboard, car headlight, and other source of light is now ray-traced, bathing objects, walls, passing cars and pedestrians in accurate lighting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull ray tracing helps with grounding objects within their surroundings. Click here to view the comparison in 4K\nWith full ray tracing and RTXDI, now practically all light sources cast physically correct soft shadows, a feat previously unimaginable using previous approaches. Players will experience enhanced shadowing, with better depth, detail and realism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matter how geometrically complex a scene gets, pipes, rails, staircases, and other objects will now get proper shadows from all the shadow casting lights in their vicinity. Click here to view the comparison in 4K\nCyberpunk 2077 features a full day-night cycle. To upgrade indirect lighting from all emissive sources, including the sun and moon, Global Illumination (GI) needed to be path traced, too. Rendering techniques including Screen Space Reflections, Screen Space Ambient Occlusion, and the existing GI solutions were replaced by a single unified algorithm that delivers more accurate lighting of scenes and objects.\nWith the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode enabled, natural colored lighting bounces multiple times throughout Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s world, creating more realistic indirect lighting and occlusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sunlight bounces off the floor to indirectly light a cardboard stack for more realistic lighting and occlusion. Click here to view the comparison in 4K\nReflections now incorporate bounced detail, too, and are rendered at full resolution, accentuating the cyberpunk aesthetic and further heightening immersion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull ray tracing helps to balance the diffuse and specular response of materials to the light, resulting in even more realistic reflections. Click here to view the comparison in 4K\nCombined, the full ray tracing of direct and global illumination give gamers the most advanced real-time lighting seen to date in gaming, and a preview of how all games will look in the future.\nFull ray tracing in Cyberpunk 2077 and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is extremely GPU intensive. For the ultimate experience we recommend GeForce RTX 40 Series and NVIDIA DLSS 3.5. Read on for more details.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077 Upgrades To DLSS 3.5\nDLSS 3.5 is available in both Cyberpunk 2077 with the game\u2019s 2.0 update, and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. In the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, DLSS 3.5\u2019s new Ray Reconstruction technology enhances the quality and clarity of reflections, global illumination is even more accurate, and lighting is more dynamically responsive, for an even better, more immersive, more realistic experience.\nWhen activated, Ray Reconstruction replaces several hand-tuned ray tracing denoisers with a new unified AI model that enhances full ray tracing, elevating image quality to new heights. In the following scene, the inaccurate headlight illumination which surrounds the car is a result of the hand-tuned denoiser pulling in inaccurate lighting effects from previous frames. DLSS 3.5 accurately generates lighting, so you can make out the beam of the headlights, and see light reflect on the curb in front of the car.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe streets of Night City are filled with reflections from rotating billboards and neon lights. By activating DLSS 3.5, their quality and clarity is enhanced city-wide:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 40 Series users can combine Super Resolution and Frame Generation with Ray Reconstruction for breathtaking performance and image quality, while GeForce RTX 20 and 30 Series users can add Ray Reconstruction to their AI-powered arsenal alongside Super Resolution. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital Foundry DLSS 3.5 Tech Interview\nIn a lengthy roundtable discussion, Digital Foundry\u2019s resident PC expert, Alex Battaglia, spoke to Bryan Catanzaro, Vice President Applied Deep Learning Research at NVIDIA, Jakub Knapik, VP Art and Global Art Director at CD Projekt RED, and NVIDIA GeForce evangelist Jacob Freeman about DLSS 3.5, the evolution of the original DLSS, the success of DLSS in the modding community, and the future of machine learning in PC graphics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose and even more topics are covered in the 1 hour discussion, so if you want even more insight into the magic of DLSS, you should definitely check it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMax Performance With NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 \nIn Cyberpunk 2077 and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, replacing multiple hand-tuned denoisers with Ray Reconstruction also happens to increase performance that bit more.

In the U.S., Pixellot powers the broadcasting of over a million games every year through its partnership with the NFHS Network, a leader in streaming live and on-demand high school sports.\nThrough its broadcasting partners like the NFHS Network, MLB and others, Pixellot provides professional analytics, post-match breakdowns and highlights based on jersey numbers with shot charts and heat maps \u2014 which can be especially useful for coaches and players of school and pro sports alike as they study their moves to up their game. It also enables interactive experiences for users, who can manipulate viewframes and cut their own highlights for a game.\nRecently, SuperSport Schools, a company based in Cape Town, South Africa, deployed the Pixellot platform to power an app that broadcasts student athletics across the nation, where more than 1,500 high schools are active in sports.\n\u201cOur goal is to democratize the coverage of sports with the help of AI and automation,\u201d said Yossi Tarablus, who leads marketing at Pixellot, a member of the NVIDIA Inception program for cutting-edge startups. \u201cUsing the NVIDIA Jetson platform for edge AI, Pixellot brings powerful technology for sports broadcasting and analytics to some of the world\u2019s most remote areas.\u201d\n\nHow Pixellot Works\nDuring peak sports seasons, about 200,000 games a month are broadcasted across the globe using the Pixellot platform, according to Tarablus.\nLightweight Pixellot cameras powered by NVIDIA Jetson capture high-quality video of games, matches and even practices \u2014 and livestream them in high definition to users through an app in real time with an overlaid scoreboard, live stats, commentary and more.\n\nThe platform creates an automatic viewframe that simulates a camera operator, optimizes videos and corrects scene lighting using NVIDIA RTX ray-tracing technology.\nIn addition, the platform helps organizations and companies monetize sports while making them more accessible to viewers, as it enables over-the-top, or OTT, streaming \u2014 direct streaming over the internet without the need for a traditional cable or satellite TV provider.\nIn all of its camera setups, the Metropolis member runs the NVIDIA DeepStream software development kit for AI-powered video streaming analytics. And the company relies on the NVIDIA TensorRT SDK for high-performance deep learning inference.\n\u201cNVIDIA Jetson made it possible for Pixellot to create the most accurate and affordable AI-powered camera solution for broadcasting live sporting events,\u201d said Gal Oz, chief technology officer and cofounder of Pixellot. \u201cThe versatility of Jetson modules in terms of camera pipeline, encoders and AI capabilities enabled Pixellot to develop multiple products based on the same hardware and software platform.\u201d\nBroadcasting South African School Sports\nHigh-quality, real-time broadcasts of athletics are difficult to produce without access to a slew of graphics and data.\nAs the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX module enables AI-powered video processing and GPU-accelerated computing right at the edge \u2014 on the field or at courtside \u2014 Pixellot lets organizations broadcast sports from anywhere.\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how many people have told us stories about a moment they were empowered to share with their children thanks to SuperSport Schools and Pixellot, because they couldn\u2019t be there physically but were present through live or on-demand video,\u201d said Kelvin Watt, managing director of Capitalize Media and SuperSport Schools, on the Pixellot deployment in South Africa.\nThe SuperSport Schools app, which is free and recently reached 600,000 subscribers, was the first to broadcast a junior nationals track race in the country.\nAt the event last year, a student named Viwe Jingqi broke 50-plus-year national records for both the 100- and 200-meter races for South African girls under 18 years old. People all over the world could easily witness these historic victories through the SuperSport Schools app, powered by Pixellot.\n\nBuilding a Smart Sports City in China\nIn China, tech giant Baidu and the Chengdu Sports Authority are using Pixellot technology in an initiative to develop a smart sports city, with an initial focus on broadcasting community soccer.\nChengdu, the capital of southwestern China\u2019s Sichuan province, is a sports-oriented city and was the host of this year\u2019s World University Games, an event sanctioned by the International University Sports Federation.\n\u201cPixellot\u2019s AI-driven sports production solutions are a perfect fit for our strategic vision of delivering innovative technology solutions to communities,\u201d said Liu Chuan, solution director of the intelligent cloud sports industry at Baidu.\n\u201cBroadcasting community soccer with vision AI is part of the Chengdu initiative\u2019s efforts to emphasize the health benefits of engaging in sports recreationally,\u201d said Tarablus. \u201cIt moves the spotlight from pro or Olympic sports to the importance of athletics for all.\u201d\nLearn more about the NVIDIA Metropolis application framework, developer tools and partner ecosystem.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | Inception | Jetson | Machine Learning | Metropolis | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It will be based on NVIDIA technology like the NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip and NVIDIA DGX Cloud.\nGH200 marks a fundamental shift in computing architecture that provides exceptional performance and massive memory bandwidth, while DGX Cloud, an AI supercomputing service in the cloud, makes it easier for enterprises to train their employees in AI technology, access the technology internally and provide generative AI services to customers.\nIn his exchange with more than a dozen of India\u2019s top tech journalists following the announcement, Huang said computer science expertise is a core competency for India, and that with access to technology and capital India is poised to build AI to be able to solve challenges at home and abroad.\n\u201cYou have the data, you have the talent,\u201d Huang said. \u201cWe are open for business and bring great expertise on building supercomputers.\nDuring the freewheeling back and forth with the media, Huang emphasized India\u2019s strength in information technology and the potential for AI to accelerate the development of the nation\u2019s IT industry.\n\u201cIT is one of your natural resources. You produce it at an incredible scale. You\u2019re incredibly good at it. You export it all over the world,\u201d Huang said.\nIndia\u2019s \u2018AI Moment\u2019\nEarlier, after meeting with many of the region\u2019s top technology leaders \u2014 including startup pioneers, AI proponents, and key players in India\u2019s digital public infrastructure \u2014 Huang hailed \u201cIndia\u2019s moment,\u201d saying the nation is on the cusp of becoming a global AI powerhouse.\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang with Nandan Nilekani, founder of Infosys and founding chairman of UIDAI during a meeting with key Indian tech leaders.\nWhile India has well-known technical capabilities \u2014 distinguished technical universities, 2,500 engineering colleges and an estimated 1.5 million engineers \u2014 many of its 1.4 billion people, located across sprawling metropolitan areas and some 650,000 villages, collectively speaking dozens of languages, have yet to fully benefit from this progress.\nApplied in the Indian context, AI can help rural farmers interact via cell phones in their local language to get weather information and crop prices. It can help provide, at a massive scale, expert diagnosis of medical symptoms and imaging scans where doctors may not be immediately available. It can better predict cyclonic storms using decades of atmospheric data, enabling those at risk to more quickly evacuate and find shelter.\nReliance Industries and Tata Communications will build and operate state-of-the-art AI supercomputing data centers based on such technology, utilizing it for internal AI development and infrastructure-as-a-service for India\u2019s AI researchers, companies and burgeoning AI startup ecosystem.\nThat effort, Huang said, during his conversation with the Indian technology press, promises to be part of a process that will turn India into a beacon for AI technology.\n\u201cAI could be built in India, used in India, and exported from India,\u201d Huang said.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Data Center | Deep Learning | SupercomputingTags: DGX Cloud \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This \u201cDigital First\u201d approach enhances efficiency, avoids defects and saves time, marking a step-change in the flexibility, resilience and intelligence of the Mercedes-Benz MO360 production system.\nThe digital twin in production helps ensure Mercedes-Benz assembly lines can be retooled, configured and optimized in physically accurate simulations first. The new assembly lines in the Kecskem\u00e9t plant will enable production of vehicles based on the newly launched Mercedes Modular Architecture that are developed virtually using digital twins in Omniverse.\nBy leveraging Omniverse, Mercedes-Benz can interact directly with its suppliers, reducing coordination processes by 50%. Using a digital twin in production doubles the speed for converting or constructing an assembly hall, while improving the quality of the processes, according to the automaker.\n\u201cUsing NVIDIA Omniverse and AI, Mercedes-Benz is building a connected, digital-first approach to optimize its manufacturing processes, ultimately reducing construction time and production costs,\u201d said Rev Lebaredian, vice president of Omniverse and simulation technology at NVIDIA, during a digital event held earlier today.\nIn addition, the introduction of AI opens up new areas of energy and cost savings. The Rastatt plant is being used to pioneer digital production in the paint shop. Mercedes-Benz used AI to monitor relevant sub-processes in the pilot testing, which led to energy savings of 20%.\nSupporting State-of-the-Art Software Systems\nNext-generation Mercedes-Benz vehicles will feature its new operating system \u201cMB.OS,\u201d which will be standard across its entire vehicle portfolio and deliver premium software capabilities and experiences across all vehicle domains.\nMercedes-Benz has partnered with NVIDIA to develop software-defined vehicles. NVIDIA will provide its DRIVE Orin system-on-a-chip and DRIVE software, with intelligent driving capabilities tested and validated in the NVIDIA DRIVE Sim platform, which is also built on Omniverse.\nThe automaker\u2019s MO360 production system will enable it to produce electric, hybrid and gas models on the same production lines and to scale the manufacturing of electric vehicles. The implementation of MB.OS in production will allow its cars to roll off assembly lines with the latest versions of vehicle software.\n\u201cMercedes-Benz is initiating a new era of automotive manufacturing thanks to the integration of artificial intelligence, MB.OS and the digital twin based on NVIDIA Omniverse into the MO360 ecosystem,\u201d said J\u00f6rg Burzer, member of the board of the Mercedes-Benz Group AG, Production, Quality and Supply Chain Management. \u201cWith our new \u2018Digital First\u2019 approach, we unlock efficiency potential even before the launch of our MMA models in our global production network and can accelerate the ramp-up significantly.\u201d\nFlexible Factories of the Future\nAvoiding costly manufacturing production shutdowns is critical. Running simulations in NVIDIA Omniverse enables factory planners to optimize factory floor and production line layouts for supply routes, and production lines can be validated without having to disrupt production.\nThis virtual approach also enables efficient design of new lines and change management for existing lines while reducing downtime and helping improve product quality. For the world\u2019s automakers, much is at stake across the entire software development stack, from chip to cloud.\nOmniverse Collaboration for Efficiencies\u00a0\nThe Kecskem\u00e9t plant is the first with a full digital twin of the entire factory. This virtual area enables development at the heart of assembly, between its tech and trim lines. And plans are for the new Kecskem\u00e9t factory hall to launch into full production.\nCollaboration in Omniverse has enabled plant suppliers and planners to interact with each other interactively in the virtual environment, so that layout options and automation changes can be incorporated and validated in real time. This accelerates how quickly new production lines can reach maximum capacity and reduces the risk of re-work or stoppages.\nVirtual collaboration with digital twins can accelerate planning and implementation of projects by weeks, as well as translate to significant cost savings for launching new manufacturing lines.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Omniverse and DRIVE Orin.\n\n\nCategories: Driving | Pro GraphicsTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | NVIDIA DRIVE Sim | Omniverse Enterprise \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It\u2019s personal, enhancing every keystroke, every frame and every moment.\nGamers are already enjoying the benefits of AI in over 300 RTX games. Meanwhile, content creators have access to over 100 RTX creative and design apps, with AI enhancing everything from video and photo editing to asset generation.\nAnd for GeForce enthusiasts, it\u2019s just the beginning. RTX is the platform for today and the accelerator that will power the AI of tomorrow.\nHow Did AI and Gaming Converge?\nNVIDIA pioneered the integration of AI and gaming with DLSS, a technique that uses AI to generate pixels in video games automatically and which has increased frame rates by up to 4x.\nAnd with the recent introduction of DLSS 3.5, NVIDIA has enhanced the visual quality in some of the world\u2019s top titles, setting a new standard for visually richer and more immersive gameplay.\nBut NVIDIA\u2019s AI integration doesn\u2019t stop there. Tools like RTX Remix empower game modders to remaster classic content using high-quality textures and materials generated by AI.\nWith NVIDIA ACE for Games, AI-powered avatars come to life on the PC, marking a new era of immersive gaming.\nHow Are RTX and AI Powering Creators?\nCreators use AI to imagine new concepts, automate tedious tasks and create stunning works of art. They rely on RTX because it accelerates top creator applications, including the world\u2019s most popular photo editing, video editing, broadcast and 3D apps.\nWith over 100 RTX apps now AI-enabled, creators can get more done and deliver incredible results.\nThe performance metrics are staggering.\nRTX GPUs boost AI image generation speeds in tools like Stable Diffusion by 4.5x compared to competing processors. Meanwhile, in 3D rendering, Blender experiences a speed increase of 5.4x.\nVideo editing in DaVinci Resolve powered by AI doubles its speed, and Adobe Photoshop\u2019s photo editing tasks become 3x as swift.\nNVIDIA RTX AI tech demonstrates a staggering 10x faster speeds in distinct workflows when juxtaposed against its competitors.\nNVIDIA provides various AI tools, apps and software development kits designed specifically for creators. This includes exclusive offerings like NVIDIA Omniverse, OptiX Denoiser, NVIDIA Canvas, NVIDIA Broadcast and NVIDIA DLSS.\nHow Is AI Changing Our Digital Experience Beyond Chatbots?\nBeyond gaming and content creation, RTX GPUs bring AI to all types of users.\nAdd Microsoft to the equation and 100 million RTX-powered Windows 11 PCs and workstations are already AI-ready.\n\nThe complementary technologies behind the Windows platform and NVIDIA\u2019s dynamic AI hardware and software stack are the driving forces that power hundreds of Windows apps and games.\n\nGamers: RTX-accelerated AI has been adopted in more than 300 games, increasing frame rates and enhancing visual fidelity.\nCreators: More than 100 AI-enabled creative applications benefit from RTX acceleration \u2014 including the top apps for image generation, video editing, photo editing and 3D. AI helps artists work faster, automate tedious tasks and\u00a0 expand the boundaries of creative expression.\nVideo Streamers: RTX Video Super Resolution uses AI to increase the resolution and improve the quality of streamed video, elevating the home video experience.\nOffice Workers and Students: Teleconferencing and remote learning get an RTX boost with NVIDIA Broadcast. AI improves video and audio quality and adds unique effects to make virtual interactions smoother and collaboration more efficient.\nDevelopers: Thanks to NVIDIA\u2019s world-leading AI development platform and technology developed by Microsoft and NVIDIA called CUDA on Windows Subsystem for Linux, developers can now do early AI development and training from the comfort of Windows, and easily migrate to servers for large training runs.\n\nWhat Are the Emerging AI Applications for RTX PCs?\nGenerative AI enables users to quickly generate new content based on a variety of inputs \u2014 text, images, sounds, animation, 3D models or other types of data \u2014 bringing easy-to-use AI to more PCs.\nLarge language models (LLMs) are at the heart of many of these use cases.\n\nPerhaps the best known is ChatGPT, a chatbot that runs in the cloud and one of the fastest growing applications in history.\nMany of these LLMs now run directly on PC, enabling new end-user applications like automatically drafting documents and emails, summarizing web content, extracting insights from spreadsheet data, planning travel, and powering general-purpose AI assistants.\nLLMs are some of the most demanding PC workloads, requiring a powerful AI accelerator \u2014 like an RTX GPU.\nWhat Powers the AI Revolution on Our Desktops (and Beyond)?\nWhat\u2019s fueling the PC AI revolution?\nThree pillars: lightning-fast graphics processing from GPUs, AI capabilities integral to GeForce and the omnipresent cloud.\nGamers already know all about the parallel processing power of GPUs. But what role did the GPU play in enabling AI in the cloud?\nNVIDIA GPUs have transformed cloud services. These advanced systems power everything from voice recognition to autonomous factory operations.\nIn 2016, NVIDIA hand-delivered to OpenAI the first NVIDIA DGX AI supercomputer \u2014 the engine behind the LLM breakthrough powering ChatGPT.\nNVIDIA DGX supercomputers, packed with GPUs and used initially as an AI research instrument, are now running 24/7 at businesses worldwide to refine data and process AI.

The open-source software, which builds on the NVIDIA cuQuantum software development kit, lets simulations run on high-performance clusters of NVIDIA GPUs.\nThe performance is key because researchers like Yoo need to process ocean-size datasets. He\u2019ll run his programs across as many as 256 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs on Perlmutter to simulate about three dozen qubits \u2014 the powerful calculators quantum computers use.\nThat\u2019s about twice the number of qubits most researchers can model these days.\nPowerful, Yet Easy to Use\nThe so-called multi-node version of PennyLane, used in tandem with the NVIDIA cuQuantum SDK, simplifies the complex job of accelerating massive simulations of quantum systems.\n\u201cThis opens the door to letting even my interns run some of the largest simulations \u2014 that\u2019s why I\u2019m so excited,\u201d said Yoo, whose team has six projects using PennyLane in the pipeline.\nBrookhaven\u2019s Shinjae Yoo prepares to scale up his quantum work on the Perlmutter supercomputer.\nHis work aims to advance high-energy physics and machine learning. Other researchers use quantum simulations to take chemistry and materials science to new levels.\nQuantum computing is alive in corporate R&D centers, too.\nFor example, Xanadu is helping companies like Rolls-Royce develop quantum algorithms to design state-of-the-art jet engines for sustainable aviation and Volkswagen Group invent more powerful batteries for electric cars.\nFour More Projects on Perlmutter\nMeanwhile, at NERSC, at least four other projects are in the works this year using multi-node Pennylane, according to Katherine Klymko, who leads the quantum computing program there. They include efforts from NASA Ames and the University of Alabama.\n\u201cResearchers in my field of chemistry want to study molecular complexes too large for classical computers to handle,\u201d she said. \u201cTools like Pennylane let them extend what they can currently do classically to prepare for eventually running algorithms on large-scale quantum computers.\u201d\nBlending AI, Quantum Concepts\nPennyLane is the product of a novel idea. It adapts popular deep learning techniques like backpropagation and tools like PyTorch to programming quantum computers.\nXanadu designed the code to run across as many types of quantum computers as possible, so the software got traction in the quantum community soon after its introduction in a 2018 paper.\n\u201cThere was engagement with our content, making cutting-edge research accessible, and people got excited,\u201d recalled Josh Izaac, director of product at Xanadu and a quantum physicist who was an author of the paper and a developer of PennyLane.\nCalls for More Qubits\nA common comment on the PennyLane forum these days is, \u201cI want more qubits,\u201d said Lee J. O\u2019Riordan, a senior quantum software developer at Xanadu, responsible for PennyLane\u2019s performance.\n\u201cWhen we started work in 2022 with cuQuantum on a single GPU, we got 10x speedups pretty much across the board \u2026 we hope to scale by the end of the year to 1,000 nodes \u2014 that\u2019s 4,000 GPUs \u2014 and that could mean simulating more than 40 qubits,\u201d O\u2019Riordan said.\nScientists are still formulating the questions they\u2019ll address with that performance \u2014 the kind of problem they like to have.\nCompanies designing quantum computers will use the boost to test ideas for building better systems. Their work feeds a virtuous circle, enabling new software features in PennyLane that, in turn, enable more system performance.\nScaling Well With GPUs\nO\u2019Riordan saw early on that GPUs were the best vehicle for scaling PennyLane\u2019s performance. He co-authored last year a paper on a method for splitting a quantum program across more than 100 GPUs to simulate more than 60 qubits, split into many 30 qubit sub-circuits.\nLee J. O\u2019Riordan\n\u201cWe wanted to extend our work to even larger workloads, so when we heard NVIDIA was adding multi-node capability to cuQuantum, we wanted to support it as soon as possible,\u201d he said.\nWithin four months, multi-node PennyLane was born.\n\u201cFor a big, distributed GPU project, that was a great turnaround time. Everyone working on cuQuantum helped make the integration as easy as possible,\u201d O\u2019Riordan said.\nA Xanadu blog details how developers can simulate large-scale systems with more than 30 qubits using PennyLane and cuQuantum.\nThe team is still collecting data, but so far on \u201csample-based workloads, we see almost linear scaling,\u201d he said.\nOr, as NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang might say, \u201cThe more you buy, the more you save.\u201d\n\n\nCategories: Research | SupercomputingTags: Customer Stories | GPU Computing | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture | Open Source | Parallel Computing | Quantum Computing | Science | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Separately, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang will join other industry leaders in a closed-door meeting on AI Wednesday with the full Senate.\nSeven companies including Adobe, IBM, Palantir and Salesforce joined NVIDIA in supporting the eight agreements the Biden-Harris administration released in July with support from Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI.\nThe commitments are designed to advance common standards and best practices to ensure the safety of generative AI systems until regulations are in place, the White House said. They include:\n\nTesting the safety and capabilities of AI products before they\u2019re deployed,\nSafeguarding AI models against cyber and insider threats, and\nUsing AI to help meet society\u2019s greatest challenges, from cancer to climate change.\n\nDally Shares NVIDIA\u2019s Experience\nIn his testimony, Dally told the Senate subcommittee that government and industry should balance encouraging innovation in AI with ensuring models are deployed responsibly.\nThe subcommittee\u2019s hearing, \u201cOversight of AI: Rules for Artificial Intelligence,\u201d is among actions from policymakers around the world trying to identify and address potential risks of generative AI.\nEarlier this year, the subcommittee heard testimonies from leaders of Anthropic, IBM and OpenAI, as well as academics such as Yoshua Bengio, a University of Montreal professor considered one of the godfathers of AI.\nDally, who leads a global team of more than 300 at NVIDIA Research, shared the witness table on Tuesday with Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and vice chair. Dally\u2019s testimony briefly encapsulated NVIDIA\u2019s unique role in the evolution of AI over the last two decades.\nHow Accelerated Computing Sparked AI\nHe described how NVIDIA invented the GPU in 1999 as a graphics processing unit, then fit it for a broader role in parallel processing in 2006 with the CUDA programming software. Over time, developers across diverse scientific and technical computing fields found this new form of accelerated computing could significantly advance their work.\nAlong the way, researchers discovered GPUs also were a natural fit for AI\u2019s neural networks, because they require massive parallel processing.\nIn 2012, the AlexNet model, trained on two NVIDIA GPUs, demonstrated human-like capabilities in image recognition. That result helped spark a decade of rapid advances using GPUs, leading to ChatGPT and other generative AI models used by hundreds of millions worldwide.\nToday, accelerated computing and generative AI are showing the potential to transform industries, address global challenges and profoundly benefit society, said Dally, who chaired Stanford University\u2019s computer science department before joining NVIDIA.\nAI\u2019s Potential and Limits\nIn written testimony, Dally provided examples of how AI is empowering professionals to do their jobs better than they might have imagined in fields as diverse as business, healthcare and climate science.\nLike any technology, AI products and services have risks and are subject to existing laws and regulations that aim to mitigate those risks.\nIndustry also has a role to play in deploying AI responsibly. Developers set limits for AI models when they train them and define their outputs.\nDally noted that NVIDIA released in April NeMo Guardrails, open-source software developers can use to guide generative AI applications in producing accurate, appropriate and secure text responses. He said that NVIDIA also maintains internal risk-management guidelines for AI models.\nEyes on the Horizon\nMaking sure that new and exceptionally large AI models are accurate and safe is a natural role for regulators, Dally suggested.\nSubcommittee chair Sen. Richard Blumenthal welcomed Dally to the hearing.\nHe said that these \u201cfrontier\u201d models are being developed at a gigantic scale. They exceed the capabilities of ChatGPT and other existing models that have already been well-explored by developers and users.\nDally urged the subcommittee to balance thoughtful regulation with the need to encourage innovation in an AI developer community that includes thousands of startups, researchers and enterprises worldwide. AI tools should be widely available to ensure a level playing field, he said.\nDuring questioning, Senator Amy Klobuchar asked Dally why NVIDIA announced in March it\u2019s working with Getty Images.\n\u201cAt NVIDIA, we believe in respecting people\u2019s intellectual property rights,\u201d Dally replied. \u201cWe partnered with Getty to train large language models with a service called Picasso, so people who provided the original content got remunerated.\u201d\nIn closing, Dally reaffirmed NVIDIA\u2019s dedication to innovating generative AI and accelerated computing in ways that serve the best interests of all.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Corporate Responsibility | Cybersecurity | GPU | Machine Learning | NVIDIA NeMo | Public Sector | Social Impact | Trustworthy AI \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Once a beautiful city, Krat has become a living nightmare as deadly puppets run amok and a plague sweeps the land. Play as P, a puppet who must fight his way through the city on his unrelenting journey to find Geppetto and finally become human. Lies of P presents an elegant world filled with tension, deep combat and character customization systems, and a gripping story with interesting narrative choices where the more lies told, the more human P becomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Lies of P launches on September 19th, GeForce RTX gamers can significantly accelerate their performance - in our GeForce RTX 40 Series benchmarks, frame rates increased by an average of 1.9X at 4K with max settings enabled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Mortal Kombat 1\nLiu Kang has restarted history, crafting a New Era reflecting his vision of peace.

Lin Kuei warriors and brothers Scorpion and Sub-Zero fight for the future of the clan, while Earthrealm champions Raiden and Kung Lao fight for family and honor. Johnny Cage, who is more concerned with staying relevant in the eyes of his fans, fights for his own vanity. Fight your way through the new Universe of Mortal Kombat 1, ushering in a new era of the iconic franchise with a new fighting system, game modes, and new, spectacular fatalities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt launch, DLSS 2 Super Resolution will be available to ensure GeForce RTX gamers hit a locked 60 frames per second in every match, with every setting maxed out at 1440p and 4K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarfield Performance Improvements\nToday, NVIDIA is releasing a Resizable BAR profile for Starfield which increases performance on GeForce RTX 40 Series and GeForce RTX 30 Series desktop and laptop GPUs.

That\u2019s radically different from a generation ago, when engineers essentially relied on the physics of ever smaller, faster chips.\nThe team of more than 300 that Dally leads at NVIDIA Research helped deliver a whopping 1,000x improvement in single GPU performance on AI inference over the past decade (see chart below).\nIt\u2019s an astounding increase that IEEE Spectrum was the first to dub \u201cHuang\u2019s Law\u201d after NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang. The label was later popularized by a column in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe advance was a response to the equally phenomenal rise of large language models used for generative AI that are growing by an order of magnitude every year.\n\u201cThat\u2019s been setting the pace for us in the hardware industry because we feel we have to provide for this demand,\u201d Dally said.\nIn his talk, Dally detailed the elements that drove the 1,000x gain.\nThe largest of all, a sixteen-fold gain, came from finding simpler ways to represent the numbers computers use to make their calculations.\nThe New Math\nThe latest NVIDIA Hopper architecture with its Transformer Engine uses a dynamic mix of eight- and 16-bit floating point and integer math. It\u2019s tailored to the needs of today\u2019s generative AI models. Dally detailed both the performance gains and the energy savings the new math delivers.\nSeparately, his team helped achieve a 12.5x leap by crafting advanced instructions that tell the GPU how to organize its work. These complex commands help execute more work with less energy.\nAs a result, computers can be \u201cas efficient as dedicated accelerators, but retain all the programmability of GPUs,\u201d he said.\nIn addition, the NVIDIA Ampere architecture added structural sparsity, an innovative way to simplify the weights in AI models without compromising the model\u2019s accuracy. The technique brought another 2x performance increase and promises future advances, too, he said.\nDally described how NVLink interconnects between GPUs in a system and NVIDIA networking among systems compound the 1,000x gains in single GPU performance.\nNo Free Lunch\u00a0\u00a0\nThough NVIDIA migrated GPUs from 28nm to 5nm semiconductor nodes over the decade, that technology only accounted for 2.5x of the total gains, Dally noted.\nThat\u2019s a huge change from computer design a generation ago under Moore\u2019s law, an observation that performance should double every two years as chips become ever smaller and faster.\nThose gains were described in part by Denard scaling, essentially a physics formula defined in a 1974 paper co-authored by IBM scientist Robert Denard. Unfortunately, the physics of shrinking hit natural limits such as the amount of heat the ever smaller and faster devices could tolerate.\nAn Upbeat Outlook\nDally expressed confidence that Huang\u2019s law will continue despite diminishing gains from Moore\u2019s law.\nFor example, he outlined several opportunities for future advances in further simplifying how numbers are represented, creating more sparsity in AI models and designing better memory and communications circuits.\nBecause each new chip and system generation demands new innovations, \u201cit\u2019s a fun time to be a computer engineer,\u201d he said.\nDally believes the new dynamic in computer design is giving NVIDIA\u2019s engineers the three opportunities they desire most: to be part of a winning team, to work with smart people and to work on designs that have impact.\nExplore generative AI sessions and experiences at NVIDIA GTC, the global conference on AI and accelerated computing, running March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., and online.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AI | NVIDIA LifeTags: Artificial Intelligence | Events | GPU | Hardware | High-Performance Computing | Inference | Machine Learning | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | NVIDIA Research | NVLink | Parallel Computing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Was there even a market for AI?\nAfter the company\u2019s latest earnings report, the question is whether anybody can challenge Nvidia as the preeminent AI platform provider for both enterprise and hyperscale data centers.\nThrough clever acquisitions, internal hardware/software development, and strategic alliances, Nvidia positioned itself perfectly to take advantage of the generative AI frenzy created by the release of ChatGPT late last year. Neither industry-wide chip shortages, nor the collapse of its proposed $40 billion purchase of chip rival Arm Ltd. had any noticeable effect on Nvidia\u2019s phenomenal growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cA new computing era has begun. Companies worldwide are transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI,\u201d Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said in the company\u2019s earnings statement. \u201cNvidia GPUs connected by our Mellanox networking and switch technologies and running our CUDA AI software stack make up the computing infrastructure of generative AI.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe numbers back him up. Nvidia\u2019s second quarter revenues increased from $6.7 billion to $13.5 billion \u2013 that\u2019s right, year-over-year revenue doubled. Net income increased from $656 million to $6.1 billion, which is an 854% increase from a year ago and a 202% gain from the previous quarter. Margins hit 70%, as Nvidia was able to charge enterprises and hyperscalers a premium for in-demand GPUs.\nData center revenue came in at $10.3 billion (up 141% in a single quarter) and now constitutes 76% of total revenue. Nvidia is on pace to surpass Cisco in total revenue by the end of the next quarter. Its stock is trading in the range of $490 a share. And, according to IDC, it has an estimated 90% market share in enterprise GPUs, the building blocks of AI systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustry analysts are bullish. Deutsche Bank\u2019s Ross Seymore says, \u201cWe continue to believe Nvidia is uniquely suited to benefit from the growth of AI in hardware and potentially software.\u201d Atif Malik at Citi predicts that the market for AI accelerators will \u201cgrow at a blistering pace,\u201d with Nvidia boasting \u201ca substantial advantage in AI performance versus AMD.\u201d\nCowen & Co\u2019s Matthew Ramsay predicts that Nvidia revenue could hit $46 billion in 2024 and $65 billion in 2025. \u201cThese upward revisions are entirely concentrated in the data center segment,\u201d says Ramsay. He adds, \u201cWhile we recognize these numbers are extraordinary, we believe there is more than sufficient demand and supply to support revenue growth of this magnitude.\u201d\nAlexander Harrowell, principal analyst at Omdia, says, \u201cThere are plenty of companies that have a powerful neural-network accelerator chip, but there is only one that has Nvidia\u2019s software ecosystem.\u201d He adds that Nvidia\u2019s ability to create a robust developer community around its core technology gives it a distinct advantage, not unlike what Apple has done with iPhones. \u201c\u2019Developers, developers, developers\u2019 has always been a winning strategy in all things digital. It\u2019s extremely difficult to reverse this once it\u2019s happened,\u201d says Harrowell.\n\nThe Nvidia ecosystem\nHuang has stated that Nvidia isn\u2019t seeking to take market share away from industry incumbents; it wants to lead the way as enterprises add AI capabilities to their existing CPU-based data centers. That strategy appears to be working because rather than alienating industry heavyweights, Nvidia has successfully threaded the needle, creating a web of partnerships and alliances.\nWant to keep your data inhouse and build out your own AI capabilities? Nividia has teamed up with Dell to offer enterprises a complete, on-prem generative AI package that integrates Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, networking, software, and NeMo large language model (LLM) framework with Dell servers, storage and preconfigured designs for specific use cases.\nIf you\u2019d rather take advantage of the scalability of the cloud and the speed with which you can get up and running, Nvidia has got that covered with its DGX cloud service, running now on the Oracle cloud and expected to be available soon on Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. DGX cloud is a complete hardware and software package that enables enterprises to create generative AI models using Nvidia technology inside the hyperscaler\u2019s environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor organizations concerned about the security risks associated with sending sensitive data into the public cloud, Nvidia has teamed up with VMware on an offering called VMware Private AI Foundation, a fully integrated, ready-to-go generative AI platform that companies can run on premises, in colocation facilities, or in private clouds.\nMoving up the stack to AI-driven business applications, Nvidia is working with ServiceNow and Accenture to develop AI Lighthouse, which combines the ServiceNow enterprise automation platform and engine, NVIDIA AI supercomputing and software, and Accenture consulting and deployment services to help enterprises build custom generative AI large language models and applications.\nOn the developer front, in addition to its own powerful developer community, Nvidia has partnered with Hugging Face, an open-source AI developer community, to give Hugging Face developers building large language models access to the DGX cloud. This will enable developers to train and tune advanced AI models on Nvidia\u2019s supercomputing infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow about industrial applications like digital twin and robotics? Nvidia has developed its Omniverse real-time 3D graphics collaboration platform. Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights, says, \u201cThe availability of Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse in the Microsoft Azure cloud is a big step forward for Nvidia and for enterprise businesses wanting to reap the benefits of digital twin technologies.\u201d\nHe adds, \u201cVery few companies can do what Nvidia is doing with Omniverse. At the heart of it, Nvidia is building from its powerful advantages in hardware to enable this incredible AI-driven software platform. That makes Omniverse a valuable tool for enterprises looking to streamline their operations and stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.\u201d\nSmart cars? The increasingly software-driven automotive industry is also on Nvidia\u2019s radar screen. The company is partnering with MediaTek to develop automotive systems on chips (or chiplets) for OEMs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GPU battlefield\nNvidia has a dominant market share in GPUs, far ahead of rivals AMD and Intel, and continues to update its product portfolio with regular releases of even more powerful chips. In the latest quarter, it announced the GH2000 Grace Hopper Superchip for complex AI and high-performance computing workloads, and the L40S GPU, a universal data center processor designed to accelerate the most compute-intensive applications.\nBut AMD isn\u2019t standing pat. It is challenging Nvidia with its new Instinct MI300X chips and is building a powerful AI accelerator by combining multiple MI300X chiplets with Zen4 CPU chiplets. \u201cThe generative AI, large language models have changed the landscape,\u201d said AMD CEO Lisa Su at an event in San Francisco in June. \u201cThe need for more compute is growing exponentially, whether you\u2019re talking about training or about inference.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you compare MI300X to the competition, MI300X offers 2.4 times more memory, and 1.6 times more memory bandwidth, and with all of that additional memory capacity, we actually have an advantage for large language models because we can run larger models directly in memory,\u201d Su said.\n\nHowever, the new AMD chips won\u2019t be shipping in volume until 2024. And Intel continues to lag. In March, Intel announced that it had cancelled the Rialto Bridge generation of GPUs and is postponing the Falcon Shores GPU architecture to 2025.\n\u201cThere is no meaningful competition for Nvidia\u2019s high-performance GPUs until AMD starts shipping its new AI accelerators in high volumes in early 2024,\u201d says Raj Joshi, senior vice president at Moody\u2019s Investors Services.\nJim Breyer, CEO at Breyer Capital, adds, \u201cFrom a three-year timeframe, Nvidia is unstoppable; it has a year-and-a-half lead in GPUs.\u201d Breyer adds that from his perspective Nvidia\u2019s biggest challenge isn\u2019t coming from AMD or Intel; it\u2019s Google.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says Google got off to a slow start, but founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page have reportedly come out of retirement and are back at Google headquarters,\u00a0working on the company\u2019s AI project called Gemini.\nGoogle is coming at AI more from the search engine perspective, seeking to maintain its Chrome dominance in the face of a challenge from Microsoft, which has integrated Chat-GPT into its Edge browser. (The Microsoft/OpenAI ChatGPT technology runs on Nvidia chips.)\nGoogle also uses Nvidia GPUs but has developed its own TPUs (tensor processing units), application specific ASICs designed for machine learning and AI. And it\u2019s entirely possible that Google could ramp up production of its TPUs and build a full-stack generative AI offering based on its own PaLM 2 large language model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Amazon is developing its own GPUs. In 2015, Amazon bought Israeli chip design start-up Annapurna Labs for $350 million and has developed two types of GPUs \u2013 Trainium (designed to handle the compute-intensive training of large language models) and Inferentia (designed for the inference part of the AI equation, which is when an end user queries the LLM.)\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy says that AWS is using Trainium and Inferentia for itself but has also made its more cost-effective accelerators available to customers. He adds that AI models trained with Trainium \u201care up to 140% faster\u201d than similar GPU systems \u201cat up to 70% lower cost.\u201d\nAmazon still buys the vast majority of its AI chips from Nvidia, so it\u2019s not clear how much of a bite Amazon might be able to take out of Nvidia\u2019s chip market share. However, never underestimate Google or AWS. They have technical chops, deep pockets, they each have their own large language models, their own marketplaces and developer communities, and of course, datacenters that can handle the demands of AI applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey do face a major challenge, should they decide to directly challenge Nvidia. Stacy Rasgon, senior analyst at Bernstein Research, points out, \u201cNvidia chips have a massive software ecosystem that\u2019s been built up around them over the last 15 years that nobody else has.\u201d\nPotential pitfalls\nNo technology or seemingly dominant technology provider is invincible, as anyone who owned a Blackberry can attest. There are several factors that could lead to competitors grabbing market share from Nvidia.\nToday, Nvidia is pretty much the only game in town, so it can charge significant markups on its chips; a single GPU could run as much as $40,000. Once AMD and Intel get their acts together, they will undoubtedly offer lower-cost alternatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, enterprises are always concerned about vendor lock-in, so, over time, they are likely to add a second GPU vendor to the mix. These factors could take market share away from Nvidia, but at the very least they will drive Nvidia to lower its prices, putting pressure on revenue and earnings.\n\nOther potential pitfalls for Nvidia would be becoming a victim of its own success; spreading itself too thin, failing to execute, becoming too arrogant, losing touch with customers. Not to say any of this is happening, but it wouldn\u2019t be the first time that a company suffered self-inflicted wounds.\nOne key strength for Nvidia is Huang\u2019s steady leadership. A frequent speaker at industry events, Huang is a charismatic presence. At 60, he\u2019s not near retirement age, but should he decide to step away for any reason, the company could face a leadership vacuum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother aspect of generative AI that\u2019s gaining attention is power consumption. \u201cNvidia has the distinction of producing the world\u2019s first chip to draw over a kilowatt of power. The AI era is proving extremely profligate in energy at exactly a time when we can least afford it,\u201d Harrowell says.\nForrester analyst Glenn O\u2019Donnell points out that the technology leaders at a large enterprise might be excited by generative AI, but the CFO might have a different perspective on the notion of spending tons of money and burning lots of energy on something that might be exciting but doesn\u2019t necessarily demonstrate a clear ROI.\nFinally, we know that every technology advance eventually gets leapfrogged by the next big thing. Harrowell says disruptors to Nvidia\u2019s leadership position could come from fundamental AI research that develops more efficient ways to do AI than massive large language models. And alternative processor architectures could emerge from companies like Tesla, Apple, Google, IBM, Meta or others.\nBut for the near term, Nvidia rules. O\u2019Donnell says Nvidia has methodically executed its game plan; they built the chips, created the ecosystem and won the mindshare battle. \u201cThere\u2019s really no stopping this juggernaut,\u201d he says. \u201cThey will continue to dominate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia in the news:\n\nFrench antitrust charges threaten Nvidia amid AI chip market surge\nNvidia teases next-generation Rubin platform, shares physical AI vision\nNvidia rides the AI wave to become the world\u2019s most valuable public company\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRelated content\n\n \n\n\nNews\n\nTop network and data center events 2025\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Denise Dubie \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n4 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCloud Computing\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Center\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetwork Security\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\n\nEnterprises reevaluate virtualization strategies amid Broadcom uncertainty\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Neal Weinberg \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n11 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetwork Management Software\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetworking Devices\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVirtualization\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\n\n5 alternatives to VMware vSphere virtualization platform\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Neal Weinberg \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n4 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetworking Devices\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tServer Virtualization\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVirtualization\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nIonQ, Alice & Bob tout quantum breakthroughs\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Maria Korolov \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 14, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n5 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCPUs and Processors\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tServers\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTechnology Industry\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Sections\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPODCASTS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVIDEOS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRESOURCES\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEVENTS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpotlight: Managing modern risks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom our editors straight to your inbox\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tGet started by entering your email address below.\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email address\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                        by                                                             \n                                                                Neal Weinberg                                                            \n\n\nContributing writer\n                                                        \n                                                                                                                    ,                                                         \n                                                                                                                    \nFoundry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Neal Weinberg on X\n \n\n\n\nNeal Weinberg is a freelance technology writer and editor.

Moore07 Sep 20234 min readSamuel K. Moore is IEEE Spectrum\u2019s semiconductor editor.\n         I-Hwa Cheng/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n    Nvidia is riding high at the moment. The company has managed to increase the performance of its chips on AI tasks a thousandfold over the past 10 years, it\u2019s raking in money, and it\u2019s reportedly very hard to get your hands on its newest AI-accelerating GPU, the H100.\n\n\tHow did Nvidia get here? The company\u2019s chief scientist, Bill Dally, managed to sum it all up in a single slide during his keynote address to the IEEE\u2019s Hot Chips 2023 symposium in Silicon Valley on high-performance microprocessors last week. Moore\u2019s Law was a surprisingly small part of Nvidia\u2019s magic and new number formats a very large part. Put it all together and you get what Dally called Huang\u2019s Law (for Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang).\nNvidia chief scientist Bill Dally summed up how Nvidia has boosted the performance of its GPUs on AI tasks a thousandfold over 10 years.NvidiaNumber Representation: 16x\n\t\u201cBy and large, the biggest gain we got was from better number representation,\u201d Dally told engineers. These numbers represent the key parameters of a neural network. One such parameter is weights\u2014the strength of neuron-to-neuron connections in a model\u2014and another is activations\u2014what you multiply the sum of the weighted input at the neuron to determine if it activates, propagating information to the next layer. Before the P100, Nvidia GPUs represented those weights using single precision floating-point numerals. Defined by the IEEE 754 standard, these are 32 bits long, with 23 bits representing a fraction, 8 bits acting essentially as an exponent applied to the fraction, and one bit for the number\u2019s sign.\n\n\tBut machine-learning researchers were quickly learning that in many calculations, they could use less precise numbers and their neural network would still come up with answers that were just as accurate. The clear advantage of doing this is that the logic that does machine learning\u2019s key computation\u2014multiply and accumulate\u2014can be made faster, smaller, and more efficient if they need to process fewer bits. (The energy needed for multiplication is proportional to the square of the number of bits, Dally explained.)  So, with the P100, Nvidia cut that number in half, using FP16. Google even came up with its own version called bfloat16. (The difference is in the relative number of fraction bits, which give you precision, and exponent bits, which give you range. Bfloat16 has the same number of range bits as FP32, so it\u2019s easier to switch back and forth between the two formats.)\n\n\tFast forward to today, and Nvidia\u2019s leading GPU, the H100, can do certain parts of massive-transformer neural networks, like ChatGPT and other large language models, using 8-bit numbers. Nvidia did find, however, that it\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all solution. Nvidia\u2019s Hopper GPU architecture, for example, actually computes using two different FP8 formats, one with slightly more accuracy, the other with slightly more range. Nvidia\u2019s special sauce is in knowing when to use which format.\n\n\tDally and his team have all sorts of interesting ideas for squeezing more AI out of even fewer bits. And it\u2019s clear the floating-point system isn\u2019t ideal. One of the main problems is that floating-point accuracy is pretty consistent no matter how big or small the number. But the parameters for neural networks don\u2019t make use of big numbers, they\u2019re clustered right around zero. So, Nvidia\u2019s R&D focus is finding efficient ways to represent numbers so they are more accurate near zero.\nComplex Instructions: 12.5x\n\t\u201cThe overhead of fetching and decoding an instruction is many times that of doing a simple arithmetic operation,\u201d said Dally. He pointed out one type of multiplication, which had an overhead that consumed a full 20 times the 1.5 picojoules used to do the math itself. By architecting its GPUs to perform big computations in a single instruction rather than a sequence of them, Nvidia made some huge gains. There\u2019s still overhead, Dally said, but with complex instructions, it\u2019s amortized over more math. For example, the complex instruction integer matrix multiply and accumulate (IMMA) has an overhead that\u2019s just 16 percent of the energy cost of the math.\nMoore\u2019s Law: 2.5x\n\tMaintaining the progress of Moore\u2019s Law  is the subject of billons and billions of dollars of investment, some very complex engineering, and a bunch of international\u00a0angst. But it\u2019s only responsible for a fraction of Nvidia\u2019s GPU gains. The company has consistently made use of the most advanced manufacturing technology available; the H100 is made with TSMC\u2019s N5 (5-nanometer) process and the chip foundry only began initial production of its next generation N3 in late 2022.\nSparsity: 2x\n\tAfter training, there are many neurons in a neural network that may as well not have been there in the first place. For some networks, \u201cyou can prune out half or more of the neurons and lose no accuracy,\u201d said Dally. Their weight values are zero, or really close to it; so they just don\u2019t contribute the output, and including them in computations is a waste of time and energy.\n\n\tMaking these networks \u201csparse\u201c to reduce the computational load is tricky business. But with the A100, the H100\u2019s predecessor, Nvidia introduced what it calls structured sparsity. It\u2019s hardware that can force two out of every four possible pruning events to happen, leading to a new smaller matrix computation.\n\n\t\u201cWe\u2019re not done with sparsity,\u201d Dally said. \u201cWe need to do something with activations and can have greater sparsity in weights as well.\u201d\nFrom Your Site ArticlesNvidia\u2019s Next GPU Shows That Transformers Are Transforming AI \u203aMove Over, Moore\u2019s Law: Make Way for Huang\u2019s Law \u203aNvidia Still on Top in Machine Learning; Intel Chasing - IEEE Spectrum \u203aNvidia Unveils Blackwell, Its Next GPU - IEEE Spectrum \u203aNvidia AI: Challengers Are Coming for Nvidia\u2019s Crown - IEEE Spectrum \u203aRelated Articles Around the WebNVIDIA: World Leader in Artificial Intelligence Computing \u203aList of Nvidia graphics processing units - Wikipedia \u203agpusfloating pointartificial intelligencenvidiamoore's lawSamuel K.

Now the company seeks to seize the generative AI opportunity in the cloud.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCredit: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s transformation from an accelerator of video games to an enabler of artificial intelligence (AI) and the industrial metaverse didn\u2019t happen overnight \u2014 but the leap in its stock market value to over a trillion dollars did.\nIt was when Nvidia reported strong results for the three months to April 30, 2023, and forecast its sales could jump by 50% in the following fiscal quarter, that its stock market valuation soared, catapulting it into the exclusive trillion-dollar club alongside well-known tech giants Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft. The once-niche chipmaker, now a Wall Street darling, was becoming a household name.\nInvestor exuberance waned later that week, however, dropping the chip designer out of the trillion-dollar club in short order, just as former members Meta and Tesla before it. But it was soon back in, and in mid-June, investment bank Morgan Stanley forecast Nvidia\u2019s value could continue to rise another 15% before the year is out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy late August, Nvidia had more than justified its earlier optimism, reporting a quarter-on-quarter increase in revenue of 88% for the three months to July 30, driven by record sales of data center products of over $10 billion, with strong demand from AWS, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle. Its stock price, too, continued to climb, bumping up against the $500 level Morgan Stanley forecast. Unlike most of its trillion-dollar tech cohorts, Nvidia has less consumer brand awareness to go on, making its Wall Street leap more mysterious to Main Street. How Nvidia got here and where it\u2019s going next sheds light on how the company has achieved that valuation \u2014 a story that owes a lot to the rising importance of specialty chips in business, and accelerating interest in the promise of generative AI.\n\n\n\n\nGraphics driver\nNvidia started out in 1993 as a fabless semiconductor firm designing graphics accelerator chips for PCs. Its founders spotted that generating 3D graphics in video games \u2014 then a fast-growing market \u2014 placed highly repetitive, math-intensive demands on PC central processing units (CPUs). They realized those calculations could be performed more rapidly in parallel by a dedicated chip rather than in series by the CPU, an insight that led to the creation of the first Nvidia GeForce graphic cards.\nFor many years, graphics drove Nvidia\u2019s business; even 30 years on, its sales of graphics cards for gaming, including the GeForce line, still make it the biggest vendor of discrete graphics cards in the world. (Intel makes more graphics chips, though, because most of its CPUs ship with the company\u2019s own integrated graphics silicon.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, other uses for the parallel-processing capabilities of Nvidia\u2019s graphical processing units (GPUs) emerged, solving problems with a similar matrix arithmetic structure to 3D-graphics modelling.\nStill, software developers seeking to leverage graphics chips for non-graphical applications had to wrangle their calculations into a form that could be sent to the GPU as a series of instructions for either Microsoft\u2019s DirectX graphics API or the open-source OpenGL (Open Graphics Library).\nThen in 2006 Nvidia introduced a new GPU architecture, CUDA, that could be programmed directly in C to accelerate mathematical processing, simplifying its use in parallel computing. One of the first applications for CUDA was in oil and gas exploration, processing the mountains of data from geological surveys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe market for using GPUs as general-purpose processors (GPGPUs) really opened up in 2009, when OpenGL publisher Khronos Group released Open Computing Language (OpenCL).\nSoon, hyperscalers such as AWS added GPUs to some of their compute instances, making scalable GPGPU capacity available on demand, thereby lowering the barrier of entry to compute-intensive workloads for enterprises everywhere.\nAI, crypto mining, and the metaverse\nOne of the biggest drivers of demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips in recent years has been AI, or, more specifically, the need to perform trillions of repetitive calculations to train machine learning (ML) models. Some of those models are truly gargantuan: OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 is said to have over 1 trillion parameters. Nvidia was an early supporter of OpenAI, even building a special compute module based on its H100 processors to accelerate the training of the large language models (LLMs) the company was developing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother unexpected source of demand for the company\u2019s chips has been cryptocurrency mining, the calculations for which can be performed faster and in a more energy-efficient manner on a GPU than on a CPU. Demand for GPUs for cryptocurrency mining meant that graphics cards were in short supply for years, making GPU manufacturers like Nvidia similar to pick-axe retailers during the California Gold Rush.\nAlthough Nvidia\u2019s first chips were used to enhance 3D gaming, the manufacturing industry is also interested in 3D simulations, and its pockets are deeper. Going beyond the basic rendering and accelerating code libraries of OpenGL and OpenCL, Nvidia has developed a software platform called Omniverse \u2014 a metaverse for industry used to create and view digital twins of products or even entire production lines in real-time. The resulting imagery can be used for marketing or collaborating on new designs and manufacturing processes.\nEfforts to stay in the $1t club\nNvidia is driving forward on many fronts. On the hardware side, it continues to sell GPUs for PCs and some gaming consoles; supplies computational accelerators to server manufacturers, hyperscalers, and supercomputer manufacturers; and makes chips for self-driving cars. It\u2019s also in the service business, operating its own cloud infrastructure for pharmaceutical firms, the manufacturing industry, and others. And it\u2019s a software vendor, developing generic libraries of code that anyone can use to accelerate calculations on Nvidia hardware, as well as more specific tools such as its cuLitho package to optimize the lithography stage in semiconductor manufacturing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut interest in the latest AI tools such as ChatGPT (developed on Nvidia hardware), among others, is driving a new wave of demand for Nvidia hardware, and prompting the company to develop new software to help enterprises develop and train the LLMs on which generative AI is based.\nIn the last few months the company has also partnered with software vendors including Adobe, Snowflake, ServiceNow, Hugging Face, and VMware, to ensure the AI elements of their enterprise software are optimized for its chips.\n\u201cBecause of our scale and velocity, we\u2019re able to sustain this really complex stack of software and hardware, networking and compute across all these different usage models and computing environments,\u201d CEO Jensen Huang said during a call on August 23 to discuss the latest earnings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is also pitching AI Foundations, its cloud-based generative AI service, as a one-stop shop for enterprises that might lack resources to build, tune, and run custom LLMs trained on their own data to perform tasks specific to their industry. The move, announced in March, may be a savvy one, given rising business interest in generative AI, and it pits the company in direct competition with hyperscalers that also rely on Nvidia\u2019s chips.\nNvidia AI Foundations models include NeMo, a cloud-native enterprise framework; Picasso, an AI capable of generating images, video, and 3D applications; and BioNemo, which deals in molecular structures, making generative AI particularly interesting for accelerating drug development, where it can take up to 15 years to bring a new drug to market. Nvidia says its hardware, software, and services can cut early-stage drug discovery from months to weeks. Amgen and AstraZeneca are among the pharmaceutical firms testing the waters, and with US pharmaceutical firms alone spending over $100 billion a year on R&D, more than three times Nvidia\u2019s revenue, the potential upside is clear.\nPharmaceutical development is moving faster, but the road toward widespread adoption of another of Nvidia\u2019s target markets is less clear: self-driving cars have been \u201cjust around the corner\u201d for years, but testing and getting approval for use on the open road is proving even more complex than getting approval for a new drug.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia gets two bites at this market. One is building and running the virtual worlds in which self-driving algorithms are tested without putting anyone at risk. The other is the cars themselves. If the algorithms make it out of the virtual world and onto the roads, cars will need chips from Nvidia and others to process real-time imagery and perform myriad calculations needed to keep them on course. This is the smallest market segment Nvidia breaks out in its quarterly results: just $253 million, or 2% of overall sales, in the three months to July 30, 2023. But it\u2019s a segment that\u2019s been more than doubling each year.\n\nWhen it reported its results for the three months to April 30, Nvidia made an ambitious forecast: that its revenue for the following fiscal quarter, ending July 30, would be over 50% higher \u2014 and it went on to beat that figure by a wide margin, reporting revenue of $13.5 billion. Growth in gaming hardware sales was also up 22% year on year, and 11% quarter on quarter, which would be impressive for most consumer electronics companies, but lags far behind the recent growth in Nvidia\u2019s biggest market \u2014 data centers. The proportion of its overall revenue coming from gaming has shrunk from over one-third in the three months to April 30 to just under one-fifth in the period to July 30. Nevertheless, Nvidia still sees opportunity ahead, as less than half of its installed base has upgraded to graphics cards with the Geforce RTX technology it introduced in 2018, CFO Colette Kress said during the call.\nHuang and Kress both talked up how clearly Nvidia can see future demand for its consumer and data center products, well into next year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe world is transitioning from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing,\u201d Huang said. With around $250 billion in capital expenditure on data centers every year, according to Huang, the potential market for Nvidia is enormous as that transition plays out.\n\u201cDemand is tremendous,\u201d he said, adding that the company is significantly expanding its production capacity to boost supply for the rest of this year and into next.\nNevertheless, Kress was more reserved in her projections for the three months to October 30, saying she expects revenue of between $15.7 billion and $16.3 billion, or quarter-on-quarter growth between 16% and 21%.

Hernando, 2023 Bar examinations chairperson, expresses his profound gratitude to all who helped in making the 2023 Bar exams a \"smashing success\" on 24 September, the last day of the exams.The 2023 Bar examinations came to a successful conclusion, with 10,387 examinees out of the original 10,791 Bar applicants taking the exams, or equivalent to a 96.26 percent turnout, hurdling all three days of the professional licensure exams for future lawyers.\"I am overwhelmed by the smooth, peaceful, and orderly turnout of the 2023 Bar examinations. It was more than what I hoped and envisioned it would be. Indeed, it was a smashing success,\" said Hernando.Raising the bar for this year's Bar examinations, Justice Hernando made sure that this year's regionalized and digitalized Bar was accessible and inclusive to all examinees, including those with special needs, to take the exams under exceptional accommodations.Conducted in 14 local testing centers nationwide, the Bar exams on the last day were on Criminal Law and Remedial Law, Legal and Judicial Ethics with Practical Exercises.Ensuring accessibility and inclusivity, this year's Bar Examinations was a testament to Justice Hernando's commitment to promote accessibility and inclusivity within the framework of digitalized and regionalized Bar examinations, in line with the institutional objectives of the Supreme Court.Upon the recommendation of Hernando, the Court, through separate issuances, and after carefully considering the highly exceptional circumstances surrounding the applicants, allowed select examinees with special needs to take this year's examinations under exceptional accommodations, either through the traditional handwritten modality, with an encoder\u201fs assistance, or with the use of the novel Digital Booklet Method.In Bar Matter No. 4399, a visually impaired examinee was allowed to take the test through the use of the Digital Booklet Method for the 2023 Bar, where a Court-issued laptop with installed Non-Visual Desktop Access (NVDA) served as his examination booklet.\u00a0 The said examinee, with the aid of NVDA, completed all three days of the examinations at the local testing center in Ateneo de Davao University.The examinee finished law school through the use of software programs like NVDA and OpenBook. NVDA, in particular, is a screen reader that \"reads aloud\" scanned text of his books and testing booklets, enabling the examinee to study his books and take his exams through ear reading.While it was not the first time that an individual with visual impairment was allowed to take the Bar exams, it was the first time that the Court permitted the use of the NVDA application. There have been visually impaired Bar applicants admitted in the past years who took the tests with the assistance of a special encoder.The Bar applicant who took the 2020-21 Bar Examinations and one of the two applicants who took the 2022 Bar examinations passed and are now full-fledged lawyers.In Bar Matter No. 4277, the Court allowed an examinee to take the examinations in San Beda College \u2013 Alabang, with the assistance of a special encoder because of his visual impairment due to ophthalmic meningitis.In Bar Matter No. 4662, the Court also allowed other examinees, who are senior citizens and suffering from varying physical disabilities, to take the examinations through the traditional and handwritten modality in the LTCs in SBCA, Muntinlupa City; University of San Jose \u2013 Recoletos, Cebu City; and University of Nueva Caceres, Naga City.Bar examinationsFollow UsShow CommentsLatest StoriesNo stories found.\n\n\nFollow UsNEWS\u2304METRONATIONWORLDHALALAN2025COMMENTARY\u2304EDITORIALOPINIONBUSINESS\u2304BUSINESS ADVISORIESINDUSTRY 4.0MONEYSHIPPINGLIFE\u2304DIVERSITYLIVING SPACESSHOWSOCIAL SETTOP FORMPORTRAITS2000Powered by Quintype\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily Tribune\n tribune.net.ph \nINSTALL APP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

NVIDIA has worked with Valve to make sure system latency, which is critical to winning, is at an absolute minimum with the addition of NVIDIA Reflex.\nIn competitive shooters such as Counter-Strike 2, higher FPS and lower system latency allows you to acquire targets faster, react more quickly, and increase aim precision. On a GeForce RTX 40 Series PC or laptop, your skill won\u2019t be constrained by system latency, or frame rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the ultimate Counter-Strike 2 competitive experience, powered by GeForce RTX 40 Series for unbeatable performance, and NVIDIA Reflex for the lowest latency. Gamers with a compatible graphics card can enable NVIDIA Reflex in Counter-Strike 2 to reduce system latency by up to 35%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead on for more details.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimate Counter-Strike 2 Experience with GeForce RTX 40 Series\nCounter-Strike 2 is the largest technical leap forward in Counter-Strike history, ushering in a new era for one of the most iconic first person-shooters of all time. Building upon the legendary legacy of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, this latest iteration now shines on the long anticipated Source 2 engine, promising enhanced graphical fidelity, with a physically-based rendering system producing more realistic textures and materials, dynamic lighting, reflections and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to leveling up the Counter-Strike 2 world with stunningly reimagined maps, smoke grenades are now dynamic volumetric objects that interact with the environment, and react to lighting, gunfire, and explosions.\u00a0 Bullets and HE grenades can push smoke to briefly clear sightlines or expand occlusion.\u00a0 Smoke expands to fill spaces naturally.\u00a0 And Counter-Strike 2 smoke particles work with the unified lighting system allowing for more realistic light and color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounter-Strike 2\u2019s technical enhancements result in a more GPU-intensive experience than CS:GO, which demands the capabilities of modern GPUs to experience previous performance benchmarks (144, 240, 360 and 500 FPS).\nThe GeForce RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 offer the ultimate 1440p Counter-Strike 2 experience, with the GeForce RTX 4090 delivering over 400 FPS at 1440p. In comparison, the GeForce RTX 4090 is over 4.5X faster than the GTX 1080, and over 2.9X faster than the RTX 2080 in the most demanding maps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GeForce RTX 4070 and RTX 4070 Ti excel in Counter-Strike 2 at 1080p. The GeForce RTX 4070 Ti delivers over 360 FPS at 1080p, 2.7X faster than the GTX 1070, and almost 2X faster than the RTX 2070 in the most demanding maps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the GeForce RTX 4060 and RTX 4060 Ti offer up 2.25X performance upgrades from one of Counter-Strike 2\u2019s most popular GPUs, the GeForce GTX 1060.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, higher FPS will not make you a great gamer, but it will give you a better chance to win. This applies to the best Counter-Strike players in the world and those that are just getting started.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex - Lowest Latency, Best Responsiveness\nNVIDIA Reflex is a must-have in games, reducing system latency and improving responsiveness so your actions occur quicker. NVIDIA Reflex is now used by over 50 million players each month, is available in 9 of the top 10 competitive shooters, including Counter-Strike 2, and is activated by 90% of GeForce gamers in over 70 supported titles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem Latency, often called \u201cinput lag\u201d, is the delay between a player's action and its appearance on the screen. In games like Counter-Strike 2, even small delays can impact gameplay, making the difference between success and defeat. This delay results from the cumulative effect of several factors, including the time taken by peripherals to communicate with the PC, the PC's processing time, and the display's refresh rate. This is known as \u201cEnd to End System Latency\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two main types of latency: \u00a0\n\nNetwork Latency: The time it takes your system to communicate with the game\u2019s servers and services when playing online. As this cannot be controlled by the PC, and is based on the characteristics of your internet connection and your distance from the game\u2019s servers, network latency is not measured in the system latency stat.\nSystem Latency: The entire end-to-end response time within your gaming system. It starts with peripheral latency, the delay from your input device; progresses through Game and Render Latency, which covers CPU processing and GPU rendering known as PC Latency; and ends with Display latency, the time taken for the rendered frame to appear on your screen.\n\nLatency impacts gameplay in several ways. For instance, you might click your mouse when your crosshair is over an opponent, but the shot might still miss due to cumulative latency. It causes a delay between what's happening in the game state and what players perceive on screen. \"Peeker\u2019s advantage\" is also influenced by system latency\u2014when two players are the same distance from an angle with the same network ping, the player with lower system latency will spot an opponent before their opponent sees them. Furthermore, high system latency can make aiming inconsistent and less predictable, especially in games that demand quick and precise movements. In short, the higher the system latency, the more the player\u2019s view lags behind the game\u2019s reality.\nNVIDIA Reflex reduces latency by optimizing the rendering pipeline across the CPU and GPU, removing stalls by synchronizing each step of the pipeline. Reflex is most effective when the system is GPU-bound\u2014or when the GPU is under high utilization\u2014as it prevents the CPU from racing ahead of the GPU, which can cause a buildup in the render queue, increasing latency.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflex Off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflex On:\u00a0 Emptying Render Queue, Synchronizing CPU & GPU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 40 Series with NVIDIA Reflex \u201cOn\u201d delivers the best responsiveness in Counter-Strike 2 at sub 15ms PC latency for faster target acquisition, quicker reaction times, and the best aim precision.\u00a0Gamers with compatible graphics cards can enable NVIDIA Reflex in Counter-Strike 2 to reduce system latency by up to 35%.\u00a0 NVIDIA Reflex \u201cEnabled + Boost\u201d can further reduce latency at the cost of extra power usage and a slightly lower frame rate. In Counter-Strike 2, this setting is only recommended for gamers who prioritize lowest latency over highest frame rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabling NVIDIA Reflex In Counter-Strike 2\nTo enable NVIDIA Reflex in Counter-Strike 2, follow these simple steps:\n\nOpen the game\nGo to \u2018Settings\u2019\nNavigate to \u2018Video\u2019\nNavigate to \u2018Advanced Video\u2019\nSet \u2018NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency\u2019 to \u201cEnabled\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring Latency In Counter-Strike 2\nTo ensure a responsive gaming experience, it\u2019s crucial to measure latency and determine whether your system is running well. In general, PC Latency is the most accessible metric and is the main metric that should be used when optimizing game settings, Windows settings, or any other software setting on your PC.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three ways to measure PC latency in Counter-Strike 2: GeForce Experience\u2019s Performance Overlay, the Reflex Analyzer, and FrameView.

The new round, led by T. Rowe Price, could mark the last round of private funding as the data company gears up for the public market. Chipmaker Nvidia NVDA, another beneficiary of the AI boom, and credit card firm Capital One Financial COF, also participated in the latest funding round.The company plans to use the funds to build out foundation models in partnership with Nvidia, which makes the core computing chips that run AI models, Ali Ghodsi, chief executive of Databricks, told Reuters in an interview.    \"You want to have models that are really good at specific tasks. It matters to us to be able to do this for our enterprise clients,\" Ghodsi said.  Other marquee names in the venture capital industry like Andreessen Horowitz, Baillie Gifford, Morgan Stanley's Counterpoint Global, Fidelity Management & Research and Tiger Global also participated in the round.AI, the latest buzzword in the technology space, has captivated the interest of investors from Silicon Valley to Wall Street.Following the massive popularity of OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT, many players in the industry including  Anthropic, Hugging Face and Modular have raised funds in recent months.The financing for Databricks comes as the company sharpened focus on developing a chatbot that can analyze business data like sales transactions or written reports.In June, it rolled out an AI assistant called LakehouseIQ, which can interpret queries submitted in natural language instead of computer codes. Weeks later, it also closed the acquisition of MosaicML, a generative AI startup it bought in a $1.3 billion deal. Databricks said it posted a 50% year-over-year jump in revenue in the second quarter ended July, and had more than 10,000 customers globally.Its latest valuation is over 13% more than the $38 billion  the San Francisco-based company was worth after its last fundraise in 2021. The company has raised $4 billion since inception. Reuters\u00a9 Copyright Thomson Reuters 2023.

Register for this free strategy session today.\r\nAs Arm Holdings PLC - ADR ARM enters its third day of trading on the open markets, after staging\u00a0the year's biggest initial public offering on Thursday with a valuation of $54.5 billion, investors may be wondering if the company is planning on returning capital to shareholders via dividends.\nThe Cambridge-based technology firm, crucial in developing CPUs for Nvidia Corp's NVDA AI-powered GPUs, was acquired by SoftBank Group Corp SFTBY in 2016 for $32 billion. The Japanese firm decided to retain 90% of ARM's ownership post-IPO, releasing just a tenth of its stake to public investors.\nOn the dividend front, the company said that it currently has no plans to distribute dividends, according to its prospectus, and capital appreciation will be the sole source of gains on any investment in Arm Holdings.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that buying shares is a bad investment \u2014 as a closer look into SoftBank's actions offers a potentially bullish narrative.\nWeeks prior to the IPO, SoftBank, then holding a 75% stake, made the decision to buy the remaining 25% of ARM, elevating its ownership to 100%. That strategic move, which effectively valued Arm\u00a0at $64 billion \u2014 almost double its initial acquisition price \u2014 seems to exude confidence in the company\u2019s future.\n\"SoftBank owned 75% of ARM just a few weeks ago. We bought back from 75% to 100% from Vision Fund, paying an even higher price. I'm more confident about the future,\"\u00a0SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son said last week. \"I see value having a significant upside. That's why I bought back at a price higher than $51.\"\nRead also:\u00a0Diamond Hands: SoftBank Isn't Leaving Arm Holdings, 'Keep As Much As Possible, As Long As Possible'\nWhile the market is assessing Arm's potential for equity growth, the company reiterated its position on dividends. The prospectus notes, \"We intend to retain any earnings for use in our business and do not currently intend to pay dividends on our ordinary shares or ADSs.\"\nThe ability for Arm to declare and distribute any future dividends, according to its Board of Directors, will be contingent upon various factors, which include operational results, financial health, cash requirements, any prevailing contractual restrictions, or any potential future debt agreements, among others.\nThe company further highlighted stipulations under English and Welsh law. Specifically, the company can only distribute dividends if there are adequate distributable reserves, and even then, they must ensure that the net value of assets isn\u2019t reduced below the aggregate of their called-up share capital and other non-distributable reserves.\nConsidering the context, investors should be mindful that for the foreseeable future, any potential capital appreciation will be the sole source of returns from their investment in Arm.\nARM Price action: Shares of Arm Holdings were trading 6.26% lower to $56.95 at the time of publication Monday, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\nRead next:\u00a0Rene Haas Shines Light On Arm's Dominance Amid 2023's Biggest IPO\nPhoto: Shutterstock\nARMARM Holdings PLC$119.77-1.32%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock \u2013 anytime.Reveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum31.84Growth-Quality-Value5.12Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewNVDANVIDIA Corp$117.10-2.03%SFTBYSoftBank Group Corp$26.44-2.58%Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Since the start of the year, shares have soared well over 200%. However, because NVDA now trades at over 110x trailing earnings, many investors understandably seek less-hyped AI stocks to buy.\nTo find out what company could be the next Nvidia, I\u2019m going to explore a range of data points, including analyst assessments and options dynamics. But be warned: these ideas are wildly speculative. If you\u2019re okay with that, below are the AI stocks to buy.\n\nPowerFleet (PWFL)\nSource: shutterstock.com/YAKOBCHUK V\nAn interesting but lesser-known entity among AI stocks to buy, PowerFleet (NASDAQ:PWFL) could be the next Nvidia if digital intelligence moves beyond just answering inquiries from Internet users. Headquartered in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey, PowerFleet is a global provider of wireless Internet of Things (IoT) and machine-to-machine (M2M) solutions for securing, controlling, tracking and managing high-value enterprise assets.\nPer its public profile, these assets include industrial trucks, tractor-trailers, intermodal shipping containers, cargo and vehicle and truck fleets. In recent years, the company has introduced new technologies such as Vista, an in-vehicle AI protocol that proactively manages risky driving situations across fleets.\nWhile it\u2019s difficult to make accurate insights based on its underlying derivatives activity, PWFL\u2019s implied volatility (IV) curve swings higher alongside rising strike prices. This may suggest heightened anticipation of upside among options traders.\u00a0Enticingly, Wall Street analysts peg PWFL as a unanimous strong buy with a $6.67 price target, implying 199% upside potential.\nCodexis (CDXS)\nSource: Shutterstock\nBased in Redwood City, California, Codexis (NASDAQ:CDXS) is a protein engineering company that develops enzymes for pharmaceutical, food and medical applications. According to its website, the company utilizes machine learning tools to design, screen and analyze libraries of thousands of enzyme variants in high throughput, sequencing each variant and correlating its sequence with its performance.\nWhile the science entices, the problem is market sentiment. Basically, few investors appreciate the marriage between ML and biotechnology-related solutions. Since the start of the year, CDXS lost just over 55% of its equity value. In the past 365 days, it gave up just under 71%. Therefore, it\u2019s not one of the AI stocks to buy lightly.\nStill, it could be the next Nvidia in the applied sciences industry. Financially, Codexis prints a three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 20.5%. Still, it only trades at 1.52x sales, below 89.46% of its biotech peers. And while its IV curve indicates risk mitigation, options traders seem bullish.\u00a0Lastly, analysts peg CDXS as a\u00a0strong buy with an $8.17 price target, implying 289% upside.\nCepton (CPTN)\nSource: shutterstock.com/Den Rise\nA wildly risky candidate for the next Nvidia, Cepton (NASDAQ:CPTN) is a leading provider of lidar-based solutions for automotive, smart cities, smart spaces and smart industrial applications. Given the rapidly burgeoning utility of AI and ML protocols, Cepton warrants attention among those looking to speculate with pocket change. However, the emphasis must be on pocket change.\nSince the beginning of this year, CPTN has fallen more than 65%. In the trailing one-year period, shares gave up nearly 72% of equity value. Since Cepton\u2019s public market debut, it\u2019s lost 95% of its value, posing serious concerns. Oh yeah, it goes without saying that CPTN is also a literal penny stock.\nThe only good thing in its financials is the growth narrative. Featuring a three-year top-line expansion of 21.1%, this metric beats out 86.78% of the company\u2019s rivals. However, it gets ugly from there, with negative margins and an overall distressed enterprise.\nThat said, analysts peg CPTN as a\u00a0strong buy with a $2.35 price target, implying nearly 411% upside potential.\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks:\u202fWith only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day. That\u2019s because these \u201cpenny stocks\u201d are frequently the playground for scam artists and market manipulators.

Nvidia says its automatic over-the-air update will enable Resizable BAR and boost Starfield performance for its latest GPUs.\u201cToday, Nvidia is releasing a Resizable BAR profile for Starfield which increases performance on GeForce RTX 40 Series and GeForce RTX 30 Series desktop and laptop GPUs,\u201d explains Andrew Burnes, technical marketer at Nvidia, in a blog post. \u201cIn our testing scenario, GeForce RTX 40-series desktop GPUs see on average a 5 percent increase in performance.\u201dRelatedStarfield is a \u2018bizarrely worse experience\u2019 on Nvidia and Intel, says Digital FoundryStarfield: all the news about Bethesda\u2019s massive space RPGThe over-the-air update will be applied to the existing 537.17 drivers and the new 537.34 drivers Nvidia released today. The latest drivers also include new one-click optimal settings for Starfield, making it a little easier to pick settings based on your system. Nvidia has also fixed its GPU profile for the Microsoft Store version of Starfield.Nvidia\u2019s updates come just days after the experts at Digital Foundry found that Starfield is a \u201cbizarrely worse experience\u201d on Nvidia and Intel compared to AMD GPUs. Digital Foundry found issues with Intel CPUs and a 46 percent performance gap between AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 6800 XT and Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3080 in Starfield. That\u2019s an unusually large gap, and we\u2019ll have to see if this new Resizable BAR profile update helps to close it.See More: EntertainmentGamingMicrosoftNewsNvidiaPC GamingTechMore in this streamSee allStarfield\u2019s big Shattered Space expansion isn\u2019t weird enoughAndrew WebsterOct 5, 2024CommentsComment Icon BubbleStarfield is finally getting a 60fps mode on XboxEmma RothMay 1, 2024CommentsComment Icon BubbleStarfield gets FSR 3 and XeSS support.Tom WarrenFeb 20, 2024CommentsComment Icon BubbleMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?Leaked Apple meeting shows how dire the Siri situation really isInstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLK), which invests in the technology sector of the S&P 500 (SPX), has returned a scintillating 42.6% year-to-date.\u00a0But this type of stellar performance is nothing new for this top tech ETF, which has been rewarding its investors with excellent returns for many years. So, let\u2019s take a look at this long-term winner that is still attractive.\u00a0\u00a0\nStellar Track Record\nXLK has established itself as a consistent, long-term winner. How good has XLK\u2019s performance been over the years?\u00a0\nAs of the end of the most recent quarter, XLK put up an impressive annualized total return of 19.5% over the past three years. Zooming out to five years and 10 years, the fund has managed to return over 20% on an annualized basis over each time frame, with outstanding total annualized returns of 21.5% over the past five years and 20.7% over the past 10 years.\nThese returns are great on their own accord, but how do they stack up against the broader market over the long term?\u00a0As of the end of the most recent quarter, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO), a good proxy for the S&P 500, returned 14.6% on an annualized basis over the past three years. Over the past five years, it has returned 12.3% on an annualized basis, and over the past 10 years, it has posted an annualized return of 12.8%. \nThese are solid returns, but XLK\u2019s returns over each of the three time frames are superior, putting it among one of the rare ETFs that can say it has decisively beaten the market over the long run.\n\t\t\n\n\nA Cost-Effective Option\nXLK has given investors a market-beating performance over the past decade, and it does so for a very reasonable price, with an expense ratio of just 0.10%. This means that an investor putting $10,000 into XLK today would pay just $10 in fees in year one. Assuming the ETF returns 5% per year going forward and the fee remains 0.10%, this same investor would pay a reasonable $128 in fees over the course of the next 10 years.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s worth noting that XLK\u2019s expense ratio is significantly lower than that of the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), the largest and most popular tech-centric ETF, which charges a still-reasonable 0.20%. \u00a0\nXLK\u2019s Holdings\u00a0\nXLK sports 67 holdings, covering the technology sector of the S&P 500. Below, you\u2019ll find an overview of XLK\u2019s top 10 holdings from TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\n\nDespite the fact that it has 67 holdings, this is a fairly concentrated fund, as its top 10 holdings account for 69.5% of assets, and its top two holdings, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), combine to make up more than 44%. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, but investors should be aware that XLK has a lot of exposure to these two stocks.\u00a0\nPart of the reason that XLK has outperformed the market over the years is that its top holdings include some of the most innovative companies in the U.S. market (not to mention globally), creating the products, technologies, and applications that have revolutionized the way many people work and live their day-to-day lives. \n\t\t\n\n\nThis is true whether it\u2019s consumer-facing products from the likes of Apple and Microsoft, enterprise-facing products from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), or the semiconductor companies that make many of these applications possible, like Nivida (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).\u00a0\nYou may notice that several big names are conspicuously absent from XLK\u2019s portfolio. The likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), are not part of XLK\u2019s portfolio. \nThis is because while we often think of them as tech stocks, the S&P index classifies Meta Platforms and Alphabet within communications services, and they can be found within the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLC). \nMeanwhile, Amazon and Tesla are classified as consumer discretionary companies and can be found within the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SDPR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLY), where they combine to make up more than 40% of the fund\u2019s holdings.\nAn Outperform Smart Score Rating\nTipRanks\u2019 Smart Score system rates XLK\u2019s top holdings highly. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating. As you can see in the table above, an impressive eight out of XLK\u2019s top 10 holdings have Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or higher. XLK itself features an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 9.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\n\n\nIs XLK Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\u00a0\nTurning to Wall Street, XLK earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 55 Buys, 12 Holds, and no Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average XLK stock price target of $199.81 implies 15.9% upside potential.\n\nLooking Ahead\nXLK has put up a banner performance in 2023. Still, this outstanding performance is nothing new \u2014 it is one of the rare ETFs that has soundly beaten the broader market over a long period of time. The ETF enjoys favorable views from analysts and an excellent rating from TipRanks\u2019 Smart Score System.\nHowever, investors should be aware that while XLK owns many of today\u2019s tech companies, it doesn\u2019t own some of the archetypical technology stocks like Meta Platforms or Amazon, as these are grouped into different sectors by the S&P.\u00a0Nevertheless, XLK\u2019s investor-friendly expense ratio, impeccable track record, and strong portfolio of top technology companies make it look like a solid long-term bet.\u00a0\nDisclosure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\n\n\n FACEBOOK\n\n\n\n\n TWITTER\n\n\n\n\n EMAIL\n\n\n\n\n COPY LINK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAMD NewsMORE  \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Micro (AMD) Jumps 4% as Its Gaming GPUs Capture 45% Market Share in JapanTipRanks 16h \n\n\n\nSA Asks: Will Intel be broken up?Seeking Alpha 1d \n\n\n\nHow Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Stayed One Step Ahead in the AI Race\u00a0TipRanks 1d \n\n\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.

The overall S&P 500, which is weighted by market cap, is up over 13% for the year.\n\n\n\"The bottom line is that if you buy the S&P 500 today, you are basically buying a handful of companies that make up 34% of the index and have an average P/E ratio around 50,\" he wrote.\u00a0\nKnown as the \"Magnificent 7,\" the massive gains seen by Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, Google, and Tesla were sparked by hype over artificial intelligence.\u00a0\nOn Monday, Amazon said it will invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, an artificial intelligence company that's considered a rival to ChatGPT creator OpenAI, which counts Microsoft as a top investor.\n\n\nThe AI-led stock rally has acted as a counterweight to equity headwinds this year, whether they be rising interest rates or last spring's banking turmoil.\u00a0\nBut the past two months have seen the seven stocks pare some gains after climbing nearly 70% at its mid-July peak. This month, top performer Nvidia was not spared from bearish sentiments, and has lost $180 billion in market capitalization.\nThat's in part as soaring bond yields now offer a profitable alternative to the equity market, while declining consumer savings and a cooling labor market make further growth uncertain.\u00a0\n\n\nBut excitement for the cohort still remains among Wall Street observers. Last week, Wedbush Securities noted that the tech sector is estimated to boost spending over the next 12-18 months, helping the rally overcome further headwinds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS&P 500\n\n\nAI\n\n\nInvesting\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\nYour Market View\n\n\nNAME / PRICE\n+ / -\n%\nDATE\n\n\n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n                          Disclaimer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n                See also:\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                    - Explore more categories\n                \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

The most promising AI stocks are those where artificial intelligence not only enhances products but also secures a strategic edge. The world's biggest tech stocks are utilizing the power of AI to streamline and power their businesses, helping keep them at the top of their game. Recent data reveals a rise in mentions of artificial intelligence during company earnings calls.Goldman Sachs published a piece titled \u2018Why AI stocks aren\u2019t in a bubble\u2019. Peter Oppenheimer, the chief global equity strategist at Goldman Sachs Research, suggests that despite the significant rally of AI stocks, they aren't in a bubble. He points out that these stocks' valuations aren't as inflated as during past bubbles, like the 2000 internet crash.Furthermore, these companies showcase robust balance sheets and impressive returns on investment. Oppenheimer believes we're merely at the dawn of a tech cycle poised for even greater success.Some of the companies considered among the best AI stocks to buy today include:Nvidia (NASDAQ:\u00a0NVDA)Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN)IBM (NYSE: IBM)Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL)Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU)Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META)Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)Splunk (NASDAQ: SPLK)#The Future Has ArrivedAI has been a futuristic presence in film, literature, and our collective vision since the 1950s when the power of computers began to spark innovative ideas. But an accelerated adoption of AI into society has come with the evolution of the internet, cloud computing, next-generation graphics, and an ever-mounting abundance of data.AI stocks make a tempting investment because the power of AI is to minimize work and rapidly scale, a driving force of capitalism.Big tech retains a capitalistic hold on our purse strings, with an intimate understanding of our wants and needs that fuels a complex relationship between companies and their consumers. And the success of big tech reflects how effective AI has been in forging this unique level of control.#From Mainframe to MetaverseThe computing sector has evolved from the mainframe era through the personal computing and mobile era to the Internet of Things era.Universal connectivity, powered by unrestrained sensing and limitless scale, is now a possibility only impeded by a lack of money and resources. But advances in AI are bringing us to the digital edge revolution, which merges the virtual and physical to welcome a new existence in the metaverse.\u00a0This thrilling new world will see rising demand for analog semiconductors to power the endless possibilities emerging.#What Are AI Stocks?AI stocks include businesses developing systems that emulate cognitive activity. This includes activities such as speech recognition, problem-solving, and automated learning.Artificial intelligence differs from robotics, but the two often go hand in hand. AI can make decisions and solve problems without specifically being programmed to do so. Meanwhile, robots are built and programmed to accomplish specific tasks.#AI Is Flourishing Despite ChallengesIn society today, organizations are using AI for many purposes, including loan approval, fraud identification, and surveillance.\u00a0However, according to a Deloitte survey, in 2020, more than half of company leaders reported that their organization was slowing AI adoption because of emerging strategic, operational, and ethical risks. Regulatory risk is another concern, and as AI language skills grow, so do scientists' concerns.\u00a0Deloitte's ongoing surveys also reveal companies continue to invest in AI, but the return on their investment (ROI) is lagging. That's because aligning people, processes, and technologies is more of a challenge than expected.Nevertheless, investor interest in the space remains as AI is undoubtedly a piece of future tech advancement that is not going away. This became particularly evident in 2023, when the arrival of generative AI caused a surge of interest in AI stocks.Nevertheless, investors should remain vigilant of underperforming companies that suddenly unveil AI product plans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Investing In AI StocksThese days many companies are working on AI initiatives or utilizing AI applications, which include machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks.

Therefore, I expect NVDA stock to continue moving higher, and I feel it\u2019s not too late to take a share position.\nNvidia\u2019s journey to a $1 trillion market capitalization has been breathtaking to behold. However, some skeptics might expect the company to collapse under its own weight before it reaches $1.5 trillion.\nI wouldn\u2019t count on a collapse, and Nvidia\u2019s continued growth is practically inevitable. The critics and short-sellers have been wrong all along, and standing in front of the Nvidia steamroller now will probably lead to significant capital loss.\n\nA Famous Fund Manager Dumped NVDA Stock\nHere\u2019s something you might not expect. Ark Invest, which is run by founder and CEO Cathie Wood, has reportedly been dumping NVDA stock.\nAs you may recall, Wood and Ark Invest became famous on Wall Street for buying technology stocks with fast momentum and high valuations.\nNow, believe it or not, Wood and Ark Invest object to Nvidia\u2019s lofty valuation.\nWood reportedly posted on social media, \u201cNow up ~80-fold, investors seem to think NVDA is the only AI play. It is not!\u201d\nArk Funds reportedly declared that \u201cthe days of relying solely on mega-cap companies for tech innovation are waning and an era of AI-centric small-cap companies is emerging.\u201d\nIn a similar vein, Tematica Research Chief Investment Officer Chris Versace claimed that, for Nvidia\u2019s investors, \u201cthe easy money\u201d has already \u201cbeen made.\u201d\nVersace feels that Nvidia needs to \u201cshow a lot more progress on what they\u2019re doing and really start to deliver on that guidance.\u201d\nDon\u2019t Get Too Distracted by Nvidia\u2019s Valuation\nI understand the concerns surrounding Nvidia\u2019s high valuation. But then, the company\u2019s valuation was quite high two, three and four months ago. Folks who complained instead of buying NVDA stock ended up leaving a lot of money on the table.\nAnd, anybody who short-sold the shares probably received a margin call. Personally, I find Versace\u2019s \u201cshow-me\u201d attitude perplexing. Nvidia didn\u2019t just issue optimistic guidance without demonstrating robust growth first. I mean, you can\u2019t argue with 101% year-over-year revenue growth.\nI never thought I\u2019d say this, but I\u2019m starting to agree with Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes\u2019s suggestion that NVDA stock might actually be \u201ccheap\u201d compared to Nvidia\u2019s peers.\nAccording to Barron\u2019s, Reitzes figured that Nvidia \u201ctrades at a price-to-earnings multiple of around 28 times its expected 2024 earnings,\u201d which isn\u2019t outlandishly high.\nAll calculations aside, Nvidia is an in-demand chipmaker for power-intensive AI applications.\nDoubling the company\u2019s quarterly revenue year-over-year is an impressive feat. So, Nvidia\u2019s valuation, irrespective of whether it\u2019s high or low, may be irrelevant for a long time to come.\nJust Relax and Stick With NVDA Stock\nWood\u2019s timing with stock purchases and sales hasn\u2019t always been spot-on. Plus, Nvidia will always have its critics and worry warts. Nvidia will almost certainly achieve a $1.5 trillion market cap eventually.\nThe best strategy now is to just relax and hold a small share position in NVDA stock. Sure, I\u2019ll admit, it\u2019s possible that the \u201ceasy money\u201d has already been made.\nOr maybe there are still more gains to come this year. Either way, Nvidia\u2019s revenue growth suggests that the skeptics and short-sellers will continue to be on the wrong side of the trade.\nTherefore, you can feel free to ignore the doubters in 2023 and stay invested in Nvidia.\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nArtificial Intelligence, Semiconductor, Technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2023/09/this-ai-darling-is-the-goldilocks-stock-you-need-now/.\n\u00a92025 InvestorPlace Media, LLC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored Headlines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMore from InvestorPlace\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHot Stocks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Top Stocks to Buy Under Trump Come From Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018BRAIN\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Luke Lango, InvestorPlace Senior Investment Analyst\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Danger that Could Derail Our Economy\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Jeff Remsburg, Contributing Editor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy Prediction Came True: Where to Find Opportunity Despite Market Unpredictability\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Eric Fry, Editor, Fry's Investment Report\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMost Popular\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 10, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBig Tech\u2019s Quantum War Has Begun \u2014 and One Tiny Stock Could Win It\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 5, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat to Make of the Weakening Economy and Trade War\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInvestors Applaud a Cool Inflation Print\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow to Escape the \u2018Tyranny of the Immediate\u2019 in Investing\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExpert Stock Picks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe System Flagging a Potential 50X Opportunity\u2026 Even in This Ugly Market\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAbout InvestorPlace\nProducts\nContact Us\nHelp\nCareers\nAdvertise With Us\nDisclosures & Disclaimers\nPrivacy Policy\nAd Choices\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\nCookie Policy\nCookie Preferences\nTerms of Use\nDMCA Policy\n All rights reserved.

While the popular index is up by over 40% year to date (YTD), many AI stocks have more than doubled.\nNone of those stocks have captured as many headlines as\u00a0Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the growth stock that seems to keep on growing. Anytime stocks like Nvidia take off, investors use them as inspiration and look for stocks that can deliver better gains.\nWhile it\u2019s hard to find stocks that can outperform Nvidia, investors should keep a few thoughts in mind. Promising stocks tend to have high revenue growth and profitability. Some investors can overlook profits if the losses are minimized, and the company is poised to become profitable soon.\nInvestors also have to keep the market cap in mind. While I like\u00a0Broadcom\u00a0(NASDAQ:AVGO) stock, its $360 billion market cap likely disqualifies it from mirroring Nvidia\u2019s 5-year returns. For context, Nvidia generated a 613% return over the past five years. Broadcom would have to become a $2.5 trillion stock in the next half decade to match Nvidia\u2019s return rate. \nSo, investors looking for cutting-edge AI stocks may want to consider these three picks.\nSoundHound AI (SOUN)\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) is a high-risk, high-reward stock with a good business model. The company offers voice AI solutions to small businesses and corporations to improve customer service and enable more efficient, automated conversations.\nThe AI company powers millions of products and services, working with top corporations like Microsoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) and\u00a0Block\u00a0(NYSE:SQ). The firm has a $160 billion addressable market for its product.\nSoundHound AI reported\u00a042% year over year (YOY) revenue growth and a 21% YOY improvement in its net loss. Investors sometimes have to ride out unprofitable quarters to achieve Nvidia-like returns. In this case, the company\u2019s Q2 net loss was $21.9 million. SOUN AI has been a bit rocky for investors, as it\u2019s down by over 20% over the past year. However, shares have almost doubled YTD.\u00a0\nThe stock\u2019s big advantage for shareholders is the company\u2019s $600 million market cap. The stock previously traded at over $13 per share but currently down to roughly $2.50 per share. A return to $13 per share would result in a gain higher than Nvidia\u2019s 5-year 613% gain.\nThe company\u2019s strong partnerships, solid revenue growth, and declining losses make this AI stock a contender for high long-term returns.\nSymbotic (SYM)\nSource: Shutterstock\nSymbotic\u00a0(NASDAQ:SYM) is a bit larger than SoundHound AI due to its $23 billion market cap. However, shares have outperformed Nvidia YTD which automatically warrants a closer look.\nSYM offers autonomous robots that perform tasks in warehouse settings. The company has a significant partnership\u00a0with\u00a0Walmart\u00a0(NYSE:WMT). The robot producer has a $23 billion order backlog and $513 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities.\u00a0\nSymbotic has good top-line growth but shows room for improvement in its bottom line. The company reported $312 million in Q3 revenue, marking a 77.6% YOY increase. The company\u2019s adjusted EBITDA loss plunged from $22 million to $3 million in the quarter, indicating a significant improvement. SOUN expects an adjusted EBITDA between $0 and $3 million next quarter, as well as revenue between $290 million and $310 million.\u00a0\nThe supply chain industry\u2019s value exceeds $1 trillion, and Symbotic is poised to capitalize on that opportunity. It already works with well-known brands for e-commerce fulfillment and distribution centers.\nSymbotic has already outperformed Nvidia stock over the past year as well as the past six months, making it an enticing choice for long-term investors.\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR)\nSource: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.com\nPalantir Technologies\u00a0(NYSE:PLTR) specializes in big data analytics, with its stock gaining 137% YTD and a $32 billion market cap.\nThat market value may cause a challenge for the company to generate a 613% return over the next five years. However, its revenue and earning numbers are impressive. Although revenue growth has slowed down lately, it still displays double-digit gains.\u00a0\nIn the\u00a0second quarter, Palantir reported $533 million in revenue, representing 13% YOY growth. More importantly, the firm generated a GAAP net income of $28 million, marking the company\u2019s third consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability.\nAccelerating profits leads to better profit margins which can strengthen a stock\u2019s valuation. The firm has many government contracts, but the firm also experienced a 35% YOY growth in U.S. commercial consumers.\nThe valuation still isn\u2019t the best, with the stock currently trading at a 65-forward P/E ratio. However, the 1.13 PEG ratio makes the stock look more enticing. If the company can continue to achieve higher net income milestones, the forward P/E can become more manageable for new investors.\u00a0\nOn the date of publication, Marc Guberti did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Some people\u2019s capacity to turn brilliant ideas into reality, create life-saving medicines and advancements in technology, art, science, and finance that foster the wellbeing and betterment of present and future generations \u2014 it\u2019s staggering.\nThen again\u2026 it took 70 years since fitted sheets were invented in 1959 for someone to figure out that sewing a \u201ctop\u201d and \u201cside\u201d label onto said sheets would save both the time and sanity of bed makers everywhere.\nWhich is to say, sometimes we get it really right, with shocking speed. And other times, we continue doing the old thing, even though it\u2019s causing more harm than good, until a lightbulb goes off and there\u2019s a better way staring us right in the face.\nTake, for example, \u201cfundamental\u201d market analysis, which asserts that price trends are driven by the tenor of news events. Positive news causes prices to rise, while negative news begets declines.\nThis strategy has endured since the time of Buttonwood trees, persisting as the go-to model for navigating markets. But often, traders and investors using \u201cfundamentals\u201d end up as frustrated as we used to get trying to put the old, unlabeled fitted sheets onto a bed.\nThey think they\u2019ve secured a corner of the market with a headline news event, only for prices to move the opposite way, causing the proverbial \u201cfitted sheet\u201d (i.e., trading plan) to fling off and hit them across the cheek. Or, as is the case for one of the world tech leaders NVIDIA Corp. (Nasdaq: NVDA). When the tech company soared to record highs on August 29, mainstream experts cited one catalyzing event: A.I. fervor.\nThat explanation certainly fits, but it\u2019s not complete. It\u2019s limited in scope to the time when A.I. enthusiasm went from \u201chuh, does this thing really have legs?\u201d to \u201coh it not only has legs, but it\u2019s taking off running!\u201d \u2014 also known as the day Chat GPT debuted on November 30, 2022.\nBut NVDA enjoyed a neck-craning rally \u2014 from $35 in 2019 to over $329 per share on Nov. 14, 2021 \u2014 long before Chat GPT went live. In turn, the A.I. fervor fire is only half the story.\nWhich is where Elliott wave analysis comes in to provide the full picture.\nHere, we look at the February 21\u00a0Trader\u2019s Classroom, where editor Robert Kelley showed a bearish wave count for NVDA. However, unlike \u201cfundamentals,\u201d which works linearly from point A (news event) to point B (price move), Elliott wave analysis works spatially to see all possible scenarios for price action. In Robert\u2019s words from the February 21\u00a0Trader\u2019s Classroom:\n\u201cNow what if this isn\u2019t right. I always like to ask myself, \u2018Where am I wrong?\u2019\n\u201cWhat would be the alternate count? This is a corrective decline and NVDA has made a big low. If this is the case, 195.48 would be good support. If it holds there, this would turn the picture bullish and NVDA is headed to new highs.\u201d\n\nNVDA did hold the 195 level and turned up in an unstoppable rally. On April 20,\u00a0Trader\u2019s Classroom\u00a0revisited the stock and said the runway for further strength was clear:\n\u201cI\u2019m picking this stock because it has, right now, the 7th largest market cap in the world. It\u2019s got impact on the indexes, it\u2019s very liquid, it moves and in the long term, it\u2019s been going up and tracing out some nice Elliott wave patterns here. So, maybe we can put our craft to use here.\n\u201cPrices should not get below 251. We\u2019ve got four, 1-2\u2019s here, so if you buy into this wave count, the implication is NVDA is going to see 4 and 5\u2019s to the upside and this stock is going to be in an uptrend for quite some time.\u201d\n\nRobert also showed this longer-term chart of NVDA and said:\n\u201cThe long-term on NVDA is bullish. I think there\u2019s some kind of pullback that\u2019s likely to happen, so I\u2019d wait for some kind of reaction on the downside before jumping in on this.\u201d\n\nPrices dropped into April 25 but then reclaimed the upside to record highs on August 29. On Sept. 6, Barron\u2019s uttered the name that shall not be spoken regarding NVDA:\n\u201cNvidia Stock\u2019s Blockbuster Gain Is a \u2018Big Market Delusion.\u2019 Artificial intelligence is a\u00a0bubble\u00a0waiting to pop.\nIf we know anything about bubbles, it\u2019s that knowing one exists doesn\u2019t make it easier to predict when it\u2019s going to end. Only a clear, objective understanding of the wave patterns underway on the price charts of the market\u2019s propped up by said bubbles, can.\nOf course, not all Elliott wave interpretations of price action turn out to be right. But, as these two\u00a0Trader\u2019s Classroom\u00a0lessons on NVDA show, Elliott analysis can identify the critical price levels that minimize risk every step of the way.\nSo click here if you\u2019re not a robot and proceed to change the way you navigate the world\u2019s leading markets.\nTrading Lessons (Plus, Market Opportunities): 2 for 1\n3 times a week, press \u201cPlay\u201d and watch the instructor Robert Kelley explain in comprehensive detail how to recognize the relevant Elliott wave patterns (and supporting technical indicators) underway now and in the future.\nThis is every\u00a0Trader\u2019s Classroom\u00a0video in a nutshell: a lesson, often with a new opportunity.\nHere\u2019s how to watch the latest lessons now.\nChat GBT applications.

Its shares have surged approximately 230% this year, a remarkable feat in this uncertain market. \nAmong the high-growth, high-momentum tech stocks out there, Nvidia is probably the most divisive. There are staunch long-term bulls that are unlikely to sell this stock at any price. There are value investors who may look at Nvidia\u2019s valuation and get vertigo.\nThen there are traders and momentum investors in the middle looking to ride waves higher and lower.\nI think right now, NVDA stock is one to be traded, and it\u2019s a difficult one to hold a long or short position on. Here\u2019s why I think investors may want to be careful taking a position on Nvidia (on either side).\nThe Debate About NVDA Stock\nNvidia, a closely watched stock, attracts both bullish and bearish viewpoints on its future direction. The bullish case for NVDA, though somewhat fueled by hype, primarily rests on solid ground. \nThe company\u2019s dominance in producing GPUs for AI applications was evident in its recent earnings report.\nThe company seems set for a swift rebound, driven by strong AI demand even as non-AI chip usage remains subdued. If non-AI business also revives, as some analysts predict, earnings growth could surge significantly soon, potentially supporting further price increases for NVDA.\nHowever, bearish perspectives present a compelling case too. They argue that Nvidia\u2019s valuation (50.8-times forward earnings) already incorporates substantial AI-driven growth, leaving shares susceptible to a significant correction when the \u201cAI bubble\u201d eventually deflates. \nAs with all economic bubbles, it\u2019s not a matter of \u201cif\u201d but \u201cwhen\u201d it bursts.\nThe Bull Case\nNvidia\u2019s breakthrough comes with artificial intelligence. Building AI models demands processing enormous data, causing the most potent tools: graphics processing units (GPUs). \nNvidia produces top-tier GPUs, and companies setting up AI-driven data centers acquire thousands of these GPUs to amplify their capabilities.\nNvidia stands to gain from the AI competition, being a primary choice for clients initiating AI capability because of its GPUs. \nThe fiscal 2024 second quarter was strong, but the third quarter looks even better, with an expected revenue of around $16 billion, marking a 170% year-over-year growth. Nvidia can command premium prices for its high-demand products, significantly boosting its gross profit margins.\nThe Bear Case\nThe key question is the longevity of AI-driven demand. Nvidia experienced demand and subsequent decline in GPU mining for cryptocurrencies. \nAI appears more enduring, but it\u2019s uncertain how many data centers are needed. Once a company builds an AI-powered data center, will it build more? \nThe answers are elusive because the full impact of AI on businesses remains uncertain. While it could be transformative, some customers may be content with their existing supercomputing infrastructure.\nThe timeline for AI demand\u2019s sustainability remains uncertain. While caution is warranted, don\u2019t underestimate the potential for a paradigm shift. \nFor investors, prudence is key. Nvidia\u2019s future revenue trajectory post-initial AI demand is uncertain. Diversify your portfolio to manage risk and capture potential gains. It\u2019s wise to secure profits while preserving the upside. \nNvidia\u2019s market role is intriguing, but requires vigilant monitoring because of its unpredictability.\nThe Bottom Line on NDVA Stock\nIf AI enthusiasm persists this summer, NVDA might face challenges surpassing its current price levels in a bearish market. A less risk-seeking stock market may not enthusiastically \u201cbuy on the rumor, buy more on the news\u201d during Nvidia\u2019s late-summer earnings report, potentially leading to subdued post-earnings performance.\nThe stock might stabilize at current prices as the company aligns with its valuation. In a less risk-tolerant market, Nvidia could face downward pressure, lowering its price. \nIn summary, Nvidia has outsized growth potential, but comes with a caveat. For its rally to persist, market sentiment must remain stable post-Fed interest rate decision, following the initial boost from the secular growth trend.\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTechnology, Artificial Intelligence, Semiconductor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2023/09/nvidia-stock-outlook-the-bull-case-vs-the-bear-case/.\n\u00a92025 InvestorPlace Media, LLC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored Headlines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMore from InvestorPlace\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHot Stocks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Top Stocks to Buy Under Trump Come From Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018BRAIN\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Luke Lango, InvestorPlace Senior Investment Analyst\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Danger that Could Derail Our Economy\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Jeff Remsburg, Contributing Editor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy Prediction Came True: Where to Find Opportunity Despite Market Unpredictability\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Eric Fry, Editor, Fry's Investment Report\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMost Popular\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 10, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBig Tech\u2019s Quantum War Has Begun \u2014 and One Tiny Stock Could Win It\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 5, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat to Make of the Weakening Economy and Trade War\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInvestors Applaud a Cool Inflation Print\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow to Escape the \u2018Tyranny of the Immediate\u2019 in Investing\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExpert Stock Picks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe System Flagging a Potential 50X Opportunity\u2026 Even in This Ugly Market\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAbout InvestorPlace\nProducts\nContact Us\nHelp\nCareers\nAdvertise With Us\nDisclosures & Disclaimers\nPrivacy Policy\nAd Choices\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\nCookie Policy\nCookie Preferences\nTerms of Use\nDMCA Policy\n All rights reserved.

according to Rebellion Research.\n\n\n                                  Reuters/Cris Toala Olivares\n                                 \n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's stock price has become a bubble, according to Rebellion Research.\nShares could soon crash like 17th-century tulips or 1990s dot-com companies did, the think tank said.\nThe semiconductor giant has soared 180% this year, thanks to the rise of generative AI.\nNvidia's stock has soared so high this year that the semiconductor giant now trades at a bubble-level valuation reminiscent of 17th-century tulips and late-1990s dot-com companies, according to Rebellion Research.\n\n\nShares have jumped 180% to $410, but the think tank said earlier this month that the stock is now hugely overvalued and could crash at any time.\n\"Historically, financial markets have witnessed numerous asset bubbles, from the tulip mania in the 17th century to the more recent dot-com bubble in the late 1990s and early 2000s,\" Rebellion analysts wrote.\n\n\n\"Nvidia's recent stock performance, driven by the enthusiasm surrounding generative AI and soaring earnings, seems to exhibit many characteristics of such speculative bubbles,\" they added. \"We think Nvidia is a great company \u2026 however, just maybe at $300 a share.\"\nGenerative AI programs like ChatGPT run on high-powered, specialized graphics processing units (GPUs) \u2013 and Nvidia has a lion-sized share of that market.\nIt's posted back-to-back stellar quarterly earnings report that showed demand for its products has surged thanks to the AI craze, and investors have responded by loading up on shares.\u00a0\n\n\nThat's pushed Nvidia to a trillion-dollar valuation and establish it as a member of the mega-cap \"Magnificent Seven\" group of Big Tech firms.\nBut it remains to be seen how \"practical and profitable\" AI can be and that makes Nvidia's stock vulnerable at its current price, according to Rebellion.\nThe company also looks overvalued at its current price-to-earnings ratio and could struggle if the Federal Reserve ends up holding interest rates at a higher level for longer to combat inflation, strategists warned.\n\n\n\"With historical price-to-earnings ratios as a reference and the looming shift in monetary policy, investors should tread with caution,\" they said. \"Like every bubble that has come before, the factors leading to its rise often sow the seeds of its eventual burst.\"\nRebellion, which uses probability models to generate market predictions, compared the chipmaker's valuation to several high-profile bubbles from the past 400 years.\nThose included the Dutch tulip boom of the 1630s \u2013 when contract prices for tulip bulbs skyrocketed, creating what's been called the first speculative financial bubble \u2013 as

A blog called \u201cThe Mad King\u201d released a treatise claiming that the tech darling has inflated its demand figures and provided misleading information regarding its graphic processing units (GPUs).\nA social media outcry quickly ensued as retail investors and experts alike rushed to look into this allegation. The news didn\u2019t directly impact NVDA stock, but it certainly led to some heavy speculation regarding how accurate its growth prospects really are.\nExperts have spoken out against The Mad King\u2019s claims, dismissing them as inaccurate. Bernstein Senior Analyst Stacy Rasgon has helped lead this charge, making the case that investors shouldn\u2019t short NVDA stock, regardless of how much attention these \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d are attracting. But as it turns out, a few days after the report went live, Nvidia addressed one of the topics it centers around.\n\nWhat\u2019s Happening With NVDA Stock\nIt\u2019s true that this week isn\u2019t off to a good start for NVDA stock. As of this writing, shares are down 2% for the day, continuing the volatility that they experienced last week. However, this can likely be attributed to negative market momentum. Most tech stocks are struggling today, and the ones that are in the green aren\u2019t up by a lot.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that the claims against Nvidia aren\u2019t worth discussing, especially as the company has recently addressed them. As InvestorPlace reported:\n\u201cThe report discusses a company called Coreweave, named as an Nvidia client responsible for many GPU orders. The post cites multiple X/Twitter posts that allege suspicious activity between the two companies \u2014 on the grounds that Coreweave has taken loans from\u00a0BlackRock\u00a0(NYSE:BLK), one of Nvidia\u2019s\u00a0top shareholders.\u201d\nLast week, Colette Kress, Nvidia\u2019s executive vice president and CFO, spoke at Citi\u2019s 2023 Global Technology Conference. She praised Coreweave\u2019s speed of adoption, noting that Nvidia has a \u201cvery small, minority passive investment\u201d in the company. Kress added, though, that Coreweave has worked with many other big tech firms. \u201cThey did have some allocation, but again, it\u2019s very small,\u201d she stated.\nKiress seems to be implying that Coreweave\u2019s contributions to Nvdia\u2019s GPU sales are too small to be significant. If that is the case, it would certainly disprove what The Mad King has argued. Her take is certainly similar to what Rasgon argued. In a note to clients, the analyst wrote that Nvidia didn\u2019t need the help of Coreweave or any other customer to \u201cjuice the quarter,\u201d citing its impressive results.\nWhy It Matters\nAs of now, it is increasingly looking like the Mad King\u2019s theories don\u2019t hold water. If that\u2019s true, this social media fad will quickly blow over and won\u2019t impact NVDA stock in the long or short term. The accusations made in the report are severe and if proven correctly, they would have implications that span far beyond the company at fault.\nBut more and more evidence is suggesting that Coreweave is not as closely linked to Nvidia as the conspiracy theorists supporting it seem to believe. If any evidence is found to support these claims, regulators will likely step in. But until then, investors shouldn\u2019t assume there is any reason to bet against the year\u2019s breakout stock.\nOn the date of publication, Samuel O\u2019Brient did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The acquisition would have created the \"world's premier computing company for the age of artificial intelligence,\" according to Nvidia. Regulators ultimately quashed the deal, and the companies terminated their efforts in early 2022.\u00a0\nThat wasn't to be the end of the story, however, and the next chapter in this tale is about to commence. Arm Holdings recently filed an F-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the first step in its bid for an initial public offering (IPO).\nIn an amended F-1 filing, which dropped on Sept. 5, Arm Holdings provided additional details to investors that suggest its public debut could be the biggest IPO of 2023.\u00a0\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe numbers tell a tale\nLike many companies in the technology sector, Arm has suffered from the macroeconomic headwinds that prevailed over the past year. For the fiscal year ended March 31, Arm generated revenue of $2.7 billion, which declined 1% year over year, resulting in net income of $524 million, down 5%.\u00a0\nWhile that was a respectable performance given the difficult environment, it pales in comparison to its prior-year performance, when revenue grew 33% and net income jumped 42%.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nArm's struggle to return to growth continues. For the quarter ended June 30, the company reported revenue of $675 million, down 2% year over year. Profits took an even bigger hit, as net income of $105 million slumped 53%. This illustrates that Arm has yet to overcome the broader economic headwinds that have buffeted many in the technology industry. Perhaps more importantly, the company has yet to fully tap into the increasing demand for AI processors.\nCan Arm be the next Nvidia?\nThere was no doubt that Arm's return to the public markets would be a grand affair. Softbank took the chipmaker private in late 2016 for $32 billion. Now, the company is looking to cash in on its investment.\u00a0\nArm revealed it's looking to issue 95.5 million American depositary shares, priced in a range of $47 to $51, though that could change based on investor demand. With just over 1 billion shares outstanding, this would value Arm Holdings between $48 billion and $52 billion, depending on the final issue price. In light of its most recent results, these are lofty ambitions, indeed.\nIf it achieves the valuation it's seeking, Arm won't be valued as richly as Nvidia, but it could still fetch a hefty premium. The company hopes to be valued at between 92 and 99 times its trailing-12-month earnings. For context, Nvidia stock is currently selling for 114 times earnings, though this is an apples-to-oranges comparison. \n\n\n\n\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended July 30), Nvidia delivered revenue of $13.5 billion, up 101% year over year (and 88% sequentially), resulting in net income of $6.2 billion, up 843%.\nSo, while Nvidia's results suggest it deserves a lofty premium, Arm's recent performance doesn't show nearly as much promise.\n\nRiding the AI train?\nIt's clear that Arm hopes to ride the wave of excitement surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), as the company mentioned AI 44 times in its regulatory filing. \"Arm CPUs already run AI and [machine learning] workloads in billions of devices, including smartphones, cameras, digital TVs, cars and cloud data centers,\" it said.\u00a0\nHowever, for all the references, its financial results suggest that its CPUs aren't as central to the processing of AI as Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) and, therefore, may not have as much to gain. It's important to note that Nvidia and others integrate Arm's components and blueprints into their processors, which could generate additional growth -- though it hasn't happened yet.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be clear, Arm's processors are pervasive, found in 99% of the world's smartphones and a host of other devices, but that doesn't necessarily translate into a clear benefit for the company from AI. Arm's chips are extremely power efficient, so the company's angle is to convince other chipmakers to integrate its technology into their own rather than reinventing the wheel.\u00a0\nAs a result, some of the world's most notable tech companies -- and Arm customers -- are expressing interest in the company's public debut. The filing noted that Advanced Micro Devices, Apple, Alphabet's\u00a0Google, Intel, and Nvidia -- among others -- plan to purchase as much as $735 million in Arm shares, though they're not committed to following through on that interest.\u00a0\nWhile Arm stock may be in high demand when it goes public, individual investors should exercise caution. Its IPO could well end up being the biggest IPO of the year, but the price seems a bit steep for a company with tepid results.\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

However, a recent development on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, has thrust NVDA stock into the spotlight in an entirely new way.\nMore specifically, an anonymous stock market blogger who refers to themself only as \u201cThe Mad King\u201d has laid out a conspiracy theory regarding NVDA stock. They argue that the graphics processing unit (GPU) sales that rocketed Nvidia to a trillion dollar market capitalization this year were inflated.\nIf that were true, it would certainly have industry-wide implications. But as it turns out, evidence points to the contrary.\nNVDA Stock: Red Flags or Just Smoke?\nThe Mad King\u2019s post on NVDA stock is titled \u201cNvidia \u2014 The Red Flags.\u201d Without revealing their identity, the author does issue a disclaimer in their post: \u201cThe information provided here is for informational purposes only and should not be considered as financial advice.\u201d That suggests they aren\u2019t a registered financial advisor. Instead, they are more likely someone who pays close attention to market trends and is concerned about Nvidia\u2019s growth prospects.\nOf course, there\u2019s certainly an argument to be made that NVDA stock isn\u2019t a buy right now. InvestorPlace\u2019s\u00a0Thomas Yeung recently compared Nvidia to Bitcoin (BTC-USD), arguing that a large-scale bet on either won\u2019t end well for investors. Yeung also raised concerns regarding the company\u2019s valuation and financials:\n\u201cConsider valuation. Today, Nvidia\u2019s $1.13 trillion valuation represents a 240X multiple of trailing earnings, making it the most expensive tech stock based on normalized figures. Even if the chipmaker raises its net income 8X from $4.37 billion to $37.96 billion by fiscal 2026, the company would have to keep increasing that figure by 7.3% per year for the next two decades to justify its current share price of $470.\u201d\nThese are valid concerns, especially given how much share prices have surged this year. However, the \u201cred flags\u201d that The Mad King sees with NVDA stock center around concerns that demand for Nvidia\u2019s GPUs isn\u2019t actually as high as experts seem to think.\nThe report discusses a company called Coreweave, named as an Nvidia client responsible for many GPU orders. The post cites multiple X/Twitter posts that allege suspicious activity between the two companies \u2014 on the grounds that Coreweave has taken loans from BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), one of Nvidia\u2019s top shareholders.\nReasons Not to Short Nvidia\nThat might sound like some questionable activity at first glance. But Rasgon easily debunked these claims in his note, digging into what he recognized as a conspiracy theory. The analyst wrote, per MarketWatch:\n\u201cBeyond somewhat hilariously confusing \u2018Blackstone\u2019 with \u2018Blackrock\u2019 during the process, this is also nonsense [\u2026] Nvidia did not need help from Coreweave (or anyone) to juice the quarter (their products are all on allocation), and the debt facility was announced Aug. 3 (after the quarter was completed) with the release suggesting deployment has likely not happened yet.\u201d\nAs noted in the report\u2019s title, Rasgon makes it clear that social media hearsay isn\u2019t a reason to bet against a company like Nvidia. The analyst maintains a highly bullish price target of $675 on shares as well as a \u201cbuy\u201d rating.\nRasgon isn\u2019t the only one, either. On TipRanks, 40 Wall Street analysts currently rate NVDA stock as a consensus strong buy, with only one hold rating. The average price target of $636.62 still represents significant upside as well, given the current per share price of around $462. All this suggests that the theories being floated on X/Twitter are just that \u2014 and shouldn\u2019t be taken as a reason to short NVDA.\nOn the date of publication, Samuel O\u2019Brient did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Your story is so inspiring it will continue to inspire people at Denny\u2019s,\u201d Valade said, as she presented the plaque to Huang.\n\u201cDenny\u2019s has taught me so many lessons,\u201d Huang said.\nBoth CEOs got their start working in diners. Valade got her first job as a waitress at a diner when she was 16. Huang got his first job at Denny\u2019s in Portland when he was 15.\n\u201cI was a dishwasher, I was a busboy, I waited tables,\u201d Huang said. \u201cNo one can carry more coffee cups than I can.\u201d\nTo fuel even more great ideas, Valade announced the Denny\u2019s Trillion-Dollar Incubator Contest \u2014 offering $25,000 in seed money for the next $1 trillion idea.\nThe contest is open to anyone with a creative and innovative idea that could impact the world. The only catch? The idea must originate \u2014 like NVIDIA \u2014 in a Denny\u2019s booth.\nNVIDIA, the leading accelerated computing and AI company, got its start at the 24-hour diner chain known for favorites such as its signature Grand Slam breakfast combo.\nIn 1993, three friends \u2014 Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem \u2014 met at Denny\u2019s to discuss creating a chip that would enable realistic 3D graphics on personal computers.\nThe Denny\u2019s just off a busy thoroughfare in the heart of Silicon Valley was the perfect place to start a business, said Huang, who lived nearby at the time with his wife and kids.\n\u201cIt had all the coffee you could drink and no one could chase you out,\u201d Huang told Valade.\nTuesday\u2019s event took place in a corner of the bustling restaurant \u2014 one of the most popular Denny\u2019s locations in Northern California \u2014 as families, retirees and workers coming off the night shift piled in for plates piled high with eggs and pancakes, sausage and bacon.\nHuang was among them, starting the day with a meeting where he and his table polished off a Lumberjack Slam, Moons Over My Hammy and a Super Bird sandwich \u2014 washed down with plenty of coffee.\u00a0 \n\nHuang, whose family immigrated to the United States from Taiwan when he was a child, told Valade he had his first hamburger at Denny\u2019s and his first milkshake.\n\u201cWe make the best pancakes here,\u201d Huang said.\n\u201cI love how you still say \u2018we,\u2019\u201d Valade said.\n\u201cMade fresh every day,\u201d Huang added with a grin.\nValade and Huang said Denny\u2019s can be a great launching pad, not just for great ideas, but for great careers.\n\u201cStart your first job in the restaurant business,\u201d Huang said. \u201cIt teaches you humility, it teaches you hard work, it teaches you hospitality.\u201d\nValade agreed wholeheartedly. After talking shop with Huang, she checked in with diners like Alfred, who was tucking into a stack of pancakes amid the morning rush.\nFor people across Silicon Valley, it\u2019s the place to be. \u201cI come here every day,\u201d the retired roofer said.\nFull contest details for the Denny\u2019s Trillion Dollar Incubator Contest can be found at www.dennys.com/trilliondollarincubator. Contestants can submit their ideas online or at a Denny\u2019s restaurant by Nov. 21 at 8:59 a.m. The winner will be announced early next year.\n\u00a0\nImage credit: Don Feria/AP Images for Denny\u2019s\n\n\nCategories: Corporate \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We are supporting Arm by investing in its IPO,\u2019 a spokesperson says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has confirmed that it plans to invest in Arm\u2019s initial public offering after the GPU giant was named as a potential \u201ccornerstone investor\u201d by the British chip designer.\n\u201cArm architecture is important to Nvidia\u2019s products and our ecosystem. We are supporting Arm by investing in its IPO,\u201d an Nvidia spokesperson said in a late Wednesday statement to CRN.\n[Related: Arm IPO\u2019s 10 Confirmed And Potential Investors: Why Apple, Intel And Nvidia Are Among Them]\n\n\nid\nunit-1659132512259\n\n\ntype\nSponsored post\n\n\nIn an updated IPO filing on Tuesday, the chip designer named Nvidia among nine other cornerstone investors that have \u201cindicated an interest in purchasing up to an aggregate of $735 million\u201d of Arm\u2019s shares in the upcoming offering, which could reportedly happen next week. However, Arm cautioned that \u201cthese indications of interest are not binding agreements or commitments.\u201d\nOnly one other investor, Intel, has publicly confirmed so far that it will participate in Arm\u2019s IPO.\n\u201cThis morning, we announced that we are an investor in Arm,\u201d said Stuart Pann, senior vice president and general manager of Intel\u2019s contract chip manufacturing business, at a Tuesday event.\nArm\u2019s Potential Investors A Who\u2019s Who In The Tech World\nThe other cornerstone investors named by Arm are AMD, Apple, Google, Samsung Electronics, TSMC, Cadence Design Systems, MediaTek and Synopsys. While AMD declined to comment, the other companies did not respond to requests for comment.\nBob O\u2019Donnell, president and chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research, said the investment interest by several major tech and semiconductor companies reflects the \u201cabsolutely critical importance of Arm and its continued strong existence and development.\u201d\n\u201cArm has played this absolutely foundational role in the tech business but in a pretty much invisible way to most of the outside world for a very long time,\u201d O\u2019Donnell told CRN recently.\nFor the IPO, Arm said it will seek a valuation of up to $52 billion when it lists under the \u201cARM\u201d ticket on Nasdaq. The company plans to offer 95.5 million American depository shares in the range of $47 to $51 apiece. Its current owner, Japanese investment giant SoftBank Group, plans to own roughly 90 percent of Arm\u2019s shares following the IPO, according to the filing.\nNvidia\u2019s IPO Investment Plan Comes After Failed Arm Deal\nNvidia previously tried to acquire Arm for $40 billion in a deal announced back in 2020, but the company\u2019s plan fell through in early 2022 after facing significant regulatory opposition over concerns that it would unfairly use its ownership of Arm\u2019s technology to harm competitors.\n\u201cThe reason why people were concerned with Nvidia\u2019s potential purchase is they didn\u2019t want that control to go to one place. [Arm] really is sort of the Switzerland of tech, and everybody wanted it to continue to be the Switzerland of tech, because they wanted it to be a neutral place where everybody could go,\u201d said O\u2019Donnell.\nDespite the significant setback, Nvidia has remained resolute in supporting the Arm architecture and building products around it. Even before the acquisition attempt, Nvidia had spent several years building system-on-chips with Arm processor cores for embedded devices, and it has since expanded those efforts to supporting and building Arm-based CPUs for high-performance computing systems.\nNvidia\u2019s highest-profile Arm product to date is Grace, a 72-core CPU that will go inside the upcoming Grace and Grace Hopper Superchips. The former product brings together two Grace CPUs while the latter combines a Grace CPU with an Hopper H100 data center GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

What's Happening to the Leader of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Revolution?\n\n\n  \n      By Keith Noonan\n  \n  \u2013\n  \n    \n      Sep 15, 2023 at 5:27AM\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been selling the company's stock this month. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move could attract scrutiny due to Nvidia's importance in the AI space and valuation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the CEO's recent stock sales aren't concerning in the context of his much larger ownership position. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$2.9T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(-2.53%)\u00a0-$3.02\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$116.51\n\n\nPrice as of March 18, 2025, 3:18 p.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's CEO is selling shares again. Is it time for investors to panic?\n\nNvidia's (NVDA -2.53%) co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang has been selling shares of his company's stock lately. Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) showed that he sold 59,376 shares across daily trading sessions on Sept. 12 and 13. All told, the executive's company stock sales on those days totaled up to $26.9 million.\u00a0\nNotably, it wasn't the first time that Huang unloaded Nvidia shares this month. Last week, the CEO sold roughly $42 million worth of stock after exercising options on the shares. The graphics processing unit (GPU) leader is undoubtedly at the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, but its chief executive's recent moves could raise red flags in the eyes of some investors.\u00a0\nAfter Nvidia's stock soared roughly 213% year to date, are Huang's recent moves a sign that Nvidia is in danger of running out of steam?\n\nWhy some investors might worry about Huang's move\nInvestors understandably get skittish when they see that a company's CEO is unloading shares. Rightly or wrongly, it's often interpreted as a lack of confidence in future performance. And more so than any other company in the world, Nvidia is under the microscope right now.\u00a0\nInvestors are wondering whether AI stocks are in a bubble or still in the very early stages of a much more substantial long-term bull run. It's not surprising that the processing leader has become a battleground stock. Performance expectations are sky-high.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia published its second-quarter report roughly three weeks ago and delivered virtually unprecedented sales and earnings beats. While the average Wall Street analyst target guided for earnings per share of $2.09 on sales of $11.22 billion, the AI leader blew the doors off those targets and posted per-share earnings of $2.70 on sales of $13.51 billion.\nMaking the historical quarterly beat even better, the company guided for revenue of approximately $16 billion in the current quarterly period. This far eclipsed the average analyst estimate's forecast for sales of $12.61 billion. \nYet despite the incredible performance, Nvidia's stock is now down more than 3% since its Q2 earnings release.\n\nNVDA data by YCharts\n\n\n\n\n\nWith lingering concerns about inflation and interest rates, fears of a potential recession somewhere on the horizon, and rising bond yields, there are a variety of macroeconomic factors that could weigh on Nvidia's stock performance in the near term. Adding another layer of bearish complexity, tensions remain high between the U.S. and China.\u00a0\nGiven all of those dynamics, it might be tempting to interpret Huang's recent stock sales as yet another bearish signal. But the CEO's moves hardly look concerning when placed in context.\u00a0\nDon't sweat the small stuff\nWhile Huang's stock sales might seem alarming at first glance, it's important to put them in context. Nvidia's most recent DEF-14A filings, which break down insider and institutional ownership stock holdings, help show why the average shareholder probably shouldn't be concerned about the CEO's latest moves.\nNvidia's last comprehensive stock ownership document was filed with the SEC on May 8 and reflected holdings on April 3. As of the second date, Huang owned 86,878,193 shares of company stock -- giving him a 3.5% ownership stake in the company and making him the largest individual shareholder.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor comparison, Vanguard, BlackRock, and Fidelity Investments owned 8.3%, 7.3%, and 5.6% of the company's shares, respectively. These are massive investment companies that manage trillions of dollars in assets, while Huang is a single shareholder.\nHuang's recent combined stock sales don't even come close to approaching 1% of his total holdings in the company. Additionally, because the stock sold was originated through options granted as part of his executive compensation plan, his total shares owned didn't decrease.\u00a0\nIn short, Huang's recent stock sales amount to little more than a blip on the radar. Even after selling shares this month, Nvidia's CEO remains heavily invested in the business.\u00a0He still has plenty of skin in the game, and his heavy insider ownership position should continue to incentivize him to pursue actions and strategies that work to the benefit of the broader shareholder base.\u00a0\nThere are many reasons why a CEO might sell company shares. Insider selling is worth monitoring, but Nvidia shareholders should keep their eyes on the big picture and avoid reading too much into what amounts to a relatively small move from Huang.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeith Noonan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Phantom Liberty is a new spy-thriller adventure for Cyberpunk 2077. When the orbital shuttle of the President of the New United States of America is shot down over the deadliest district of Night City, there\u2019s only one person who can save her \u2014 you. Become V, a cyberpunk for hire, and dive deep into a tangled web of espionage and political intrigue, unraveling a story that connects the highest echelons of power with the brutal world of black-market mercenaries.\nWitness the power of full ray tracing and DLSS 3.5 in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty for yourself in our new, exclusive Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty RTX Technology Video:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Thanks to DLSS 3.5\u2019s smart technology, fuelled by AI rendering power, you can experience Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty\u2019s newest location Dogtown at its very best \u2014 with sharper images, more accurate lighting, and the highest frame rates possible.\" - Jakub Knapik, VP of Art, Global Art Director, CD PROJEKT RED\nReturn to the neon lights of Night City in Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s 2.0 update available today, featuring support for NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 and its new Ray Reconstruction technology, enhancing the quality of full ray tracing in Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrank Ray Tracing Up To Overdrive \nBoth Cyberpunk 2077 and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty feature full ray tracing in the technology preview for the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode. Full ray tracing, also known as path tracing, accurately simulates light throughout an entire scene. It is used by visual effects artists to create film and TV graphics that are indistinguishable from reality, but until the arrival of GeForce RTX GPUs with RT Cores, and the AI-powered acceleration of NVIDIA DLSS, real-time video game full ray tracing was impossible because it is extremely GPU intensive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor even more info on the making of Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, check out our interview with CD PROJEKT RED\nPrevious techniques separately addressed ray-traced shadows, reflections and global illumination for a small number of light sources. Full ray tracing models the properties of light from a virtually unlimited number of emissive sources, delivering physically correct shadows, reflections and global illumination on all objects.\nOne of the most impactful additions in the technology preview of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode is NVIDIA RTX Direct Illumination (RTXDI), a free SDK that enables developers to closely replicate the appearance of light in scenes with numerous light sources. With RTXDI, thousands of objects can emit ray-traced light.\nIn Cyberpunk 2077, each neon sign, street lamp, LED billboard, car headlight, and other source of light is now ray-traced, bathing objects, walls, passing cars and pedestrians in accurate lighting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull ray tracing helps with grounding objects within their surroundings. Click here to view the comparison in 4K\nWith full ray tracing and RTXDI, now practically all light sources cast physically correct soft shadows, a feat previously unimaginable using previous approaches. Players will experience enhanced shadowing, with better depth, detail and realism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matter how geometrically complex a scene gets, pipes, rails, staircases, and other objects will now get proper shadows from all the shadow casting lights in their vicinity. Click here to view the comparison in 4K\nCyberpunk 2077 features a full day-night cycle. To upgrade indirect lighting from all emissive sources, including the sun and moon, Global Illumination (GI) needed to be path traced, too. Rendering techniques including Screen Space Reflections, Screen Space Ambient Occlusion, and the existing GI solutions were replaced by a single unified algorithm that delivers more accurate lighting of scenes and objects.\nWith the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode enabled, natural colored lighting bounces multiple times throughout Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s world, creating more realistic indirect lighting and occlusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sunlight bounces off the floor to indirectly light a cardboard stack for more realistic lighting and occlusion. Click here to view the comparison in 4K\nReflections now incorporate bounced detail, too, and are rendered at full resolution, accentuating the cyberpunk aesthetic and further heightening immersion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull ray tracing helps to balance the diffuse and specular response of materials to the light, resulting in even more realistic reflections. Click here to view the comparison in 4K\nCombined, the full ray tracing of direct and global illumination give gamers the most advanced real-time lighting seen to date in gaming, and a preview of how all games will look in the future.\nFull ray tracing in Cyberpunk 2077 and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is extremely GPU intensive. For the ultimate experience we recommend GeForce RTX 40 Series and NVIDIA DLSS 3.5. Read on for more details.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077 Upgrades To DLSS 3.5\nDLSS 3.5 is available now in Cyberpunk 2077 with the game\u2019s 2.0 update and is available from day one in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, launching September 26th. In the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, DLSS 3.5\u2019s new Ray Reconstruction technology enhances the quality and clarity of reflections, global illumination is even more accurate, and lighting is more dynamically responsive, for an even better, more immersive, more realistic experience.\nWhen activated, Ray Reconstruction replaces several hand-tuned ray tracing denoisers with a new unified AI model that enhances full ray tracing, elevating image quality to new heights. In the following scene, the inaccurate headlight illumination which surrounds the car is a result of the hand-tuned denoiser pulling in inaccurate lighting effects from previous frames. DLSS 3.5 accurately generates lighting, so you can make out the beam of the headlights, and see light reflect on the curb in front of the car.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe streets of Night City are filled with reflections from rotating billboards and neon lights. By activating DLSS 3.5, their quality and clarity is enhanced city-wide:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 40 Series users can combine Super Resolution and Frame Generation with Ray Reconstruction for breathtaking performance and image quality, while GeForce RTX 20 and 30 Series users can add Ray Reconstruction to their AI-powered arsenal alongside Super Resolution. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMax Performance With NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 \nIn Cyberpunk 2077 and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, replacing multiple hand-tuned denoisers with Ray Reconstruction also happens to increase performance that bit more. Get the ultimate Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty experience, using the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, at over 60 FPS, with GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards.

Since then, even more announcements have confirmed the accuracy of the Nvidia leak. Below are the as-yet-unannounced games we think could still be coming to PC, while games that have been announced are marked with a green check. \u2705In early September, a web developer tinkering around with Nvidia's GeForce Now client discovered a way to access a list of all the games in GFN's database\u2014some 18,000. Among the database entries he found games that hadn't been announced for GeForce Now streaming support and what seemed to be a gold mine of games that hadn't been announced period. After the list began to spread, Nvidia told WCCFTech that it contained \"both released and/or speculative titles, used only for internal tracking and testing,\" and that \"inclusion on the list is neither confirmation nor an announcement of any game.\"But since September, it has started to look more and more like those \"speculative titles\" are real games.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\n18 games the PC Gamer team can't wait to play in 2025\n\n\n\n\nNew games 2025: All the upcoming pc games you won't want to miss, from big hits to hidden gems\n\n\n\nIt started with Actraiser Renaissance, a surprise remake announced and released on September 23. The GeForce Now list included an entry called \"ActRaiser Remake.\" It's a real stretch to believe that someone at Nvidia decided to speculate that Square Enix would be releasing a new version of a 1990 Super Nintendo game on PC. Windows Central also wrote that multiple codenames on the list from Xbox Game Studios matched games they knew about: Project Holland is Fable, for example.More confirmations followed. Destroy All Humans 2's remake was announced at a THQ Nordic event just days after the leak\u2014and so was Outcast 2. Randy Pitchford publicly stated that Gearbox was working on a new Brothers in Arms. Square Enix announced Dungeon Encounters, which was listed as an \"Unannounced Dungeon Tactics game.\" Rockstar announced the Grand Theft Auto remastered trilogy. Sony announced that God of War is coming to PC.All were on Nvidia's list.With so many examples, there's no way the unannounced games on the list were all speculative. And it's looking like more games will continue to be confirmed: The Helldivers Twitter account is teasing some sort of announcement, and Helldivers 2, sure enough, is on the Nvidia list.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.This doesn't mean that every unreleased game on the list is currently in development, or is guaranteed to come out on PC. Bayonetta 3 and New Super Mario Bros are both on there, for example, and both are published by Nintendo. Nintendo might let Sega release Bayonetta 3 on PC despite funding its development, but Mario? Unlikely. There's an easy answer in this case, though: Nvidia had a partnership with Nintendo to put Wii games like New Super Mario Bros on the Shield in China.There are also games on the list that have likely or definitely been canceled. Scalebound, for example, is on there, and that's been dead for years. Titanfall 3 became Apex Legends, as hinted at by its \"shortName\" in the database: \"apex_legends_-_titanfall.\" But there are still dozens of games here that are quite possibly in the works. We may be looking at a treasure map for the next few years of PC gaming.Here are the game names that stand out to me. The biggest I've organized by publisher, while others I've lumped together into a list at the end.Valve(Image credit: Valve)Half-Life 2 RemasteredThis seems entirely plausible\u2014Valve actually released a beta branch update for Half-Life 2 last October, fixing bugs and adding Vulkan support. That may have been it for this entry, though a 20th anniversary edition in a couple years wouldn't be too hard to believe.Sony(Image credit: Sony)Demon's SoulsGhosts of TsushimaGod of War \u2705Gran Turismo 7Helldivers 2 \u2705Horizon Forbidden West \u2705Ratchet & Clank \u2705Returnal \u2705Sackboy: A Big Adventure \u2705Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection \u2705So many big games from Sony here. I can see Demon's Souls, Gran Turismo 7 and Ghosts of Tsushima in particular absolutely crushing it on PC.Notably, Bloodborne is not on the list. It hurts.\u00a0Square Enix(Image credit: Square Enix)Chrono Cross Remaster \u2705Final Fantasy 7 Remake \u2705Final Fantasy 9 RemakeFinal Fantasy Tactics Remaster\u00a0\u2705Kingdom Hearts 4 \u2705New strategy game \u2705 (The DioField Chronicle)Tactics Ogre Remaster \u2705Tomb Raider 25th Anniversary (2021)Unannounced Card Game 2 \u2705 (Voice of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden)There's wild stuff in here. Square Enix has been hyping up Tomb Raider's 25th this year, so a new remake or HD port of Tomb Raider Anniversary seems plausible. But Chrono Cross Remaster, Tactics Ogre Remaster and Final Fantasy 9 Remake are all incredibly tantalizing. It's ludicrous FFT wasn't on PC years ago, and Tactics Ogre would be the cherry on top. The fantastic 2010 remake never even got a mobile port the way FFT did, which means it's been marooned on the PlayStation Portable for a decade.\u00a0Chrono Cross absolutely deserves the same treatment as Square Enix's other \"HD\" ports of its PlayStation games\u2014well, better treatment, really, because as we've seen with AI upscaling, Square's official releases can really be improved on. Final Fantasy 9 is the one closest to my heart and the one I would've assumed had no chance in hell of happening, except that Square Enix is also, extremely randomly, developing a FF9 animated series. Maybe the best Final Fantasy really is getting a ground-up remake.Oh, and Kingdom Hearts 4? Sure, we'll see that in a decade or two.Take Two(Image credit: 2k)Bioshock 2022BioShock RTX RemasterXCOM 3There's no GTA 6 on the list, but the BioShocks are interesting. We've known about an upcoming BioShock for quite some time, but the RTX remaster is new. Take Two announced the studio working on the next BioShock in late 2019, which does make 2022 sound like an optimistic target. My guess is it doesn't arrive until at least 2023.As for XCOM 3, is that actually Midnight Suns, or is it a proper sequel? If the latter, hopefully it wasn't canceled to make room for Midnight Suns instead.Sega(Image credit: Atlus)Endless Legend 2Judgment \u2705Shin Megami Tensei 5Total War 9 \u2705No surprise that another mainline Total War is coming, and Endless Legend 2 seems possible, though it may have been scrapped in favor of Amplitude's Humankind. The real items of interest here are Judgment, the Yakuza spin-off, and Shin Megami Tensei 5. With Persona 4 on PC, it feels like a matter of when, not if, the rest of Atlus's RPGs make it over. It's a bit disappointing not to see Persona 5 or any other Atlus games on here, though. \u00a0EA(Image credit: EA)Mirror's Edge RTX RemasterUntitled Respawn GameWe know Respawn is working on a new game or two, and a ray traced version of Mirror's Edge? Sure, why not.\u00a0Warner Bros(Image credit: Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment)Batman: Arkham Knight RTX RemasterInjustice 3: Gods Will FallMortal Kombat XII \u2705Arkham Knight had an infamously broken launch on PC, but it was a stunner when it worked. Good ray tracing candidate. And both of these fighting games from Nether Realm seem likely\u2014the question is more which one is in development right now.\u00a0Capcom(Image credit: Capcom)Dragon's Dogma 2 \u2705Monster Hunter 6 \u2705Resident Evil 4 Remake \u2705Street Fighter 6 \u2705These were already named in Capcom's massive data breach last year, but I just wanted an excuse to write DRAGON'S DOGMA 2 in all-caps. \u00a0Microsoft(Image credit: Xbox Game Studios, The Coalition)Gears 6Halo 5: GuardiansThere are also a whole lot of game codenames, but Gears 6 feels like close to outright confirmation that the next Gears game is on the way. Not exactly a shocker. Meanwhile, 343 Industries has stated once again that nothing's happening with Halo 5 on PC right now.\u00a0Bandai Namco(Image credit: Bandai-Namco)Tekken 8 \u2705Konami(Image credit: Konami)Metal Gear Solid 2 HD \u2705Metal Gear Solid 3 HD \u2705VGC reported in October that Konami's planning big comebacks for Metal Gear and Castlevania, and remasters of MGS2/3 are part of that plan. This seems likely and it'd be great to finally have MGS3 on PC.\u00a0The rest(Image credit: Paradox Interactive)Warhammer 40,0000: Space Marine 2 \u2705Cities Skylines 2 \u2705Crash Team Racing Nitro-FueledCrysis 4 \u2705Earth Defense Force 6 \u2705Metro \"Next\"The Talos Principle 2 \u2705Timesplitters 2 (Remastered)Titan Quest 2 (working title) \u2705Wreckfest sequel\n\n\nWes FenlonSocial Links NavigationSenior EditorWes has been covering games and hardware for more than 10 years, first at tech sites like The Wirecutter and Tested before joining the PC Gamer team in 2014.

[+] (artificial intelligence) written in the background. (Photo Illustration by Idrees Abbas/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\n\nThe unthinkable is happening; Google\nGOOG\n is being disrupted by a small software startup. Now the search giant finally has a plan to fight back. It might not matter.\n\n\nThe chief executive at Alphabet (GOOGL), Google\u2019s parent company announced in April that two of its advanced research divisions are merging to build general artificial intelligence applications.\n\nInvestors should buy Nvidia (NVDA) shares into any weakness. Let me explain.\n\nArtificial intelligence research has never been hotter. OpenAI, the small company behind ChatGPT is taking the computing world by storm with a next generation chatbot that appears to behave like a human. ChatGPT can do everything from writing music, poetry, and software code, to carrying out casual conversations about recipes and philosophy. This could be catastrophic to Google\u2019s core business, internet search.\n\nChatGPT launched in December and added 1 million active users in the first week. By the end of January that number had swollen to 100 million. For context, this growth is orders of magnitude faster than Instagram, TikTok, and Google Search, that needed almost 1 year to reach 100 million users, according to a report from Reuters.\nSundar Pichai, Alphabet\u2019s chief executive is rightfully concerned.\nHis plan is to merge Google Brain and DeepMind, its advanced research divisions. While the new subsidiary may lack a creative name, Google DeepMind, it combines a wealth of real-world AI accomplishments.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of September 2023By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of September 2023By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nPichai noted in early April in his blogpost that since 2016 the research teams helped refine Search, YouTube, Gmail, and build the computational photography that made Pixel smartphone cameras best in class. The academic triumphs include Transformers, AlphaFold, and TensorFlow and JAX, the foundational frameworks that facilitate large language modelling used for general AI system development.\n\nIt is undeniable that Google has the intellectual talent and LLM knowhow to fight back against OpenAI. This misses the larger point, though. This isn\u2019t really a story about ChatGPT. AI is a disruptive gamechanger.\n\n\nResearch from Lambda Labs shows that ChatGPT could have been created in only 34 days, at a cost of a mere $5 million.\nAnalysts at Lambda figure that 355 years would have been required using traditional methods to train LLMs. Developers at OpenAI blew up the norm. They used 1,023 A100 graphics processing units scaled into a supercomputer. The Nvidia GPUs used massively parallel design to bust through the complex math in short order.\nThis feat of brute force pushed demand for the Nvidia gear through the roof. Two year old A100s are now selling on eBay for up to $45,000 apiece. The retail cost is $10,000, if you can find one.\nNvidia reported in November that Microsoft\nMSFT\n (MSFT) would acquire \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of these GPUs for its Azure cloud computing subsidiary. And a note last week at Business Insider indicated Elon Musk has purchased 10,000 units to bolster an internal AI project at Twitter.\nIt\u2019s not hard to see where all of this is going. There is an AI gold rush.\nDevelopers understand it is now possible to build extremely disruptive products with relatively few engineers and little money, using AI. ChatGPT is only the beginning of what is possible. An entire ecosystem is developing around staking claims and building businesses. And Nvidia has a monopoly on the shovels and pickaxes. It\u2019s really an incredible story, with unprecedented upside from here.\nNvidia\u2019s AI hardware is running at every major datacenter in the world, according to Jenson Huang, chief executive officer. Chieftains at Microsoft\u2019s Azure, Amazon Web Services, and even Google Cloud are scrambling to buy gear ahead of a new wave of AI development. More importantly, Nvidia controls the direction of the entire AI stack through the governance of its CUDA open source software platform.\nAt a share price of $271.19 Nvidia stock trade at 44.8x forward earnings and 24.8x sales. The stock has also run up immensely since October when it touched $110 amid stories of semiconductor gluts and China sales bans.\nInvestors should buy pullbacks to the $245 area.\nDiscover the secrets to successful investing with our Strategic Advantage newsletter.

The card was only available in systems from OEMs but now, it is also available as a standalone GPU variant. A quick recap: the NVIDIA RTX Ada lineup has three different graphics cards featuring the RTX 5000,\u00a0RTX 4500, and\u00a0RTX 4000. Here is what you can expect with the lineup:\nRelated Story NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 5060 Surfaces Up At an ACER Pre-Built System, Gets Valued Around $300-$400\nNVIDIA CUDA cores: Up to 2x the single-precision floating-point throughput compared to the previous generation.\nThird-generation RT Cores: Up to 2x the throughput of the previous generation with the ability to concurrently run ray tracing with either shading or denoising capabilities.\nFourth-generation Tensor Cores: Up to 2x faster AI training performance than the previous generation with expanded support for the FP8 data format.\nDLSS 3: New levels of realism and interactivity for real-time graphics with the power of AI.\nLarger GPU memory: The RTX 4000 provides 20GB of GDDR6 memory; the RTX 4500 offers 24GB of GDDR6 memory; and the RTX 5000 boasts 32GB of GDDR6 memory \u2014 all supporting error-code correction for error-free computing with large 3D models, rendered images, simulations, and AI datasets.\nExtended-reality capabilities: Support for high-resolution augmented-reality and virtual-reality devices to deliver the high-performance graphics required for creating stunning AR, VR, and mixed-reality content.\n\nIn terms of specifications, the NVIDIA RTX 5000 Ada graphics card comes with the AD102 GPU core that is configured with 12800 cores and 500 Tensor cores, offering up to 65.3 TFLOPs of single and 1044 TFLOPs of tensor performance. The card also comes with 32 GB of GDDR6 memory and has a TDP of 250W.\nRegarding gen-to-gen improvements, the NVIDIA RTX 5000 Ada brings up to 3x more performance than its previous \"RTX A5500\" counterpart. Harnessing the power of NVIDIA's AI Enterprise 4.0 suite, the RTX Ada workstation GPUs have brought massive performance enhancement, making them one of the best options available. However, such specifications come with a high cost, and the RTX 5000 Ada has been listed on JD.com for 35,000 RMB, which is still almost\u00a0half of what the higher-end \"RTX 6000 ADA\" is going at.\nImage Credits: Videocardz\nYou might be surprised to see the high price, but it is important to note that this isn't meant for an ordinary consumer but for a professional who requires high computing performance.

The company generates revenue from licensing and royalty deals that it arranges with customers who want to use its designs when making semiconductor chips.\nAnd with chips soaring in demand and tech being a great place to invest these days, the timing couldn't have been better for the stock -- it can benefit from an uptick in demand due to the growing popularity of artificial intelligence (AI).\nInvestors who missed the boat on Nvidia's (NVDA -2.53%) mammoth 200% gains this year might be wondering if Arm is a good alternative right now. Could it be the next big AI stock, or should investors hold off on investing in this hyped-up IPO?\nA big opportunity for Arm\nAlthough investors have become bearish on Arm in recent days, there's no denying the company's strong brand presence and the long-term growth potential it possesses. Its central processing units are in nearly all smartphones. The company estimates that it has a 49% share of the total semiconductor design market, up from just over 42% at the end of 2020. \nArm's total addressable market is a whopping $202.5 billion, and it is expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.8%. And with AI potentially accelerating the demand for chips, the market may soon prove to be a lot bigger than those already high projections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company's growth has been underwhelming\nHistorically, Arm hasn't been a fast-growing business despite the increase in tech spending. For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, Arm's revenue totaled just under $2.7 billion and was flat from the previous year. Over a two-year streak, the top line has risen by 32%. \nRoyalties account for a significant part of the company's revenue and can provide the business with some great stability. But that's not the type of thing that might excite growth investors who may otherwise expect a big influx of sales due to soaring demand for AI-powered chips.\u00a0\nArm's net profit margin of 20% is also lower than Nvidia's, which has averaged more than 30% over the trailing 12 months. \nIt could take a while for Arm to generate significant growth from AI\nArm is definitely an AI play, but it may not be the one that investors are hoping for. While Nvidia's revenue has been doubling, it may not be as quick of a payoff for Arm.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nOne analyst, Richard Windsor from Radio Free Mobile, says that it could take up to five years for Arm to benefit from an increase in AI-related demand. That's because right now, the AI craze relates to applications that are in the cloud.\nThe bigger payoff for Arm is in edge computing, where processes take place on an individualized device. But demand for AI on the \"edge,\" as it's called, may take longer given how nascent AI development still is. As concerns about privacy and security grow related to AI, the demand for AI processes to work locally rather than in the cloud could increase significantly. That's when Arm could see a big jump in revenue.\nBut given that its sales have gone up only 32% in two years, it's debatable just how much growth investors will see from Arm -- remember, its total addressable market is only growing at a CAGR of less than 7%.\nThe valuation isn't cheap\nEven out of the gate, Arm isn't a cheaper option than Nvidia. At a valuation of more than $60 billion, it is trading at 23 times revenue and over 110 times its trailing earnings.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia trades at a comparable multiple of earnings while its revenue multiple is higher at 33. But with Nvidia growing at a much faster rate than Arm, there's little reason to pay a greater premium for shares of Arm.\n\nIs Arm's stock worth buying right now?\nArm started out hot out of the gate but things have since cooled down -- drastically, as investors may be thinking twice about how strong of an AI stock it really is. It's not the next Nvidia. Even if it were to have promising growth prospects, its high valuation doesn't give investors any incentive to buy it instead of Nvidia. While it did well in its first day, shares of Arm have already begun falling as the hype appears to be wearing off.\nInvestors should wait to see how the company does after a couple of earnings reports. But as of now, there isn't much of a reason to add this stock to your portfolio. And at its high price tag, you're better off simply buying shares of Nvidia.\n\n\n\nDavid Jagielski has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

But two of them that many artificial intelligence (AI) investors focus on are Nvidia (NVDA -2.53%) and Alphabet (GOOG -2.29%) (GOOGL -2.22%). Both companies also have products outside this space, which will help stabilize them should this trend burn out quickly.\nBut which one is the better buy? Let's dig in since these are completely different types of investments.\nBoth companies are heavily invested in AI\nNvidia's business is centered around its graphics processing units (GPUs), which process intense calculations, whether it's gaming graphics, engineering simulations, mining cryptocurrency, or generating AI models. These GPUs are considered the best on the market, so the company has seen a massive surge in interest thanks to AI.\nAlphabet has multiple AI investments, but it boils down to a couple of business segments. First is advertising, by far the largest revenue driver since its Google Search and YouTube products are driven by ad revenue. AI-driven advertising can ensure the right person sees the ad and may eventually offer full customization for the viewer. It also has another crucial piece of AI infrastructure: Google Cloud.\n\nMost companies don't have the resources to create a sophisticated AI model, so they need to rent additional computing power elsewhere. With Google Cloud's infrastructure optimized for AI workloads, it has solidified itself as a top option despite being third in cloud computing market share. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhile both companies are interested in AI proliferation, Nvidia will be in hot water if this trend fizzles out.\nNvidia is all-in on the AI movement\nDuring the second quarter of Nvidia's 2024 fiscal year (ending July 30), data center revenue rose 171% year over year. AI investments ultimately fueled this growth, but the results aren't fantastic if you look past that.\nIts consumer-facing segment, gaming, was only up 11% and now is one-fourth the size of the data center division, even though it used to be larger. While Nvidia has given guidance for a fantastic third quarter, it must maintain that rapid growth for its valuation to make sense.\n\nAlphabet isn't seeing the same strength as Nvidia, mainly because it's still an advertising-focused company. And Alphabet is an AI application play, as its own AI technologies and data center infrastructure won't see the benefit immediately. Because Nvidia's GPUs are the basis for creating AI models, it's seeing the first wave of business explosion.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the second quarter (ending June 30), Alphabet's revenue only rose 7%, with weak advertising revenue growth (up 3.2%). When the recession fears fade away, companies will be more willing to spend on advertising, significantly boosting the company's business. However, there is still one bright spot.\nGoogle Cloud revenue rose 28% year over year and continues to post greater operating profits each quarter. This is a key area to focus on, as it should continue to see strength if AI developers find their infrastructure best suited for the application.\nAlphabet is a far cheaper stock than Nvidia\nBecause of the hype surrounding Nvidia, the stock's valuation is incredibly higher than Alphabet's.\n\nGOOGL PE Ratio data by YCharts.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause Nvidia is undergoing a significant business transformation, looking at the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is smart because it factors in the growth. The problem is that the company must hit sky-high analyst expectations over the next 12 months. These projections factor in 162% earnings growth, which is feasible if it maintains its growth rate. But if it misses those projections, the stock could get whacked.\nOn the other hand, Alphabet doesn't have too expensive a premium, regardless of which ratio you use. As a result, it's a more conservative investment than Nvidia.\nSo which should you choose? I think investors are better off with Alphabet because it doesn't require perfection to work out as an investment. However, if Nvidia can maintain its expansion for three years (or even two), it will blow Alphabet out of the water in terms of performance.\nTo best account for the risk and reward here, if you want to buy both, it could be smart to buy a much larger portion of Alphabet than Nvidia. That way, Nvidia's effect is smaller if it underperforms. But if it continues its skyward ascent, you'll still have plenty of exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Reliance will use Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips and Nvidia DGX Cloud to build out its infrastructure.Reliance's telecom arm, Jio Infocomm, will lead the project, developing AI tools that may include translation and weather information for rural farmers, and AI applications and services for 450 million Jio customers. The AI infrastructure will also be made available to scientists, developers, and startups across India.That infrastructure, managed by Jio, \"will be hosted in AI-ready computing data centers that will eventually expand to 2,000MW,\" Nvidia said. DCD has contacted the company for more details about specific timelines.Jensen Huang, Nvidia's founder and CEO, said: \u201cWe are delighted to partner with Reliance to build state-of-the-art AI supercomputers in India. India has scale, data, and talent. With the most advanced AI computing infrastructure, Reliance can build its own large language models that power generative AI applications made in India, for the people of India.\u201dMukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, added: \u201cAs India advances from a country of data proliferation to creating technology infrastructure for widespread and accelerated growth, computing, and technology super centers like the one we envisage with Nvidia will provide the catalytic growth just like Jio did to our nation\u2019s digital march.\"Back in 2019, Ambani announced plans to build data centers across India in partnership with Microsoft Azure. Facebook and Google have both taken stakes in Jio as the telco expands rapidly across India.Alongside its work with Reliance, Nvidia is partnering with rival conglomerate Tata Group.Specifically, it will work with Tata Communications (TCS), which claims to carry around 30 percent of the world's Internet routes. TCS and Nvidia will build an AI supercomputer powered by the GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, and then develop an AI cloud connected by TCS.\u201cData centers worldwide are shifting to GPU computing to build energy-efficient infrastructure to support the exponential demand for generative AI,\" Nvidia's Huang said. \u201cWe are delighted to partner with Tata as they expand their cloud infrastructure service with Nvidia AI supercomputing to support the exponential demand of generative AI startups and processing of large language models.\u201dTCS plans to upskill its 600,000-strong workforce on AI and build and process generative AI applications.\u201cThe advancements in AI have made focus on AI a central priority in governments, industries and society at large,\" N. Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Sons, said. \"The impact of AI and machine learning is going to be profound across industries and every aspect of our lives.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nA future version of DLSS is likely to include full neural rendering, hinted Bryan Catanzaro, a Nvidia VP of Applied Deep Learning Research. In a round table discussion organized by Digital Foundry (video), various video game industry experts talked about the future of AI in the business. During the discussion, Nvidia\u2019s Catanzaro raised a few eyebrows with his openness to predict some key features of a hypothetical \"DLSS 10.\"\n\nWe've seen significant developments in Nvidia\u2019s DLSS technology over the years. First launched with the RTX 20-series GPUs, many wondered about the true value of technologies like the Tensor cores being included in gaming GPUs. The first ray tracing games, and the first version of DLSS, were of questionable merit. However, DLSS 2.X improved the tech and made it more useful, leading to it being more widely utilized \u2014 and copied, first via FSR2 and later with XeSS.\n\nDLSS 3 debuted with the RTX 40-series graphics cards, adding Frame Generation technology. With 4x upscaling and frame generation, neural rendering potentially allows a game to only fully render 1/8 (12.5%) of the pixels. Most recently, DLSS 3.5 offered improved denoising algorithms for ray tracing games with the introduction of Ray Reconstruction technology.\n\nThe above timeline raises questions about where Nvidia might go next with future versions of DLSS. And of course, \"Deep Learning Super Sampling\" no longer really applies, as the last two additions have targeted other aspects of rendering. Digital Foundry asked that question to the group: \u201cWhere do you see DLSS in the future? What other problem areas could machine learning tackle in a good way?\u201d\n\nBryan Catanzaro immediately brought up the topic of full neural rendering. This idea isn\u2019t quite as far out as it may seem. Catanzaro reminded the panel that, at the NeurIPS conference in 2018, Nvidia researchers showed an open-world demo of a world being rendered in real-time using a neural network. During that demo the UE4 game engine provided data about what objects were in a scene, where they were, and so on, and the neural rendering provided all the on-screen graphics.UE4 with neural network generated graphics (Image credit: Nvidia)The graphics back in 2018 were rather basic \u2014 \u201cNot anything close to Cyberpunk,\u201d admitted Catanzaro. Advances in AI image generation have been quite incredible in the interim, though. Look at the leaps in quality we've seen in AI image generators over the last year, for example.\n\nCatanzaro suggested the 2018 demo was a peek into a major growth area of (generative) AI in gaming. \u201cDLSS 10 (in the far far future) is going to be a completely neural rendering system,\u201d he speculated. The result will be \u201cmore immersive and more beautiful\u201d games than most can imagine today.\n\nBetween now and DLSS 10, Catanzaro believes we'll see a gradual process, developer controllable, and coherent. Developers are now experienced in tools that allow them to steer their vision using traditional game engines and 2D / 3D rendering tech. They need similar finely controlled tools ready for generative AI, noted the Nvidia VP.Another interesting perspective on the future of AI in gaming was provided by Jakub Knapik, VP Art and Global Art Director at CD Projekt RED. Knapik was fully transparent in saying Catanzaro\u2019s easily believable vision of generative AI graphics \u201cscares me like crazy.\u201d However, he sounded more excited about AI enhancing the interactive and immersive worlds that make gaming so much fun, not just graphics.\n\nCurrently, 90% of a game might be prescriptive, noted the senior CDPR developer. In contrast, he referenced Nvidia\u2019s \u2018Cyberpunky\u2019 demo of an AI-powered interactive NPC as providing a window into deeper AI-enhanced games. Knapik went on to note that for CDPR, the story is king, and that\u2019s where he sees the best use of AI going forward.\n\nBoth Catanzaro and Knapik seemed to agree that developers need extensive control over AI to realize their creative visions. People won\u2019t just be able to conjure up an AAA game from a chat prompt, joked the Nvidia VP. We can see it now: \"/Imagine: A dystopian future first-person game with RPG elements in a violent world dominated by corporations.\"\n\nWherever we go in the interim, by the time DLSS 10 rolls out, we could see game engines wielding AI-generated visuals for better real-time graphics quality and performance, with AI-enhanced characters, stories, and environments contributing to what might become a whole new category of media.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (33)\n\n\n\nMark TysonSocial Links NavigationNews EditorMark Tyson is a news editor at Tom's Hardware.

It's not fun to play Batman Arkham games and seeing that toggle \"Enable PhysX\" disabled, because I don't have an Nvidia card. How would games be today if PhysX were supported in every GPU from the start? And I don't want that for DLSS 10 or whatever.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hardcard\n\n\nI think it will replace ray tracing and shaders. I see game developers providing assets, objects and a story and DLSS 10 generating 70 - 120 Stable Diffusion (or probably more advanced AI algorithms) frames per second.\n\nI think this is the future. I think it will look far more realistic and natural than shaders and hardware ray tracing can hope for while simultaneously needing less growth in transistors and power budgets to scale up performance.\n\nInterestingly, using AI algorithms to generate the image stream is also going to make it easier for other companies than Nvidia, AMD, and Intel to provide gaming hardware.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbaboma\n\n\n>Maybe i went through this piece of news faster than i should, but i don't think i read anything about potentially replacing Ray Tracing. Unless, of course, this kind of development is implied as a sort of natural evolution, in the process of improving graphics quality.\n\nYeah, note the DLSS 10. Assuming linear progress, it took ~4.5 years from 1.0 (Feb 2019) to 3.5 now, and another 6.5 iterations would take another ~8+ years. But progress isn't linear (for AI), so if the '10' holds true, I'd say a bit sooner than that.\n\nAnyway, the sentiment coming from an Nvidia VP of \"Applied Deep Learning Research\" is just one more indication of where Nvidia is heading for its GPUs--more AI, less brute power.\n\n>In any case, i very much like what Nvidia has done so far with DLSS and RT, and i'm sure it will only get better by time. \n\nI'm excited more for the non-graphical possibilities of AI in games. More intelligent NPCs for starters...better combat AI...no more canned convos...the list is endless.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsalgado18 said:But while I agree that their advances are great, they need to contribute to the general ecosystem to make all gamers enjoy at least part of the benefits, or work with some existing standards.\nThat would be nice, if DLSS wasn't one of those features that give Nvidia the edge over its competitors.\n\nWe all want this to happen, but, unfortunately, it's not a reasonable thing to expect.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurissokah\n\n\nAt that point wouldn't it be inaccurate to call it DLSS if it's a rendering engine? (maybe DLR?)\n\nI hope they get it stable enough before trying to ship it as such, otherwise we'll have a bunch of psychedelic releases full of AI hallucinations.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechyInAZ\n\n\nkraylbak said:Maybe i went through this piece of news faster than i should, but i don't think i read anything about potentially replacing Ray Tracing.

If you create a image completely rendered by AI, the AI will duplicate what path tracing does naturally, and render the image to mimic pathtraced/raytraced images.\n\nOf course, you can probably have AI reference an actual image rendered with real path tracing/ray tracing, but that's not very efficient when the AI can be taught to mimick RT all on its own.\n\nRay Reconstruction in a way already does this...\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKamen Rider Blade\n\n\nI'll believe it when I see it.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nedzieba\n\n\nkraylbak said:That would be nice, if DLSS wasn't one of those features that give Nvidia the edge over its competitors.\n\nWe all want this to happen, but, unfortunately, it's not a reasonable thing to expect.Like with most things Nvidia are the first-mover on and heavily invest in, it will inevitably roll out elsewhere as that knowledge becomes public and demand is demosntrated. GPGPU (CUDA), variable monitor refresh (G-Sync), etc. May take time, but even now after dragging their feet for a while AMD are starting to implement hardware RT acceleration and deep-learning based resampling, just as they followed suit on GPGPU and VFR.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhotaru.hino\n\n\nIf such tech aims to replace rendering, then it better have a path to provide backwards compatibility.\n\nIt was a thing on my mind when ray tracing finally hit the scene. It only gets better the more resources you throw at it, but we may hit a point where we have more ray tracing resources that rasterization performance stops improving.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 33 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreeware image editor GIMP 3.0 arrives after seven years of incubation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle's Gemini 2.0 Flash is reportedly capable of removing watermarks \u2014 Also found to generate AI celebrity photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi and ChatGPT bring AI conversations to your retro rotary phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI Afterburner update enables RTX 50 series owners to push their GDDR7 VRAM up to 36 GT/s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD manager reports 45% GPU retail market share in Japan \u2014 Eyes 70% as the next target\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nERNIE 4.5 AI model by Baidu claims to match DeepSeek R1 at half the cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi Pico 2's RP2350 SoC goes on general sale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeller and Koduri headline the Beyond CUDA Summit today \u2014 AI leaders rally to challenge Nvidia's dominance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina will enforce clear flagging of all AI generated content starting from September\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk and OpenAI to fast-track trial to December \u2014 suit aims to stop OpenAI's transition to a for-profit company\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Meanwhile, the company stressed that its new product has been received with great interest by the industry at large, hinting that NVIDIA will likely not be the only customer to end up using Micron's HBM3E.\n\"The introduction of our HBM3E product offering has been met with strong customer interest and enthusiasm,\" said Sanjay Mehrotra, president and chief executive of Micron, at the company's earnings call.\nIntroducing HBM3E, which the company also calls HBM3 Gen2, ahead of its rivals Samsung and SK Hynix is a big deal for Micron, which is an underdog on the HBM market with a 10% market share. The company obviously pins a lot of hopes on its HBM3E since this will likely enable it to offer a premium product (to drive up its revenue and margins) ahead of its rivals (to win market share).\nTypically, memory makers tend not to reveal names of their customers, but this time around Micron emphasized that its HBM3E is a part of its customer's roadmap, and specifically mentioned NVIDIA as its ally. Meanwhile, the only HBM3E-supporting product that NVIDIA has announced so far is its Grace Hopper GH200 compute platform, which features an H100 compute GPU and a Grace CPU.\n\"We have been working closely with our customers throughout the development process and are becoming a closely integrated partner in their AI roadmaps,\" said Mehrotra. \"Micron HBM3E is currently in qualification for NVIDIA compute products, which will drive HBM3E-powered AI solutions.\"\nMicron's 24 GB HBM3E modules are based on eight stacked 24Gbit memory dies made using the company's 1\u03b2 (1-beta) fabrication process. These modules can hit data rates as high as 9.2 GT/second, enabling a peak bandwidth of 1.2 TB/s per stack, which is a 44% increase over the fastest HBM3 modules available. Meanwhile, the company is not going to stop with its 8-Hi 24 Gbit-based HBM3E assemblies. The company has announced plans to launch superior capacity 36 GB 12-Hi HBM3E stacks in 2024 after it initiates mass production of 8-Hi 24GB stacks.\n\"We expect to begin the production ramp of HBM3E in early calendar 2024 and to achieve meaningful revenues in fiscal 2024,\" added chief executive of Micron.\n\n\n                Source:\n                Micron\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n7 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\ncharlesg - Friday, September 29, 2023 - link\nTypo?  Second to last paragraph:\"These modules can hit date rates as high as 9.2 GT/second\"Should be \"data rates\"?\n\n\n\nDougMcC - Tuesday, October 10, 2023 - link\nNo it's correct, this is for applications in speed dating.\n\n\n\nKevin G - Friday, September 29, 2023 - link\nThis could be useful for a Hopper refresh as Blackwell looks to be at least a full year away from shipping.  Much like Hopper, I would expect Blackwell to be announced months in advance.\n\n\n\nA5 - Monday, October 2, 2023 - link\nCould do a ~140GB version of H100, ship it at GTC in March right before announcing Blackwell for end of the year.\n\n\n\nskinnyelephant - Saturday, September 30, 2023 - link\nFor rtx 5000\n\n\n\nsonny73n - Sunday, October 1, 2023 - link\nFor rtx 50000They could've had hbm in consumer graphics long ago but they chose not to. They're also reducing memory bandwidths in new gpus. So NO, you won't get hbm for your gaming cards. \n\n\n\nUnashamed_unoriginal_username_x86 - Monday, October 2, 2023 - link\nIt's not coming to consumer but the bandwidth statement's pessimistic. They've already gotten the low hanging fruit from giant caches and without SRAM density improvements memory will need to pick up the slack.There's speculation going on about a 512 bit bus flagship or GDDR7 next gen, one of these is probably true and I don't think it's the former.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Free stock tips and stock research newsletter at https://io-fund.comFollow AuthorSep 22, 2023, 05:45am EDTShareSaveCommentIt is our stance at the I/O Fund that the stock market is not logical, rather it\u2019s sentimental. There is no logical explanation for a stock to go up 100% or more \u2014\u2014 only to fall 40% or more in the matter of a couple of months. Fundamentals do not change this quickly, but sentiment does. In the simplest terms, sentiment is driven by how fear and greed interrelate with supply and demand. However, the way to track sentiment to protect capital is much more complex and needs to combine fundamental analysis with technical analysis\n\nThis roller coaster ride is most evident in tech stocks, which happens to be our specialty. Therefore, we openly and frequently discuss with our free newsletter readers the importance of layering into a leading position, setting up buy plans ahead of time, and also the importance of taking gains once the technical and fundamentals get stretched.\n\nTAIPEI, TAIWAN - 2023/05/29: Nvidia president and CEO Jensen Huang speaks at a keynote presentation ...

The COMPUTEX 2023 runs from 30 May to 02 June 2023 and gathers over 1,000 exhibitors from 26 different countries with 3000 booths to display their latest products and to sign orders with foreign buyers. (Photo by Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\nWe\u2019ve had unwavering conviction in Nvidia\u2019s AI story since November of 2018. In fact, it was our leading position going into 2023 and our AI allocation of 45% exceeded Stanley Druckenmiller at 29%, meanwhile, Druckenmiller was celebrated for having a leading AI portfolio. The Street is also taking credit for being early to Nvidia, which was a latecomer recommendation in March of 2023. Ark often discusses AI as a leading trend, yet almost missed this AI leader entirely. We point this out because we provided Nvidia as a stock tip for free, repeatedly, with top tier analysis delivered on Forbes and through our free newsletter, with our own capital backing the research.\n\n\nThe I/O Fund is a strong proponent of offering quality information at the free level. We offer top tier analysis every single week in our free newsletter, and we do not know any other top-performing portfolio that offers this at the free level in a consistent manner.\n\nUnfortunately, free information tends to come from those who are unproven and may not be very good investors at all, while those with a proven track record keep trades close to their chest.\nNot only do we actively manage every position we own and send real-time trade alerts, but we discuss openly and frequently our thoughts along the way. Our track record on Nvidia over the past 1-2 years looks like this:\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of September 2023By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of September 2023By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\nNot only do we actively manage every position we own and send real-time trade alerts, but we discuss ... [+] openly and frequently our thoughts along the way. Our track record on Nvidia over the past 1-2 years looks like this.I/O Fund\n\nThe single biggest issue individual investors face is a lack of quality information that is early, consistent, and comes with ultimate transparency around position sizing, portfolio performance, and how to handle sell-offs.\n\n\nIt is this last point that we\u2019d like to discuss with you today \u201chow to handle sell-offs.\u201d We were considered crazy for buying Nvidia in 2022 and we are considered crazy for trimming in 2023. Yet, in what is rare transparency for the financial world, we are sharing with you our plans with this leading portfolio position.\nPrice Analysis\nOn August 28th, we put out our price analysis on NVDA. We offered two general scenarios that we see playing out, which are still very much in play today. Here is what we said back then\u2026\n\u201cThere are two general Elliott Wave counts I\u2019m using that represent both of these gap possibilities.\n\n\nBlue \u2013 this count has the 2022 bear market as the first leg in a large degree correction. That would make 2023 the corrective leg, with the final drop on the horizon, which would likely retest the October lows.\nRed \u2013 this count has us in a 4th wave correction within a larger 5 wave uptrend. This would make this current dip a buying opportunity as we push towards the $560-$590 region next.\n\n\nThe lowest I would allow this correction to go and still keep the red count valid would be the $340 region. If we break below $340, then the odds shift that the gap from Nvidia\u2019s last earnings call was in fact an exhaustion gap. Our next move would be to set up downward targets to accumulate Nvidia for the long haul.\u201d\nAlso, in the last report, we were looking for a breakout above $480 to signal that a low was in and we were heading towards our first overhead target around $545. We did see a breakout, but it failed to hold, which was a warning of more volatility to come. This coupled with some heavy distribution volume above the $440 price level, had us decide to take more gains in Nvidia.Real-time trade alert offered by I/O FundI/O Fund\nMy prior analysis still holds \u2013 as long as we hold $340, Nvidia has the potential for one more swing higher into year-end/early next year. However, we do not believe current prices are ideal for a long-term, buy and hold mindset. Patience will likely pay off in the long run. So, it will be up to each investor to decide if they want to take on the risk of potentially getting one more high.\nFor the I/O Fund, the reward is not worth the risk which is why we have decided to trim. Our last buy at $410 in July is our last buy and we do not have any more buys planned until we see a resolution. There are two other AI-related stocks that we like better in the near-term, and when we enter these, we will notify our premium members with real-time trade alerts.\nThis remains my primary perspective as long as we hold the $340 support. Below there, and the top is likely in.This remains my primary perspective as long as we hold the $340 support. Below there, and the top is ... [+] likely in.I/O Fund\nWhen we Plan to Trim next\nNvidia is a core holding of ours, so we will likely never close the position, as long as the story and tech trend remain intact. However, we do strongly believe in taking gains, reducing risk, and targeting lower levels for a better cost basis. That being said, we believe we are approaching one of these moments. Even though we broke a key trendline today, we expect a bounce to occur soon. If this bounce is a corrective bounce that fails to reclaim key overhead levels, we will trim our position even more.Even though we broke a key trendline today, we expect a bounce to occur soon. If this bounce is a ... [+] corrective bounce that fails to reclaim key overhead levels, we will trim our position even more.I/O Fund\nInsider Selling is Elevated Over the Past Month\nThere has been an excessive level of insider selling by the CEO, Jensen Huang. So far, he has sold over $110,000,000 worth of shares over the last 3 weeks. Regarding insider activity, there are many reasons insiders sell, which may have nothing to do with the business. However, when you the see executives within a company, like the CEO, it\u2019s worth paying attention to. Since June, we\u2019ve seen about $175,000,000 worth of NVDA sold.There has been an excessive level of insider selling by the CEO, Jensen Huang. So far, he has sold ... [+] over $110,000,000 worth of shares over the last 3 weeks.SecForm4.Com\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, our broad market work suggests that a complex topping process is forming. Many sectors and stocks have likely topped while some big tech names look like they have the potential for one more high into the end of the year.\nInsider activity and institutional selling point toward another high being less likely. If we do get that second high, our plan is to trim more. Until the $340 support breaks, NVDA still has the potential for that last swing higher. Regardless, we believe being patient will pay off for those looking to buy a great company at a great a price. We are also being patient for when we add back to our position and feel it\u2019s better to be defensive at the moment.\nIf you own Nvidia stock, or are looking to own NVDA, we encourage you to attend our weekly premium webinars, held every Thursday at 4:30 pm EST. Next week, we will discuss NVDA, as well two other AI plays that we will likely buy next \u2013 what our targets are, where we plan to buy, as well as where we plan to take gains.\nI/O Fund Portfolio Manager, Knox Ridley, contributed to this analysis\nPlease note: The I/O Fund conducts research and draws conclusions for the company\u2019s portfolio.

The Code Conference was this week, and we had a great time talking live onstage with all of our guests. We\u2019ll be sharing a lot of these conversations here in the coming days, and the first one we\u2019re sharing is my chat with Dr. Lisa Su, the CEO of AMD.Lisa and I spoke for half an hour, and we covered an incredible number of topics, especially about AI and the chip supply chain. These past few years have seen a global chip shortage, exacerbated by the pandemic, and now, coming out of it, there\u2019s suddenly another big spike in demand thanks to everyone wanting to run AI models. The balance of supply and demand is overall in a pretty good place right now, Lisa told us, with the notable exception of these high-end GPUs powering all of the large AI models that everyone\u2019s running.Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge\u2019s Nilay Patel about big ideas \u2014 and other problems. Subscribe here!The hottest GPU in the game is Nvidia\u2019s H100 chip. But AMD is working to compete with a new chip Lisa told us about called the MI300 that should be as fast as the H100. There\u2019s also a lot of work being done in software to make it so that developers can move easily between Nvidia and AMD. So we got into that.You\u2019ll also hear Lisa talk about what companies are doing to increase manufacturing capacity. The CHIPS and Science Act that recently passed is a great step toward building chip manufacturing here in the United States, but Lisa told us it takes a long time to bring up that supply. So I wanted to know how AMD is looking to diversify this supply chain and make sure it has enough capacity to meet all of this new demand.Finally, Lisa answered questions from the amazing Code audience and talked a lot about how much AMD is using AI inside the company right now. It\u2019s more than you think, although Lisa did say AI is not going to be designing chips all by itself anytime soon.Okay, Dr. Lisa Su, CEO of AMD. Here we go.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.Hello, hello. Nice to see you.Nice to see you. Thank you for having me.I have a ton to talk about \u2014 500 cards\u2019 worth of questions. We\u2019re going to be here all night. But let\u2019s start with something exciting. AMD made some news today in the AI market. What\u2019s going on?Well, I can say, first of all, the theme of this whole conference, AI, is the theme of everything in tech these days. And when we look at all of the opportunities for computing to really advance AI, that\u2019s really what we\u2019re working on. So yes, today, we did have an announcement this morning from a company, a startup called Lamini, a great company that we\u2019ve been working with, some of the top researchers in large language models.And the key for everyone is, when I talk to CEOs, people are all asking, \u201cI know I need to pay attention to AI. I know I need to do something. But what do I do? It\u2019s so complicated. There are so many different factors.\u201d And with these foundational models like Llama, which are great foundational models, many enterprises actually want to customize those models with their own data and ensure that you can do that in your private environment and for your application. And that\u2019s what Lamini does.They actually customize models, fine-tune models for enterprises, and they operate on AMD GPUs. And so that was a cool thing. And we spent a bit of time with them, quite a bit of time with them, really optimizing the software and the applications to make it as easy as possible to develop these enterprise, fine-tuned models.I want to talk about that software in depth. I think it\u2019s very interesting where we\u2019re abstracting the different levels of software development away from the hardware. But I want to come back to that.I want to begin broadly with the chip market. We\u2019re exiting a period of pretty incredible constraint in chips across every process node. Where do you think we are now?It\u2019s interesting. I\u2019ve been in the semiconductor business for, I don\u2019t know, the last 30 years, and for the longest time, people didn\u2019t really even understand what semiconductors were or where they fit in the overall supply chain and where they were necessary in applications. I think the last few years, especially with the pandemic-driven demand and everything that we\u2019re doing with AI, people now are really focused on semiconductors.I think there has been a tremendous cycle. One, a cycle where we needed a lot more chips than we had, and then a cycle where we had too many of some. But at the end of the day, I think the fact is semiconductors are essential to so many applications. And particularly for us, what we\u2019re focused on are the most complex, the highest performance, the bleeding edge of semiconductors. And I would say that there\u2019s tremendous growth in the market.What do you think the bottleneck is now? Is it the cutting edge? Is it at the older process nodes, which is what we were hearing in the middle of the chip shortage?I think the industry as a whole has really come together as an ecosystem to put a lot of capacity on for the purposes of ensuring that we do satisfy overall demand. So in general, I would say that the supply / demand balance is in a pretty good place, with perhaps the exception of GPUs. If you need GPUs for large language model training and inference, they\u2019re probably tight right now. A little bit tight.Lisa\u2019s got some in the back if you need some.But look, the truth is we absolutely are putting a tremendous amount of effort getting the entire supply chain ramped up. These are some of the most complex devices in the world \u2014 hundreds of billions of transistors, lots of advanced technology. But absolutely ramping up supply overall.The CHIPS and Science Act passed last year, a massive investment in this country in fabs. AMD is obviously the largest fabless semiconductor company in the world. Has that had a noticeable effect yet, or are we still waiting for that to come to fruition?I do think that if you look at the CHIPS and Science Act and what it\u2019s doing for the semiconductor industry in the United States, it\u2019s really a fantastic thing. I have to say, hats off to Gina Raimondo and everything that the Commerce Department is doing with industry. These are long lead time things. The semiconductor ecosystem in the US needed to be built five years ago. It is expanding now, especially at the leading edge, but it\u2019s going to take some time.So I don\u2019t know that we feel the effects right now. But one of the things that we always believe is the more you invest over the longer term, you\u2019ll see those effects. So I\u2019m excited about onshore capacity. I\u2019m also really excited about some of the investments in our national research infrastructure because that\u2019s also extremely important for long-term semiconductor strength and leadership.AMD\u2019s results speak for themselves. You\u2019re selling a lot more chips than you were a few years ago. Where have you found that supply? Are you still relying on TSMC while you wait for these new fabs to come up?Again, when you look at the business that we\u2019re in, it\u2019s pushing the bleeding edge of technology. So we\u2019re always on the most advanced node and trying to get the next big innovation out there. And there\u2019s a combination of both process technology, manufacturing, design, design systems. We are very happy with our partnership with TSMC. They are the best in the world with advanced and leading-edge technologies.They\u2019re it, right? Can you diversify away from them?I think the key is geographical diversity, Nilay. So when you think about geographical diversity, and by the way, this is true no matter what. Nobody wants to be in the same place because there are just natural risks that happen. And that\u2019s where the CHIPS and Science Act has actually been helpful because there are now significant numbers of manufacturing plants being built in the US. They\u2019re actually going to start production over the next number of quarters, and we will be active in having some of our manufacturing here in the United States.I talked to Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger when he broke ground in Ohio. They\u2019re trying to become a foundry. He said very confidently to me, \u201cI would love to have an AMD logo on the side of one of these fabs.\u201d How close is he to making that a reality?Well, I would say this. I would say that from onshore manufacturing, we are certainly looking at lots and lots of opportunities. I think Pat has a very ambitious plan, and I think that\u2019s there. I think we always look at who are the best manufacturing partners, and what\u2019s most important to us is someone who\u2019s really dedicated to the bleeding edge of technology.Is there a competitor in the market to TSMC on that front?There\u2019s always competition in the market. TSMC is certainly very good. Samsung is certainly making a lot of investments. You mentioned Intel. I think there are some activities in Japan as well to bring up advanced manufacturing. So there are lots of different options.Last question on this thread, and then I do want to talk to you about AI. There has been a lot of noise recently about Huawei. They put out a seven-nanometer chip. This is either an earth-shattering geopolitical event or it\u2019s bullshit. What do you think it is?Let\u2019s see. I don\u2019t know that I would call it an earth-shattering geopolitical event. Look, I think there\u2019s no question that technology is considered a national security importance. And from a US standpoint, I think we want to ensure that we keep that lead. Again, I think the US government has spent a lot of time on this aspect.The way I look at these things is we are a global company. China\u2019s an important market for us. We do sell to China more consumer-related goods versus other things, and there\u2019s an opportunity there for us to really have a balanced approach into how we deal with some of these geopolitical matters.Do you think that there was more supply available at TSMC because Huawei got kicked out of the game?I think TSMC has put a tremendous amount of supply on the table. I mean, if you think about the CapEx that\u2019s happened over the last three or four years, it\u2019s there because we all need more chips. And when we need more chips, the investment is there. Now chips are more expensive as a result, and that\u2019s part of the ecosystem that we\u2019ve built out.Let\u2019s talk about that part of it. So you mentioned GPUs are constrained. The Nvidia H100, there\u2019s effectively a black market for access to these chips. You have some chips, you\u2019re coming out with some new ones. You just announced Lamini\u2019s training fully on your chips. Have you seen opportunity to disrupt this market because Nvidia supply is so constrained?I would take a step back, Nilay, and just talk about what\u2019s happening in the AI market because it\u2019s incredible what\u2019s happening. If you think about the technology trends that we\u2019ve seen over the last 10 or 20 years \u2014 whether you\u2019re talking about the internet or the mobile phone revolution or how PCs have changed things \u2014 AI is 10 times, 100 times, more than that in terms of how it\u2019s impacting everything that we do.So if you talk about enterprise productivity, if you talk about personal productivity or society, what we can do from a productivity standpoint, it\u2019s that big. So the fact that there\u2019s a shortage of GPUs, I think it\u2019s not surprising because people recognize how important the technology is. Now, we\u2019re in such the early innings of how AI and especially generative AI is coming to market that I view this as a 10-year cycle that we\u2019re talking about, not how many GPUs can you get in the next two to four quarters.We are excited about our road map. I think with high-performance computing, I would call generative AI the killer app for high-performance computing. You need more and more and more. And as good as today\u2019s large language model is, it can still get better if you continue to increase the training performance and the inference performance.And so that\u2019s what we do. We build the most complex chips. We do have a new one coming out. It\u2019s called MI300 if you want the code name there, and it\u2019s going to be fantastic. It\u2019s targeted at large language model training as well as large language model inference. Do we see opportunity? Yes. We see significant opportunity, and it\u2019s not just in one place. The idea of the cloud guys are the only users, that\u2019s not true. There\u2019s going to be a lot of enterprise AI. A lot of startups have tremendous VC backing around AI as well. And so we see opportunity across all those spaces.So MI300?MI300, you got it.Performance-wise, is this going to be competitive with the H100 or exceed the H100?It is definitely going to be competitive from training workloads, and in the AI market, there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all as it relates to chips. There are some that are going to be exceptional for training. There are some that are going to be exceptional for inference, and that depends on how you put it together.What we\u2019ve done with MI300 is we\u2019ve built an exceptional product for inference, especially large language model inference. So when we look going forward, much of what work is done right now is companies training and deciding what their models are going to be. But going forward, we actually think inference is going to be a larger market, and that plays well into some of what we\u2019ve designed MI300 for.If you look at what Wall Street thinks Nvidia\u2019s mode is, it\u2019s CUDA, it\u2019s the proprietary software stack, it\u2019s the long-running relationships with developers. You have ROCm, which is a little different. Do you think that that\u2019s a moat that you can overcome with better products or with a more open approach? How are you going about attacking that?I\u2019m not a believer in moats when the market is moving as fast as it is. When you think about moats, it\u2019s more mature markets where people are not really wanting to change things a lot. When you look at generative AI, it\u2019s moving at an incredible pace. The progress that we\u2019re making in a few months in a regular development environment might\u2019ve taken a few years. And software in particular, our approach is an open software approach.There\u2019s actually a dichotomy. If you look at people who have developed software over the last five, seven, or eight years, they\u2019ve tended to use\u2026 let\u2019s call it, more hardware-specific software. It was convenient. There weren\u2019t that many choices out there, and so that\u2019s what people did. When you look at going forward, actually what you find is everyone\u2019s looking for the ability to build hardware-agnostic software because people want choice. Frankly, people want choice. People want to use their older infrastructure. People want to ensure that they\u2019re able to move from one infrastructure to another infrastructure. And so they\u2019re building on these higher levels of software. Things like PyTorch, for example, which tends to be that hardware-agnostic capability.So I do think the next 10 years are going to be different from the last 10 as it relates to how do you develop within AI. And I think we\u2019re seeing that across the industry and the ecosystem. And the benefit of an open approach is that there\u2019s no one company that has all of the ideas. So the more we\u2019re able to bring the ecosystem together, we get to take advantage of all of those really, really smart developers who want to accelerate AI learning.PyTorch is a big deal, right? This is the language that all these models are actually coded in. I talk to a bunch of cloud CEOs. They don\u2019t love their dependency on Nvidia as much as anybody doesn\u2019t love being dependent on any one vendor. Is this a place where you can go work with those cloud providers and say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to optimize our chips for PyTorch and not CUDA,\u201d and developers can just run on PyTorch and pick whichever is best optimized?That\u2019s exactly it. So if you think about what PyTorch is trying to do \u2014 and it really is trying to be that sort of hardware-agnostic layer \u2014 one of the major milestones that we\u2019ve come up with is on PyTorch 2.0, AMD was qualified on day one. And what that means is anybody who runs CUDA on PyTorch right now, it will run on AMD out of the box because we\u2019ve done the work there. And frankly, it\u2019ll run on other hardware as well.But our goal is \u201cmay the best chip win.\u201d And the way you do that is to make the software much more seamless. And it\u2019s PyTorch, but it\u2019s also Jax. It\u2019s also some of the tools that OpenAI is bringing in with Triton. There are lots of different tools and frameworks that people are bringing forward that are hardware-agnostic. There are a bunch of people who are also doing \u201cbuild your own\u201d types of things. So I do think this is the wave of the future for AI software.Are you building custom chips for any of these companies?We have the capability of building custom chips. And the way I think about it is the time to build custom chips is actually when you get very high volume applications going forward. So I do believe there will be custom chips over the next number of years. The other piece that\u2019s also interesting is you need all different types of engines for AI. So we spend a lot of time talking about big GPUs because that\u2019s what\u2019s needed for trading large language models. But you\u2019re also going to see ASICs for some\u2026 let\u2019s call it, more narrow applications. You\u2019re also going to see AI in client chips. So I\u2019m pretty excited about that as well in terms of just how broad AI will be incorporated into chips across all of the market segments.I\u2019ve got Kevin Scott, CTO of Microsoft, here tomorrow. So I\u2019ll ask you this question so I can chase him down with it. If, say, Microsoft wanted to diversify Azure and put more AMD in there and be invisible to customers, is that possible right now?Well, first of all, I love Kevin Scott. He\u2019s a great guy, and we have a tremendous partnership with Microsoft across both the cloud as well as the Windows environment. I think you should ask him the question. But I think if you were to ask him or if you were to ask a bunch of other cloud manufacturers, they would say it\u2019s absolutely possible. Yes, it takes work. It takes work that we each have to put in, but it\u2019s much less work than you might have imagined because people are actually writing code at the higher-level frameworks. And we believe that this is the wave of the future for AI programming.Let me connect this to an end-user application just for a second. We\u2019re talking about things that are very much raising the cost curve: a lot of smart people doing a lot of work to develop for really high-end GPUs on the cutting-edge process nodes. Everything\u2019s just getting more expensive, and you see how the consumer applications are expensive: $25 a month, $30 a seat for Microsoft Office with Copilot. When do you come down the cost curve that brings those consumer prices down?It\u2019s a great, great question. I do believe that the value that you get with gen AI in terms of productivity will absolutely be proven out. So yes, the cost of these infrastructures is high right now, but the productivity that you get on the other side is also exciting. We\u2019re deploying AI internally within AMD, and it\u2019s such a high priority because, if I can get chips out faster, that\u2019s huge productivity.Do you trust it? Do you have your people checking the work that AI is doing, or do you trust it?Sure. Look, we\u2019re all experimenting, right? We\u2019re in the very, very early stages of building the tools and the infrastructure so that we can deploy. But the fact is it saves us time \u2014 whether we\u2019re designing chips, where we\u2019re testing chips, where we\u2019re validating chips \u2014 it saves us time, and time is money in our world.But back to your question about when do you get to the other side of the curve. I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to think about AI broadly and not just in the cloud. So if you think about how the ecosystem will look a few years from now, you would imagine a place where, yes, you have the cloud infrastructures training these largest foundational models, but you\u2019re also going to have a bunch of AI at the edge. And whether it\u2019s in your PC or it\u2019s in your phone, you\u2019re going to be able to do local AI. And there, it is cheaper, it is faster, and it is actually more private when you do that. And so, that\u2019s this idea of AI everywhere and how it can really enhance the way we\u2019re deploying.That brings me to open source and, honestly, to the idea of how we will regulate this. So there\u2019s a White House meeting, everyone participates, great. Everyone\u2019s very proud of each other. You think about how you will actually enforce AI regulation. And it\u2019s okay, you can probably tell AWS or Azure not to run certain work streams. \u201cDon\u2019t do these things.\u201d And that seems fine. Can you tell AMD to not let certain things happen on the chips for somebody running an open-source model on Linux on their laptop?I think it is something that we all take very seriously. The technology has so much upside in terms of what it can do from a productivity and a discovery standpoint, but there\u2019s also safety in AI. And I do think that, as large companies, we have a responsibility. If you think about the two things around data privacy as well as just overall ensuring as these models are developed that they\u2019re developed to the best of our ability without too much bias. We\u2019re going to make mistakes. The industry as a whole will not be perfect here. But I think there is clarity around its importance and that we need to do it together and that there needs to be a public / private partnership to make it happen.I can\u2019t remember anyone\u2019s name, so I\u2019d be a horrible politician. But let\u2019s pretend I\u2019m a regulator. I\u2019m going to do it. And I say, \u201cBoy, I really don\u2019t want these kids using any model to develop chemical weapons. And I need to figure out where to land that enforcement.\u201d I can definitely tell Azure, \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d But a kid with an AMD chip in a Dell laptop running Linux, I have no mechanism of enforcement except to tell you to make the chip not do it. Would you accept that regulation?I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a silver bullet. It\u2019s not, \u201cI can make the chip not do it.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cI can make the combination of the chip and the model and have some safeguards in place.\u201d And we\u2019re absolutely willing to be at that table to help that happen.You would accept that kind of regulation, that the chip will be constrained?Yes, I would accept an opportunity for us to look at what are the safeguards that we would need to put in place.I think this is going to be one of the most complicated... I don\u2019t think we expect our chips to be limited in what we can do, and it feels like this is a question we have to ask and answer.Let me say again, it\u2019s not the chip by itself. Because in general, chips have broad capability. It\u2019s the chips plus the software and the models. Particularly on the model side, what you do in terms of safeguards.We could start lining up for questions. I\u2019ve just got a couple more for you. You\u2019re in the PS5; you\u2019re in the Xbox. There\u2019s a view of the world that says cloud gaming is the future of all things. That might be great for you because you\u2019ll be in their data centers, too. But do you see that shift underway? Is that for real, or are we still doing console generations?It\u2019s so interesting. Gaming is everywhere. Gaming is everywhere in every form factor. There\u2019s been this long conversation about: is this the end of console gaming? And I don\u2019t see it. I see PC gaming strong, I see console gaming strong, and I see cloud gaming also having legs. And they all need similar types of technology, but they obviously use it in different ways.Audience Q&ANilay Patel: Please introduce yourself.Alan Lee: Hi, Lisa. Alan Lee, Analog Devices. One and a half years after the Xilinx acquisition, how do you see adaptive computing playing out in AI?Lisa Su: First of all, it\u2019s nice to see you, Alan. I think, first of all, the Xilinx acquisition was an acquisition we completed about 18 months ago \u2014 fantastic acquisition. Brought a lot of high-performance IP with adaptive computing IP. And I do see that particularly on these AI engines, engines that are optimized for data flow architectures, that\u2019s one of the things that we were able to bring in as part of Xilinx. That\u2019s actually the IP that is now going into PCs.And so we see significant IP usage there. And together, as we go forward, I have this belief that there\u2019s no one computer that is the right one. You actually need the right computing for the right applications. So whether it\u2019s CPUs or GPUs or FPGAs or adaptive SoCs, you need all of those. And that\u2019s the ecosystem that we\u2019re bringing together.NP: This tall gentleman over here.Casey Newton: Hi, Casey Newton from Platformer. I wanted to return to Nilay\u2019s question about regulation. Someday, it\u2019s sad to say, but somebody might try to acquire a bunch of your GPUs for the express purpose of doing harm \u2014 training a large language model for that purpose. And so I wonder what sort of regulations, if any, do you think government should place around who gets access to large numbers of GPUs and what size training runs they\u2019re allowed to do.LS: That\u2019s a good question. I don\u2019t think we know the answer to that, particularly in terms of how to regulate. Our goal is, again, within all of the export controls that are out there, because GPUs are export controlled, that we follow those regulations. There are the biggest and the next level of GPUs that are there. I think the key is, again, as I said, it\u2019s a combination of both chip and model development that really comes about. And we\u2019re active at those tables and talking about how to do those things. I think we want to ensure that we are very protective of the highest-performing GPUs. But also, it\u2019s an important market where lots of people want access.Daniel Vestergaard: Hi, I\u2019m Daniel from DR [Danmarks Radio]. To return to something you talked about earlier because everyone here is thinking about implementing AI in their internal workflows \u2014 and it\u2019s just so interesting to hear about your thoughts because you have access to the chips and deep machine learning knowledge. Can you specify a bit, what are you using AI internally for in the chip-making process? Because this might point us in the right direction.LS: Thanks for the question. I think every business is looking at how to implement AI. So for us, for example, there are the engineering functions and the non-engineering: sales, marketing, data analytics, lead generation. Those are all places where AI can be very useful. On the engineering side, we look at it in terms of how can we build chips faster. So they help us with design, they help us with test generation, they help us with manufacturing diagnostics.Back to Nilay\u2019s question, do I trust it to build a chip with no humans involved? No, of course not. We have lots of engineers. I think copilot functions in particular are actually fairly easy to adopt. Pure generative AI, we need to check and make sure that it works. But it\u2019s a learning process. And the key, I would say, is there\u2019s lots of experimentation, and fast cycles of learning are important. So we actually have dedicated teams that are spending their time looking at how we bring AI into our company development processes as fast as possible.Jay Peters: Hi, Jay Peters with The Verge. Apple seems to be making a much bigger push in how its devices, and particularly its M-series chips, are really good for AAA gaming. Are you worried about Apple on that front at all?NP: They told me the iPhone 15 Pro is the world\u2019s best game console. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s \u201cPro.\u201d It\u2019s a very confusing situation.LS: I don\u2019t know about that. I would say, look, as I said earlier, gaming is such an important application when you think about entertainment and what we\u2019re doing with it. I always think about all competition. But from my standpoint, it\u2019s how do we get... It\u2019s not just the hardware; it\u2019s really how do we get the gaming ecosystem. People want to be able to take their games wherever and play with their friends and on different platforms. Those are options that we have with the gaming ecosystem today. We\u2019re going to continue to push the envelope on the highest-performing PCs and console chips. And I think we\u2019re going to be pretty good.NP: I have one more for you. If you listen to Decoder, you know I love asking people about decisions. Chip CEOs have to make the longest-range decisions of basically anybody I can think of. What\u2019s the longest-term bet you\u2019re making right now?LS: We are definitely designing for the five-plus-year cycle. I talked to you today about MI300. We made some of those architectural decisions four or five years ago. And the thought process there was, \u201cHey, where\u2019s the world going? What kind of computing do you need?\u201d Being very ambitious in our goals and what we were trying to do. So we\u2019re pretty excited about what we\u2019re building for the next five years.NP: What\u2019s a bet you\u2019re making right now?LS: We\u2019re betting on what the next big thing in AI is.NP: Okay. Thank you, Lisa.LS: Alright.NP: I did my best.Decoder with Nilay PatelA podcast about big ideas and other problems.SUBSCRIBE NOW!See More: AIAMDDecoderNvidiaPodcastsPolicyPoliticsRegulationTechMore in this streamSee allMicrosoft CTO Kevin Scott on how AI and art will coexist in the futureNilay PatelOct 3, 2023CommentsComment Icon Bubble\u201cA platform in transformation\u201dJacob KastrenakesSep 29, 2023CommentsComment Icon BubbleWhat does it really mean to be CEO of X?Jacob KastrenakesSep 29, 2023CommentsComment Icon BubbleMost PopularMost PopularAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?Leaked Apple meeting shows how dire the Siri situation really isInstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nThe chairman of\u00a0TSMC\u00a0admitted that the ongoing short supply of compute GPUs for artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) applications is caused by\u00a0constraints\u00a0of its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) packaging capacity.\u00a0This shortage is expected to persist for around 18 months\u00a0due to\u00a0rising demand for generative AI applicationsand relatively slow expansion of CoWoS capacity at TSMC.\u00a0\u00a0\"It is not the shortage of AI chips, it is the shortage of our CoWoS capacity,\"\u00a0said Mark Liu, the chairman of TSMC, in a conversation with Nikkei\u00a0at Semicon Taiwan. \"Currently, we cannot fulfill 100% of our customers' needs, but we try to support about 80%. We think this is a temporary phenomenon. After our expansion of [advanced chip packaging capacity], it should be alleviated in one and a half years.\"TSMC is\u00a0the\u00a0producer\u00a0of the majority of AI processors, including Nvidia's\u00a0A100 and\u00a0H100\u00a0compute GPUs that\u00a0are integral to AI tools like ChatGPT and are predominantly used in AI data centers.\u00a0These processors, just like solutions from other players like AMD, AWS, and Google, use HBM memory (which is\u00a0essential for\u00a0high bandwidth\u00a0and\u00a0proper\u00a0functioning of extensive AI language models) and CoWoS packaging, which puts additional strain on TSMC's advanced packaging facilities.Liu said that demand for CoWoS surged unexpectedly earlier this year, tripling year-over-year, leading to the current supply constraints. TSMC recognizes that\u00a0demand for\u00a0generative AI services is growing and so is demand for appropriate hardware, so it is speeding up expansion of CoWoS capacity to meet demand for compute GPUs as well as specialized AI accelerators and processors.At present, the company is installing additional tools for CoWoS at its existing advanced packaging facilities, but this takes time and the company expects its CoWoS capacity to double only by the end of 2024.In addition,\u00a0TSMC\u00a0recently announced\u00a0intention to invest\u00a0$2.9 billion in a new facility dedicated to advanced chip packaging. This facility, located\u00a0near\u00a0Miaoli, Taiwan, is a testament to the company's commitment to addressing demand\u00a0for advanced packaging from all sectors and\u00a0recognized importance of advanced chip packaging in the semiconductor industry\u00a0going forwardThis focus on advanced chip packaging is\u00a0not exclusive to TSMC; other industry giants like Intel and Samsung are also prioritizing it, with Intel aiming to quadruple its capacity for its top-tier chip packaging by 2025.\u00a0Traditional outsource semiconductor assembly and test\u00a0(OSAT) companies like ASE and Amkor also have technologies similar to CoWoS, but they yet have to build up capacity for them comparable to that of TSMC, Intel, and Samsung.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (12)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

Photograph: APThe ObserverComputing This article is more than 1 year oldHow savvy trillion-dollar chipmaker Nvidia is powering the AI goldrushThis article is more than 1 year oldJohn NaughtonThe US firm best known for its gaming tech has long been ahead of the curve in supplying the tools needed by tech developersSat 9 Sep 2023 16.00 BSTLast modified on Thu 13 Jun 2024 20.02 BSTShareIt\u2019s not often that the jaws of Wall Street analysts drop to the floor but late last month it happened: Nvidia, a company that makes computer chips, issued sales figures that blew the street\u2019s collective mind. It had pulled in $13.5bn in revenue in the last quarter, which was at least $2bn more than the aforementioned financial geniuses had predicted. Suddenly, the surge in the company\u2019s share price in May that had turned it into a trillion-dollar company made sense.Well, up to a point, anyway. But how had a company that since 1998 \u2013 when it released the revolutionary Riva TNT video and graphics accelerator chip \u2013 had been the lodestone of gamers become worth a trillion dollars, almost overnight? The answer, oddly enough, can be found in the folk wisdom that emerged in the California gold rush of the mid-19th century, when it became clear that while few prospectors made fortunes panning for gold, the suppliers who sold them picks and shovels prospered nicely.We\u2019re now in another gold rush \u2013 this time centred on artificial intelligence (AI) \u2013 and Nvidia\u2019s A100 and H100 graphical processing units (GPUs) are the picks and shovels. Immediately, everyone wants them \u2013 not just tech companies but also petro states such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Thus demand wildly exceeds supply. And just to make the squeeze really exquisite, Nvidia had astutely prebooked scarce (4-nanometre) production capacity at the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the only chip-fabrication outfit in the world that can make them, when demand was slack during the Covid-19 pandemic. So, for the time being at least, if you want to get into the AI business, you need Nvidia GPUs.What\u2019s so special about GPUs? Well, here\u2019s where the video gaming connection comes in. In gaming, graphics images are made up of polygons (mostly tiny triangles) \u2013 rather as the images produced by a digital camera are composed of rectangular pixels. The more triangles you have, the higher the resolution of the resulting image. For gaming, polygons are defined as the coordinates of their vertices, so each object becomes a large matrix of numbers. But most objects in a video game are dynamic, not static: they move and change shape, and for each change, the matrix has to be recalculated. Underpinning a video game, therefore, is a fiendish amount of continuous computation.And for the game to be realistic, this computation has to be done very quickly. Which basically means that conventional central processing units \u2013 which do things serially, one step at a time \u2013 are not up to the job. What makes GPUs special is their ability to do thousands or even millions of mathematical operations in parallel \u2013 which is why, when you\u2019re playing Grand Theft Auto V, the goodies and baddies move swiftly and smoothly, and roam around a convincingly rendered fictional version of Los Angeles in real time.The company has built a software ecosystem around its hardware that is like catnip for AI developersAs interest in machine learning and neural networks surged in the 00s, and especially after 2017, when Google introduced the \u201ctransformer\u201d model on which most generative AI is now based, AI researchers realised that they needed the parallel processing capabilities offered by GPUs. At which point it became clear that Nvidia was the outfit that had the head start on everyone else. And since then the company has wisely capitalised on that advantage and consolidated its lead by building a software ecosystem around its hardware that is like catnip for AI developers.So is Nvidia set to become the next Apple, or at least the next Intel? For the next few years, its dominance seems pretty secure, partly because its revenues are coming more from cloud-computing companies anxious to kit out their datacentres not just with conventional servers but increasingly with parallel-processing kit that will address the anticipated needs of the AI gold rush. They are good customers that pay on time and it\u2019ll take them a couple of years at minimum to reconfigure their cloud infrastructures.But nothing lasts for ever. After all, it\u2019s not that long ago that Intel\u2019s dominance of the semiconductor industry seemed total. And now it\u2019s a shadow of its former self. Curiously enough, though, when Nvidia passed the trillion-dollar milestone, the thought on everyone\u2019s mind was not of Intel but of Cisco, a famous manufacturer of networking and telecoms equipment that once happened to be in the right place at the right time, when the first internet boom kicked off in the mid-1990s. Its revenues tripled between 1997 and 2000 as demand for routers and other networking equipment soared. Then came the bust and by 2001 Cisco\u2019s share price (and consequent market valuation) had dropped by 70%.Could something such as this happen to Nvidia? The key question, says Ben Thompson, the shrewdest tech guru around, is: what will the eventual market for AI be when the frenzy has abated? Nobody knows the answer to that. Whatever happens, though, Nvidia\u2019s picks and shovels will have made some people an awful lot of money.What I\u2019ve been readingDefinite article Consciousness Is a Great Mystery.

Singapore and\u00a0Tsinghua University, 6Estates focuses on delivering domain-specific large language model (LLM)-backed solutions to enterprises. 6Estates is also a member of NVIDIA Inception, a program for cutting-edge startups revolutionising industries with technological advancements.\n\nDGX BasePOD leverages NVIDIA's full-stack data centre platform, including industry-leading computing, storage, networking, software, and infrastructure management all optimised to work together and provide maximum performance at scale.\n6Estates plans to use its NVIDIA DGX BasePOD for its new Model Solutions offering, which empowers enterprises with customised, domain-specific LLMs and applications. The company will also have access to NVIDIA AI Enterprise software for secure, stable and supported production AI. The software layer of the NVIDIA AI platform, NVIDIA AI Enterprise, offers 100+ frameworks, pretrained models, and development tools to accelerate data science and streamline the deployment of production-ready generative AI, computer vision, speech AI, and more.The cluster will also support 6Estates' existing AI solutions \u2013 namely its Intelligent Document Processing platform, which automates processing and analysis for unstructured, template-free documents, and automates workflows for lenders and trade companies from end to end.\"There is immense potential for Generative AI to transform how businesses operate \u2013 spanning from how they execute internal processes to how they understand and serve their customer base. We are seeing incredible demand from customers looking to implement LLM solutions that are highly tailored and with the highest assurance of security, and we are excited to bring this to life for enterprises in the region,\" said Dr. Luan Huanbo, Founder and CEO of 6Estates.Next-Generation Model Training and InferenceNVIDIA DGX H100 systems form the building blocks of the world's most advanced and most powerful AI computing platform. Each system contains eight NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs, which feature the new Transformer Engine, second-generation secure Multi-Instance GPU capabilities, and fourth-generation NVIDIA NVLink connectivity. With DGX H100 systems, 6Estates can achieve up to 4x higher speed for GPT-3 AI training and up to 30x higher speed for AI inference compared to the previous generation.Using NVIDIA DGX H100, 6Estates will materially shorten model training time to deliver faster Model Solutions service to enterprise customers.6Estates' NVIDIA DGX BasePOD cluster with NVIDIA DGX H100 systems can help power domain-specific LLM training and on-premise deployments to customers.\"Supporting large enterprises that need to process and understand substantial amounts of customer data to develop a truly transformational LLM requires significant compute resources \u2013 NVIDIA DGX H100 provides access to the industry-leading performance needed to do so,\" said Dr Luan.\"Generative AI is helping businesses across industries create new opportunities and better serve customers. 6Estates' deployment of NVIDIA DGX AI supercomputing can help organisations across Southeast Asia drive growth through the development of advanced AI services and solutions,\" said Dennis Ang, Senior Director of Enterprise Business for the ASEAN and ANZ Regions at NVIDIA.Empowering Businesses with Customised, Domain-Specific LLMs6Estates has begun developing domain-specific LLMs for several customers \u2013 one in the finance domain, with a commercial company targeting to train 70B ~ 130B size models, and another in the medical domain, with a research institution targeting to train 7B, 13B, and 65B size models.The benefits of domain-specific LLMs are manifold.

Two others, Intel and Nvidia, confirmed their plans to invest. \u2018Arm has played this absolutely foundational role in the tech business but in a pretty much invisible way to most of the outside world for a very long time,\u2019 an analyst says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBritish chip designer Arm has disclosed that AMD, Apple and Google are among the potential \u201ccornerstone investors\u201d in the company\u2019s much-hyped initial public offering. Two other named investors, Intel and Nvidia, confirmed that they plan to invest in Arm\u2019s IPO.\nIn an updated IPO filing Tuesday, the Cambridge, U.K.-based semiconductor company divulged the 10 cornerstone investors and said it will seek a valuation of up to $52 billion when it lists under the \u201cARM\u201d ticker on Nasdaq, reportedly happening next week.\n[Related: Arm\u2019s IPO Filing: Revenue, China Reliance, Ampere Stake And Other Things To Know]\nThe filing said Arm plans to offer 95.5 million American depository shares in the range of $47 to $51 apiece. The company\u2019s current owner, Japanese investment giant SoftBank Group, plans to own roughly 90 percent of Arm\u2019s shares following the IPO, according to the filing.\nArm said the 10 cornerstone investors\u2014which also include Samsung Electronics and MediaTek\u2014have \u201cindicated an interest in purchasing up to an aggregate of $735 million\u201d of its shares in the IPO. However, the company added, \u201cthese indications of interest are not binding agreements or commitments.\u201d\nWhile Amazon reportedly held talks earlier this summer to invest in Arm\u2019s IPO, the e-commerce giant no longer plans to do so, Reuters reported last week.\nBob O\u2019Donnell, president and chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research, said the investment interest by several major tech and semiconductor companies reflects the \u201cabsolutely critical importance of Arm and its continued strong existence and development.\u201d\nFor years, Arm\u2019s architecture has served as the foundation for chips in most of the world\u2019s smartphones, and the company is now starting to gain momentum in the server and PC markets. The chip designer\u2019s technologies are also prevalent in industrial IoT and embedded devices as well as vehicles.\nThe potential investors include several companies that develop chips using Arm\u2019s instruction set architecture,and, in some cases, processor designs. Among the 10, Apple completely relies on Arm\u2019s architecture for its entire portfolio of devices while others use Arm for some products.\n\u201cTheir whole future is dependent on the Arm architecture, and they want to keep the people who built this in the first place going,\u201d O\u2019Donnell told CRN in a recent interview.\nThe investor list also includes Taiwanese foundry giant TSMC, which manufactures a significant portion of chips for Arm\u2019s customers. Samsung too fabricates Arm-based chips while also using those chips for its various devices, such as the Galaxy S23 smartphones and Galaxy Tab S9 tablets.\nThen there\u2019s Intel. While the semiconductor giant relies on the x86 instruction set architecture for its CPUs, it develops some chips that use Arm technology, such as its infrastructure processing units. But the chipmaker also hopes to manufacture a large share of Arm-based chips for other companies as part of its drive to build a significant contract chip manufacturing business with Intel Foundry Services.\n\u201cArm has played this absolutely foundational role in the tech business but in a pretty much invisible way to most of the outside world for a very long time,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.\nWhat follows are summaries of the 10 confirmed and potential investors in Arm\u2019s IPO as well as explanations of how each company is connected to the British chip designer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD\nAn AMD spokesperson declined to confirm the chip designer\u2019s plan to invest in Arm\u2019s IPO and referred to what Arm\u2019s updated IPO filing said about potential investors.\nWhile Santa Clara, Calif.-based AMD relies on the x86 instruction set architecture for the processing cores inside its client and server CPUs, it uses Arm\u2019s architectures within other chip products. These include AMD\u2019s Pensando data processing units, Alveo accelerator cards, Versal adaptive system-on-chips, among others.\nAMD also uses Arm as the basis for the secure co-processor, known officially as the Platform Security Processor, that is embedded within its EPYC server CPUs to enable security features.\nWhile the chip designer relies on Arm for several products, it\u2019s looking to stave off competition from companies such as Amazon Web Services and Ampere Computing that are developing Arm-based CPUs with high core counts and high energy efficiency for cloud computing.\nAMD plans to compete with Arm-based cloud CPUs with the recently launched EPYC 97X4 CPUs, which cap at 128 cores and come with energy efficiency advantages over its vanilla server chips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple\nApple did not respond to a request to comment about its potential plan to invest in Arm\u2019s IPO.\nA longtime customer and co-founder of Arm, Apple has relied on the company\u2019s chip architecture for processors inside all its mobile devices, including the iPhone and iPad.\nIn 2020, the Cupertino, Calif.-based electronics giant signaled a plan to embrace Arm across its entire hardware portfolio by transitioning its Mac computers from Intel CPUs to Arm-compatible M-series system-on-chips such as the M1 and M2. Three years later, Apple completed that transition with M-series chips powering its entire line of Mac laptops and desktops.\nMore than a decade ago, Apple began designing custom Arm processors for iPhones and iPads rather than using the semiconductor company\u2019s pre-developed processor designs. The iPhone maker expanded upon that trend with its M-series chips, which are based on in-house designs rather than Arm\u2019s.\nIn Arm\u2019s updated IPO filing Tuesday, the company said it has entered a \u201cnew long-term agreement with Apple that extends beyond 2040, continuing our long-standing relationship of collaboration with Apple and Apple\u2019s access to the Arm architecture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle\nGoogle did not respond to a request to comment about its potential plan to invest in Arm\u2019s IPO.\nWhile Mountain View, Calif.-based Google has relied on Arm\u2019s pre-developed processor designs for the chips inside its Pixel mobile devices, the company has shown in recent years an increased interest in Arm for its cloud data centers.\nThe first public display of this interest was Google Cloud\u2019s launch last year of the Tau T2A VMs, which are powered by Ampere Computing\u2019s Arm-based Altra CPUs.\nThe cloud service provider continued its public support for Arm-based processors with last month\u2019s announcement that Ampere\u2019s new CPU, AmpereOne, would power its upcoming C3A instances.\nBehind the scenes, Google has been developing its own custom Arm server processors, according to a report earlier this year from The Information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel\nOn the day Arm disclosed its list of cornerstone investors, an Intel executive confirmed at an investor conference that the semiconductor giant will invest in the British chip designer\u2019s IPO.\n\u201cThis morning, we announced that we are an investor in Arm,\u201d said Stuart Pann, senior vice president and general manager of Intel\u2019s contract chip manufacturing business, Tuesday.\nWhile Intel is a stalwart champion of the x86 instruction set architecture for its CPUs, the company relies on Arm for other products and hopes its revitalized contract chip manufacturing business can benefit from growing industry adoption of the alternative architecture.\nThe Santa Clara, Calif.-based semiconductor giant uses Arm technology for non-CPU products such as its infrastructure processing units, which are targeted at cloud infrastructure.\nWith its contract chip-making business, Intel Foundry Services, the company hopes to convince other companies designing Arm-based chips to use its factories to manufacture the products.\nIn April, Intel Foundry Services revealed a deeper commitment to manufacturing third-party Arm chip designs through a \u201cmultigeneration agreement\u201d with Arm that will \u201cenable chip designers to build low-power compute system-on-chips\u201d on its 18A manufacturing node.\nThe foundry business said this agreement will include design technology co-optimization efforts that will optimize Arm chip designs for Intel\u2019s 18A process to improve power, performance, area and cost. The agreement will focus on Arm chip designs for mobile devices first, but Intel said the collaboration could eventually expand into automotive, IoT, data center, aerospace and government applications.\nBefore Intel confirmed its plan to invest in Arm\u2019s IPO Tuesday, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger had expressed interest in investing in Arm, potentially through a consortium of companies, not long after Nvidia, Intel\u2019s AI chip rival, failed to acquire the chip designer in early 2022 due to regulatory opposition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\nAn Nvidia spokesperson told CRN Wednesday that the company plans to invest in Arm\u2019s IPO.\n\u201cArm architecture is important to Nvidia\u2019s products and our ecosystem. We are supporting Arm by investing in its IPO,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nFor the last several years, Nvidia has expanded its purview from designing GPUs to becoming a \u201cfull-stack computing company\u201d that not only designs several important components for high-performance computing but also designs systems and software to run a variety of workloads.\nOver the course of this evolution, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company announced in 2020 its plan to acquire Arm for $40 billion in a bid to expand the boundaries of its business even further, which included the possibility of using Arm\u2019s licensing business to license Nvidia\u2019s GPU technology to customers.\nAt the time, Nvidia had been designing system-on-chips with Arm processor cores for embedded applications, and it was starting to build a GPU-accelerated ecosystem around HPC systems running on Arm-based CPUs. A year after the Arm deal was announced, Nvidia revealed its plan to release an Arm-based data center CPU that would be paired with a GPU in a design disclosed later on.\nHowever, Nvidia\u2019s deal to acquire Arm was foiled in early 2022 after facing significant regulatory opposition over concerns that the company would unfairly use its ownership of Arm\u2019s technology to harm competitors, despite repeated assurances that it wouldn\u2019t.\n\u201cThe reason why people were concerned with Nvidia\u2019s potential purchase is they didn\u2019t want that control to go to one place. [Arm] really is sort of the Switzerland of tech, and everybody wanted it to continue to be the Switzerland of tech, because they wanted it to be a neutral place where everybody could go,\u201d said O\u2019Donnell, the analyst.\nDespite Nvidia\u2019s failure to acquire Arm, the company has remained resolute in supporting the Arm architecture and building products around it, such as the Grace and Grace Hopper Superchips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamsung Electronics\nSamsung Electronics did not respond to a request to comment about its potential plan to invest in Arm\u2019s IPO.\nBased in South Korea, Samsung designs and manufactures several devices such as smartphones, tablets and smart TVs that use Arm-based chipsets and system-on-chips.\nThe electronics giant designs and manufactures some of these system-on-chips, such as the Exynos lineup for smartphones, while other Arm-based chip products are made by other companies.\nSamsung manufactures Arm-based chips through its contract chip manufacturing business, which is the second largest in the world, behind Taiwan\u2019s TSMC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTSMC\nTSMC did not respond to a request to comment about its potential plan to invest in Arm\u2019s IPO.\nBased in Taiwan, TSMC is the world\u2019s largest contract chip manufacturer, counting AMD, Apple, Intel and Nvidia as significant customers and producing a significant share of Arm-based chips every year.\nAs a result, TSMC and Arm have been important and long-standing allies, working together on new initiatives such as TSMC\u2019s 3D Fabric Alliance, which aims to help companies create chips with 3-D silicon stacking and advanced packaging technologies faster.\nMark Liu, TSMC\u2019s chairman, reportedly said Wednesday that the company plans to decide \u201cthis week\u201d whether it will invest in Arm\u2019s IPO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCadence Design Systems\nCadence Design Systems did not respond to a request to comment about its potential plan to invest in Arm\u2019s IPO.\nSan Jose, Calif.-based Cadence provides electronic design automation tools that are used to design chips and semiconductor devices, including those that rely on Arm technologies.\nThe company has strengthened ties with Arm in recent years. In May, Cadence unveiled an expanded collaboration with the chip designer that is expected to help companies tape out Arm-based chips faster\u2014a crucial step before manufacturing begins\u2014using its digital and verification tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMediaTek\nMediaTek did not respond to a request to comment about its potential plan to invest in Arm\u2019s IPO.\nMediaTek is a Taiwan-based chip designer that uses pre-developed Arm processor designs as the basis for chips targeting the smartphone, Chromebook, tablet, IoT and networking markets.\nThe company reportedly plans to introduce Arm-based CPUs for Windows computers in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynopsys\nSynopsys did not respond to a request to comment about its potential plan to invest in Arm\u2019s IPO.\nMountain View, Calif.-based Synopsys is a provider of electronic design automation tools and silicon technologies that are used to design chips, including Arm-based processors.\nIn May, the company unveiled an expanded collaboration with Arm around AI-enhanced design that is expected to accelerate the speed at which chips are created.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We\u2019re also deep-diving on new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU features, technologies and resources and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.\nAs beautiful and extraordinary as art forms can be, it can be easy to forget the simple joy and comforting escapism that content creation can provide for artists across creative fields. \nJanice K. Lee, a.k.a Janice.Journal \u2014 the subject of this week\u2019s In the NVIDIA Studio installment \u2014 is a TikTok sensation using AI to accelerate her creative process, find inspiration and automate repetitive tasks. \n\n\n\n\nAlso this week, NVIDIA Studio technology is powering some of the most popular mobile and desktop apps \u2014 driving creative workflows of both aspiring artists and creative professionals.\nTikTok and CapCut, Powered by NVIDIA and the Cloud\nWeek by week, AI becomes more ubiquitous within content creation.\nTake the popular social media app TikTok. All of its mobile app features, including AI Green Screen, are accelerated by GeForce RTX GPUs in the cloud. Other parts of TikTok creator workflows are also accelerated \u2014 Descript AI, a popular generative AI-powered video editing app, runs 50% faster on the latest NVIDIA L4 Tensor Core GPUs versus T4 Tensor Core GPUs. \nCapCut, the most widely used video editor by TikTok users, enables Simultaneous Scene Encoding, a functionality that sends independent groups of scenes to an NVIDIA Encoder (NVENC), contributing to shorter video export times without affecting image quality. This technology performs over 2x faster on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 graphics cards versus on Apple\u2019s M2 Ultra. \n \n  \n Tests were conducted by CapCut using CapCut v2.2.0 (beta) on desktops equipped with GeForce RTX 4090 to export 180s 4K 60fps H.264 video. Video exporting was accelerated.\nAdvanced users can move footage to their preferred desktop video editing app using native GPU-acceleration and RTX technology. This includes AV1 dual encoders (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti graphics cards or higher required) for 40% better video quality for livestreamers, while video editors can slash export times nearly in half. \nJanice.Journal Gets AI Art Blanche\nJanice.Journal, a self-taught 3D creator, was motivated to learn new art skills as a way to cope with her busy schedule. \n\u201cI was going through a tough time during my junior year of college with classes and clubs,\u201d she said. \u201cWith no time to hang out with friends or decompress, my only source of comfort was learning something new every night for 20 minutes.\u201d\nHer passion for 3D creation quickly became evident. While Janice.Journal does consulting work during the day, she deep-dives into 3D creation at night, creating stunning scenes and tutorials to help other artists get started. \nOne of her recent projects involved using the free NVIDIA Canvas beta app, which uses AI to interpret basic lines and shapes, translating them into realistic landscape images and textures. \n\nIn the above video, Janice.Journal aimed to create the \u201cEighth Wonder of the World,\u201d a giant arch inspired by the natural sandstone formations in Arches National Park in Utah.\n\u201cI love NVIDIA Canvas! When I was a kid I always wanted to draw or create complex backgrounds but was never able to. So, it\u2019s funny how I\u2019m now able to turn my simple doodles into fully HD images using Canvas AI.\u201d \u2014 Janice.Journal\n\u201cI wanted to create something that looked familiar enough where you could conceive to see it on \u2018National Geographic\u2019 but would still seem fantastical, awe-inspiring and simultaneously make the viewer question if it was real or fake,\u201d said Janice.Journal. \n  \n NVIDIA Canvas AI-assisted painting.\nUsing Canvas\u2019s 20 material brushes and nine style images, each with 10 variations, Janice.Journal got to work. \n\n\n\n\nShe said she \u201cgot a bit carried away\u201d on Canvas, resulting in an incredible masterpiece.\n\n\n\n\nJanice.Journal then had the option to export her painting into either a PNG or layered PSD file format to import into graphic design apps like Adobe Photoshop.\n  \n \u201cThe Eighth Wonder of the World.\u201d\nCanvas is especially useful for concept artists looking to rapidly explore new ideas and for architects aiming to quickly draft backdrops and environments for buildings. With Canvas, Janice.Journal could rapidly paint a landscape without having to search for hours for the perfect stock photo, saving her valuable time to hone her 3D skills instead.\n\u201cI\u2019m still blown away trying it out for myself,\u201d said Janice.Journal. \u201cSeeing my simple drawings turn into fully HD images is wild \u2014 it really reminds me that the future is now.\u201d\nDownload NVIDIA Canvas, free for NVIDIA GeForce RTX graphics cards owners. \nA Better Blender Render With AI\nJanice.Journal\u2019s portfolio features bright, vibrant visuals with a soft touch. Her 3D scene \u201cGameboy\u201d features two levels \u2014 no, not gaming levels, but living quarters built into a Gameboy, bringing to life every child\u2019s dream.\n  \n Would you love to live here?\nMost artists start with a rough physical sketch to get concepts on paper, then move to Blender to block out basic shapes and sculpt models in finer detail. \n\n\n\n\nAI shines at this point in the workflow. Janice.Journal\u2019s GeForce RTX 3090 GPU-powered system unlocks Blender\u2019s Cycles RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in the viewport, reducing noise and improving interactivity in the viewport for fluid movement with photorealistic visuals. \n  \n Work-in-progress \u2018Gameboy\u2019 render. \n\u201cSimply put, GPU acceleration and AI allow me to see renders in real time as they process modeling, lighting and the entire environment, enabling a preview as if I were to hit \u2018render\u2019 right away,\u201d said Janice.Journal. \u201cIt makes life 10 times easier for me.\u201d\nJanice.Journal has also been experimenting with AI-generated images as a way to brainstorm concepts and push creative boundaries \u2014 in her opinion, the most optimal use of AI. \n\n\n\n\nOnce everything has been modeled, Janice.Journal adds textures by playing around in Blender, applying clay shaders or displacement modifiers for \u201cbumpier\u201d textures. Then, she adds lighting and finishing touches to complete the ambience of the scene.\n  \n 3D artist Janice K. Lee, a.k.a.

And while the chipmaker ended the period up a whopping 562%, the ride was far from easy. Let's explore what Nvidia's next five years could look like and decide if now is a good time to bet on the stock.\u00a0\nA new period of super-growth and competition\u00a0\nAnalysts at Price Waterhouse Coopers expect artificial intelligence (AI) to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 as it is used across industries to boost productivity, stimulate consumer demand and drive innovation.\u00a0Over the next five years, Nvidia is poised to benefit massively from this megatrend. While the company doesn't offer consumer-facing generative AI applications, it boasts an impressive 80% market share in AI-capable GPU chips such as the A100 and H100, which train and power applications like ChatGPT.\u00a0\n\nThe AI impacts are already showing in Nvidia's operational results. Revenue jumped 101% year over year to $13.5 billion, based on a surge in data center chip sales for generative AI applications. Investors should expect the company to report a high top-line growth rate for the next few years as AI usage becomes more entrenched in the economy. With that said, it won't necessarily be an easy road ahead.\u00a0\nCompetitors like\u00a0Amazon\u00a0and\u00a0Advanced Micro Devices\u00a0are working on their own AI-capable chips that can compete with Nvidia. And the company will have to work hard to protect its\u00a0economic moat\u00a0against new entrants. Rising competition could lead to margin pressure, and Nvidia will have to rely on research and development to maintain its lead.\u00a0\nThe weaker segments could eventually recover\nOver the last few quarters, Nvidia has faced significant pressure in its gaming segment, where it sells graphics processing units (GPUs) often used for video game PCs and cryptocurrency mining. This business has faced consumer pressures like inflation and rising interest rates, which lower peoples' spending power and encourage them to shop for cheaper (often used) chips instead of Nvidia's latest offerings.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, this segment might have finally bottomed. And in the second quarter, it began showing signs of recovery, with sales up 22% to $2.49 billion. Over the next five years, it looks likely that microeconomic challenges will ease further, creating a pathway for Nvidia's highly cyclical gaming segment to exit from its current slump. The company could also boost growth by implementing AI technology.\u00a0\nIn the second quarter, the company released its Nvidia Cloud Engine for Games, a customizable AI service to help game developers build and deploy advanced speech and animation within their projects. This unique venture could help boost growth and diversify Nvidia's gaming segment revenue outside graphics hardware.\u00a0\nNvidia may grow into its high valuation\nAfter surging by a whopping 225% year to date, Nvidia's stock has undoubtedly become quite expensive. With a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 109, Nvidia's shares dwarf the S&P 500\u00a0average of 25. But Nvidia's GPU business is also surging, so the company looks set to grow into its valuation, which means its financial performance should catch up to its stock price. When looking at earnings projected 12 months into the future), Nvidia's (forward) P/E drops to just 42, which is not unreasonable for a rapidly expanding industry leader with a strong moat.\nInvestors should not expect Nvidia's stock price to maintain an extreme growth rate over the next five years, or mirror its performance over last 12 months, because much of the company's business expansion is already priced-in. Instead, the stock will probably move slower as its valuation returns to historical norms. However, the chipmaker's current valuation may not fully account for its long term potential -- especially if the artificial intelligence boom lives up to analysts' expectations, which means the stock still has ample room for growth and possibly continue to outperform broader benchmarks in the near term. While we just don't yet know how big the AI opportunity will be, Nvidia will almost certainly play a big role by virtue of its industry-leading hardware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Specifically, many believe this next big-time winner may come from a company associated with artificial intelligence (AI), just like Nvidia.\nOne company that some point to is Snowflake (SNOW -1.90%), as its data cloud software is incredibly useful for developing AI models. But does Snowflake have the same level of upside as Nvidia? Let's take a look.\nSnowflake has a critical role in the AI arms race\nSnowflake's software is designed to help its clients handle large datasets. Whether that data is structured, semi-structured, or unstructured, Snowflake helps optimize and store it across the client's cloud provider. Additionally, it can seamlessly migrate this data to another cloud provider if the client wants to switch. This is incredibly useful in its own right. Otherwise, cloud providers would be able to lock users into unreasonable contracts.\nOnce a customer has deployed Snowflake and begun collecting data, it has tools to drive applications from the data and keep its integrity through cybersecurity offerings. Perhaps the most intriguing application of Snowflake is that dataset owners can sell their information on Snowflake's marketplace. This has massive AI implications, as AI models are incredibly complex and require as much information as possible to be accurate. Many AI model creators don't have access to all of the data they want, but with Snowflake, they can find information to start or supplement a model.\n\nOnce customers sign on with Snowflake, they usually expand their spending significantly. In Q2 of FY 2024 (ending July 31), Snowflake's customers spent $142 for every $100 they spent last year. This is an artifact of Snowflake's billing model, which charges its customers on a consumption basis. The pay-as-you-go model aligns Snowflake's interests with its clients'. Still, if the economy starts to struggle and various management teams look to cut expenses, Snowflake may see a decrease in usage as changing usage frequency could save on costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall in Q2, Snowflake's revenue grew by 36% to $640 million. That's strong growth for any company but not quite Nvidia's 100%-plus growth. So that's one strike against Snowflake from becoming the next Nvidia. However, revenue is just one piece of the puzzle. There are also profits to consider.\nSnowflake is massively unprofitable\nAs for profitability, Snowflake is a long way away from generating any profit. In Q2, its operating expenses totaled $741 million, up 39% from last year. That's faster than revenue growth, so Snowflake's profitability is moving in the wrong direction. But with a 42% operating loss margin already, the company has found itself in a rather deep hole.\n\nSNOW Operating Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts\nBut Snowflake isn't in danger of going out of business, either. Because it heavily supplements its employees' salaries with stock-based compensation, it's free-cash-flow positive. In Q2, it shelled out nearly $300 million in stock-based compensation, which caused its share count to rise by 3% year over year. Investors should keep an eye on this, as Snowflake can claim some sense of profitability, but investors must be aware that this isn't true profitability.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, when it comes to valuation, Snowflake is far from a cheap stock. At 22 times sales, it tips the scales as one of the most expensive software stocks. That's a steep price to pay for Snowflake, and it conveys the sky-high expectations that are built into the stock.\nSo, to answer whether Snowflake can become the next Nvidia-like stock, I'd say no. Snowflake isn't growing fast enough, has no sense of profitability, and is quite expensive already. But does that mean you should avoid the stock completely? I don't think so. Snowflake has a massive upside because of its strong position in the data cloud. However, because of the uncertainty provided by the unprofitability and high valuation, I'd keep your position size relatively small.\n\n\n\nKeithen Drury has positions in Snowflake.

Image: BethesdaSean Hollister is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.I\u2019m not ready to upgrade my PC. Would I pay $20 a month to rent one that lives in the cloud? Starfield is the first game that\u2019s actually making me consider the possibility.Today, Starfield arrived on Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now, a service that lets you tap into an RTX 4080-equivalent GPU, and I spent a little time benchmarking the hard-to-run game. It absolutely looks and plays better than it did on my aging 1440p desktop, and looks great handheld.This reads 56 fps, but I saw as low as 47 fps when turning around at this spot. Click for larger image. Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The VergeIt\u2019s not a silver bullet. I currently have wired gigabit fiber optic internet and live only a few towns over from Nvidia\u2019s west coast servers. Even then, the game doesn\u2019t currently run as smoothly as it does on the highest-end gaming PCs. In the city of New Atlantis, I saw dips down to 47 and 48 frames per second no matter my graphics settings or resolution, because many worlds are fundamentally limited by your CPU speeds.RelatedTesting Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now RTX 4080, the most advanced cloud gaming platform yetHow well does Starfield run on PC?But in the cyberpunk core of Neon, I never saw a dip below 60fps at 4K resolution and Ultra spec, regardless of whether I simply walked through town or provoked a battle. It\u2019s so much smoother than my 5600X / 3060 Ti desktop machine.(By default, GeForce Now sets the game to Ultra with FSR2 enabled, at 75 percent render resolution. I got 70-80fps in Neon\u2019s core that way \u2014 consistently 10fps higher than native resolution.)Yes, you can see the sun with GeForce Now. Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The VergeOn other worlds, and in lighter firefights, my cloud gaming framerate was far north of 60fps at Ultra spec. I do still need to test on Masada III, though.Right now, you\u2019re probably wondering about my headline. If it\u2019s so great, why\u2019s it also a \u201cworst way to play\u201d? How can it be \u201cbest\u201d if high-end PCs run the game better? Well, some people might prefer to play this game handheld, and I\u2019d take this experience over Starfield on a Steam Deck or ROG Ally:Don\u2019t get me started on the Razer Edge\u2019s pricing or 5G, though. Photo by Sean Hollister / The VergeWith GeForce Now, you can stream to most any system you\u2019ve got, and it\u2019s wild to seeBut the minor tragedy of Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now is that you won\u2019t experience any of what I\u2019m talking about unless you cough up cash first.I decided to give GeForce Now\u2019s free tier a try, too, and Starfield is basically unplayable that way. After sitting nearly half an hour waiting for the game to load, sync my cloud saves, and compile its shaders, I was greeted with graphics like this:The gun is still loading in. Wait for it... wait for it... full-size image here. Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The VergeAppropriate caption. Full-size image here. Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The VergeNot to mention scary error messages:Oh boy. Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The VergeIt\u2019s an embarrassment. I would be ashamed to put this free trial out into the world as a sample of cloud gaming. Nvidia, do you really think this will convince anyone to pay?If you\u2019re interested and have good internet, I highly recommend you try the Ultimate tier for a month \u2014 and make sure to manually set your GeForce Now resolution to 4K even if your monitor is only capable of 1440p.I must have bumped the mouse between these shots, but you can get the idea if you look closely.  Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The VergeFull-res image here. Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The VergeNvidia\u2019s streaming quality is noticeably better when it\u2019s got more render resolution to work with; I saw all kinds of muddiness and jaggies at 1440p that utterly vanished at 4K.See More: EntertainmentGamingHands-onMobileNvidiaPC GamingReviewsTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Until...ByKarl Freund, Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Founder and Principal Analyst,\nCambrian-AI Research LLCFollow AuthorSep 11, 2023, 12:00pm EDTShareSaveCommentIn the latest inference processing MLPerf benchmark contest, Gaudi 2 came surprisingly close to Nvidia H100. But Nvidia promised faster software soon, which is a constantly changing picture. \n\nIn the latest round of AI benchmarks, all eyes were on the new Large Language Model (LLM) results. While the updated recommendation benchmarks are essential, inference processing is widely expected to surpass training over the next few years as LLM models become ingrained in almost every enterprise application. As expected, Nvidia H100 was the fastest, but surprisingly, Habana Labs, acquired by Intel in 2019 for $2B, showed remarkably well.\n\n\nBut just before the virtual bell rang, Nvidia announced new inference software not used in the testing that can double the performance of the H100 and other Nvidia GPUs. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nIntel: Two Chips for Two Markets\nIntel is convinced that there are two markets for AI processing power. One is for dedicated AI infrastructure, where the Habana Labs Gaudi is a strong contender, and the other is for more casual use of AI as one tool out of many workloads that a CPU like Xeon will provide adequate performance.\n\nIntel describes two different use models for AI.  While Self-serving, they are totally accurate.Intel\nOK, we buy that argument ultimately, as we firmly believe that AI techniques will become ubiquitous across the IT landscape over the next five years. Interestingly, the other major CPU vendor, AMD, is nowhere to be seen in this discussion; AMD still needs to add the AI capabilities (such as matrix operations) to AMD EPYC CPUs that Intel has imbued into Xeon.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of September 2023By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of September 2023By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nThe performance of the HBM-equipped Xeon Max 9480 CPU came in at about half the performance of its DRAM-based Xeon 8480+ CPU. When asked about these results, an Intel spokesperson pointed to the lack of fp8 support at this time for the Max CPU. The benchmarks were run using fp16. But for anyone hoping that the Max CPU could help lower the high costs of inferencing huge LLMs, that\u2019s not the case.\n\nBut what about, as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang calls it, \u201cAI Cloud\u201d and \u201cAI Factories\u201d? Here\u2019s where the Habana Gaudi2 comes in, at least for AI Cloud. AI Factories need faster networking than Gaudi2 has with 100Gb Ethernet and the ability to treat a large fabric of accelerators as one, which is the case with NVLink-connected GPUs.\n\n\nBut AI Cloud includes inference processing where the Gaudi2 does remarkably well, coming in 2.4 times faster than an NVIDIA A100 and close to parity compared to the H100 Hopper GPU.Gaudi2 stands as today's only viable alternative to NVIDIA.Intel\nFor training, Intel showed off the Gaudi2 last July, and it also did quite well with one hand tied behind its back. The software for the chip had yet to take advantage of the ~2X performance boost made possible with FP8 precision quantization, a feature the company promised would be unveiled in September. We expect to see updates on this at the Intel Innovation event on September 19-20 later this month. As you can see below, Habana hopes that adding FP8 will help Gaudi2 exceed H100 performance in training.The Gaudi2 performed quite will in training in last July's results.Intel\nGaudi2 is manufactured on a TSMC 7nm manufacturing node but still competes quite well with NVIDIA\u2019s 5nm Hopper GPU. An apples-to-apples comparison could come soon, as a Habana spokesperson indicated the 5nm Gaudi3 could be announced: \u201cvery soon.\u201d Perhaps at Intel Innovation? We will see.\nNvidia: Still the best, with more to come.\nNot to be outdone, Nvidia shared results that demonstrate why they remain the one to beat. As always, the company ran and won every benchmark. No surprise there. Most interesting was the first submission for Grace Hopper, the Arm CPU, and Hopper GPU Superchip, which has become the Nvidia fleet's flagship for AI inferencing.NVIDIA had four key messages from its 3.1 release.NVIDIA\nNote that in these benchmarks, while the H100 is clearly the fastest, the competition also continues to improve. Both Intel and Qualcomm showed excellent results fueled by software improvements. The Qualcomm Cloud AI100 results were achieved using a fraction of the power consumed by the rest of the party.Note that NVIDIA continues to be the only company that runs all the MLPerf benchmarks.  And for good ... [+] reason: they win every single benchmark.NVIDIA\nGrace Hopper: Look Ma! No (x86) CPU!\nThe Grace Hopper results beat the H100 results by up to 17%. Grace Hopper has more HBM and higher networking speed between the Arm CPUs and the GPU than is possible with an x86 CPU and a discreet Hopper. And Nvidia announced that it has enabled \u201cAutomatic Power Steering.\u201d No, this is not to steer your car; this steers the right amount of power to each chip to maximize performance at the lowest power consumption.\nBut 17% should not be a surprise. I had expected a more significant advantage. Nvidia indicated that we would soon learn how server configurations will change when OEMs bring out GH100-based servers next month. There will be no dual X86 CPUs, no PCIe card cages and potentially no off-package memory. Just the GH Superchip with HBM, a power supply, and a NIC. Done. The simplification afforded by Grace Hopper will substantially lower the costs of the server and inference processing; the CPU will essentially be free.The Grace Hopper Superchip performs well and will change the economics of LLM inferencing when OEMs ... [+] bring out servers next month.NVIDIA\nEnter New Software\nBut, unfortunately for competitors, Nvidia announced a new TensorRT for LLMs just last Friday, which they say doubled the performance of the H100 in inference processing after the benchmarks were submitted. Nvidia didn\u2019t have the software ready in time for MLPerf.TensorRT-LLM can dramatically change these benchmark results in six months.NVIDIA\nWhile the MLCommons peer review process has not verified this claim, it indicates the massive improvements in inference efficiency possible with clever software. GPUs need to be more utilized in inferencing today; that means there is a repository of opportunities Nvidia can mine. And there is nothing here that is proprietary to Nvidia; in fact, TensorRT-ML is open-source code, so in theory, Intel, AMD, and everyone else could implement the in-flight batch processing and other TensorRT-LLM concepts and realize some performance boost themselves.Theoretically this is what MLPerf would show if they re-ran the benchmarks today.Intel, Nvidia, and the Author\nFinally, talking about software, Nvidia has improved the performance of its edge AI Jetson platform by 60-80% since the MLPerf 3.0 benchmarks were run just six months ago. We would assume that the TensorRT-LLM could have an impact here, but this isn\u2019t a platform for LLMs today, but that could change as LLMs eat the world.The Jetson Orin gets new software that increased performance by 61-84%.NVIDIA\nConclusions\nSo, Nvidia won the MLPerf contest again, even without their new software. While Intel Gaudi2 looks competitive for training and inference, the latest Nvidia TensorRT-LLM software will take some of the shine off for Intel and, of course, for Google TPU v4. (Google did submit a TPUv5e result, but we did not feel it was significant.)\nBut this story is just getting started. Next up, Intel will uodate their software with float8 and bring out the 5nm Gaudi3, AMD will introduce the MI300 by the end of the year (but will likely and unfortunately shun the MLPerf benchmarks externally), and the Google TPUv5 will hopefully be available in time for the next training runs in 3 months.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Disclosures: This article expresses the opinions of the author, and is not to be taken as advice to purchase from nor invest in the companies mentioned.

The company\u00a0began operations in Bangalore almost two decades ago. The country is now home to four of its engineering development centers \u2014 in Gurugram, Hyderabad, Pune and Bengaluru \u2014 and there are now more than 3,800 NVIDIANs in India.\nIn addition, there are more than 320,000 India-based developers in NVIDIA\u2019s developer program. NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA parallel programming platform is downloaded roughly 40,000 times a month in India, and NVIDIA estimates there are 60,000 experienced CUDA developers in the country.\nThat growth comes as India\u2019s government continues to expand the nation\u2019s information technology infrastructure.\nFor example, a compute grid is expected to link 20 cities across the country soon, helping researchers and scientists collaborate and share data and computing resources more efficiently.\nThat effort, in turn, promises to help support India\u2019s ambitious development goals in the years to come.\nModi has set a target of 2030 for India to become the world\u2019s third-largest economy. It\u2019s currently the fifth largest.\nAnd Modi has set a target of 2047, the 100th anniversary of India\u2019s independence, for the South Asian nation to join the ranks of developed economies.\nAt a reception after the meeting with Modi (from left) Ajay Kumar Sood, principal scientific advisor to the Government of India, Sashikumaar Ganesan, chair of the Department of Computational & Data Sciences, IISc Bangalore, Huang and Vishal Dhupar, NVIDIA Managing Director, South Asia.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The new OCI Compute instances are designed to make running a variety of workloads\u2014from training, fine-tuning, and AI model inferencing to running cloud-native applications and video transcoding applications\u2014in the cloud more accessible to organizations while providing improved price-performance.\nThe upcoming OCI Compute instances based on next-generation NVIDIA GPUs will include:\n\nOCI Compute Bare Metal Instances Powered by NVIDIA H100 GPUs: Can help customers reduce the time it takes to train large AI models, such as those that power natural language processing and recommendation systems. Organizations using NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs have seen as much as a 30x improvement in performance for AI inference use cases and 4x better performance training AI models compared to using the previous generation of NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. For customers running intense computing workloads such as AI model training, OCI Supercluster enables them to connect tens of thousands of NVIDIA H100 GPUs over a high-performance, ultra-low latency cluster network. These instances are planned to be generally available in the Oracle Cloud London Region and Oracle Cloud Chicago Region later this year, with others expected to follow.\nOCI Compute Bare Metal Instances Powered by NVIDIA L40S GPUs: Will provide customers an alternative option for workloads such as AI inferencing or training small to medium AI models. These instances have been tested to deliver up to a 20% improvement in performance for generative AI workloads and up to a 70% improvement in fine-tuning models over the previous generation of NVIDIA A100 GPUs. The instances are planned to be available within the next year.\n\nThe upcoming OCI Compute Instances based on Ampere Computing CPUs will include:\n\nOCI Compute A2 Instances Powered by Ampere AmpereOne\u2122 CPUs: Are expected to deliver leading price-performance and the highest available processor core count in the industry\u2014320 cores in the bare metal shape and up to 156 cores in the flexible VM shape\u2014to power a variety of general-purpose cloud workloads including running web servers, transcoding video, and servicing CPU-based AI inference requests. The high core count available in these instances can support increased levels of performance, virtual machine density, and scaling to help customers more efficiently manage their computing workloads while reducing data center footprint and power consumption. These instances can also run flexible shapes for virtual machines to provide customers with granular options for the amount of processing power and memory to help maximize resource utilization and minimize costs while providing a simple and predictable pricing model. These instances are planned to be coming next year.\n\n\u201cOCI was one of the first cloud providers to offer bare metal instances natively which is a key part of our ability to make high-performance computing more accessible to organizations everywhere. By providing access to processors from NVIDIA and Ampere Computing in OCI, we are giving our customers the performance, efficiency, and flexibility they need in their cloud infrastructure to power anything from general purpose workloads all the way up to high-performance AI projects,\u201d said Donald Lu, senior vice president, software development, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. \u201cOracle is early to the market with cloud compute offerings designed specifically to support the development and use of AI. We are well-positioned to lead the cloud computing industry as the market grows by supporting the increasing number of AI providers and users.\u201d\n\u201cThe collaboration between NVIDIA and Oracle is helping democratize access to cutting-edge GPUs on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure,\u201d said Ian Buck, vice president of Hyperscale and High Performance Computing, NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA H100 and L40S GPUs on OCI will enable AI innovation with unprecedented performance, scalability, and security for customers across all verticals.\u201d\n\u201cOracle was the first cloud services provider to globally deploy compute instances based on Ampere processors,\u201d said Jeff Wittich, chief product officer, Ampere Computing. \u201cThis new generation of Ampere A2-based instances from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will provide up to an industry-leading 320 cores per instance for even better performance, workload density, and scale.\u201d\n\u201cThe upcoming OCI Compute instances, powered by NVIDIA GPUs, will give us the power we need to train and serve the next generation of industry-leading Cohere enterprise AI models,\u201d said Martin Kon, president and COO, Cohere. \u201cOracle's cloud provides reliable and powerful computing resources to build high-performance models that can be embedded into any application and used in a wide range of industries.\u201d\n\u201cTraining large language models on the MosaicML Platform requires thousands of NVIDIA GPUs running on OCI\u2019s bare metal compute instances, which leverage high-performance storage and ultrafast cluster networking,\u201d said Naveen Rao, vice president of Generative AI, Databricks. \u201cWe chose OCI for its superior price-performance for AI training and inferencing at scale and look forward to using the OCI Compute instances with NVIDIA H100 and L40S GPUs.\u201d\n\u201cUber is revolutionizing the way people and things move around cities. As part of a multicloud architecture, we leverage Oracle Cloud Infrastructure for critical workloads because of its superior security, performance, and flexibility,\u201d said Kamran Zargahi, senior director of tech strategy, Uber. \u201cWe use Standard and Dense I/O instances based on AMD processors, and plan to use OCI Compute with NVIDIA GPUs in the future.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAdditional Resources\n\nLearn more about Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\nLearn more about OCI Compute\nDig deeper into the instances based on NVIDIA H100 GPUs\nDig deeper into the instances based on NVIDIA L40S GPUs\nDig deeper into the instances based on Ampere AmpereOne\u2122 CPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Erickson\nOracle\nandrew.c.erickson@oracle.com\n+1.650.506.0111\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAbout Oracle\nOracle offers integrated suites of applications plus secure, autonomous infrastructure in the Oracle Cloud.

As the world becomes more computerized, it drives up demand for high-powered chips and software.\u00a0\nThe latest tech trend having an impact is the growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI). Organizations need the most powerful chips and software to power AI and distill intelligent insights from the ever-growing amount of data out there. As a result, top AI stocks are surging, with Nvidia (NVDA -2.53%) trading up 207% year to date, while C3.ai (AI -0.41%) has soared 152%.\nNvidia is the top supplier of data center chips and systems, while C3.ai provides mission-critical software to help companies design applications that take advantage of AI technology. But which of these AI leaders is the better investment for long-term investors? Let's find out.\n\nNvidia sees tremendous demand for its AI chips\nNvidia just wrapped up another impressive quarter of growth. Major cloud service providers are investing in Nvidia's H100 Tensor Core graphics processing units (GPUs) to expand their AI infrastructure. Management's efforts to increase chip supply suggest demand could remain high for the foreseeable future, which is consistent with long-term forecasts for AI spending by the International Data Corp. (IDC).\nWorldwide spending on AI-centric systems, such as hardware, software, and services needed for AI, is projected to grow nearly 27% this year to reach $154 billion, according to IDC. It's expected to exceed $300 billion by 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opportunity for Nvidia is massive. As IDC said in its report, \"Companies that are slow to adopt AI will be left behind.\" It's no surprise that Nvidia's revenue grew 101% year over year in the most recent quarter. Data center revenue specifically hit a new record of $10.3 billion and increased 171% versus the year-ago quarter. Companies are indeed terrified of being outmaneuvered by competitors, which is working to Nvidia's benefit.\u00a0\nThe quarter exceeded management's expectations, but executives' discussion on the recent earnings call about working with supply partners to meet demand suggests that growth could remain quite robust into 2024. CFO Colette Kress described the demand as \"tremendous and broad-based across industries and customers.\"\u00a0\nNvidia's chips are driving many areas of the economy that consumers might take for granted, like product recommendations, customer service chatbots, and faster product development cycles. The company is also involved in other markets that could provide solid growth over the long term, including making chips for gaming, autonomous driving, and graphics development for metaverse applications.\nAnalysts expect Nvidia to report total revenue of $16 billion this year, which is in line with company guidance. For the full year, revenue is on pace to roughly double over last year, and analysts see the company growing the top line another 48% next year.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC3.ai sees a big opportunity in generative AI\nC3.ai helps corporations and government agencies develop and manage large-scale AI applications. It serves leading companies across energy, financial services, utilities, defense, and more.\nHowever, by focusing almost exclusively on large organizations, the company might be limiting its growth compared to Nvidia. We can see this in the numbers. After posting a revenue increase of 38% in fiscal 2022 (which ends in April), revenue growth slowed to just 5.6% in fiscal 2023. The company recently reported flat sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\u00a0\nThe one area of strength for C3.ai has been U.S. defense, where bookings jumped 39% year over year in the most recent quarter. Management said its relationship with the U.S. Department of Defense is \"extensive and rapidly expanding.\" That suggests more growth is ahead, but the rest of the business is clearly not performing up to expectations.\nOne factor contributing to slowing growth is C3.ai's shift to a consumption-based model, where customers spend only on the resources they use. This means it is more exposed to the recent headwinds impacting cloud service providers as companies tighten their spending budgets on new services amid an uncertain economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, the growth from U.S. defense shows that C3.ai's technology is absolutely mission-critical. Many organizations will surely find the company's technology valuable, too, so C3.ai should see revenue accelerate again over the next few years. Businesses need to find ways to speed up data analysis, optimize resources, and make smarter forecasts, and that's basically what C3.ai's enterprise software provides.\nAnalysts currently anticipate revenue growing 15% this year before accelerating to about 20% in fiscal 2026. One big opportunity the company is seeing is in generative AI, which is behind popular text and image-based apps that are powered by AI like OpenAI's ChatGPT and DALL-E. During the recent earnings call, management noted that more companies and military leaders are interested in how they can use this technology to improve operational efficiency. C3.ai has closed 12 generative AI agreements so far, with a pipeline of over 140 more opportunities.\u00a0\nInvest in the more profitable business\nC3.ai can grow much faster than it is right now, but Nvidia is clearly the stronger of the two. What makes Nvidia a much better business is evident by looking at the profit it generates from sales of its products. Over the last year, Nvidia converted $0.31 of every dollar of revenue into a net profit. That's a high profit margin of 31%. Meanwhile, C3.ai produced a net loss of $261 million on $274 million of revenue.\u00a0\nBoth stocks have expensive valuations, but Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 41 based on analysts' earnings estimates is fair. Buying growth stocks at a P/E less than the percentage growth in earnings (its PEG ratio) can sometimes signal an undervalued stock.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll told, Nvidia is the better buy. It is more dominant in the AI chip market than C3.ai is in the AI software market. This explains why Nvidia's business is growing faster, is more profitable, and is generating better returns for shareholders.\n\n\n\nJohn Ballard has positions in Nvidia.

While the French agency doesn\u2019t mention Nvidia by name, it confirms it carried out a raid over concerns about anti-competitive practices in the graphics cards industry.Sources tell the WSJ that French authorities specifically targeted Nvidia, which has seen demand for its chips skyrocket in recent months. Several companies, including Microsoft and OpenAI, have purchased thousands of the company\u2019s high-end AI chips to power large language models.That massive demand resulted in a lot more money for Nvidia. The chipmaker reported earning a record revenue of $13.51 billion in its latest report, marking a 101 percent increase at the same time last year. Nvidia\u2019s valuation briefly crossed the trillion-dollar mark in May as a result of the AI boom.According to the WSJ, these types of raids occur early in the morning and have authorities \u201csearch a company\u2019s premises, seize physical and digital materials and interview employees who arrive for work.\u201d The French authority says it conducted the raid as part of its increased scrutiny on cloud technology, a topic the agency published a market study on in June.A machine-translated version of the French agency\u2019s press release says that dawn raids \u201cdo not pre-suppose the existence of a breach of the law,\u201d which is something \u201conly a full investigation\u201d can establish. Nvidia declined to comment on the story. However, a raid could suggest that Nvidia\u2019s reign in the chipmaking market isn\u2019t going unnoticed by global governments.See More: TechAntitrustBusinessNewsNvidiaPolicyPoliticsRegulationMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

By delivering these capabilities through a compact, AI-powered imaging system within the treatment room, Invenio aims to support rapid clinical decision-making.\n\u201cThis technology will help surgeons make intraoperative decisions when performing a biopsy or surgery,\u201d said Chris Freudiger, chief technology officer of Silicon Valley-based Invenio. \u201cThey\u2019ll be able to rapidly evaluate whether the tissue sample contains cancerous cells, decide whether they need to take another tissue sample and, with the AI models Invenio is developing, potentially make a molecular diagnosis for personalized medical treatment within minutes.\u201d\nQuicker diagnosis enables quicker treatment. It\u2019s especially critical for aggressive types of cancer that could grow or spread significantly in the weeks it takes for biopsy results to return from a dedicated pathology lab.\nInvenio is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a program that provides cutting-edge startups with technological support and AI platform guidance. The company accelerates AI training and inference using NVIDIA GPUs and software libraries.\nLaser Focus on Cancer Care\nThe NIO Laser Imaging System accelerates the imaging of fresh tissue biopsies.\nInvenio\u2019s NIO Laser Imaging System is a digital pathology tool that accelerates the imaging of fresh tissue biopsies. It\u2019s been used in thousands of procedures in the U.S. and Europe. In 2021, it received the CE Mark of regulatory approval in Europe.\nThe company plans to adopt the NVIDIA Jetson Orin series of edge AI modules for its next-generation imaging system, which will feature near real-time AI inference accelerated by the NVIDIA TensorRT SDK.\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a layer of AI models on top of our imaging capabilities to provide physicians with not just the diagnostic image but also an analysis of what they\u2019re seeing,\u201d Freudiger said. \u201cWith the AI performance provided by NVIDIA Jetson at the edge, they\u2019ll be able to quickly determine what kinds of cancer cells are present in a biopsy image.\u201d\nInvenio uses a cluster of NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs to train neural networks with tens of millions of parameters on pathologist-annotated images. The models were developed using the TensorFlow deep learning framework and trained on images acquired with NIO imaging systems.\n\u201cThe most powerful capability for us is the expanded VRAM on the RTX A6000 GPUs, which allows us to load large batches of images and capture the variability of features,\u201d Freudiger said. \u201cIt makes a big difference for AI training.\u201d\nOn the Path to Clinical Deployment\nOne of Invenio\u2019s AI products, NIO Glioma Reveal, is approved for clinical use in Europe and available for research use in the U.S. to help identify areas of cancerous cells in brain tissue.\nA team of Invenio\u2019s collaborators from the University of Michigan, New York University, University of California San Francisco, the Medical University of Vienna and University Hospital of Cologne recently developed a deep learning model that can find biomarkers of cancerous tumors with 93% accuracy in 90 seconds.\nWith this ability to analyze different molecular subtypes of cancer within a tissue sample, doctors can predict how well a patient will respond to chemotherapy \u2014 or determine whether a tumor has been successfully removed during surgery.\nBeyond its work on brain tissue analysis, Invenio this year announced a clinical research collaboration with Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Lung Cancer Initiative to develop and validate an AI solution that can help evaluate lung biopsies. The AI model will help doctors rapidly determine whether collected tissue samples contain cancer.\nLung cancer is the world\u2019s deadliest form of cancer, and in the U.S. alone, lung nodules are found in over 1.5 million patients each year. Once approved for clinical use, Invenio\u2019s NIO Lung Cancer Reveal tool aims to shorten the time needed to analyze tissue biopsies for these patients.\nAs part of this initiative, Invenio will run a clinical study before submitting the NVIDIA Jetson-powered AI solution for FDA approval.\nSubscribe to NVIDIA healthcare news.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Embedded Computing | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | Jetson | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

To help meet this need, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure today announced general availability of NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs on OCI Compute, with NVIDIA L40S GPUs coming soon.\nNVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU Instance on OCI\nThe OCI Compute bare-metal instances with NVIDIA H100 GPUs, powered by the NVIDIA Hopper architecture, enable an order-of-magnitude leap for large-scale AI and high-performance computing, with unprecedented performance, scalability and versatility for every workload.\nOrganizations using NVIDIA H100 GPUs obtain up to a 30x increase in AI inference performance and a 4x boost in AI training compared with tapping the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU. The H100 GPU is designed for resource-intensive computing tasks, including training LLMs and inference while running them.\nThe BM.GPU.H100.8 OCI Compute shape includes eight NVIDIA H100 GPUs, each with 80GB of HBM2 GPU memory. Between the eight GPUs, 3.2TB/s of bisectional bandwidth enables each GPU to communicate directly with all seven other GPUs via NVIDIA NVSwitch and NVLink 4.0 technology. The shape includes 16 local NVMe drives with a capacity of 3.84TB each and also includes 4th Gen Intel Xeon CPU processors with 112 cores, as well as 2TB of system memory.\nIn a nutshell, this shape is optimized for organizations\u2019 most challenging workloads.\nDepending on timelines and sizes of workloads, OCI Supercluster allows organizations to scale their NVIDIA H100 GPU usage from a single node to up to tens of thousands of H100 GPUs over a high-performance, ultra-low-latency network.\nNVIDIA L40S GPU Instance on OCI\nThe NVIDIA L40S GPU, based on the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture, is a universal GPU for the data center, delivering breakthrough multi-workload acceleration for LLM inference and training, visual computing and video applications. The OCI Compute bare-metal instances with NVIDIA L40S GPUs will be available for early access later this year, with general availability coming early in 2024.\nThese instances will offer an alternative to the NVIDIA H100 and A100 GPU instances for tackling smaller- to medium-sized AI workloads, as well as for graphics and video compute tasks. The NVIDIA L40S GPU achieves up to a 20% performance boost for generative AI workloads and as much as a 70% improvement in fine-tuning AI models compared with the NVIDIA A100.\nThe BM.GPU.L40S.4 OCI Compute shape includes four NVIDIA L40S GPUs, along with the latest-generation Intel Xeon CPU with up to 112 cores, 1TB of system memory, 15.36TB of low-latency NVMe local storage for caching data and 400GB/s of cluster network bandwidth. This instance was created to tackle a wide range of use cases, ranging from LLM training, fine-tuning and inference to NVIDIA Omniverse workloads and industrial digitalization, 3D graphics and rendering, video transcoding and FP32 HPC.\nNVIDIA and OCI: Enterprise AI\nThis collaboration between OCI and NVIDIA will enable organizations of all sizes to join the generative AI revolution by providing them with state-of-the-art NVIDIA H100 and L40S GPU-accelerated infrastructure.\nAccess to NVIDIA GPU-accelerated instances may not be enough, however. Unlocking the maximum potential of NVIDIA GPUs on OCI Compute means having an optimal software layer. NVIDIA AI Enterprise streamlines the development and deployment of enterprise-grade accelerated AI software with open-source containers and frameworks optimized for the underlying NVIDIA GPU infrastructure, all with the help of support services.\nTo learn more, join NVIDIA at Oracle Cloud World in the AI Pavillion, attend this session on the new OCI instances on Wednesday, Sept. 20, and visit these web pages on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, OCI Compute, how Oracle approaches AI and the NVIDIA AI Platform.\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | Cloud Services | Events | Inference \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Long-term, this is good. Short-term, things could get messy.\n\tBy David Cahn \n\nPublished September 20, 2023\n\n\nThe Generative AI wave, which began last summer, has gone into hyperspeed. The catalyst for this double acceleration was Nvidia\u2019s Q2 earnings guide and subsequent beat. This signaled to the market an insatiable level of demand for GPUs and AI model training.\u00a0\nBefore Nvidia\u2019s announcement, consumer launches like ChatGPT, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion had raised AI into the public consciousness. With Nvidia\u2019s results, founders and investors were delivered empirical evidence that AI can generate billions of dollars of net new revenue. This has shifted the category into its highest gear yet.\u00a0\nWhile investors have extrapolated much from Nvidia\u2019s results\u2014and AI investments are now happening at a torrid pace and at record valuations\u2014a big open question remains: What are all these GPUs being used for? Who is the customer\u2019s customer? How much value needs to be generated for this rapid rate of investment to pay off?\nConsider the following: For every $1 spent on a GPU, roughly $1 needs to be spent on energy costs to run the GPU in a data center. So if Nvidia sells $50B in run-rate GPU revenue by the end of the year (a conservative estimate based on analyst forecasts), that implies approximately $100B in data center expenditures. The end user of the GPU\u2014for example, Starbucks, X, Tesla, Github Copilot or a new startup\u2014needs to earn a margin too. Let\u2019s assume they need to earn a 50% margin. This implies that for each year of current GPU CapEx, $200B of lifetime revenue would need to be generated by these GPUs to pay back the upfront capital investment. This does not include any margin for the cloud vendors\u2014for them to earn a positive return, the total revenue requirement would be even higher.\n\nBased on public filings, much of the incremental data center build-out is coming from big tech companies: Google, Microsoft and Meta, for example, have reported increased data center CapEx. Reports indicate that Bytedance, Tencent and Alibaba are big Nvidia customers as well. On a go-forward basis, companies like Amazon, Oracle, Apple, Tesla and Coreweave should also be important contributors.\u00a0\nThe important question to be asking is: How much of this CapEx build out is linked to true end-customer demand, and how much of it is being built in anticipation of future end-customer demand? This is the $200B question.\nThe Information has reported that OpenAI is generating $1B in annual revenue. Microsoft has said it expects to generate $10B in AI revenue from products like Microsoft Copilot. Let\u2019s assume Google will generate a similar amount of revenue from its AI products, such as Duet and Bard. Let\u2019s also assume Meta and Apple each generate $10B in revenues from AI. Let\u2019s use a $5B placeholder for Oracle, Bytedance, Alibaba, Tencent, X and Tesla. These are all dummy assumptions\u2014the point is that even if you assume extremely generous gains from AI, there\u2019s a $125B+ hole that needs to be filled for each year of CapEx at today\u2019s levels.\u00a0\nThere is a large opportunity for the startup ecosystem to fill this hole. Our goal is to \u201cfollow the GPUs\u201d and find the next generation of startups that leverage AI technology to create real end-customer value. We want to invest in these companies.\nThe goal of this analysis is to highlight the gap that we see today. AI hype has finally caught up to the deep learning technology breakthroughs in development since 2017. This is good news. A major CapEx buildout is happening. This should bring AI development costs down dramatically over the long-term. You used to have to buy a server rack to build any application. Now you can use the public clouds at a much lower cost. Likewise, today many AI companies are using a large portion of their venture capital on GPUs. As today\u2019s supply constraints give way to a supply glut, the cost of running AI workloads will come down. This should spur more product development. It should also attract more founders to build in this space.\nDuring historical technology cycles, overbuilding of infrastructure has often incinerated capital, while at the same time unleashing future innovation by bringing down the marginal cost of new product development. We expect this pattern will repeat itself in AI.\nFor startups, the takeaway is clear: As a community, we need to shift our thinking away from infrastructure and towards end-customer value. Happy customers are a fundamental requirement of every great business. For AI to have an impact, we need to figure out how to leverage this new technology to make people\u2019s lives better. How can we translate these amazing innovations into products that customers use every day, love and are willing to pay for?\u00a0\nThe AI infrastructure build out is happening. Infrastructure is not the problem anymore. Many foundation models are being developed\u2014this is not the problem anymore, either. And the tooling in AI is pretty good today. So the $200B question is: What are you going to use all this infrastructure to do? How is it going to change people\u2019s lives?\u00a0\nIf you are building in this space, we\u2019d love to hear from you.

But he keeps it as a reminder of a job that taught him some key skills needed in his customer-focused role as a senior solutions architect at NVIDIA.\nA native of Bulgaria, Cvetanov came to the U.S. 15 years ago to attend the University of Georgia. When he graduated amid an economic downturn, it was challenging to find work \u2014 and even harder to break into the tech industry without the typical experience or background of his peers.\nAfter his mom worked several jobs to support him through college, Cvetanov refused further financial support. Upon graduating, he took a job as a parking valet at an Atlanta hotel, dreaming of a career in tech as he worked 16-hour shifts.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t trade that struggle for anything because it taught me the value of humility, work ethic and connecting with people,\u201d he said. \u201cThose skills have helped me be successful in my life today.\u201d\n\nHe continued parking cars until one day, his big break came from a tech recruiter who called looking for a Spanish-speaking customer service specialist. Cvetanov, who graduated from a Spanish-speaking high school in Sofia, Bulgaria, and minored in Spanish in college, fit the bill and was hired immediately.\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t get that call, my whole life would have been different,\u201d he said.\nHoping to transition into a technical role, he stayed late, shadowing engineers and completing certifications. Eventually, he became an escalation engineer, troubleshooting high-severity customer outages. There, his work with customers grew in him a passion for pre-sales engineering. At his next company, he took the lead in developing an AI practice for his engineering team and attended an NVIDIA GTC conference, which inspired him to later join the company in 2017.\nBringing People Together at NVIDIA\nToday, Cvetanov leads customer adoption of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software portfolio. He enjoys bringing people together, and his predisposition for building long-lasting relationships across industries \u2014 combined with his genuine passion for NVIDIA and its mission \u2014 makes him a natural ambassador for the company.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never worked at a place like NVIDIA,\u201d he said. \u201cTeams work together seamlessly. Product teams value and implement feedback from their field teams. We lead with impact, and we accomplish amazing things together.\u201d\n\nPaying It Forward\u00a0\nCvetanov works to give younger generations the early career mentorship that he never had. Through his alma mater and other networking groups, he mentors youth and entry-level professionals, offering them resume advice or holding mock interviews.\n\u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be an immigrant and start your career with no one to help you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve gained mentors and seen the difference that they make in your life and career, so I\u2019m always willing to make myself accessible.\u201d\nCvetanov hopes to one day create an organization that brings technology to students in Eastern Europe, so they can learn about technical careers and gain the relevant skills.\nUntil then, seeing his old valet uniform every time he opens his closet stokes his determination to make sure anyone who crosses his path and seeks help won\u2019t have to do it all on their own.\nLearn more about NVIDIA life, culture and careers. \n\n\nCategories: Corporate | NVIDIA Life \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Video chat technology lets friends and family on different continents connect with ease. With voice command tools, AI assistants can play songs, initiate phone calls or recommend the best Italian food in a 10-mile radius. AI algorithms can even predict which show users may want to watch next or suggest an article they may want to read before making a purchase.\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that customers expect fast and personalized interactions with companies. According to a Salesforce research report, 83% of consumers expect immediate engagement when they contact a company, while 73% expect companies to understand their unique needs and expectations. Nearly 60% of all customers want to avoid customer service altogether, preferring to resolve issues with self-service features.\nMeeting such high consumer expectations places a massive burden on companies in every industry, including on their staff and technological needs \u2014 but speech AI can help.\nSpeech AI can understand and converse in natural language, creating opportunities for seamless, multilingual customer interactions while supplementing employee capabilities. It can power self-serve banking in the financial services industry, enable food kiosk avatars in restaurants, transcribe clinical notes in healthcare facilities or streamline bill payments for utility companies \u2014 helping businesses across industries deliver personalized customer experiences.\nSpeech AI for Banking and Payments\nMost people now use both digital and traditional channels to access banking services, creating a demand for omnichannel, personalized customer support. However, higher demand for support coupled with a high agent churn rate has left many financial institutions struggling to keep up with the service and support needs of their customers.\nCommon consumer frustrations include difficulty with complex digital processes, a lack of helpful and readily available information, insufficient self-service options, long call wait times and communication difficulties with support agents.\nAccording to a recent NVIDIA survey, the top AI use cases for financial service institutions are natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs). These models automate customer service interactions and process large bodies of unstructured financial data to provide AI-driven insights that support all lines of business across financial institutions \u2014 from risk management and fraud detection to algorithmic trading and customer service.\nBy providing speech-equipped self-service options and supporting customer service agents with AI-powered virtual assistants, banks can improve customer experiences while controlling costs. AI voice assistants can be trained on finance-specific vocabulary and rephrasing techniques to confirm understanding of a user\u2019s request before offering answers.\nKore.ai, a conversational AI software company, trained its BankAssist solution on 400-plus retail banking use cases for interactive voice response, web, mobile, SMS and social media channels. Customers can use a voice assistant to transfer funds, pay bills, report lost cards, dispute charges, reset passwords and more.\nKore.ai\u2019s agent voice assistant has also helps live agents provide personalized suggestions so they can resolve issues faster. The solution has been shown to improve live agent efficiency by cutting customer handling time by 40% with a return on investment of $2.30 per voice session.\nWith such trends, expect financial institutions to accelerate the deployment of speech AI to streamline customer support and reduce wait times, offer more self-service options, transcribe calls to speed loan processing and automate compliance, extract insights from spoken content and boost the overall productivity and speed of operations.\nSpeech AI for Telecommunications\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHeavy investments in 5G infrastructure and cut-throat competition to monetize and achieve profitable returns on new networks mean that maintaining customer satisfaction and brand loyalty is paramount in the telco industry.\nAccording to an NVIDIA survey of 400-plus industry professionals, the top AI use cases in the telecom industry involve optimizing network operations and improving customer experiences. Seventy-three percent of respondents reported increased revenue from AI.\nBy using speech AI technologies to power chatbots, call-routing, self-service features and recommender systems, telcos can enhance and personalize customer engagements.\nKT, a South Korean mobile operator with over 22 million users, has built GiGa Genie, an intelligent voice assistant that\u2019s been trained to understand and use the Korean language using LLMs. It has already conversed with over 8 million users.\nBy understanding voice commands, the GiGA Genie AI speaker can support people with tasks like turning on smart TVs or lights, sending text messages or providing real-time traffic updates.\nKT has also strengthened its AI-powered Customer Contact Center with transformer-based speech AI models that can independently handle over 100,000 calls per day. A generative AI component of the system autonomously responds to customers with suggested resolutions or transfers them to human agents for more nuanced questions and solutions.\nTelecommunications companies are expected to lean into speech AI to build more customer self-service capabilities, optimize network performance and enhance overall customer satisfaction.\nSpeech AI for Quick-Service Restaurants\nThe food service industry is expected to reach $997 billion in sales in 2023, and its workforce is projected to grow by 500,000 openings. Meanwhile, elevated demand for drive-thru, curbside pickup and home delivery suggests a permanent shift in consumer dining preferences. This shift creates the challenge of hiring, training and retaining staff in an industry with notoriously high turnover rates \u2014 all while meeting consumer expectations for fast and fresh service.\nDrive-thru order assistants and in-store food kiosks equipped with speech AI can help ease the burden. For example, speech-equipped avatars can help automate the ordering process by offering menu recommendations, suggesting promotions, customizing options or passing food orders directly to the kitchen for preparation.\nHuEx, a Toronto-based startup and member of NVIDIA Inception, has designed a multilingual automated order assistant to enhance drive-thru operations. Known as AIDA, the AI assistant receives and responds to orders at the drive-thru speaker box while simultaneously transcribing voice orders into text for food-prep staff.\nAIDA understands 300,000-plus product combinations with 90% accuracy, from common requests such as \u201ccoffee with milk\u201d to less common requests such as \u201ccoffee with butter.\u201d It can even understand different accents and dialects to ensure a seamless ordering experience for a diverse population of consumers.\nSpeech AI streamlines the order process by speeding fulfillment, reducing miscommunication and minimizing customer wait times. Early movers will also begin to use speech AI to extract customer insights from voice interactions to inform menu options, make upsell recommendations and improve overall operational efficiency while reducing costs.\nSpeech AI for Healthcare\nIn the post-pandemic era, the digitization of healthcare is continuing to accelerate. Telemedicine and computer vision support remote patient monitoring, voice-activated clinical systems help patients check in and receive zero-touch care and speech recognition technology supports clinical documentation responsibilities. Per IDC, 36% of survey respondents indicated that they had deployed digital assistants for patient healthcare.\nAutomated speech recognition and NLP models can now capture, recognize, understand and summarize key details in medical settings. At the Conference for Machine Intelligence in Medical Imaging, NVIDIA researchers showcased a state-of-the-art pretrained architecture with speech-to-text functionality to extract clinical entities from doctor-patient conversations. The model identifies clinical words \u2014 including symptoms, medication names, diagnoses and recommended treatments \u2014 and automatically updates medical records.\nThis technology can ease the burden of manual note-taking and has the potential to accelerate insurance and billing processes while also creating consultation recaps for caregivers. Relieved of administrative tasks, physicians can focus on patient care to deliver superior experiences.\nArtisight, an AI platform for healthcare, uses speech recognition to power zero-touch check-ins and speech synthesis to notify patients in the waiting room when the doctor is available. Over 1,200 patients per day use Artisight kiosks, which help streamline registration processes, improve patient experiences, eliminate data entry errors with automation and boost staff productivity.\nAs healthcare moves toward a smart hospital model, expect to see speech AI play a bigger role in supporting medical professionals and powering low-touch experiences for patients. This may include risk factor prediction and diagnosis through clinical note analysis, translation services for multilingual care centers, medical dictation and transcription and automation of other administrative tasks.\nSpeech AI for Energy\nFaced with increasing demand for clean energy, high operating costs and a workforce retiring in greater numbers, energy and utility companies are looking for ways to do more with less.\nTo drive new efficiencies, prepare for the future of energy and meet ever-rising customer expectations, utilities can use speech AI. Voice-based customer service can enable customers to report outages, inquire about billing and receive support on other issues without agent intervention. Speech AI can streamline meter reading, support field technicians with voice notes and voice commands to access work orders and enable utilities to analyze customer preferences with NLP.\nMinerva CQ, an AI assistant designed specifically for retail energy use cases, supports customer service agents by transcribing conversations into text in real time. Text is fed into Minerva CQ\u2019s AI models, which analyze customer sentiment, intent, propensity and more.\nBy dynamically listening, the AI assistant populates an agent\u2019s screen with dialogue suggestions, behavioral cues, personalized offers and sentiment analysis. A knowledge-surfacing feature pulls up a customer\u2019s energy usage history and suggests decarbonization options \u2014 arming agents with the information needed to help customers make informed decisions about their energy consumption.\nWith the AI assistant providing consistent, simple explanations on energy sources, tariff plans, billing changes and optimal spending, customer service agents can effortlessly guide customers to the most ideal energy plan. After deploying Minerva CQ, one utility provider reported a 44% reduction in call handling time, a 12.5% increase in first-contact resolution and average savings of $2.67 per call.\nSpeech AI is expected to continue to help utility providers reduce training costs, remove friction from customer service interactions and equip field technicians with voice-activated tools to boost productivity and improve safety \u2014 all while enhancing customer satisfaction.\nSpeech and Translation AI for the Public Sector\nBecause public service programs are often underfunded and understaffed, citizens seeking vital services and information are at times left waiting and frustrated. To address this challenge, some federal- and state-level agencies are turning to speech AI to achieve more timely service delivery.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency uses automated speech recognition systems to manage emergency hotlines, analyze distress signals and direct resources efficiently. The U.S. Social Security Administration uses an interactive voice response system and virtual assistants to respond to inquiries about social security benefits and application processes and to provide general information.\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs has appointed a director of AI to oversee the integration of the technology into its healthcare systems. The VA uses speech recognition technology to power note-taking during telehealth appointments. It has also developed an advanced automated speech transcription engine to help score neuropsychological tests for analysis of cognitive decline in older patients.\nAdditional opportunities for speech AI in the public sector include real-time language translation services for citizen interactions, public events or visiting diplomats. Public agencies that handle a large volume of calls can benefit from multilingual voice-based interfaces to allow citizens to access information, make inquiries or request services in different languages.\nSpeech and translation AI can also automate document processing by converting multilingual audio recordings or spoken content into translated text to streamline compliance processes, improve data accuracy and enhance administrative task efficiency. Speech AI additionally has the potential to expand access to services for people with visual or mobility impairments.\nSpeech AI for Automotive\u00a0\nFrom vehicle sales to service scheduling, speech AI can bring numerous benefits to automakers, dealerships, drivers and passengers alike.\nBefore visiting a dealership in person, more than half of vehicle shoppers begin their search online, then make the first contact with a phone call to collect information. Speech AI chatbots trained on vehicle manuals can answer questions on technological capabilities, navigation, safety, warranty, maintenance costs and more. AI chatbots can also schedule test drives, answer pricing questions and inform shoppers of which models are in stock. This enables automotive manufacturers to differentiate their dealership networks through intelligent and automated engagements with customers.\nManufacturers are building advanced speech AI into vehicles and apps to improve driving experiences, safety and service. Onboard AI assistants can execute natural language voice commands for navigation, infotainment, general vehicle diagnostics and querying user manuals. Without the need to operate physical controls or touch screens, drivers can keep their hands on the wheel and eyes on the road.\nSpeech AI can help maximize vehicle up-time for commercial fleets. AI trained on technical service bulletins and software update cadences lets technicians provide more accurate quotes for repairs, identify key information before putting the car on a lift and swiftly supply vehicle repair updates to commercial and small business customers.\nWith insights from driver voice commands and bug reports, manufacturers can also improve vehicle design and operating software. As self-driving cars become more advanced, expect speech AI to play a critical role in how drivers operate vehicles, troubleshoot issues, call for assistance and schedule maintenance.\nSpeech AI \u2014 From Smart Spaces to Entertainment\nSpeech AI has the potential to impact nearly every industry.\nIn Smart Cities, speech AI can be used to handle distress calls and provide emergency responders with crucial information. In Mexico City, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime is developing a speech AI program to analyze 911 calls to prevent gender violence. By analyzing distress calls, AI can identify keywords, signals and patterns to help prevent domestic violence against women. Speech AI can also be used to deliver multilingual services in public spaces and improve access to transit for people who are visually impaired.\nIn higher education and research, speech AI can automatically transcribe lectures and research interviews, providing students with detailed notes and saving researchers the time spent compiling qualitative data. Speech AI also facilitates the translation of educational content to various languages, increasing its accessibility.\nAI translation powered by LLMs is making it easier to consume entertainment and streaming content online in any language. Netflix, for example, is using AI to automatically translate subtitles into multiple languages. Meanwhile, startup Papercup is using AI to automate video content dubbing to reach global audiences in their local languages.\nTransforming Product and Service Offerings With Speech AI\nIn the modern consumer landscape, it\u2019s imperative that companies provide convenient, personalized customer experiences. Businesses can use NLP and the translation capabilities of speech AI to transform the way they operate and interact with customers in real time on a global scale.\nCompanies across industries are using speech AI to deliver rapid, multilingual customer service responses, self-service features and information and automation tools to empower employees to provide higher-value experiences.\nTo help enterprises in every industry realize the benefits of speech, translation and conversational AI, NVIDIA offers a suite of technologies.\nNVIDIA Riva, a GPU-accelerated multilingual speech and translation AI software development kit, powers fully customizable real-time conversational AI pipelines for automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech and neural machine translation applications.\nNVIDIA Tokkio, built on the NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine, offers cloud-native services to create virtual assistants and digital humans that can serve as AI customer service agents.\nThese tools enable developers to quickly deploy high-accuracy applications with the real-time response speed needed for superior employee and customer experiences.\nJoin the free Speech AI Day on Sept. 20 to hear from renowned speech and translation AI leaders about groundbreaking research, real-world applications and open-source contributions.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Driving | ResearchTags: Agriculture and Food | Artificial Intelligence | Conversational AI | Education | Energy | Financial Services | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Media and Entertainment | NVIDIA Research | Public Sector | Riva | Smart Spaces | Telecommunications \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Alexandra Garfinkle   \u00b7 Senior Reporter  September 6, 2023 2 min read        101   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.20%       Speaking to a standing-room-only crowd at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Tech Conference on Tuesday, Nvidia (NVDA) exec Manuvir Das outlined some startling numbers on the market for artificial intelligence. According to Das, the total addressable market for AI will consist of $300 billion in chips and systems, $150 billion in generative AI software, and $150 billion in omniverse enterprise software. These figures represent growth over the \"long term,\" Das said, though he did not specify a target date. The grand total adds up to a $600 billion AI-fueled market opportunity that is tied to what Nvidia calls \"accelerated computing.\" \"It's not just about the chips, it's about the whole stack,\" said Das, Nvidia's vice president of enterprise computing.   Despite the recent boom in AI since last November, Nextdoor CEO Sarah Friar said that the value of AI has been building for years. \"It's not a new thing,\" Friar told Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi at the Communacopia conference. \"ChatGPT unleashed generative AI and really brought it in, I think, to the cultural domain. But of course, we've all been investing in data for now decades, and we're starting to see it come to fruition.\"  Still, Das explained that when it comes to accelerated computing, the industry is still in its early stages. \"If you think about the traditional computing systems based on CPU computing, what has changed over the decades is simply the location \u2014 you're in the cloud, you're doing it on your phone, but it's essentially the same style of computing,\" Das told the audience. \"And more and more, the functions of companies are being done in computing. That means you need more and more computing in the world, which means you need more data centers. You need more energy. You need more horsepower, and it's just not sustainable.\" The way Das described it, Nvidia is capitalizing on an inevitability the company has been preparing for, in which corporate operations go digital and grow more efficient in previously unimaginable ways. \"It's time to start on a more sustainable trajectory,\" Das added. \"We're saying [with] accelerated computing, which is with the same footprint, we can do 10 times, 100 times the work \u2014 that's going to be the only way.\"   Rodolfo Campos uses a virtual reality headset in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 1, 2017. (SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)  \u00b7 AFP Contributor via Getty Images Investors seem to agree. Nvidia stock has soared 232% to all-time highs this year, powered by blowout earnings and its pole position in the AI space. \"The simplest way of thinking about Nvidia is that we made this big bet,\" Das said. \"It's been decades in the making.\"   Story Continues Read more coverage of the 2023 Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Tech conference:CrowdStrike CEO: 'Microsoft is always going to be a competitor' Visa CEO: Consumer spending showing 'stability, resiliency' -Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

However, many of these tasks do not always require the full performance and resources of a high-end GPU. This underutilization of GPU resources leads to inefficiencies, increased costs, and unpredictable performance. There is an imperative demand for a solution that facilitates the flexible allocation of GPU resources to accommodate diverse workloads, ensuring optimal utilization, cost efficiency, and consistent performance for every user and application. This need shows how important tools like NVIDIA\u2019s Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) are. They help solve these problems and make GPUs work better in different situations.\nIn 2020, NVIDIA launched a feature called Multi-Instance GPU (MIG). The feature lets you split a GPU into several smaller, separate parts. It\u2019s great for tasks that don\u2019t use up all the GPU\u2019s power. With MIG, you can have many tasks running at the same time on one GPU, making the most of its capabilities.\nIn this blog post, we dive deep into optimizing GPU performance using NVIDIA\u2019s Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Our focus is on amplifying performance by running more pods per GPU, especially for intensive tasks like AI and high-performance computing (HPC). We walk you through a detailed guide on setting up, configuring, and mastering NVIDIA MIG on Amazon EKS. Through real-world case studies, we\u2019ll showcase the remarkable boosts in performance and cost-efficiency achieved with this method. By the conclusion of this piece, you\u2019ll be well-equipped to harness the full potential of your GPU resources on Amazon EKS using NVIDIA MIG.\nIntroduction to Multi-Instance GPU\nNVIDIA\u2019s Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) is a feature introduced with the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU. It allows a single A100 GPU to be partitioned into multiple GPU instances, each with its own dedicated resources like GPU memory, compute, and cache. MIG provides strict isolation, allowing multiple workloads to run on a single GPU without interfering with each other, ensuring predictable performance.\nMIG allows you to precisely adjust the GPU resources allocated to your tasks. With this feature, you\u2019re assured a consistent quality of service, ensuring stable response times and performance. This ensures that tasks can share GPU resources smoothly, without any disruptions.\nMIG offers the following benefits:\n\nResource efficiency:\u00a0\n\nMaximizes GPU utilization by allowing multiple workloads to share a single GPU.\n \nPredictable performance:\u00a0\n\nEach GPU instance operates in isolation, ensuring consistent performance for each workload.\n \nFlexibility:\u00a0\n\nMIG can be configured to create GPU instances of various sizes to match workload requirements.\n \nCost-efficiency:\u00a0\n\nFor businesses, it can lead to cost savings as they can get more out of their existing GPU infrastructure.\n \nEnhanced security:\n\nEach MIG partition gets it\u2019s own dedicated memory and compute cores, ensuring different workloads do not interfere with each other thereby reducing the attack surface.\n \n\nMulti-Instance GPU (MIG) on Amazon EKS offers a transformative approach to handling diverse workloads. It empowers users to run multi-tenant clusters efficiently, allowing both smaller models to be colocated with larger ones, optimizing resource utilization. By deploying models on the same instance, network latency is significantly reduced, ensuring faster data processing and real-time insights. Furthermore, ML scientists can take advantage of these capabilities to run their notebooks more efficiently, streamlining their research and development processes\nMIG for Kubernetes\nA significant number of customers prefer Kubernetes for managing their ML tasks. Kubernetes offers a robust and scalable system for scheduling, making it simpler to coordinate workloads across a cluster of virtual machines. Additionally, the active Kubernetes community has developed tools like Kubeflow, streamlining the process of constructing, deploying, and overseeing ML pipelines.\nHowever, the integration of MIG within Kubernetes remains under-explored, largely due to its complex nature. The challenge is amplified when considering the prerequisites for MIG on Kubernetes, which include the installation of the NVIDIA driver, NVIDIA container runtime, and specific device plugins.\n\nSolution overview\nThe starting point of the solution is an EKS cluster. We\u2019ll create a cluster with one\u00a0P4d.24xlarge instance.\nWe\u2019ll use NVIDIA GPU operator to automatically partition A100 GPUs in a P4d.24xlarge instance.\nNVIDIA GPU Operator is a tool that eases the process of deploying, configuring, and monitoring GPU resources within Kubernetes. It eliminates the complexities associated with setting up MIG on Kubernetes by automating essential tasks. Its based on the operator framework within Kubernetes.\nAfter deploying the GPU Operator on Amazon EKS, you can label the nodes to define specific partition strategies for Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) usage. Labeling nodes is a way to tag them with specific attributes or characteristics. By doing so, you can create custom partitioning strategies tailored to your application needs. For instance, you might label nodes to allocate a specific portion of the GPU for lightweight tasks and another portion for more intensive computations. This labeling process provides fine-grained control over GPU resource allocation, allowing users to optimize for specific workloads, whether it\u2019s ML training, inference, or any other GPU-intensive task. In essence, with the GPU Operator and node labeling, Amazon EKS users can harness the full potential of NVIDIA GPUs, ensuring that they get the best performance and efficiency out of their GPU-enabled clusters.\u201c\nPrerequisites\n\nHelm v3\nkubectl\naws cli\neksctl\nAmazon EKS v1.25 or later\n\nSolution walkthrough\nCreate an EKS cluster using eksctl\n\ncat << EOF > mig-cluster.yaml\napiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5\nkind: ClusterConfig\nmetadata:\n  name: p4d-cluster\n  region: eu-west-1\nmanagedNodeGroups:\n  - name: demo-gpu-workers\n    instanceType: p4d.24xlarge\n    minSize: 1\n    desiredCapacity: 1\n    maxSize: 1\n    volumeSize: 200\nEOF\neksctl create cluster -f mig-cluster.yaml\n\n\nInstall GPU Operator on Amazon EKS using Helm (Package manager for kubernetes)\n\nhelm repo add nvidia https://helm.ngc.nvidia.com/nvidia \\\n && helm repo update\n\nhelm upgrade gpuo \\\n   nvidia/gpu-operator \\\n   --set driver.enabled=true \\\n   --namespace kube-system \n   --set mig.strategy=mixed \\\n   --set devicePlugin.enabled=true \\\n   --set migManager.enabled=true \\\n   --set migManager.WITH_REBOOT=true \\\n   --set toolkit.version=v1.13.1-centos7 \\\n   --set operator.defaultRuntime=containerd \\\n   --set gfd.version=v0.8.1 \\\n   --set devicePlugin.version=v0.14.0 \\\n   --set migManager.default=all-balanced\n\n\nThe provided Helm command is designed to upgrade a deployment named gpuo using the nvidia/gpu-operator chart.\nLet\u2019s decipher the specific parameters set within the command:\n\ndriver.enabled=true\n\nThis enables the NVIDIA GPU driver.

You can see the label by describing the node:\n\nkubectl describe node \n\n\nSetting Up MIG partitions in Kubernetes\nNVIDIA offers two distinct approaches to showcase MIG-partitioned devices within a Kubernetes node. The first, known as the \u201csingle strategy,\u201d displays only one kind of MIG device across all GPUs on a node. On the other hand, the \u201cmixed strategy\u201d permits the creation of various MIG devices of different sizes across all the GPUs present on a node.\n\nWith the MIG single strategy, you can create MIG devices of the same size. For instance, on a P4d.24XL, the options include creating 56 slices of 1g.5gb, 24 slices of 2g.10gb, 16 slices of 3g.20gb, or a single slice of either 4g.40gb or 7g.40gb.\nSuppose we have several teams working on simulations and deep learning. With the MIG single strategy, you can give each team the GPU power they need, making the most of the P4d.24XL. This approach is great when all tasks need the same amount of GPU and when tasks can run at the same time.\nOn the other hand, the mixed strategy offers more flexibility. It lets you combine different-sized slices, such as a few 1g.5gb slices with some 2g.10gb and 3g.20gb slices. This approach is particularly beneficial when your cluster handles tasks with diverse GPU needs.\nThe mixed strategy is beneficial when managing a range of workloads with distinct GPU demands. This approach is especially valuable when tasks necessitate adaptable GPU resource distribution.\nConsider an AI startup comprising three specialized teams. Using the mixed strategy, the startup can customize GPU allocations to precisely match each team\u2019s requirements. For example, the image recognition team might be assigned two 1g.5gb slices, the natural language processing team could use two 2g.10gb slices, while the video analytics team benefits from three 3g.20gb slices \u2014 all operating concurrently on a singular GPU.\nCreate MIG devices with a single strategy\nLet\u2019s dive into setting up a single strategy and integrating it with Kubernetes. With the NVIDIA GPU Operator, setting up MIG partitions is easy. The process is straightforward: Simply label the node, and the rest is taken care of. The MIG manager operates as a daemonset across all nodes. Once it identifies node labels, it gets to work creating MIG devices.\nTo set up 1g.5gb MIG devices on all GPUs, label a node as follows (ensure to replace $NODE with your cluster\u2019s specific node):\n\nkubectl label nodes $NODE nvidia.com/mig.config=all-1g.5gb --overwrite\n\nWhen you label the node like this, two changes occur. First, the node won\u2019t show any full GPUs, and the nvidia.com/gpu label will read \u201c0\u201d. Second, the node will display 56 MIG devices of size 1g.5gb.\n\nkubectl describe node $NODE\n\nOutput:\n\n...\n nvidia.com/gpu: 0\n nvidia.com/mig-1g.5gb: 56\n...\n\n\nNOTE:\u00a0Keep in mind that the changes might not be immediate; they could take a short while to apply. During this transition, the node will carry the label nvidia.com/mig.config.state=pending. After the MIG manager finishes the partitioning process, this label will change to nvidia.com/mig.config.state=success.\nCreate a deployment that uses MIG devices\n\ncat << EOF > mig-1g-5gb-deployment.yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: mig1.5\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: mig1-5\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: mig1-5\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: vectoradd\n        image: nvidia/cuda:8.0-runtime\n        command: [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\"]\n        args: [\"nvidia-smi && tail -f /dev/null\"]\n        resources:\n          limits:\n            nvidia.com/mig-1g.5gb: 1\nEOF\n\n\nThe pod should go into running state, and it should consume 1x 1g.5gb MIG device.\n\nkubectl get deployments.apps mig1.5\n\nOutput:\n\nIf we try to scale the deployment to 100 replicas, only 56 pods will actually be running. This is because the node has the capacity for just 56 MIG devices of 1g.5gb size, given that it has eight GPUs with seven MIG slices each.\nScale the deployment\n\nkubectl scale deployment mig1.5 --replicas=100\nkubectl get deployments.apps mig1.5\n\n\n\nExec into one of the containers and run nvidia-smi to view allocated GPU resources.\n\nkubectl exec <YOUR MIG1.5 POD> -ti -- nvidia-smi\n\n\nAs you can see, this pod has only 5GB GPU memory.\nLet\u2019s scale the deployment down to 0:\n\nkubectl scale deployment mig1.5 --replicas=0\n\nMIG devices with mixed strategy\nIn the single strategy, every MIG device was set at 1g.5gb. Now, let\u2019s adjust the GPUs so that each node can handle various MIG device setups. The MIG manager relies on a configmap to keep track of the MIG settings. When we labeled the node as all-1g.5gb, the MIG partition editor referred to this configmap to decide on the partition layout.\n\nkubectl describe configmaps default-mig-parted-config\n\nOutput:\n\n..\n\n  all-1g.5gb:\n    - devices: all\n      mig-enabled: true\n      mig-devices:\n        \"1g.5gb\": 7\n\n...\n\n\nThe configmap also features profiles such as all-balanced. Using the all-balanced profile, each GPU is partitioned into two units of 1g.10gb, one unit of 2g.20gb, and one unit of 3g.40gb MIG devices. If you have specific needs, you can even craft your own profile by tweaking the configmap.\nall-balanced MIG profile:\n\nkubectl describe configmaps default-mig-parted-config\n\n...\n  all-balanced:\n    - device-filter: [\"0x20B010DE\", \"0x20B110DE\", \"0x20F110DE\", \"0x20F610DE\"]\n      devices: all\n      mig-enabled: true\n      mig-devices:\n        \"1g.5gb\": 2\n        \"2g.10gb\": 1\n        \"3g.20gb\": 1\n...\n\n\nLabel the node to use all-balanced MIG profile:\n\nkubectl label nodes $NODE nvidia.com/mig.config=all-balanced --overwrite\n\nAfter the node displays the label nvidia.com/mig.config.state=success, if you inspect the node\u2019s details, you\u2019ll notice several MIG devices listed within it.\n\nkubectl describe node $NODE\n\n...\n\n nvidia.com/mig-1g.5gb: 16\n nvidia.com/mig-2g.10gb: 8\n nvidia.com/mig-3g.20gb: 8\n\n...\n\n\nUsing the all-balanced profile, the P4d.24XL node has the capacity to operate 16 pods of 1g.5gb, 8 pods of 2g.20gb, and 8 pods of 3g.20gb.\nTo verify this, let\u2019s initiate two more deployments. The first will consist of pods utilizing a 2g.10gb MIG device, and the second will employ a 3g.10gb MIG device.\nCreate the deployments\n\ncat << EOF > mig-2g-10gb-and-3g.20gb-deployments.yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: mig2-10\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: mig2-10\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: mig2-10\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: vectoradd\n        image: nvidia/cuda:8.0-runtime\n        command: [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\"]\n        args: [\"nvidia-smi && tail -f /dev/null\"]\n        resources:\n          limits:\n            nvidia.com/mig-2g.10gb: 1\n---\n\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: mig3-20\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: mig3-20\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: mig3-20\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: vectoradd\n        image: nvidia/cuda:8.0-runtime\n        command: [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\"]\n        args: [\"nvidia-smi && tail -f /dev/null\"]\n        resources:\n          limits:\n            nvidia.com/mig-3g.20gb: 1\nEOF\n\nkubectl apply -f mig-2g-10gb-and-3g.20gb-deployments.yaml\n\n\nAfter the pods from these deployments are active, increase the count for all three deployments to 20 replicas each.\n\nkubectl scale deployments mig1.5 mig2-10 mig3-20 --replicas=20\n\nLets see how many replicas start running\n\nkubectl get deployments\n\n\nLet\u2019s examine the amount of GPU memory allocated to a pod with 3g.20gb:\n\nkubectl exec mig3-20-<pod-id> -ti -- nvidia-smi\n\nAs anticipated, the pod is allocated 20GB of GPU memory.\n\nClean up\nDelete the cluster and the node group:\n\neksctl delete cluster <CLUSTER_NAME>\n\nConclusion\nThis blog explains how to set up GPUs with NVIDIA\u2019s Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) for use on Amazon EKS. While setting up MIG on Kubernetes might seem a bit tricky, the NVIDIA GPU Operator makes it much easier by handling the setup and organization. Thanks to MIG and the tools NVIDIA provides, those in machine learning can make better use of their GPUs. They can run more tasks on each GPU and use their resources more efficiently. This means they can handle bigger ML projects and get better results. In short, using NVIDIA\u2019s MIG lets you get the most out of your GPUs for your machine learning needs.\nResources\n\nMulti-Instance GPU \u2014 NVIDIA Cloud Native Technologies documentation\nNVIDIA Multi-Instance GPU User Guide :: NVIDIA Tesla Documentation\nNVIDIA GPU Operator Overview \u2014 NVIDIA Cloud Native Technologies documentation\nGPU Operator with MIG \u2014 NVIDIA Cloud Native Technologies documentation\nSupporting MIG in Kubernetes\nChallenges Supporting MIG in Kubernetes\nSteps to Enable MIG Support in Kubernetes\n\n\n\n\n\n         TAGS: \n        Amazon EKS, EC2, GPU, Performance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Resources\n\n\nAmazon Container Services\nAWS Fargate\nAmazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)\nAmazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)\nAmazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)\nAWS Cloud Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Follow\n\n\n\u00a0Twitter\n\u00a0Facebook\n\u00a0LinkedIn\n\u00a0Twitch\n\u00a0RSS Feed\n\u00a0Email Updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Sign In to the Console \n\n Learn About AWS\n\nWhat Is AWS?\nWhat Is Cloud Computing?\nAWS Accessibility\nAWS Inclusion, Diversity & Equity\nWhat Is DevOps?\nWhat Is a Container?\nWhat Is a Data Lake?\nWhat is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\nWhat is Generative AI?\nWhat is Machine Learning (ML)?\nAWS Cloud Security\nWhat's New\nBlogs\nPress Releases\n\n\n\n Resources for AWS\n\nGetting Started\nTraining and Certification\nAWS Solutions Library\nArchitecture Center\nProduct and Technical FAQs\nAnalyst Reports\nAWS Partners\n\n\n\n Developers on AWS\n\nDeveloper Center\nSDKs & Tools\n.NET on AWS\nPython on AWS\nJava on AWS\nPHP on AWS\nJavaScript on AWS\n\n\n\n Help\n\nContact Us\nGet Expert Help\nFile a Support Ticket\nAWS re:Post\nKnowledge Center\nAWS Support Overview\nLegal\nAWS Careers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Create an AWS Account \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n          Amazon is an Equal Opportunity Employer: \n          Minority / Women / Disability / Veteran / Gender Identity / Sexual Orientation / Age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\nBahasa Indonesia\nDeutsch\nEnglish\nEspa\u00f1ol\nFran\u00e7ais\nItaliano\nPortugu\u00eas\nTi\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t\nT\u00fcrk\u00e7e\n\u03a1\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\n\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\n\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\n\u4e2d\u6587 (\u7b80\u4f53)\n\u4e2d\u6587 (\u7e41\u9ad4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy\n|\nAccessibility\n|\nSite Terms\n|\n Cookie Preferences \n|\n\u00a9 2024, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates.

He now shares his vast 3D knowledge with over 77,000 subscribers.\nMost recently, Matosevic created a 3D spaceship in Blender that he later enhanced in Omniverse through virtual reality.\n\nIndividual creators aren\u2019t the only ones seeing success with Blender and USD. Multimedia entertainment studio Moment Factory creates OpenUSD-based digital twins to simulate their immersive events \u2014 including live performances, multimedia shows and interactive installations \u2014 in Omniverse with USD before deploying them in the real world.\nMoment Factory\u2019s interactive installation at InfoComm 2023.\nTeam members can work in the digital twin at the same time, including designers using Blender to create and render eye-catching beauty shots to share their creative vision with customers.\nSee how Moment Factory uses Omniverse, Blender and USD to bring their immersive events to life in their recent livestream.\nThese 3D workflow enhancements are available to all. Blender users and USD creators, including Boehmer, showcased their unique 3D pipeline on this recent Omniverse community livestream:\n\nNew Features Deliver Elevated 3D Experience\nThe latest USD improvements in Blender are the result of collaboration among many contributors, including AMD, Apple, Unity and NVIDIA, enabled by the Blender Foundation.\nFor example, hair object support \u2014 which improves USD import and export capabilities for digital hair \u2014 was added by a Unity software engineer. And a new Python IO callback system \u2014 which lets technical artists use Python to access USD application programming interfaces \u2014 was developed by a software engineer at NVIDIA, with support from others at Apple and AMD.\nNVIDIA engineers are continuing to work on other USD contributions to include in future Blender updates.\nComing soon, the Blender 4.0 Alpha 201.0 Omniverse Connector will offer new features for USD and Omniverse users, including:\n\nUniversal Material Mapper 2 add-on: This allows for more complex shader networks, or the blending of multiple textures and materials, to be round-tripped between Omniverse apps and Blender through USD.\nImproved UsdPreviewSurface support and USDZ import/export capabilities: This enables creators to export 3D assets for viewing in AR and VR applications.\nGeneric attribute support: This allows geometry artists to generate vertex colors \u2014 red, green or blue values \u2014 or other per-vertex (3D point) values and import/export them between Blender and other 3D applications.\n\nLearn more about the Blender updates by watching this tutorial:\n\nGet Plugged Into the Omniverse\u00a0\nLearn from industry experts on how OpenUSD is enabling custom 3D pipelines, easing 3D tool development and delivering interoperability between 3D applications in sessions from SIGGRAPH 2023, now available on demand.\nAnyone can build their own Omniverse extension or Connector to enhance their 3D workflows and tools. Explore the Omniverse ecosystem\u2019s growing catalog of connections, extensions, foundation applications and third-party tools.\nShare your Blender and Omniverse work as part of the latest community challenge, #StartToFinish. Use the hashtag to submit a screenshot of a project featuring both its beginning and ending stages for a chance to be featured on the @NVIDIAStudio and @NVIDIAOmniverse social channels.\nTo learn more about how OpenUSD can improve 3D workflows, check out a new video series about the framework.

As a theoretical grown-up with a mortgage and a husky who eats me out of house and home, I think my days of buying ultra-powerful GPUs like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 are numbered. And you know what? I\u2019m okay with that.The main reason I\u2019m becoming less enthused about cutting-edge graphics cards isn\u2019t just down to the credit card-obliterating costs involved. The best cloud gaming services keep making real strides as broadband quality and global internet infrastructure improve. As such, my current favorite streaming option has led to me turning on my powerful gaming rig less and less.I\u2019ve written a lot about Nvidia GeForce Now during my time here at Tom\u2019s Guide, because it\u2019s a service I\u2019m unapologetically passionate about. I\u2019m a subscriber to its premium \u2018Ultimate\u2019 tier, which gives you access to a cloud version of an RTX 4080 for $20 / \u00a318 per month. As a graphics-obsessed rube who sunk $2,000 into his 4090 a year ago, my depleted bank balance wishes I\u2019d embraced the power of the cloud before making such a financially unwise investment.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nThe best cloud gaming services in 2025\n\n\n\n\nI'm so excited by the AI advances of the RTX 5090 I'm ditching my 4090 \u2014 here's why\n\n\n\nAs a graphics-obsessed rube who sunk $2,000 into his 4090, I wish I'd embraced the power of the cloud sooner\"I\u2019ve previously messed around with Nvidia GeForce Now Ultimate on a $120 laptop, and the results blew me away. Over the past few days, though, I\u2019ve taken the experience to the next level by installing the GeForce Now app on my brand new LG G3 OLED TV. And yes, I shouldn\u2019t be let within 500ft of a credit card application ever again.My wincesome monthly payments are a bed I willingly jumped into. And you know what? After experiencing some of the best PC games on one of the best OLED TVs in the world at 4K / 60 fps on GeForce Now Ultimate, I\u2019d max out my credit card again in a heartbeat.Not that I\u2019d recommend regular Tom\u2019s Guide readers should do this \u2014 I\u2019m just cursed with the impulse control of a small, tech-obsessed child.Doom with a view(Image credit: Future)Playing games in Ultra HD at high frame rates on brilliant games like Doom Eternal, Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Cyberpunk 2077 on one of the brightest OLED panels is an astonishing experience. And for the record, playing Starfield on the LG G3 OLED looks pretty dang sweet, too.But the real, far more accessible appeal of GeForce Now is you don\u2019t need anywhere near this level of display tech to enjoy your Steam or Xbox Game Pass libraries on Team Green\u2019s streaming service. That\u2019s kind of the whole point.Provided you have solid to strong broadband (Nvidia recommends minimum connection speeds of 45 Mbps to stream games in 4K at PS5-toppling frame rates), you could go wild in a Steam sale, then enjoy your games from the comfort of a couch on your main TV via GeForce Now Ultimate.Not that streaming games through Ultimate doesn\u2019t have its flaws\"Not that streaming games through Ultimate doesn\u2019t have its flaws. Despite having 1TB full fiber optic, I can still feel noticeable input delay while playing titles, be it those in my Steam or GOG Galaxy libraries.It\u2019s definitely not a game-breaking issue, but compared to playing locally on my ultrawide Alienware AW3423DWF QD-OLED gaming monitor, the lag is a lot more noticeable on Nvidia\u2019s streaming platform.I still think the trade-off is just about worth it, though, because the visual fidelity you get through a good internet connection with Ultimate is stronger than Thor after he\u2019s binged on a dozen protein bars. I notice no visible video artifacting while streaming games through my OLED TV, and picture quality remains pretty much pristine at all times.The future is Now(Image credit: Future)As a market leader in the GPU space, Nvidia is hardly going to stop manufacturing high-ends cards overnight, even if subs for GeForce Now shot through the stratosphere.Yet there is a sense that, like with Microsoft and its approach to consumers playing Xbox titles through non-native hardware, the company probably wouldn\u2019t be devastated if certain gamers started forgoing buying its high-end silicon in favor of a monthly Nvidia streaming fee.In the here and now, having a cloud-based RTX 4080 at your disposal at least gives PC gamers the opportunity to venture down a different avenue. Thanks to advances in cloud gaming, you can now experience cutting edge, triple-A titles where the issue of lag has become far less of a problem since the failed experiment of Google Stadia.Will GeForce Now Ultimate stop Nvidia from producing and selling top-end GPUs at eye-watering prices anytime soon? Of course not. At the end of the day, that remains the company\u2019s (hugely profitable) bread and butter.Still, I\u2019m all for a future of gaming where anyone with decent internet bandwidth can enjoy experiences that aren\u2019t a million miles off what the best gaming PCs can currently produce.More from Tom's GuideI just played Cyberpunk 2077 at 60 fps on a $120 laptop \u2014 here\u2019s howThe best cloud gaming services todayThe best Steam games to play right now\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nnvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (14)\n\n\n\nDave MeiklehamSocial Links NavigationUK Computing EditorDave is a computing editor at Tom\u2019s Guide and covers everything from cutting edge laptops to ultrawide monitors.

No one does. You have a gigabit and despite having a gigabit it's still not fast enough to handle cloud gaming with an acceptable amount of latency. Why is this? Well it's simple really. No matter how much Nvidia pay you to write this clearly sponsored content that you'll make residuals off of through your affiliate links, it'll never be enough money to overcome the laws of physics.\n\nCloud gaming will always have latency. It will never compare to running on local hardware. You could live next door to the data centre and it would still be noticeable.\n\nYou seem to forget that the core demographic or your readership are technically competent and know these things. Perhaps you should try writing for the Daily Mail.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwoubulbus\n\n\nFirestone said:A video card is useless without a computer.

The good news is policies and practices in place today provide excellent starting points.\nIndeed, the way forward lies in extending the existing foundations of enterprise and cloud security. It\u2019s a journey that can be summarized in six steps:\n\nExpand analysis of the threats\nBroaden response mechanisms\nSecure the data supply chain\nUse AI to scale efforts\nBe transparent\nCreate continuous improvements\n\nAI security builds on protections enterprises already rely on.\nTake in the Expanded Horizon\nThe first step is to get familiar with the new landscape.\nSecurity now needs to cover the AI development lifecycle. This includes new attack surfaces like training data, models and the people and processes using them.\nExtrapolate from the known types of threats to identify and anticipate emerging ones. For instance, an attacker might try to alter the behavior of an AI model by accessing data while it\u2019s training the model on a cloud service.\nThe security researchers and red teams who probed for vulnerabilities in the past will be great resources again. They\u2019ll need access to AI systems and data to identify and act on new threats as well as help building solid working relationships with data science staff.\nBroaden Defenses\nOnce a picture of the threats is clear, define ways to defend against them.\nMonitor AI model performance closely. Assume it will drift, opening new attack surfaces, just as it can be assumed that traditional security defenses will be breached.\nAlso build on the PSIRT (product security incident response team) practices that should already be in place.\nFor example, NVIDIA released product security policies that encompass its AI portfolio. Several organizations \u2014 including the Open Worldwide Application Security Project \u2014 have released AI-tailored implementations of key security elements such as the common vulnerability enumeration method used to identify traditional IT threats.\nAdapt and apply to AI models and workflows traditional defenses like:\n\nKeeping network control and data planes separate\nRemoving any unsafe or personal identifying data\nUsing zero-trust security and authentication\nDefining appropriate event logs, alerts and tests\nSetting flow controls where appropriate\n\nExtend Existing Safeguards\nProtect the datasets used to train AI models. They\u2019re valuable and vulnerable.\nOnce again, enterprises can leverage existing practices. Create secure data supply chains, similar to those created to secure channels for software. It\u2019s important to establish access control for training data, just like other internal data is secured.\nSome gaps may need to be filled. Today, security specialists know how to use hash files of applications to ensure no one has altered their code. That process may be challenging to scale for petabyte-sized datasets used for AI training.\nThe good news is researchers see the need, and they\u2019re working on tools to address it.\nScale Security With AI\nAI is not only a new attack area to defend, it\u2019s also a new and powerful security tool.\nMachine learning models can detect subtle changes no human can see in mountains of network traffic. That makes AI an ideal technology to prevent many of the most widely used attacks, like identity theft, phishing, malware and ransomware.\nNVIDIA Morpheus, a cybersecurity framework, can build AI applications that create, read and update digital fingerprints that scan for many kinds of threats. In addition, generative AI and Morpheus can enable new ways to detect spear phishing attempts.\nMachine learning is a powerful tool that spans many use cases in security.\nSecurity Loves Clarity\nTransparency is a key component of any security strategy. Let customers know about any new AI security policies and practices that have been put in place.\nFor example, NVIDIA publishes details about the AI models in NGC, its hub for accelerated software. Called model cards, they act like truth-in-lending statements, describing AIs, the data they were trained on and any constraints for their use.\nNVIDIA uses an expanded set of fields in its model cards, so users are clear about the history and limits of a neural network before putting it into production. That helps advance security, establish trust and ensure models are robust.\nDefine Journeys, Not Destinations\nThese six steps are just the start of a journey. Processes and policies like these need to evolve.\nThe emerging practice of confidential computing, for instance, is extending security across cloud services where AI models are often trained and run in production.\nThe industry is already beginning to see basic versions of code scanners for AI models. They\u2019re a sign of what\u2019s to come. Teams need to keep an eye on the horizon for best practices and tools as they arrive.\nAlong the way, the community needs to share what it learns. An excellent example of that occurred at the recent Generative Red Team Challenge.\nIn the end, it\u2019s about creating a collective defense. We\u2019re all making this journey to AI security together, one step at a time.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | ExplainerTags: Artificial Intelligence | Cybersecurity | Machine Learning | NGC | Trustworthy AI \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Photograph: Leah Millis/ReutersArtificial intelligence (AI) This article is more than 1 year oldMicrosoft president and Nvidia chief scientist testify in Senate AI hearingsThis article is more than 1 year oldSenator Richard Blumenthal urges risk-based approach to regulation as panel hears from companies at forefront of AI boomJohana BhuiyanTue 12 Sep 2023 21.40 BSTFirst published on Tue 12 Sep 2023 17.16 BSTShareMicrosoft and the chipmaker Nvidia are the latest companies to take the hot seat in a series of Senate judiciary hearings on artificial intelligence as the federal government continues to grapple with how to regulate the technology.Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith, and Nvidia\u2019s chief scientist, William Dally, are testifying on Tuesday alongside Woodrow Hartzog, a professor of law at Boston University School of Law.At the start of the hearing, Senator Richard Blumenthal urged a risk-based approach to regulating AI. Earlier this week, he and Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, introduced a bipartisan AI framework that would require companies to register with an independent oversight body that would be tasked with licensing high-risk AI technology. The proposal, the full text of which is not yet publicly available, also calls for Congress to clarify a section in the Communications Decency Act of 1996 that does not protect tech companies developing AI tools from liability and potential lawsuits.\u201cMake no mistake, there will be regulation,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cThe only question is how soon and what. It should be regulation that encourages the best in American free enterprise but at the same time provides the kind of protections that we do in other areas \u2026 We need to make sure that these protections are framed and targeted in a way that applies to the risk involved, risk-based rules.\u201dBoth Microsoft and Nvidia have been at the forefront of the AI boom, ramping up their investment in developing and utilizing aspects of the AI supply chain. Microsoft invested in a series of partnerships as well as its own in-house AI technology, Copilot. In addition to its $10bn investment in the ChatGPT owner, OpenAI, Microsoft partnered with Meta on the release and support of the social media platform\u2019s open-source large language model Llama 2. Nvidia, for its part, has benefited from its early investment and focus on building computer chips for AI systems, raking in more than $13bn in revenue in the second quarter. The 30-year-old company is now valued at $1tn and is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, with its chips powering many of the world\u2019s major AI tools including ChatGPT.As efforts to rein in these technologies continue, digital advocacy groups warn that tech companies cannot be trusted to regulate themselves and anything Congress comes up with should be cognizant of that.\u201cBig tech has shown us what \u2018self-regulation\u2019 looks like, and it looks a lot like their own self-interest,\u201d said Bianca Recto, communications director for Accountable Tech. \u201cSenators must go into this week\u2019s AI hearings with their eyes wide open \u2013 or risk once again getting fooled by savvy PR at the expense of our safety.\u201dIn opening testimony, both Microsoft and Nvidia commended the Senate on its work to create a legal framework that would require \u201chigh-risk\u201d AI to be certified by an oversight board, being sure to draw a distinction between advanced AI and less capable systems. However, Hartzog urged Congress to steer clear of half measures and industry-led approaches like \u201cencouraging transparency, mitigating bias, and promoting principles of ethics\u201d without also implementing means to enforce liability and other important regulatory mechanisms.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to commit to ethics, but industry doesn\u2019t have the incentive to leave money on the table for the good of society,\u201d Hartzog continued.While the industry representatives both agreed Congress was moving in the right direction, Nvidia\u2019s Dally said some fears, particularly doomsday concerns around AI systems becoming sentient, were unfounded. \u201cUncontrollable artificial general intelligence is science fiction and not reality,\u201d Dally said. \u201cAt its core, AI is a software program that is limited by its training, the inputs provided to it and the nature of its output. In other words, humans will always decide how much decision-making power to cede to AI models.\u201dThe companies were also asked to answer for concerns over the existing use of AI and how it is trained. Senator Amy Klobuchar asked Smith about how AI systems use content, particularly journalism.\u201cWe should let local journalists and publications make decisions about whether they want their content to be available for training,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe should certainly let them, in my view, negotiate collectively.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Blumenthal said Congress was facing a huge dilemma as deepfakes become more sophisticated and it gets harder to distinguish from authentic images, audio or videos. \u201cWe need to do something about it, we can\u2019t delude ourselves by thinking with a false sense of comfort that we\u2019ve solved the problem if we don\u2019t provide effective enforcement,\u201d Blumenthal. \u201cTo be very blunt, the Federal Elections Commission often has been less than fully effective in enforcing rules related to campaigns.\u201dHartzog suggested that Congress use several different tools and consider how surveillance advertising business models play a role in powering the technologies that allow \u201cthe lie to be created but flourish and to be amplified\u201d. \u201cI would think about rules and safeguards that limit those financial incentives.\u201dHawley also brought up questions of data privacy and protections for children who are using AI systems. Hawley asked Smith whether Microsoft would commit to raising the age limit to use AI systems from 13 to something older. \u201cI don\u2019t want any kids to be your guinea pig,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to learn from their failures. This is what happened with social media \u2026 which made billions of dollars giving our kids a mental health crisis.\u201dSmith first said Microsoft followed existing laws that restrict the use of child user data to advertise to them. He also said that 13 was not necessarily too young to use AI depending on what they want to use it for. \u201cWe want kids in a controlled way, with safeguards, to use tools \u2026\u201dThe hearing continues a big week for AI at the Capitol. On Wednesday, the Senate is hosting its first ever AI Forum, a closed-door meeting convened by Senator Chuck Schumer, who has invited several tech executives including Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and Nvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang .Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)MicrosoftUS SenateNvidianewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldUS politicsUKClimate crisisMiddle EastUkraineEnvironmentScienceGlobal developmentFootballTechBusinessObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
