A copy of the same can be\u00a0downloaded here. In the quarter, the Blue Tower Global Value had a -2.19% return net of fees (-1.94% gross). The rates on US government treasuries rose sharply this quarter as the Federal Reserve pushed back their predictions for interest rate decreases. This drop in long-term bond prices triggered a selloff in equity markets. In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2023.  Blue Tower Asset Management highlighted stocks like NVVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the third quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides computer graphics processors, chipsets, and related multimedia software. On December 19, 2023, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed at $496.04 per share. One-month return of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was -0.68%, and its shares gained 208.39% of their value over the last 52 weeks. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a market capitalization of $1.225 trillion. Blue Tower Asset Management made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter: \"In addition to the use of larger datasets, the training speed of AI models has increased dramatically. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s stock almost tripled in the first 3 quarters of this year with a 197% gain, and a large reason for this is the huge role they have played in recent AI improvements. Nvidia\u2019s single GPU AI training speed performance has increased by a dramatic 1000x in 10 years with only 2.5x coming from Moore\u2019s Law3 driven increases in chip density. Besides better chip manufacturing, there were three other improvement factors at play: simplifications in number representation for the weights of the neural networks, more complex mathematical instructions for reducing the computational overhead involved in mathematical calculations, and increased neuron sparsity (in neural networks, some neurons are useless and can be pruned from the network without reducing performance significantly). In addition to these single GPU improvements, Nvidia also made improvements in data center scale architecture that allows groups of GPUs to work more efficiently together.

However, given the\u00a0AI (Artificial Intelligence)-led opportunities and NVDA\u2019s leadership in this space, the stock may continue to rise in 2024.\u00a0\nThe company forecasts that its top line could triple in Q4 of the current fiscal year. Furthermore, this positive momentum is expected to be sustained into 2024, driven by robust demand across the Data Center segment.\u00a0\nAdditionally, the company is making substantial expansions to its supply chain, signaling continued strength in demand for the upcoming quarters. Against this backdrop, let\u2019s explore what the analysts suggest for Nvidia stock.\nNVDA Stock: Analysts Weigh In\nThe majority of analysts covering NVDA stock advocate purchasing it at current levels. On December 15, Bank of America Securities analyst Vivek Arya reaffirmed a Buy rating for Nvidia, designating it as his top semiconductor pick for 2024. Arya\u2019s optimistic outlook is reflected in his $700 price target, suggesting a substantial upside potential of 43.18%.\nWhile Nvidia stock has appreciated in value, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon finds its valuation attractive. Rasgon suggests buying NVDA stock near current levels. The analyst added that Nvidia trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 25, which is lower than Advanced Micro Devices\u2019 (NASDAQ:AMD) forward earnings multiple of 41. Rasgon has a price target of $700 on Nvidia stock.\n\t\t\n\n\nMeanwhile, DBS analyst Fang Boon Foo maintained a Buy rating on NVDA stock on December 7. The analyst said that NVDA, through its\u00a0robust financial performance, has dispelled doubts about AI being merely hype. Instead, AI is now seen as the key driver of earnings for the company. Additionally, the analyst sees sustained global demand for AI chips and envisions Nvidia reaping incremental advantages from the growing adoption of generative AI across various industries.\u00a0\nIs Nvidia Stock Expected to Rise?\nAnalysts\u2019 average price target suggests Nvidia stock is expected to rise. With 31 Buy and three Hold recommendations, Nvidia stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating. Moreover,\u00a0analysts\u2019 average price target\u00a0of $661.35 implies 35.27% upside potential from current levels.\u00a0\n\nBottom Line\nNvidia stock has generated significant returns for its investors so far in 2023. Further, analysts continue to show confidence in it and expect the stock to grow more over the next 12 months. The AI-led demand, supply-chain expansion, and NVDA\u2019s focus on accelerating its product development position it well to deliver solid financials, supporting its share price in 2024.\u00a0\nDisclosure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\n\n\n FACEBOOK\n\n\n\n\n TWITTER\n\n\n\n\n EMAIL\n\n\n\n\n COPY LINK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNVIDIA NewsMORE  \n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX PRO Comes to Workstations and Servers for Designers, Developers, Data Scientists and Creatives to Build and Collaborate With Agentic AIGlobeNewswire 21m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces DGX Spark and DGX Station Personal AI ComputersGlobeNewswire 23m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces Spectrum-X Photonics, Co-Packaged Optics Networking Switches to Scale AI Factories to Millions of GPUsGlobeNewswire 38m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell Ultra AI Factory Platform Paves Way for Age of AI ReasoningGlobeNewswire 48m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Dynamo Open-Source Library Accelerates and Scales AI Reasoning ModelsGlobeNewswire 1h \n\n\n\nNvidia GTC 2025: Rubin, reasoning, robotics and moreSeeking Alpha 1h \n\n\n\nGeneral Motors and NVIDIA Collaborate on AI for Next-Generation Vehicle Experience and ManufacturingGlobeNewswire 2h \n\n\n\nNVIDIA and Telecom Industry Leaders to Develop AI-Native Wireless Networks for 6GGlobeNewswire 2h \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tStart Trading Futures\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n\n\n\n\nAMD\n\n\n\n103.86\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-0.73 (-0.70%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t03:19:26 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time AMD charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA\n\n\n\n116.79\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-2.74 (-2.29%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t03:19:30 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time NVDA charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMORE \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFind News\n\t\t\t\tNews\n\n\n\n\n\nGO\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n            See also:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                - Explore more categories\n            \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

Let\u2019s look at its financial metrics to know more\u2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Anushka Dutta Dec 26, 2023  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular Stories\n\n\u2022 Has the Next Bear Market Already Arrived?\n\u2022 How Low Will Stocks Go?\n\u2022 Why is Stock Market Outlook So Uncertain?\n\u2022 Trump or the Fed More Important to Stock Investors?\n\u2022 Investors in \u201cWait and See\u201d Mode\nView All Top stories\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) stands as a mega-cap chip giant in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) industry by virtue of its Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which support accelerated computing.\nWith the era of generative AI upon us, the company is seeing heightened interest from global cloud service providers, internet companies, and large language model startups. This is reflected in NVDA\u2019s stock performance, which has gained 234.1% year-to-date.\nContrarily, the company faces regulatory restrictions as the United States and China engage in a race to be the global tech superpower. Subsequently, in October, NVDA\u2019s share hit a near five-month low when a Wall Street Journal report dropped that it could be forced to cancel up to $5 billion worth of advanced chip orders to China.\nAlthough the Biden administration is in talks with the company about permitting some AI chips to be sold to China, the administration has also stated that it cannot sell its most advanced chips to Chinese companies.\n\n\nTherefore, we think investors should wait for a more opportune moment to invest in NVDA\u2019s stock. Let\u2019s look at the trends of its key financial metrics to gain further insight.\nTwo-Year Financial Performance Review: A Shift-by-Shift Analysis of NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s Key Metrics (2021-2023)\nThe trailing-12-month net income of NVDA has exhibited immense fluctuation over the period depicted in your dataset, which spans from January 2021 to October 2023.\nOn January 31, 2021, NVDA had a net income of $4.33 billion, which gradually increased in the subsequent months.\nIn May 2022, NVDA\u2019s net income peaked at $9.46 billion before seeing a significant drop to $5.96 billion in October of the same year.\nFollowing this downward trend, the corporation experienced an even steeper decline, with the net income falling to $4.37 billion by January 2023.\nAn incredible recovery was witnessed between April and October 2023. The net income registered a steady growth to $4.79 billion in April, then surged to an all-time high of $18.88 billion in October 2023.\nThe net income growth rate from January 2021 ($4.33 billion) to October 2023 ($18.88 billion) is approximately 336%. However, it\u2019s worth noting that the performance in recent quarters has been highly volatile, suggesting market turbulence or significant shifts within the company.\n3 STOCKS TO DOUBLE THIS YEAR\nThe NVDA\u2019s gross margin has shown a fluctuating trend over the years based on the provided data series. The data begins with a gross margin of 62.30% in January 2021 and ends with 69.90% in October 2023. Key observations:\nThere was a slightly increasing trend from January 2021 (62.30%) to May 2022 (65.30%).\nAn unusual drop was seen between May and October 2022, with the gross margin falling from 65.30% to 57.80%.\nThe highest drop was recorded between July and October 2022, when the gross margin plummeted from 65.30% to 57.80%, a decrease of 7.5% points.\nFrom October 2022 onwards, NVDA experienced a steady increase in its gross margin, with it reaching 69.90% by October 2023.\nWhen calculating the growth rate by measuring the last value from the first one, we observe that there was an overall positive growth in the gross margin during the reporting period. Specifically, the gross margin increased from 62.30% to 69.90% from January 2021 to October 2023, indicating sizable progress.\nThe greater emphasis lies on the recent figures that reveal gross margin sharply pumped up after the substantial fall in mid-2022. There was notable growth from April to October 2023, rising from 56.30% to 69.90%, showing a robust recovery and boding well for NVDA\u2019s financial position.\n\n\nIt is important to dig more into the reason behind such variations, especially the drop witnessed in 2022 and the significant rebound in 2023. Among possible reasons could be changes in the cost of sales, variations in product mix, strategic shifts, or unexpected market events.\n\nThe current ratio of NVDA has exhibited both upward and downward trends as well as fluctuations throughout the reported period. Here\u2019s the summary:\nIn January 2021, the current ratio was 4.09.\nThere was a steady increase in the current ratio from January 2021 to October 2021, peaking at 7.145 in October 2021.\nFollowing the peak, there was a sharp decline in the current ratio, falling to 3.62 by July 2022.\nThe current ratio showed slight fluctuations between July 2022 and April 2023, ranging between 3.388 and 3.516.\nBy July 2023, the current ratio fell further down to 2.787.\nThe data series ends with a rebound in October 2023, where the current ratio was recorded as 3.588.\nFrom the first value in January 2021 (4.09) to the last value in October 2023 (3.588), there was a decrease of roughly 12.3%. Despite the mid-period peak, by the end of the series, the current ratio was lower than the starting point.\nPlease note: greater emphasis has been placed on more recent data in this analysis, according to the instructions. The general trend suggests some form of instability in NVDA\u2019s short-term liquidity over the course of the observed time frame.\n\nThe available data on NVDA\u2019s asset turnover, spanning from January 2021 to October 2023, reveals a generally fluctuating pattern with a minor overall increment. Some of the key points include:\nStarting at 0.641 in January 2021, the asset turnover manifested small gains through August 2021, peaking at 0.7.\nThis small upward trend plateaued through May 2022 as the value remained around 0.70.\nNotably, a brief downturn appeared between July and October 2022 when the figure slightly dropped to 0.659.\nThe number further decreased to 0.61 by April 2023, marking its lowest point in this timeframe.\nHowever, from July to October 2023, there was a significant surge in asset turnover, reaching a series high of 0.948 by the end of the period.\nIn terms of growth rate, calculated from the difference between the final (October 2023: 0.948) and the initial value (January 2021: 0.641), there is a growth of approximately 48%. It means NVDA has been able to use its assets more effectively to generate income over this period despite some intermittent fluctuations.\nThis growth suggests financial improvements for NVDA. However, the inconsistent pattern within this timeframe also indicates potential instability or varying degrees of operational efficiency.\n\nAnalyzing NVIDIA\u2019s Stock Performance: A Comprehensive Review of June-December 2023\nBased on the data provided, NVDA\u2019s share price displays an overall rising trend from June to December 2023. Here is a more detailed breakdown:\nOn June 30, 2023, NVDA\u2019s share price was $415.96.\nThroughout July 2023, the share price saw a consistent increase, peaking at $461.01 on July 21 before slightly dipping to $454.66 by early August.\nIn August, the share price fluctuated, starting at $454.66 and reaching a low of $433.02 on August 11. However, by the end of August, there was a notable surge to $468.04.\nSeptember 2023 witnessed a gradual decline, with the share price getting down to $426.26 towards the end of the month.\nThere was a short rebound in October, with the price rising from $426.26 to $460.56 by mid-October, but it dropped back down to $418.71 by the end of the month.\nIn November, there was an impressive climb once again, culminating in a peak share price of $491.72 on November 24, 2023.\nThe trend decelerated in December with slight fluctuations. The share price ended at $488.30 on December 22.\n\n\nTo summarize, the NVDA share price demonstrated an overall upward trajectory during this period despite some periods of volatility and deceleration. The share price escalated by approximately 18.34% from June to December 2023. Here is a chart of NVDA\u2019s price over the past 180 days.\n\nTracking NVIDIA\u2019s Exceptional Growth, Quality and Sentiment Ratings in 2023\nThe POWR Ratings grade for NVDA, a stock in the Semiconductor & Wireless Chip category, has held a steady C (Neutral) grade from July 2023 to December 2023.

As a result, the company's stock and earnings have skyrocketed in 2023.\nThose who bought shares in Nvidia at the start of the year have enjoyed immense growth. But what about those who invested a decade ago, when the chipmaker was still finding its footing in tech?\n\nData by YCharts\nNvidia's stock has hit record heights since 2013, as the company became dominant in gaming, data centers, and AI. The chart shows its share price climbed more than 12,000% in that period. So if you had invested $5,000 in Nvidia's stock 10 years ago, that investment would be worth around $625,000 today. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe company's meteoric rise is owed to success in multiple areas of tech. Let's take a look at Nvidia's biggest growth drivers and if the company can continue delivering significant gains in the coming years.\nNvidia's business has exploded alongside solid positions in gaming and data centers\nLong before Nvidia became a prominent figure in AI, it took on the weighty task of expanding in a market that barely existed. The company was among the first to begin selling GPUs for the consumer sector, encouraging people to custom-build computers for specific needs.\nThe gaming community fully embraced this, using Nvidia's GPUs to build high-powered video game machines that offer far better performance than any game consoles on the market. According to Zion Market Research, the PC games industry was valued at $26 billion last year and is projected to hit about $32 billion by decade's end. Meanwhile, Nvidia holds an 87% market share in desktop GPUs, which are crucial to the growth of PC games. \n\nNvidia's success in video games has seen its gaming segment post revenue growth of 500% over the last decade. The gaming market has hit some roadblocks over the last two years as macroeconomic headwinds curbed consumer spending, but trends in 2023 are positive as we head into the new year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tech giant's achievements in gaming gave it the funds and resources to expand into other areas of tech, with Nvidia now primarily a data center firm. Growth in markets like cloud computing and AI has increased demand for chips, with Nvidia's data center revenue soaring more than 7,000% in the last 10 years and hitting net sales of $14 billion in its third quarter of 2024 (ending October 2023). \nGaming and data centers remain the two highest-earning parts of Nvidia's business, accounting for 95% of its revenue in its most recent quarter. So the question is, can these businesses continue to post stellar growth?\nCan Nvidia continue to deliver significant gains over the next decade?\nA market downturn saw the video gaming industry achieve sales worth $193 billion in 2022, a 5% decrease from the previous year. Nvidia was similarly affected, with revenue in its gaming segment falling 27% year over year between its fiscal 2022 and 2023. \nHowever, easing inflation and reductions in manufacturing costs have improved Nvidia's gaming business and suggest the worst market declines are behind it. In Q3 2024, Nvidia posted gaming revenue growth of 81% year over year, hitting close to $3 billion. \n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Market Insights projects the GPU market to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25% through 2032 as the industry continues to recover and expand. \nHowever, Nvidia's biggest growth driver in the coming years will almost certainly be data centers. Q3 2024 saw data center revenue soar 279% year over year, massively profiting from increased AI GPU sales. The AI market is expected to develop at a CAGR of 37% through 2030, indicating chip demand is only likely to continue rising. \n\nData by YCharts\nThe table shows Nvidia's earnings could climb to $23 per share in fiscal 2026. That figure, multiplied by its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 39, would yield a stock price of $897 and deliver growth of 84% from its current position. \n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, a $5,000 investment in Nvidia today could be worth $9,200 in just a few years. So it could be worth investing in this chipmaker now to potentially see big gains over the long term.\n\n\n\nDani Cook has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

So let\u2019s break down Intel vs. Nvidia stock. \n\n\nDecember 7, 2023\u2022\n\nCarl Delfeld\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Save article\n            \n\n                Article Saved\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Email\n    \n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Print\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA couple years ago, the financial media could not get enough of the story of Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) market value soaring past traditional automakers such as Toyota, GM and Ford, or some combination of them. But when supercharged chip designer Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) market value surpassed semiconductor stalwart Intel (INTC), it went by with nary a notice. However, Nvidia garnered significant headlines when it reached the rarified air of a trillion-dollar company. The combination of Intel\u2019s relative underperformance and Nvidia\u2019s staggering valuation begs the question: if you had to choose only one of Intel vs. Nvidia stock, which is the better semiconductor stock?Semiconductors are crucial and the most strategically important technology because they are the materials and circuitry needed to produce microchips that are at the heart of everything from smartphones to advanced satellites. You might think of these microchips as the brains inside all advanced technology.[text_ad]Semiconductor chips are in the spotlight because of AI and because one of the areas that China is still relatively behind in is advanced chip technology, which runs across chip design, computer software and equipment. Washington\u2019s chief concern is that while many of the advanced chips are designed in America, only around 12% of all chips are manufactured here, and they tend to be the less advanced chips produced in older plants.Nvidia\u2019s Surge in the Intel vs. Nvidia Stock DebateNvidia is riding the surge in demand for the more high-performance chips used in a variety of applications. The company also expanded into data centers, with a $7 billion acquisition of Mellanox Technologies. NVDA is also leading the way in artificial intelligence (AI)-focused chips and in cloud computing. These are all profitable, big-growth areas that have pushed Nvidia (well) past Intel in market value, as INTC stock has gone the other way.It is important to note that Nvidia only designs its advanced chips, outsourcing production primarily to Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), which fabricates more than half of the world\u2019s chips.Intel\u2019s Stumble and Shake-upIntel is a different animal than Nvidia in a few ways. First, it produces semiconductor chips for a much broader array of industries while still dominating its core PC and data center markets. Intel has nine manufacturing facilities around the world leading to a reported $81 billion in net property, plants and equipment. Plus, being in business since 1969 has netted substantial intellectual property for manufacturing semiconductors.Despite this experience, Intel has publicly stumbled in terms of the next-generation chip manufacturing process known as 7-nanometer technology, referring to the size of the transistors it produces (Intel\u2019s offerings have been anticipated for a while, and it seems they\u2019ll just make the 2023 target). Chips that use smaller transistors can run more efficiently and use up less physical space.This led the company to shake up its technology team overseeing its manufacturing operations, and it\u2019s considering outsourcing more to foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor.As you might guess, all this hit Intel stock pretty hard and it is woefully underperforming Nvidia in recent years. In the last five years, NVDA stock is up 1,100%, while INTC shares are down 9%.Of note, INTC and NVDA were similarly navigating the growth stock sell-off in 2022, but that changed quickly when NVDA surged more than 189% in the first half of 2023 and Intel cut its dividend.Intel vs. Nvidia Stock: Which is the Better Buy?It seems a no-brainer to go with Nvidia in the Intel vs. Nvidia stock debate, since NVDA seems to have unbeatable momentum in this critical industry at the heart of advanced technology.Now consider geopolitical risks. The chief risk for Nvidia is its dependence on Taiwan Semiconductor for production. Taiwan Semiconductor is a powerful company in a strategically important place so it has to diplomatically balance both customers and countries. For example, roughly 14% of its sales go to Huawei, and the U.S. Commerce Department has stipulated that companies would require licenses for sales to Huawei of semiconductors made abroad with U.S. technology. Although this briefly interrupted sales, Taiwan Semiconductor received the license and resumed sales. However, this highlights the unique political risks that potentially weigh on a company that doesn\u2019t do its own manufacturing.Which stock to buy now in the Intel vs. Nvidia stock debate depends on your time frame. Momentum traders should go with Nvidia stock if the uptrend continues. But if you\u2019re considering a more contrarian, potentially undervalued company, I would go with Intel.And if you want more stock recommendations, my Cabot Explorer advisory has been researching the global tech battleground and currently has several promising technology stocks in the portfolio that I really like.

We\u2019re talking about the leader of the company whose GPUs made the snappy responses of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT possible: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\n[Related: Nvidia CEO Explains How AI Chips Could Save Future Data Centers Lots Of Money]\nHuang was at Amazon Web Services re:Invent 2023. He was at Microsoft Ignite 2023. He was at Google Cloud Next 2023. He was at Dell Technologies World 2023. He was at Lenovo Tech World 2023. He was at VMware Explore 2023.\nHuang wasn\u2019t at Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s Discover 2023 events, but the server vendor nevertheless announced a \u201csignificantly\u201d expanded partnership with the GPU designer at its Barcelona affair with Huang\u2019s top enterprise computing lieutenant on stage.\nNvidia\u2019s omnipresence among the channel\u2019s largest server and cloud service providers is just one example of the company\u2019s growing influence in the IT industry, which increasingly believes AI will become an important facet of many applications and services.\nAnother way to demonstrate Nvidia\u2019s power is to compare its data center revenue against that of the industry\u2019s largest and longest-running provider of general-purpose server CPUs: Intel.\nWhile Intel\u2019s data center revenue shrunk to $3.7 billion in the first quarter of this year, Nvidia\u2019s data center revenue grew and surpassed its rival in roughly the same period to $4.3 billion.\nNvidia\u2019s data center revenue then grew 141 percent to $10.3 billion the next quarter and then another 41 percent to $14.5 billion in the third quarter, more than double and triple what the company made for those two periods in the previous year. Meanwhile, Intel\u2019s rose slightly to $4 billion before sinking down again to $3.8 billion over the past two quarters.\nThis put Nvidia\u2019s data center revenue for the first three quarters of its 2024 fiscal year\u2014which ran from Jan. 29 to Oct. 29 of this year\u2014at $29.1 billion. That\u2019s more than 2.5 times higher than the $11.5 billion in sales Intel earned for data center products between Jan. 1 and Sept. 30.\nNvidia has said it expected that total revenue in the fourth quarter, which includes other segments like gaming and visualization, will reach $20 billion, plus or minus 2 percent, with \u201cstrong sequential growth\u201d expected for data center segment sales.\nIntel, in the meantime, expects fourth-quarter revenue to reach between $14.6 billion and $15.6 billion, driven in part by \u201cmoderate sequential growth\u201d within its Data Center and AI Group.\nBarring any unexpectedly large deviations, these forecasts mean Nvidia will almost certainly finish its current fiscal year with far more full-year data center revenue than Intel.\nWhat Nvidia\u2019s skyrocketing data center revenue shows is how lucrative it\u2019s been for the company to sell powerful and expensive GPUs for demanding AI and data science workloads as the IT industry seeks to turn the hype around generative AI applications like ChatGPT into long-lasting business opportunities that transform the way we work and play.\nBut Nvidia hasn\u2019t succeeded on the strength of its GPUs alone. These processors are backed by a rapidly expanding software suite, which includes everything from software development kits to orchestration platforms, and they\u2019re increasingly used in systems and motherboards designed by the company in concert with other parts it makes, like CPUs and data processing units.\nThis is Nvidia\u2019s \u201cfull-stack computing\u201d strategy at work, providing the most critical aspects that are needed to run AI workloads and others in the realm of what the company calls accelerated computing. And many of these components within Nvidia\u2019s stack have been adopted by the channel\u2019s largest data center and cloud players, AWS and Dell included.\nThe company\u2019s runaway success is what allowed its stock price to skyrocket by 240 percent to roughly $488 per share on Friday versus $143.15 at the beginning of the year.\nBut while Nvidia has dominated the fast-growing AI computing space, the company is facing greater competition than it ever has. And it\u2019s coming while the chip designer builds up GPU capacity to serve businesses who have faced several months of shortages due to high demand.\nThe companies targeting Nvidia\u2019s data center business include its largest cloud computing allies\u2014AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud\u2014who are building out accelerator chips and complementary technologies to compete against Nvidia-powered instances.\nThere are also scores of startups, backed by hundreds of millions of dollars from venture capital firms, designing novel chip architectures they believe are better suited to accelerate AI workloads than Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, which were originally made for graphics processing.\nThen there is Intel and AMD, who have fiercely fought over x86 CPU market share for the past several years and are now seeking to challenge Nvidia\u2019s dominance in the GPU space.\nBut it\u2019s one thing to build the right combination of hardware and software to serve a market opportunity that will continue to grow fast for the next several years. (Research firm IDC, for instance, said this week that spending on generative AI solutions alone\u2014not counting other kinds of AI workloads\u2014will grow, on average, 85.9 percent every year to $151.1 billion in 2027.)\nWhat\u2019s equally important is that Nvidia and other players in the AI computing space work hand-in-hand with channel partners to seize on the long-standing relationships solutions providers have held with businesses, governments and other organizations to find new opportunities.\nAnd while there are plenty of partners who have benefited from Nvidia\u2019s meteoric rise in the data center and cloud infrastructure markets, the growing competition from the likes of Intel, AMD and others will lead to broader opportunities for the channel in the AI computing space.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It recently added services for Seattle\u2019s Pagliacci Pizza, vitamin and supplement giant GNC, and large health systems like Intermountain Health, OhioHealth and Michigan Medicine.\nZipline developed its drones \u2014 which have now flown more than 65 million miles \u2014 for autonomous navigation and precision landings using the NVIDIA Jetson edge AI and robotics platform.\nThe fast-growing company recently landed $330 million in funding at a more than $4 billion valuation.\nZipline is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a program that provides startups with technological support and AI platform guidance.\nDelivering With Jetson-Powered Fleets\nThe company\u2019s P1 drone, or platform one, has been deployed in production for seven years and currently uses the Jetson Xavier NX system-on-module to process its sensor inputs. It\u2019s guided by GPS, air traffic control communications, inertial measurement unit sensors and its onboard detection and avoidance system, with redundancy of guidance for safety.\n\u201cThe NVIDIA Jetson module in the wing is part of what delivers our acoustic detection and avoidance system, so it allows us to listen for other aircraft in the airspace around us and plot trajectories that avoid any conflict,\u201d said A.J. Frantz, navigation lead at Zipline.\nThe company\u2019s fixed-wing drones can fly out more than 55 miles, at 70 miles per hour, for deliveries from one of several Zipline distribution centers and then return. Capable of hauling up to four pounds of cargo, they autonomously fly over delivery locations and release packages that float down to their destination by parachute.\nThe company\u2019s P2, or platform two, is a hybrid drone that can fly fast on fixed-wing flights \u2014 but also hover. It can carry eight pounds of cargo for 10 miles and packs a droid that can be lowered on a tether to complete deliveries with precision placement. It\u2019s intended for use in dense, urban environments.\nThe P2 uses two Jetson Orin NX modules. One is for the drone\u2019s sensor fusion system to understand environments. The other is in the droid that descends by tether \u2014 for redundancy to provide added safety.\n\u201cThe P2 droid is about bringing the smallest, quickest, safest, quietest drone in for delivery, coming down precisely and leaving the package \u2014 and then going back up,\u201d said Joseph Mardall, head of engineering at Zipline. \u201cWe want to integrate into people\u2019s lives in a way that they love and that feels magical.\u201d\nZipline completes one delivery every 70 seconds globally.\n\nFlying Away With a Roster of Customers\nZipline\u2019s service offers advantages that are attracting customers. Its drones, fondly nicknamed \u2018Zips,\u2019 are capable of 7x faster delivery times compared with vehicle deliveries, according to the company.\n\u201cOur aircraft fly at 70 miles per hour, as the crow flies, so no traffic, no waiting at lights \u2014 we\u2019re talking minutes here in terms of delivery times,\u201d said Mardall. \u201cSingle-digit minutes are common for deliveries, so it\u2019s faster than any alternative, for sure.\u201d\nIn addition to services for pizza, vitamins and courier meds, Zipline works with Walmart, restaurant chain Sweetgreen, Michigan Medicine, MultiCare Health Systems, Intermountain Health and the government of Rwanda, among others. It also delivers to more than 4,000 hospitals and health centers, according to the company.\nZipline started its service delivering blood in Rwanda seven years ago and later expanded into food and convenience.\nRiding Jetson Orin for Energy Efficiency, Environmental Benefits \nDelivering energy-efficient computing is mission-critical for the run-time of autonomous machines, used in everything from delivery services and agriculture to mining and undersea exploration. NVIDIA Jetson Orin modules offer up to 275 trillion operations per second while providing market-leading energy efficiency.\n\u201cYou can pick the right place for your algorithms to run to make sure you\u2019re getting the most out of the hardware and the power that you are putting into the system,\u201d said Frantz.\nStartups using Jetson-driven applications are also leading the way in sustainability, as more next-generation electric-driven autonomous machines replace those contributing to pollution.\nDeliveries by Zipline offer a 97% reduction in carbon emissions compared with gasoline-driven vehicles, according to the company.\n\u201cWe are super excited to significantly reduce carbon emissions,\u201d said Mardall. \u201cAnd when building an electric aircraft, efficiency is totally key \u2014 every watt, every fraction of a watt, every joule that we can claw back can be turned into payload and range.\u201d\nLearn more about NVIDIA Jetson Orin.\n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: Inception | NVIDIA Jetson | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Tons of new in-game content is introduced, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Warzone lobbies add full ray tracing and Ray Reconstruction to enhance the appearance of your loadout, characters and vehicles, and Call of Duty: Warzone adds support for DLSS 3, following its addition to all other modes and campaigns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Call of Duty: Warzone, the free-to-play massive combat arena title, players can now deploy to Urzikstan, the game\u2019s newest big map, which is sure to excite veterans and newcomers alike. This high-density urban layout has exciting points of interest, and players can move through this city landscape with the return of slide cancel, as well as more responsive movement allowing for faster-paced play. With exhilarating new features such as the Drivable Train, Horizontal Ziplines, new Gulag map, and gameplay features, it\u2019s time to call up the squad and drop in.\nFor GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers, Season 1 sees the debut of NVIDIA DLSS 3 in Call of Duty: Warzone, multiplying performance. GeForce RTX 20 Series and 30 Series gamers can boost performance with DLSS Super Resolution.\nAnd if performance is high enough already in your opinion, you can instead enable NVIDIA DLAA, an AI-based anti-aliasing mode that utilizes the same technology developed for DLSS. DLAA uses a native resolution image to maximize image quality, rather than boosting performance, for an even richer, more detailed experience.\nAdditionally, all GeForce gamers, dating back to users of the GeForce GTX 900 Series, can activate NVIDIA Reflex.\nNVIDIA Reflex is synonymous with responsive gaming, and can be found in the latest and greatest games.\u00a0 Reflex reduces system latency so your actions occur quicker, potentially giving you a competitive edge in multiplayer matches, and making single-player titles more responsive and enjoyable. NVIDIA Reflex is now used by over 50 million players each month, is available in 9 of the top 10 competitive shooters, and is activated by 90% of GeForce gamers in over 90 supported titles.\nIn Call of Duty: Warzone, NVIDIA Reflex reduces system latency, and combined with the super fast frame rates delivered by DLSS, you can let your skill shine when competing on the battlefields of Urzikstan, Ashika Island and Vondel.\nWith the release of Season 1 for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Warzone, NVIDIA DLSS 3, NVIDIA DLSS 2, NVIDIA DLAA, NVIDIA Reflex, and NVIDIA Image Scaling are now supported in all modes, as well in every Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II mode, giving GeForce RTX gamers the definitive PC experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall of Duty HQ serves as the hub for all Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Warzone content, enabling players to quickly access Multiplayer, Zombies, Battle Royale, the Firing Range, and more. On December 6th, GeForce RTX gamers can activate full ray tracing in the lobbies of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Warzone, enabling you to see your characters, skins, vehicles, and weapons in an entirely new light.\nFull ray tracing, otherwise known as path tracing, is a demanding but highly accurate way to render light and its effect on a scene. Reflections, shadows, ambient occlusion, and more are all amped up, letting your Call of Duty content shine with incredible detail and realism. Inspect your Gunsmith weapons with enhanced detail, see your characters with pixel-perfect lighting and shadowing, head to the Firing Range to test your beautifully rendered loadouts, and marvel at immersive pre-game moments with you and your assembled squad.\nAll GeForce RTX gamers can activate pre-game Path Tracing via the Video options menu, and doing so will automatically enable NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 with\u00a0DLSS Ray Reconstruction. Ray Reconstruction replaces hand-tuned ray tracing denoisers with a new unified AI model, elevating the image quality of ray-traced effects and full ray tracing to new heights, further enhancing detail, realism and immersion.\nFor even faster performance, in all available campaigns and modes for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, and Call of Duty: Warzone, activate DLSS Frame Generation, which multiplies frame rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition & Update 2.1, Featuring New Tech Enhancements\nIn Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, immerse yourself in every story the world of the dark future has to offer, including the base game, its acclaimed spy-thriller expansion Phantom Liberty, and the game-changing Update 2.0 - all in one package.\nBecome an urban outlaw equipped with cybernetic enhancements and build your legend on the streets of Night City. Go on daring adventures and build relationships with unforgettable characters whose fates are shaped by the choices you make, and decide how V's story ends. Your choices in the base game and Phantom Liberty create interweaving webs of consequences, ones that shape the fate of the characters around you \u2014 and your own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate 2.1 ships alongside Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition and is available for free to owners of both the Ultimate Edition and the original Cyberpunk 2077 on PC. This major update for the incredible game is stacked with content, and new technical enhancements for PC players.\nOn the content front, players can now travel through Night City using a new metro system, which includes unique subway scenes and interactions. Players can now romance their partners in the comfort of their apartments, and can listen to radio stations when on-foot and riding the subway. Additionally, amongst a long list of other additions, a previously closed highway is now open to vehicles and the NCPD, new motorbikes and cars are available for purchase, select boss fights have been revamped, replayable street races have been introduced, new world mini stories are available to discover, and rasterized graphics have been enhanced for all platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen playing Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty on a GeForce RTX GPU, gamers have a laundry list of incredible options available to take performance and image quality to the next level. DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Frame Generation multiply frame rates by up to 5X, full ray tracing replaces lighting with a unified, jaw-dropping path-traced model that takes immersion to 11, DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction makes revolutionary use of AI to further improve image quality and performance, and Reflex makes Cyberpunk 2077 gameplay even more responsive, delivering the best gameplay experience possible on any platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate 2.1 makes that technology even better, once again raising the bar for image quality, immersion, and realism.\nFull ray tracing, activated via the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, exits Preview status with the release of the Ultimate Edition, boasting additional improvements.\nUnder the hood, technologies including Shader Execution Reordering (SER) and Opacity Micromaps (OMM) have delivered significant performance gains during the evolution of the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode.\nNow, we're introducing Reservoir-based Spatiotemporal Importance Resampling Global Illumination (ReSTIR GI) with the launch of Update 2.1 and the Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition. ReSTIR GI is an advanced sampling technique for indirect lighting available in the NVIDIA RTXDI SDK, which further improves the quality of fully ray traced lighting in Cyberpunk 2077.\nBefore the release of Update 2.1, some scenes were darker than intended due to the loss of lighting energy during denoising. Using ReSTIR GI, local lighting is appropriately bright, and light now travels further, illuminating a scene further into the distance and increasing the brightness of previously illuminated detail.\nIn Update 2.0, the movement of dynamic characters, the equipping of new weapons and items, or the moving of the camera could cause full ray tracing to visibly update in areas that were previously occluded. With the introduction of ReSTIR GI in Update 2.1, disocclusion noise has been greatly reduced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conjunction with Ray Reconstruction enhancements in Update 2.1, ReSTIR GI significantly reduces the ghosting of moving game elements and their shadows, further improving image quality and immersion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with Ray Reconstruction, it replaces several hand-tuned ray tracing denoisers with a single, unified AI model that accelerates performance by up to 5X in conjunction with DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation, and dramatically enhances path tracing image quality. Reflections are substantially clearer, light responds near instantaneously, and image quality overall is further improved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the launch of Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition and Update 2.1, Ray Reconstruction has been further refined. Now, the fidelity and realism of skin rendering is improved, and the quality of eye reflections enhanced, making character close ups in conversations and cinematic moments even better.\nAdditionally, Ray Reconstruction will now be usable when activating Ray-Traced Reflections, either as part of a preset, or when configuring custom settings.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Ray Reconstruction enabled, the clarity and fidelity of reflected game elements is noticeably enhanced (click the icon on the bottom right to view in fullscreen)\nThese enhancements, additions and improvements mean that CD PROJEKT RED will be removing the Technology Preview label from the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, signifying that it has reached its potential, and the promise of being the next revolution in real-time graphics rendering.\nIn advance of Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition and Update 2.1\u2019s launch, we\u2019ve released a new GeForce Game Ready Driver, which is required to take advantage of the tech outlined above. To get your system ready ahead of December 5th, go to the Drivers tab of GeForce Experience or GeForce.com to download and install our Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition Game Ready Driver.\nGeForce Game Ready Drivers deliver the best experience for your favorite PC games. They\u2019re finely tuned in collaboration with developers and extensively tested across thousands of hardware configurations for maximum performance and reliability. Game Ready Drivers also allow you to optimize game settings in GeForce Experience with a single click, and empower you with the latest NVIDIA technologies.\nIf you don\u2019t have a powerful GeForce RTX PC or laptop, you can still enjoy and experience Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition by streaming it from the cloud with the same technologies as GeForce RTX 40-Series owners, including DLSS 3.5, Ray Reconstruction, and Reflex, thanks to NVIDIA GeForce NOW Ultimate. Members can play over 1,700 games they already own from Steam, Epic Games Store, Xbox, Ubisoft Connect, and GOG.com. Head over to the GeForce NOW website to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen playing Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty on a GeForce RTX GPU, gamers have a laundry list of incredible options available to take performance and image quality to the next level. DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation multiply frame rates by up to 5X, full ray tracing replaces lighting with a unified, jaw-dropping path-traced model that takes immersion to 11, DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction makes revolutionary use of AI to further improve image quality and performance, and Reflex makes Cyberpunk 2077 gameplay even more responsive, delivering the best gameplay experience possible on any platform. See for yourself when patch 2.1 and the Ultimate Edition are released December 5th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For THRONE AND LIBERTY\u2019s Korean Release\nNCSoft\u2019s THRONE AND LIBERTY is a free-to-play MMORPG that takes place in the vast open world of Solisium. You can scale expansive mountain ranges for new vantage points, scan open skies, traverse sprawling plains, and explore a land full of depth and opportunity.

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Editor\u2019s note: This post is part of our weekly In the NVIDIA Studio series, which celebrates featured artists, offers creative tips and tricks, and demonstrates how NVIDIA Studio technology improves creative workflows.\nNVIDIA DLSS 3.5 for realistic ray-traced visuals is now available on D5 Render, a real-time 3D creation software. The integration features DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation and Ray Reconstruction powered by an AI neural network.\nAnd this week\u2019s In the NVIDIA Studio 3D artist Michael Gilmour shares his wondrous, intricate winter worlds in long-form videos.\nHis winter-themed creations join Arkadly Demchenko, Austin Smith and Maggie Shelton\u2019s works in the latest Studio Standouts video, available on the NVIDIA Studio YouTube channel.\n\nAlso, tune in to the NVIDIA special address at CES on Jan. 8 at 8 a.m. PT for the latest and greatest on content creation, AI-related news and more.\nDLSS 3.5 Accelerates Real-Time Rendering\nD5 Render is a software designed for 3D designers and professionals working on large-scale architectural or landscaping projects.\nUse D5 Render and NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs to model and render massive scenes.\nSupport for NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation in D5 Render enhances ray-tracing performance and boosts real-time viewport frame rates for a smoother editing experience, enabling intuitive, interactive 3D creation.\nSmoother movement in the viewport with DLSS 3.5.\nRay Reconstruction, a new neural rendering AI model, further enhances ray-traced visual quality by providing intelligent denoising solutions for an extensive variety of content at quick speeds.\nEnhanced visual quality with DLSS 3.5 and Ray Reconstruction.\nWith both DLSS Frame Generation and Ray Reconstruction enabled, FPS in the viewport increases by a staggering 2.5x, enabling incredible resolution and visual quality in massive scenes.\nAutodesk VRED, a professional digital prototyping software, also adds DLSS 3.5 support, bringing smoother viewport movement and higher graphical fidelity.\nWinter Tinker\nGilmour, this week\u2019s featured NVIDIA Studio artist, grew up in the beautiful winters of Appleton, Wisconsin. It\u2019s no surprise he conjured up chillingly beautiful winter worlds to share with his friends, family and the creative community \u2014 fueled by his passion for 3D art.\nShared as long-form videos, these winter wonderlands showcase breathtakingly photorealistic details.\nHis winter video compilation \u2014 featuring \u201cCampfire on a Winter Cliff,\u201d \u201cDickensian Christmas Reading Nook\u201d and \u201cNorthern Lights\u201d \u2014 is designed to offer viewers a sense of peace and relaxation while encouraging self-reflection.\n\nGilmour began his creative workflows in Unreal Engine, building out the environments. He used the Ultra Dynamic Sky system plug-in by game developer Everett Gunther, which offered greater flexibility and more customization options to achieve the effects in this northern lights scene.\n\nFully built models are available in Unreal Engine, but to achieve further customization, Gilmour created custom 3D meshes in Blender. He used Blender Cycles\u2019 NVIDIA RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in the viewport for interactive, photorealistic rendering \u2014 all powered by his GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card.\n\u201cOriginally, I chose an NVIDIA RTX GPU because of its CUDA core integration in Blender\u2019s Cycles rendering engine,\u201d said Gilmour. \u201cNow with ray-tracing capabilities in Unreal Engine 5, it\u2019s a no-brainer.\u201d\nOrganizing assets in Unreal Engine.\nHe then acquired models in Quixel Megascans to block out the scene in Unreal Engine, creating a rough draft using simple, unpolished 3D shapes. This helped to keep base meshes clean, eliminating the need to create new ones in the next iteration.\nMoving models in Unreal Engine.\nTo build the fire and glowing firewood in his \u201cCampfire on a Winter Cliff\u201d scene, Gilmour used the M5 VFX Vol 2 and Twinmotion Backyard Pack 2 packs from Unreal Engine. The NVIDIA PhysX SDK, advanced shader support and real-time ray tracing enabled high-fidelity, interactive visualization for swift viewport movement.\n\nBy upgrading to a GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU, Gilmour could use NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation to further improve viewport interactivity by tapping AI to generate additional, high-quality frames, ensuring increased FPS rendered at lower resolution while retaining high-fidelity detail.\n\nWhen finished building his scenes, Gilmour moved to Blackmagic Design\u2019s DaVinci Resolve to color correct and add subtle film grains, lens distortion, lens reflection and glow effects. It was all GPU-accelerated, including the process of exporting final videos with the eighth-generation NVENC encoder.\nColor correction in DaVinci Resolve.\nThe final touch to Gilmour\u2019s wintry scenes were peaceful tunes, sampled from royalty-free music database Splice.\nAll that\u2019s left to do is kick back, relax and soak in the scenery.\nDigital 3D artist Michael Gilmour.\nCheck out Gilmour\u2019s portfolio on ArtStation.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

GPU-powered AI, data science and machine learning models are helping counter these problems.\t\t\t\n\n\nDecember 13, 2023 by Kevin Levitt \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  The Wild West had gunslingers, bank robberies and bounties \u2014 today\u2019s digital frontier has identity theft, credit card fraud and chargebacks.\nCashing in on financial fraud has become a multibillion-dollar criminal enterprise. And generative AI in the hands of fraudsters only promises to make this more profitable.\nCredit card losses worldwide are expected to reach $43 billion by 2026, according to the Nilson Report.\nFinancial fraud is perpetrated in a growing number of ways, like harvesting hacked data from the dark web for credit card theft, using generative AI for phishing personal information, and laundering money between cryptocurrency, digital wallets and fiat currencies. Many other financial schemes are lurking in the digital underworld.\nTo keep up, financial services firms are wielding AI for fraud detection. That\u2019s because many of these digital crimes need to be halted in their tracks in real time so that consumers and financial firms can stop losses right away.\nSo how is AI used for fraud detection?\nAI for fraud detection uses multiple machine learning models to detect anomalies in customer behaviors and connections as well as patterns of accounts and behaviors that fit fraudulent characteristics.\nGenerative AI Can Be Tapped as Fraud Copilot\nMuch of financial services involves text and numbers. Generative AI and large language models (LLMs), capable of learning meaning and context, promise disruptive capabilities across industries with new levels of output and productivity. Financial services firms can harness generative AI to develop more intelligent and capable chatbots and improve fraud detection.\nOn the opposite side, bad actors can circumvent AI guardrails with crafty generative AI prompts to use it for fraud. And LLMs are delivering human-like writing, enabling fraudsters to draft more contextually relevant emails without typos and grammar mistakes. Many different tailored versions of phishing emails can be quickly created, making generative AI an excellent copilot for perpetrating scams. There are also a number of dark web tools like FraudGPT, which can exploit generative AI for cybercrimes.\nGenerative AI can be exploited for financial harm in voice authentication security measures as well. Some banks are using voice authentication to help authorize users. A banking customer\u2019s voice can be cloned using deep fake technology if an attacker can obtain voice samples in an effort to breach such systems. The voice data can be gathered with spam phone calls that attempt to lure the call recipient into responding by voice.\nChatbot scams are such a problem that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission called out concerns for the use of LLMs and other technology to simulate human behavior for deep fake videos and voice clones applied in imposter scams and financial fraud.\nHow Is Generative AI Tackling Misuse and Fraud Detection?\u00a0\nFraud review has a powerful new tool. Workers handling manual fraud reviews can now be assisted with LLM-based assistants running RAG on the backend to tap into information from policy documents that can help expedite decision-making on whether cases are fraudulent, vastly accelerating the process.\nLLMs are being adopted to predict the next transaction of a customer, which can help payments firms preemptively assess risks and block fraudulent transactions.\nGenerative AI also helps combat transaction fraud by improving accuracy, generating reports, reducing investigations and mitigating compliance risk.\nGenerating synthetic data is another important application of generative AI for fraud prevention. Synthetic data can improve the number of data records used to train fraud detection models and increase the variety and sophistication of examples to teach the AI to recognize the latest techniques employed by fraudsters.\nNVIDIA offers tools to help enterprises embrace generative AI to build chatbots and virtual agents with a workflow that uses retrieval-augmented generation. RAG enables companies to use natural language prompts to access vast datasets for information retrieval.\nHarnessing NVIDIA AI workflows can help accelerate building and deploying enterprise-grade capabilities to accurately produce responses for various use cases, using foundation models, the NVIDIA NeMo framework, NVIDIA Triton Inference Server and GPU-accelerated vector database to deploy RAG-powered chatbots.\nThere\u2019s an industry focus on safety to ensure generative AI isn\u2019t easily exploited for harm. NVIDIA released NeMo Guardrails to help ensure that intelligent applications powered by LLMs, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, are accurate, appropriate, on topic and secure.\nThe open-source software is designed to help keep AI-powered applications from being exploited for fraud and other misuses.\nWhat Are the Benefits of AI for Fraud Detection?\nFraud detection has been a challenge across banking, finance, retail and e-commerce.\u00a0 Fraud doesn\u2019t only hurt organizations financially, it can also do reputational harm.\nIt\u2019s a headache for consumers, as well, when fraud models from financial services firms overreact and register false positives that shut down legitimate transactions.\nSo financial services sectors are developing more advanced models using more data to fortify themselves against losses financially and reputationally. They\u2019re also aiming to reduce false positives in fraud detection for transactions to improve customer satisfaction and win greater share among merchants.\nFinancial Services Firms Embrace AI for Identity Verification\nThe financial services industry is developing AI for identity verification. AI-driven applications using deep learning with graph neural networks (GNNs), natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision can improve identity verification for know-your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements, leading to improved regulatory compliance and reduced costs.\nComputer vision analyzes photo documentation such as drivers licenses and passports to identify fakes. At the same time, NLP reads the documents to measure the veracity of the data on the documents as the AI analyzes them to look for fraudulent records.\nGains in KYC and AML requirements have massive regulatory and economic implications. Financial institutions, including banks, were fined nearly $5 billion for AML, breaching sanctions as well as failures in KYC systems in 2022, according to the Financial Times.\nHarnessing Graph Neural Networks and NVIDIA GPUs\u00a0\nGNNs have been embraced for their ability to reveal suspicious activity. They\u2019re capable of looking at billions of records and identifying previously unknown patterns of activity to make correlations about whether an account has in the past sent a transaction to a suspicious account.\nNVIDIA has an alliance with the Deep Graph Library team, as well as the PyTorch Geometric team, which provides a GNN framework containerized offering that includes the latest updates, NVIDIA RAPIDS libraries and more to help users stay up to date on cutting-edge techniques.\nThese GNN framework containers are NVIDIA-optimized and performance-tuned and tested to get the most out of NVIDIA GPUs.\nWith access to the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, developers can tap into NVIDIA RAPIDS, NVIDIA Triton Inference Server and the NVIDIA TensorRT software development kit to support enterprise deployments at scale.\nImproving Anomaly Detection With GNNs\nFraudsters have sophisticated techniques and can learn ways to outmaneuver fraud detection systems. One way is by unleashing complex chains of transactions to avoid notice. This is where traditional rules-based systems can miss patterns and fail.\nGNNs build on a concept of representation within the model of local structure and feature context. The information from the edge and node features is propagated with aggregation and message passing among neighboring nodes.\nWhen GNNs run multiple layers of graph convolution, the final node states contain information from nodes multiple hops away. The larger receptive field of GNNs can track the more complex and longer transaction chains used by financial fraud perpetrators in attempts to obscure their tracks.\nGNNs Enable Training Unsupervised or Self-Supervised\u00a0\nDetecting financial fraud patterns at massive scale is challenged by the tens of terabytes of transaction data that needs to be analyzed in the blink of an eye and a relative lack of labeled data for real fraud activity needed to train models.\nWhile GNNs can cast a wider detection net on fraud patterns, they can also train on an unsupervised or self-supervised task.\nBy using techniques such as Bootstrapped Graph Latents \u2014 a graph representation learning method \u2014 or link prediction with negative sampling, GNN developers can pretrain models without labels and fine-tune models with far fewer labels, producing strong graph representations. The output of this can be used for models like XGBoost, GNNs or techniques for clustering, offering better results when deployed for inference.\nTackling Model Explainability and Bias\nGNNs also enable model explainability with a suite of tools. Explainable AI is an industry practice that enables organizations to use such tools and techniques to explain how AI models make decisions, allowing them to safeguard against bias.\nHeterogeneous graph transformer and graph attention network, which are GNN models, enable attention mechanisms across each layer of the GNN, allowing developers to identify message paths that GNNs use to reach a final output.\nEven without an attention mechanism, techniques such as GNNExplainer, PGExplainer and GraphMask have been suggested to explain GNN outputs.\nLeading Financial Services Firms Embrace AI for Gains\n\nAmerican Express: Improved fraud detection accuracy by 6% with deep learning models and used NVIDIA TensorRT on NVIDIA Triton Inference Server.\nBNY Mellon: Bank of New York Mellon improved fraud detection accuracy by 20% with federated learning. BNY built a collaborative fraud detection framework that runs Inpher\u2019s secure multi-party computation, which safeguards third-party data on NVIDIA DGX systems.\u200b\nPayPal: PayPal sought a new fraud detection system that could operate worldwide continuously to protect customer transactions from potential fraud\u200b in real time.\u200b The company delivered a new level of service, using NVIDIA GPU-powered inference to improve real-time fraud detection by 10% while lowering server capacity nearly 8x.\nSwedbank: Among Sweden\u2019s largest banks, Swedbank trained NVIDIA GPU-driven generative adversarial networks to detect suspicious activities in efforts to stop fraud and money laundering.\n\nLearn how NVIDIA AI Enterprise addresses fraud detection at this webinar.\n\n\nCategories: ExplainerTags: Banking | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA Triton | RAPIDS | Synthetic Data Generation | TensorRT \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Many behave in ways that lack depth and realism, making their interactions repetitive and forgettable.\nInworld AI is changing the game by using generative AI to drive NPC behaviors that are dynamic and responsive to player actions. The Mountain View, Calif.-based startup\u2019s Character Engine, which can be used with any character design, is helping studios and developers enhance gameplay and improve player engagement.\n\nRegister for\u00a0NVIDIA GTC, which takes place March 17-21, to hear how leading companies like\u00a0Inworld AI\u00a0are using the latest innovations in AI and graphics.\u00a0And join us at\u00a0Game Developers Conference (GDC) to discover how the latest generative AI and RTX technologies are accelerating game development.\n\nElevate Gaming Experiences: Achievement Unlocked\nThe Inworld team aims to develop AI-powered NPCs that can learn, adapt and build relationships with players while delivering high-quality performance and maintaining in-game immersion.\nTo make it easier for developers to integrate AI-based NPCs into their games, Inworld built Character Engine, which uses generative AI running on NVIDIA technology to create immersive, interactive characters. It\u2019s built to be production-ready, scalable and optimized for real-time experiences.\nThe Character Engine comprises three layers: Character Brain, Contextual Mesh and Real-Time AI.\nCharacter Brain orchestrates a character\u2019s performance by syncing to its multiple personality machine learning models, such as for text-to-speech, automatic speech recognition, emotions, gestures and animations.\nThe layer also enables AI-based NPCs to learn and adapt, navigate relationships and perform motivated actions. For example, users can create triggers using the \u201cGoals and Action\u201d feature to program NPCs to behave in a certain way in response to a given player input.\nContextual Mesh allows developers to set parameters for content and safety mechanisms, custom knowledge and narrative controls. Game developers can use the \u201cRelationships\u201d feature to create emergent narratives, such that an ally can turn into an enemy or vice versa based on how players treat an NPC.\nOne big challenge developers face when using generative AI is keeping NPCs in-world and on-message. Inworld\u2019s Contextual Mesh layer helps overcome this hurdle by rendering characters within the logic and fantasy of their worlds, effectively avoiding the hallucinations that commonly appear when using large language models (LLMs).\nThe Real-Time AI layer ensures optimal performance and scalability for real-time experiences.\n\nPowering Up AI Workflows With NVIDIA\u00a0\nInworld, a member of the NVIDIA Inception program, which supports startups through every stage of their development, uses NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs and NVIDIA Triton Inference Server as integral parts of its generative AI training and deployment infrastructure.\nInworld used the open-source NVIDIA Triton Inference Server software to standardize other non-generative machine learning model deployments required to power Character Brain features, such as emotions. The startup also plans to use the open-source NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM library to optimize inference performance. Both NVIDIA Triton Inference Server and TensorRT-LLM are available with the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, which provides security, stability and support for production AI.\nInworld also used NVIDIA A100 GPUs within Slurm-managed bare-metal machines for its production training pipelines. Similar machines wrapped in Kubernetes help manage character interactions during gameplay. This setup delivers real-time generative AI at the lowest possible cost.\n\u201cWe chose to use NVIDIA A100 GPUs because they provided the best, most cost-efficient option for our machine learning workloads compared to other solutions,\u201d said Igor Poletaev, vice president of AI at Inworld.\n\u201cOur customers and partners are looking to find novel and innovative ways to drive player engagement metrics by integrating AI NPC functionalities into their gameplay,\u201d said Poletaev. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to achieve real-time performance without hardware accelerators, which is why we required GPUs to be integrated into our backend architecture from the very beginning.\u201d\n\nInworld\u2019s generative AI-powered NPCs have enabled dynamic, evergreen gaming experiences that keep players coming back. Developers and gamers alike have reported enhanced player engagement, satisfaction and retention.\nInworld has powered AI-based NPC experiences from Niantic, LG UPlus, Alpine Electronics and more.

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Accessibility is a key element that all designers must consider before constructing a space or product \u2014 but the evaluation process has traditionally been tedious and time-consuming.\nMathew Schwartz, an assistant professor in architecture and design at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, is using the NVIDIA Omniverse platform and the Universal Scene Description framework, aka OpenUSD, to help architects, interior designers and industrial designers address this challenge.\nSchwartz\u2019s research and design lab SiBORG \u2014 which stands for simulation, biomechanics, robotics and graphics \u2014 focuses on understanding and improving design workflows, especially in relation to accessibility, human factors and automation. Schwartz and his team develop algorithms for research projects and turn them into usable products.\nUsing Omniverse\u00a0 \u2014 a development platform that enables multi-app workflows and real-time collaboration \u2014 the team developed open-source, OpenUSD-based code that automatically generates a complex accessibility graph for building design. This code is based on Schwartz\u2019s research paper, \u201cHuman centric accessibility graph for environment analysis.\u201d\nThe graph provides feedback related to human movement, such as the estimated energy expenditure required for taking a certain path, the number of steps it takes to complete the path, or the angles of any inclines along it.\nWith Omniverse, teams can use Schwartz\u2019s code to visualize the graph and the paths that it creates. This can help designers better evaluate building code and safety for occupants while providing important accessibility insights.\n\nThe Power of OpenUSD\nTraditionally, feedback on accessibility and environmental conditions during the building design process has been limited to building code analysis. Schwartz\u2019s work enables designers to overcome this obstacle by seamlessly integrating Omniverse and OpenUSD.\nPreviously, he had to switch between multiple applications to achieve different aspects of his simulation and modeling projects. His workflows were often split between tools such as Unity, which supports simulations with people, and McNeel Rhino3D, which offers 3D modeling features.\nWith OpenUSD, he can now combine his research, Python code, 3D environments and renders, and favorite tools into Omniverse.\n\u201cWhat got me hooked on Omniverse was how it allows me to combine the Python application programming interface with powerful physics, rendering and animation software,\u201d he said. \u201cMy team took full advantage of the flexible Python APIs in Omniverse to develop almost the entire user interface.\u201d\nSchwartz\u2019s team uses Omniverse to visualize and interact with existing open-source Python code in ways that don\u2019t require external work, like seamlessly linking to a third-party app. The lab\u2019s versatile data analysis tool can interact with any program that\u2019s compatible with OpenUSD.\n\u201cWith OpenUSD and Omniverse, we\u2019ve been able to expand the scope of our research, as we can easily combine data analysis and visualization with the design process,\u201d said Schwartz.\nRunning Realistic Renderings and Simulations\n\nSchwartz also uses Omniverse to simulate crowd movement and interactions.\nHe accelerates large crowd simulations and animations using two NVIDIA RTX A4500 GPUs, which enable real-time visualization. These accelerated simulations can help designers gain valuable insights into how people with reduced mobility can navigate and interact in spaces.\n\u201cWe can also show what locations will offer the best areas to place signage so that it\u2019s most visible,\u201d said Schwartz. \u201cOur simulation work can be used to visualize paths taken in an early-stage design \u2014 this provides feedback on accessibility to prevent problems with building code, while allowing users to create designs that go beyond the minimum requirements.\u201d\n\nSchwartz also taps the feedback and assistance of many developers and researchers who actively engage on the Omniverse Discord channel. This collaborative environment has been instrumental in Schwartz\u2019s journey, he said, as well as to the platform\u2019s continuous improvement.\nSchwartz\u2019s open-source code is available for designers to use and enhance their design workflows.

It converts video feeds from the airport\u2019s existing camera systems into structured data.\nUsing anonymized footage, the platform counts how many travelers are in a line, identifies congested areas and predicts passenger wait times, among other tasks \u2014 and it alerts staff in real time to speed operations.\nThe platform also offers analytical reports that enable operations teams to assess performance, plan more effectively and redeploy staff for optimal efficiency.\nIn addition to providing airport operators data-driven insights, live wait-time statistics from Zensors AI are published on Toronto Pearson\u2019s online dashboard, as well as on electronic displays in the terminals. This lets passengers easily access accurate information about how long customs or security processes will take. And it increases customer satisfaction overall and reduces potential anxieties about whether they\u2019ll be able to make connecting flights.\n\u201cThe analyses we get from the Zensors platform are proving to be very accurate,\u201d said Zeljko Cakic, director of airport IT planning and development at the Greater Toronto Airport Authority, Toronto Pearson\u2019s managing company. \u201cOur goal is to improve overall customer experience and reduce wait times, and the data gathered through the Zensors platform is one of the key contributors for decision-making to drive these results.\u201d\nAccurate AI Powered by NVIDIA\nZensors AI \u2014 built with vision transformer models \u2014 offers insights with an impressive accuracy of about 96% compared to when humans validate the information manually. It\u2019s all powered by NVIDIA technology.\n\u201cThe Zensors model development and inference run-time stack is effectively the NVIDIA AI stack,\u201d Jain said.\nThe company uses NVIDIA GPUs and the CUDA parallel computing platform to train its AI models, along with the cuDNN accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks and the NVIDIA DALI library for decoding and augmenting images and videos.\nWith checkpoints at Toronto Pearson open 24/7, Zensors AI inference runs around the clock on NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, an open-source software available through the NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform.\nThe company estimates that using NVIDIA Triton to optimize its inference run-time decreased its monthly cloud GPU spending by more than 20%. In this way, NVIDIA technology enables Zensors to provide a high-availability, production-grade, fully managed service for Toronto Pearson and other clients, Jain said.\n\u201cToday, lots of companies and organizations want to adopt AI, but the hard part is figuring out how to go about it,\u201d he added. \u201cBeing a part of NVIDIA Metropolis gives us the best tools and enables more visibility for potential end users of Zensors technology, which ultimately lets users deploy AI with ease.\u201d\nZensors is also a member of NVIDIA Inception, a free program that nurtures cutting-edge startups.\nVisual AI for the Future of Transportation\nAmong many other customers who use Zensors AI is Ireland\u2019s Cork Airport, which uses the platform to optimize its operations from curb to gate. In June, Zensors AI was deployed across the airport in just 20 days and, in less than four months, the platform helped save about 90 hours of congestion time through proactive curbside traffic management.\n\u201cAviation is just one part of mobility,\u201d Jain said. \u201cWe\u2019re expanding to rail, bus and multimodal transit \u2014 and we believe Zensors will provide the layer of intelligence to eventually bring AI to all types of brick-and-mortar operators.\u201d\nLooking forward, the company is working to incorporate generative AI and large language models into the question-answering capabilities of its platform in a safe, reliable way.\nLearn more about the NVIDIA Metropolis\u00a0platform and how it\u2019s used in smart cities and spaces\u00a0to build smarter, safer travel hubs, including at Bengaluru Airport, one of India\u2019s busiest airports.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | Customer Stories | GPU | Inception | Machine Learning | Metropolis | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Dubbed \u201cSeason 1\u201d, the massive content drop has something for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Call of Duty: Warzone, the free-to-play massive combat arena title, players can now deploy to Urzikstan, the game\u2019s newest big map, which is sure to excite veterans and newcomers alike. This high-density urban layout has exciting points of interest, and players can move through this city landscape with the return of slide cancel, as well as more responsive movement allowing for faster-paced play. With exhilarating new features such as the Drivable Train, Horizontal Ziplines, new Gulag map, and gameplay features, it\u2019s time to call up the squad and drop in.\nFor GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers, Season 1 sees the debut of NVIDIA DLSS 3 in Call of Duty: Warzone, multiplying performance. GeForce RTX 20 Series and 30 Series gamers can boost performance with DLSS Super Resolution.\nAnd if performance is high enough already in your opinion, you can instead enable NVIDIA DLAA, an AI-based anti-aliasing mode that utilizes the same technology developed for DLSS. DLAA uses a native resolution image to maximize image quality, rather than boosting performance, for an even richer, more detailed experience.\nAdditionally, all GeForce gamers, dating back to users of the GeForce GTX 900 Series, can activate NVIDIA Reflex.\nNVIDIA Reflex is synonymous with responsive gaming, and can be found in the latest and greatest games. Reflex reduces system latency so your actions occur quicker, potentially giving you a competitive edge in multiplayer matches, and making single-player titles more responsive and enjoyable. NVIDIA Reflex is now used by over 50 million players each month, is available in 9 of the top 10 competitive shooters, and is activated by 90% of GeForce gamers in over 90 supported titles.\nIn Call of Duty: Warzone, NVIDIA Reflex reduces system latency, and combined with the super fast frame rates delivered by DLSS, you can let your skill shine when competing on the battlefields of Urzikstan, Ashika Island and Vondel.\nWith the release of Season 1 for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Warzone, NVIDIA DLSS 3, NVIDIA DLSS 2, NVIDIA DLAA, NVIDIA Reflex, and NVIDIA Image Scaling are now supported in all modes, as well in every Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II mode, giving GeForce RTX gamers the definitive PC experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III Adds Full Ray Tracing & NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 To Lobbies On December 6th\nCall of Duty HQ serves as the hub for all Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Warzone content, enabling players to quickly access Multiplayer, Zombies, Battle Royale, the Firing Range, and more. On December 6th, GeForce RTX gamers can activate full ray tracing in the lobbies of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Warzone, enabling you to see your characters, skins, vehicles, and weapons in an entirely new light.\nFull ray tracing, otherwise known as path tracing, is a demanding but highly accurate way to render light and its effect on a scene. Reflections, shadows, ambient occlusion, and more are all amped up, letting your Call of Duty content shine with incredible detail and realism. Inspect your Gunsmith weapons with enhanced detail, see your characters with pixel-perfect lighting and shadowing, head to the Firing Range to test your beautifully rendered loadouts, and marvel at immersive pre-game moments with you and your assembled squad.\nAll GeForce RTX gamers can activate pre-game Path Tracing via the Video options menu, and doing so will automatically enable NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 with DLSS Ray Reconstruction. Ray Reconstruction replaces hand-tuned ray tracing denoisers with a new unified AI model, elevating the image quality of ray-traced effects and full ray tracing to new heights, further enhancing detail, realism and immersion.\nFor even faster performance, in all available campaigns and modes for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, and Call of Duty: Warzone, activate DLSS Frame Generation, which multiplies frame rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition Update 2.1 Further Enhances Full Ray Tracing & DLSS\nIn Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, immerse yourself in every story the world of the dark future has to offer, including the base game, its acclaimed spy-thriller expansion Phantom Liberty, and the game-changing Update 2.0 - all in one package.\u00a0\nBecome an urban outlaw equipped with cybernetic enhancements and build your legend on the streets of Night City. Go on daring adventures and build relationships with unforgettable characters whose fates are shaped by the choices you make, and decide how V's story ends. Your choices in the base game and Phantom Liberty create interweaving webs of consequences, ones that shape the fate of the characters around you \u2014 and your own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate 2.1 ships alongside Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition and is available for free to owners of both the Ultimate Edition and the original Cyberpunk 2077 on PC. This major update for the incredible game is stacked with content, and new technical enhancements for PC players.\nOn the content front, players can now travel through Night City using a new metro system, which includes unique subway scenes and interactions. Players can now romance their partners in the comfort of their apartments, and can listen to radio stations when on-foot and riding the subway. Additionally, amongst a long list of other additions, a previously closed highway is now open to vehicles and the NCPD, new motorbikes and cars are available for purchase, select boss fights have been revamped, replayable street races have been introduced, new world mini stories are available to discover, and rasterized graphics have been enhanced for all platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen playing Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty on a GeForce RTX GPU, gamers have a laundry list of incredible options available to take performance and image quality to the next level. DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Frame Generation multiply frame rates by up to 5X, full ray tracing replaces lighting with a unified, jaw-dropping path-traced model that takes immersion to 11, DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction makes revolutionary use of AI to further improve image quality and performance, and Reflex makes Cyberpunk 2077 gameplay even more responsive, delivering the best gameplay experience possible on any platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate 2.1 makes that technology even better, once again raising the bar for image quality, immersion, and realism.\nFull ray tracing, activated via the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, exits Preview status with the release of the Ultimate Edition, boasting additional improvements.\nUnder the hood, technologies including Shader Execution Reordering (SER) and Opacity Micromaps (OMM) have delivered significant performance gains during the evolution of the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode.\u00a0\nNow, we're introducing Reservoir-based Spatiotemporal Importance Resampling Global Illumination (ReSTIR GI) with the launch of Update 2.1 and the Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition. ReSTIR GI is an advanced sampling technique for indirect lighting available in the NVIDIA RTXDI SDK, which further improves the quality of fully ray traced lighting in Cyberpunk 2077.\nBefore the release of Update 2.1, some scenes were darker than intended due to the loss of lighting energy during denoising. Using ReSTIR GI, local lighting is appropriately bright, and light now travels further, illuminating a scene further into the distance and increasing the brightness of previously illuminated detail.\nIn Update 2.0, the movement of dynamic characters, the equipping of new weapons and items, or the moving of the camera could cause full ray tracing to visibly update in areas that were previously occluded. With the introduction of ReSTIR GI in Update 2.1, disocclusion noise has been greatly reduced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\nIn conjunction with Ray Reconstruction enhancements in Update 2.1, ReSTIR GI significantly reduces the ghosting of moving game elements and their shadows, further improving image quality and immersion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with Ray Reconstruction, it replaces several hand-tuned ray tracing denoisers with a single, unified AI model that accelerates performance by up to 5X in conjunction with DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation, and dramatically enhances path tracing image quality. Reflections are substantially clearer, light responds near instantaneously, and image quality overall is further improved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the launch of Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition and Update 2.1, Ray Reconstruction has been further refined. Now, the fidelity and realism of skin rendering is improved, and the quality of eye reflections enhanced, making character close ups in conversations and cinematic moments even better.\nAdditionally, Ray Reconstruction will now be usable when activating Ray-Traced Reflections, either as part of a preset, or when configuring custom settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Ray Reconstruction enabled, the clarity and fidelity of reflected game elements is noticeably enhanced (click the icon on the bottom right to view in fullscreen)\nThese enhancements, additions and improvements mean that CD PROJEKT RED will be removing the Technology Preview label from the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, signifying that it has reached its potential, and the promise of being the next revolution in real-time graphics rendering.\u00a0\nIn advance of Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition and Update 2.1\u2019s launch, we\u2019ve released a new GeForce Game Ready Driver, which is required to take advantage of the tech outlined above. To get your system ready ahead of December 5th, go to the Drivers tab of GeForce Experience or GeForce.com to download and install our Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition Game Ready Driver.\nGeForce Game Ready Drivers deliver the best experience for your favorite PC games. They\u2019re finely tuned in collaboration with developers and extensively tested across thousands of hardware configurations for maximum performance and reliability. Game Ready Drivers also allow you to optimize game settings in GeForce Experience with a single click, and empower you with the latest NVIDIA technologies.\nIf you don\u2019t have a powerful GeForce RTX PC or laptop, you can still enjoy and experience Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition by streaming it from the cloud with the same technologies as GeForce RTX 40-Series owners, including DLSS 3.5, Ray Reconstruction, and Reflex, thanks to NVIDIA GeForce NOW Ultimate. Members can play over 1,700 games they already own from Steam, Epic Games Store, Xbox, Ubisoft Connect, and GOG.com. Head over to the GeForce NOW website to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen playing Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty on a GeForce RTX GPU, gamers have a laundry list of incredible options available to take performance and image quality to the next level. DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation multiply frame rates by up to 5X, full ray tracing replaces lighting with a unified, jaw-dropping path-traced model that takes immersion to 11, DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction makes revolutionary use of AI to further improve image quality and performance, and Reflex makes Cyberpunk 2077 gameplay even more responsive, delivering the best gameplay experience possible on any platform. See for yourself when patch 2.1 and the Ultimate Edition are released December 5th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Back Next Week For Even More RTX Games\nEach week there are even more DLSS integrations arriving for an array of games. Check back next week for a rundown of the next DLSS and RTX games, and head here to see the complete list of several hundred DLSS-enhanced games and apps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Additionally, there\u2019s support for Fortnite Chapter 5 and its 3 new modes, and Squad\u2019s DLSS 3, DLAA and Reflex update.\nTo download and install, head to the Drivers tab of GeForce Experience or GeForce.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE FINALS Is Available Now With DLSS 3, DLAA, Reflex & Ray Tracing\nEmbark Studios\u2019 THE FINALS is a free-to-play shooter set in a highly destructive world, making each match unique. Players form teams of three and enter tournaments that see the lowest-ranked teams dropped, concluding with a one-on-one grand finale for the title of champion. The goal is to collect, carry, and bank boxes of cash - the team with the most cash at the end of the round wins. But team wipes and steals see the pendulum of success swing widely from moment to moment, putting contestants on the edges of their seats each and every match.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE FINALS was recently shadow dropped on Steam in a surprise announcement, giving gamers instant access to environments that can be blown apart by explosives and an arsenal of weapons. As buildings are blown open, and walls come crashing down, the world\u2019s lighting needs to react realistically as light is occluded or disoccluded. To make this a reality, NVIDIA RTX Global Illumination (RTXGI) is used to accurately calculate and update light and shadow in real-time on all platforms.\nWith a GeForce RTX GPU in your PC or laptop, RTXGI can leverage hardware-accelerated ray tracing to produce richer and more realistic global illumination effects. When enabled, you\u2019ll experience light realistically bouncing around the environment, reacting to destruction, and interacting with volumetric fog and smoke. And light and shadow will look even better.\nAt 4K, DLSS 3 multiplies performance by 2X on average, when ray tracing and every other setting is maxed out, enabling smooth 100+ FPS gameplay on the GeForce RTX 4070 and up, and frame rates of up to 226 FPS on the GeForce RTX 4090, giving you the definitive experience in THE FINALS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 2560x1440, performance is boosted by 1.6X on average, enabling all GeForce RTX 40 Series desktop gamers to play THE FINALS at over 100 FPS with max settings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 1920x1080, a 1.6X average improvement enables flawless every GeForce RTX 40 Series gamer to play at over 144 FPS, with frame rates hitting an incredible 300-plus on the GeForce RTX 4080 and 4090:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your performance in THE FINALS is high enough already, you can instead enable NVIDIA DLAA, an AI-based anti-aliasing mode that utilizes the same technology developed for DLSS. DLAA uses a native resolution image to maximize image quality, rather than boosting performance, for an even richer, more detailed experience.\nAnd to make gameplay even more responsive in THE FINALS, all GeForce gamers with GPUs dating back to the GTX 900 Series can enable NVIDIA Reflex, which reduces system latency by up to 57%.\nWith Reflex, DLSS, and hardware-accelerated ray tracing, GeForce RTX gamers will receive the definitive experience in THE FINALS. See for yourself in our new frag video, leveraging all three technologies to deliver the best gameplay possible:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload THE FINALS on Steam, and install our new Game Ready Driver to further optimize gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFortnite Chapter 5 Now Available, New Fortnite Experiences Each Enhanced By DLSS 2 & Reflex\nFortnite\u2019s Unreal Engine 5 upgrade brought astonishing new visuals to the world\u2019s most popular Battle Royale. On GeForce RTX PCs and laptops, Fortnite players can boost performance using DLSS 2, gameplay is even more responsive thanks to NVIDIA Reflex, and ray tracing performance is accelerated significantly using the dedicated RT Cores on each GeForce RTX GPU.\nChapter 5 of Fortnite Battle Royale brings a beautiful new Island, but not all is what it seems. \u201cThe Society\u201d is pulling the strings in secret, and they\u2019ve taken Peely in their spite.

Sid Siddeek, who runs NVIDIA\u2019s venture capital arm, knows this well.\nSiddeek still remembers one of his first jobs, schlepping presentation materials from one investor meeting to another, helping the startup\u2019s CEO and management team get the story out while working from a trailer that \u201cshook when the door opened,\u201d he said.\nThat CEO was Jensen Huang. The startup was NVIDIA.\nSiddeek, who has worked as an investor and an entrepreneur, knows how important it is to find the right people to share your company\u2019s story with early on, whether they\u2019re customers or partners, employees or investors.\nIt\u2019s this very principle that underpins NVIDIA\u2019s multifaceted approach to investing in the next wave of innovation, a strategy also championed by Vishal Bhagwati, who leads NVIDIA\u2019s corporate development efforts.\nIt\u2019s an effort that\u2019s resulted in more than two dozen investments so far this year, accelerating as the pace of innovation in AI and accelerated computing quickens.\nNVIDIA\u2019s Three-Pronged Strategy to Support the AI Ecosystem\nThere are three ways that NVIDIA invests in the ecosystem, driving the transformation unleashed by accelerated computing. First, through NVIDIA\u2019s corporate investments, overseen by Bhagwati. Second, through NVentures, our venture capital arm, led by Siddeek. And finally, through NVIDIA Inception, our vehicle for supporting startups and connecting them to venture capital.\nThere couldn\u2019t be a better time to support companies harnessing NVIDIA technologies. AI alone could contribute more than $15 trillion to the global economy by 2030, according to PwC.\nAnd if you\u2019re working in AI and accelerated computing right now, NVIDIA stands ready to help. Developers across every industry in every country are building accelerated computing applications. And they\u2019re just getting going.\nThe result is a collection of companies that are advancing the story of AI every day. They include Cohere, CoreWeave, Hugging Face, Inflection, Inceptive and many more. And we\u2019re right alongside them.\n\u201cPartnering with NVIDIA is a game-changer,\u201d said Ed Mehr, CEO of Machina Labs. \u201cTheir unmatched expertise will supercharge our AI and simulation capabilities.\u201d\nCorporate Investments: Growing Our Ecosystem\nNVIDIA\u2019s corporate investments arm focuses on strategic collaborations. These partnerships stimulate joint innovation, enhance the NVIDIA platform and expand the ecosystem. Since the beginning of 2023, announcements have been made about 14 investments.\nThese target companies include Ayar Labs, specializing in chip-to-chip optical connectivity, and Hugging Face, a hub for advanced AI models.\nThe portfolio also includes next-generation enterprise solutions. Databricks offers an industry-leading data platform for machine learning, while Cohere provides enterprise automation through AI. Other notable companies are Recursion, Kore.ai and Utilidata, each contributing unique solutions in drug discovery, conversational AI and smart electricity grids, respectively.\nConsumer services are another investment focus. Inflection is crafting a personal AI for creative expression, while Runway serves as a platform for art and creativity through generative AI.\nThe investment strategy extends to autonomous machines. Ready Robotics is developing an operating system for industrial robotics, and Skydio builds autonomous drones.\nNVIDIA\u2019s most recent investments are in cloud service providers like CoreWeave. These platforms cater to a diverse clientele, from startups to Fortune 500 companies seeking to build next-generation AI services.\nNVentures: Investing Alongside Entrepreneurs\nThrough NVentures, we support innovators who are deeply relevant to NVIDIA. We aim to generate strong financial returns and expand the ecosystem by funding companies that use our platforms across a wide range of industries.\nTo date, NVentures has made 19 investments in companies in healthcare, manufacturing and other key verticals. Some examples of our portfolio companies include:\n\nGenesis Therapeutics, Inceptive, Terray, Charm, Evozyne, Generate, Superluminal: revolutionizing drug discovery\nMachina Labs, Seurat Technologies: disrupting industrial processes to improve manufacturing\nPassiveLogic: automating building systems with AI\nMindsDB: for developers that need to connect enterprise data to AI\nMoon Surgical: improving laparoscopic surgery with AI\nTwelve Labs: developing multimodal foundation models for video understanding\nFlywheel: accelerating medical imaging data development\nLuma AI: developers of visual and multimodal models\nOutrider: automating logistics hub operation\nSynthesia: AI Video for the enterprise\nReplicate: developer platform for open-source and custom models\n\nAll these companies are building on work being done inside and outside NVIDIA.\n\u201cNVentures has a network, not just within NVIDIA, but throughout the industry, to make sure we have access to the best technology and the best people to build all the different modules that have to come together to define the distribution and supply chain of the future,\u201d said Andrew Smith, CEO of Outrider.\nNVIDIA Inception: Supporting Startups and Connecting Them to Investors\nIn addition, we\u2019re continuing to support startups with NVIDIA Inception. Launched in 2016, this free global program offers technology and marketing support to over 17,000 startups across multiple industries and over 125 countries.\nAnd, as part of Inception, we\u2019re partnering with venture capitalists through our VC Alliance, a program that offers benefits to our valued network of venture capital firms, including connecting startups with potential investors.\nPartnering With Innovators in Every Industry\nWhatever our relationship, whether as a partner or investor, we can offer companies unique forms of support.\nNVIDIA has the technology. NVIDIA has the richest set of libraries and the deepest understanding of the frameworks needed to optimize training and inference pipelines.\nWe have the go-to-market skills. NVIDIA has tremendous field sales, solution architect and developer relations organizations with a long track record of working with the most innovative startups and the largest companies in the world.\nWe know how to grow. We have people throughout our organization who are recognized leaders in their respective fields and can offer expert advice to companies of all sizes and industries.\n\u201cPartnering with NVIDIA was an easy choice,\u201d said Victor Riparbelli, cofounder and CEO of Synthesia. \u201cWe use their hardware, benefit from their AI expertise and get valuable insights, allowing us to build better products faster.\u201d\nAccelerating the Greatest Breakthroughs of Our Time\nIn turn, these investments augment our R&D in the software, systems and semiconductors undergirding this ecosystem.\nWith NVIDIA\u2019s technologies poised to accelerate the work of researchers and scientists, entrepreneurs, startups and Fortune 500 companies, finding ways to support companies that rely on our technologies\u2014 with engineering resources, marketing support and capital \u2014 is more vital than ever.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Explainer \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Each reason has multiple facets well worth exploring, but at a high level:\n\nGPUs employ parallel processing.\nGPU systems scale up to supercomputing heights.\nThe GPU software stack for AI is broad and deep.\n\nThe net result is GPUs perform technical calculations faster and with greater energy efficiency than CPUs. That means they deliver leading performance for AI training and inference as well as gains across a wide array of applications that use accelerated computing.\nIn its recent report on AI, Stanford\u2019s Human-Centered AI group provided some context. GPU performance \u201chas increased roughly 7,000 times\u201d since 2003 and price per performance is \u201c5,600 times greater,\u201d it reported.\nA 2023 report captured the steep rise in GPU performance and price/performance.\nThe report also cited analysis from Epoch, an independent research group that measures and forecasts AI advances.\n\u201cGPUs are the dominant computing platform for accelerating machine learning workloads, and most (if not all) of the biggest models over the last five years have been trained on GPUs \u2026 [they have] thereby centrally contributed to the recent progress in AI,\u201d Epoch said on its site.\nA 2020 study assessing AI technology for the U.S. government drew similar conclusions.\n\u201cWe expect [leading-edge] AI chips are one to three orders of magnitude more cost-effective than leading-node CPUs when counting production and operating costs,\u201d it said.\nNVIDIA GPUs have increased performance on AI inference 1,000x in the last ten years, said Bill Dally, the company\u2019s chief scientist in a keynote at Hot Chips, an annual gathering of semiconductor and systems engineers.\nChatGPT Spread the News\nChatGPT provided a powerful example of how GPUs are great for AI. The large language model (LLM), trained and run on thousands of NVIDIA GPUs, runs generative AI services used by more than 100 million people.\nSince its 2018 launch, MLPerf, the industry-standard benchmark for AI, has provided numbers that detail the leading performance of NVIDIA GPUs on both AI training and inference.\nFor example, NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips swept the latest round of inference tests. NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM, inference software released since that test, delivers up to an 8x boost in performance and more than a 5x reduction in energy use and total cost of ownership. Indeed, NVIDIA GPUs have won every round of MLPerf training and inference tests since the benchmark was released in 2019.\nIn February, NVIDIA GPUs delivered leading results for inference, serving up thousands of inferences per second on the most demanding models in the STAC-ML Markets benchmark, a key technology performance gauge for the financial services industry.\nA RedHat software engineering team put it succinctly in a blog: \u201cGPUs have become the foundation of artificial intelligence.\u201d\nAI Under the Hood\nA brief look under the hood shows why GPUs and AI make a powerful pairing.\nAn AI model, also called a neural network, is essentially a mathematical lasagna, made from layer upon layer of linear algebra equations. Each equation represents the likelihood that one piece of data is related to another.\nFor their part, GPUs pack thousands of cores, tiny calculators working in parallel to slice through the math that makes up an AI model. This, at a high level, is how AI computing works.\nHighly Tuned Tensor Cores\nOver time, NVIDIA\u2019s engineers have tuned GPU cores to the evolving needs of AI models. The latest GPUs include Tensor Cores that are 60x more powerful than the first-generation designs for processing the matrix math neural networks use.\nIn addition, NVIDIA Hopper Tensor Core GPUs include a Transformer Engine that can automatically adjust to the optimal precision needed to process transformer models, the class of neural networks that spawned generative AI.\nAlong the way, each GPU generation has packed more memory and optimized techniques to store an entire AI model in a single GPU or set of GPUs.\nModels Grow, Systems Expand\nThe complexity of AI models is expanding a whopping 10x a year.\nThe current state-of-the-art LLM, GPT4, packs more than a trillion parameters, a metric of its mathematical density. That\u2019s up from less than 100 million parameters for a popular LLM in 2018.\nIn a recent talk at Hot Chips, NVIDIA Chief Scientist Bill Dally described how single-GPU performance on AI inference expanded 1,000x in the last decade.\nGPU systems have kept pace by ganging up on the challenge. They scale up to supercomputers, thanks to their fast NVLink interconnects and NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand networks.\nFor example, the DGX GH200, a large-memory AI supercomputer, combines up to 256 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips into a single data-center-sized GPU with 144 terabytes of shared memory.\nEach GH200 superchip is a single server with 72 Arm Neoverse CPU cores and four petaflops of AI performance. A new four-way Grace Hopper systems configuration puts in a single compute node a whopping 288 Arm cores and 16 petaflops of AI performance with up to 2.3 terabytes of high-speed memory.\nAnd NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs announced in November pack up to 288 gigabytes of the latest HBM3e memory technology.\nSoftware Covers the Waterfront\nAn expanding ocean of GPU software has evolved since 2007 to enable every facet of AI, from deep-tech features to high-level applications.\nThe NVIDIA AI platform includes hundreds of software libraries and apps. The CUDA programming language and the cuDNN-X library for deep learning provide a base on top of which developers have created software like NVIDIA NeMo, a framework to let users build, customize and run inference on their own generative AI models.\nMany of these elements are available as open-source software, the grab-and-go staple of software developers. More than a hundred of them are packaged into the NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform for companies that require full security and support. Increasingly, they\u2019re also available from major cloud service providers as APIs and services on NVIDIA DGX Cloud.\nSteerLM, one of the latest AI software updates for NVIDIA GPUs, lets users fine tune models during inference.\nA 70x Speedup in 2008\nSuccess stories date back to a 2008 paper from AI pioneer Andrew Ng, then a Stanford researcher. Using two NVIDIA GeForce GTX 280 GPUs, his three-person team achieved a 70x speedup over CPUs processing an AI model with 100 million parameters, finishing work that used to require several weeks in a single day.\n\u201cModern graphics processors far surpass the computational capabilities of multicore CPUs, and have the potential to revolutionize the applicability of deep unsupervised learning methods,\u201d they reported.\nAndrew Ng described his experiences using GPUs for AI in a GTC 2015 talk.\nIn a 2015 talk at NVIDIA GTC, Ng described how he continued using more GPUs to scale up his work, running larger models at Google Brain and Baidu. Later, he helped found Coursera, an online education platform where he taught hundreds of thousands of AI students.\nNg counts Geoff Hinton, one of the godfathers of modern AI, among the people he influenced. \u201cI remember going to Geoff Hinton saying check out CUDA, I think it can help build bigger neural networks,\u201d he said in the GTC talk.\nThe University of Toronto professor spread the word. \u201cIn 2009, I remember giving a talk at NIPS [now NeurIPS], where I told about 1,000 researchers they should all buy GPUs because GPUs are going to be the future of machine learning,\u201d Hinton said in a press report.\nFast Forward With GPUs\nAI\u2019s gains are expected to ripple across the global economy.\nA McKinsey report in June estimated that generative AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually across the 63 use cases it analyzed in industries like banking, healthcare and retail. So, it\u2019s no surprise Stanford\u2019s 2023 AI report said that a majority of business leaders expect to increase their investments in AI.\nToday, more than 40,000 companies use NVIDIA GPUs for AI and accelerated computing, attracting a global community of 4 million developers. Together they\u2019re advancing science, healthcare, finance and virtually every industry.\nAmong the latest achievements, NVIDIA described a whopping 700,000x speedup using AI to ease climate change by keeping carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere (see video below). It\u2019s one of many ways NVIDIA is applying the performance of GPUs to AI and beyond.\nLearn how GPUs put AI into production.\n\nExplore generative AI sessions and experiences at NVIDIA GTC, the global conference on AI and accelerated computing, running March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., and online.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Explainer | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | CUDA | Customer Stories | DGX Cloud | Hardware | Inference | Machine Learning | NVIDIA DGX | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA Quantum-2 | NVLink | Parallel Computing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He is based in New York City.\n\n 7 December 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRest of World/NVIDIA\n\n \n\n\nRest of World/NVIDIA\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\tBy Russell Brandom \n\n\n7 December 2023 \n\n\n\n \nExporter Newsletter\nCasualties of the chip war\nBy Russell Brandom\n\n\n\n>\nExporter Newsletter\nThis article is originally from Exporter, a newsletter covering the latest on U.S. tech giants and their impact outside the West. You can read past editions here.\n\n\n \n\nLast week, I wrote about the flood of appeals coming to the Oversight Board about the bloodshed in Israel and Gaza. Now, the board is starting to take action on those appeals, launching expedited reviews of two cases: one involving footage of kidnapped Israelis and another showing the aftermath of the strike on the al-Shifa Hospital. The reviews were announced this morning, with a final ruling expected within 30 days.\n\nIt feels odd to say it, but the most successful tech company of the year is a hardware components business. Nvidia has had an incredible year, tripling its market cap over the course of 2023. The company\u2019s processing systems are at the heart of ChatGPT and the new wave of large language models (LLMs). As companies like Meta scramble to catch up, it means spending billions on more hardware from the same supplier. In the last reported quarter, Nvidia\u2019s data center business made over $14 billion in sales \u2014 more than four times what it did the year before.\nUnderstandably, CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang has taken a victory lap in the press. A few hours before Elon Musk\u2019s disastrous appearance at The New York Times\u2019 DealBook summit, Huang was interviewed on the same stage about the company\u2019s success and his tempered expectations for self-reasoning artificial intelligence. A profile of Huang in The New Yorker\u2019s AI issue last month aptly compared Nvidia to companies that sold prospecting supplies during the gold rush.\nAs far as the U.S. is concerned, the problem is AI development in China.\nNvidia has so much good news that some really serious bad news can pass by almost unnoticed. On the most recent earnings call, the company announced it was anticipating a problem with its data center sales to China, on the heels of a new round of export restrictions from the U.S. Department of Commerce. According to Nvidia\u2019s internal figures, sales to China represent as much as a quarter of its data center sales, or roughly $3.6 billion. The new restrictions, placed on the Nvidia GPUs that are hardest to replicate, could reduce that business to almost nothing.\nHuang took an optimistic view of the restrictions at the DealBook summit: \u201cWe have to come up with new chips that comply with the regulation,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we\u2019ll go back to market.\u201d\nBut there is a bit of a cat-and-mouse game here, as Nvidia responds to regulations with new chip designs and the U.S. responds to those designs with new restrictions. As far as the U.S. is concerned, the problem is AI development in China in general, rather than some particular quirk of a GPU.\nSo far, the U.S. officials in charge have been talking tough. \u201cIf you redesign a chip around a particular cut line that enables them to do AI, I\u2019m going to control it the very next day,\u201d U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said at a conference last week. It\u2019s hard to imagine a chip that\u2019s weak enough to be exportable but still powerful enough to be useful. And if Nvidia can\u2019t thread that needle, it would mean giving up the entire $3.6 billion.\nChina, meanwhile, is desperately trying to prop up Huawei as an alternate source \u2014 although the company seems unlikely to be able to compete on either scale or quality. But as long as they\u2019re operating in completely segregated markets, \u201ccompete\u201d isn\u2019t even quite the right word. China\u2019s LLMs are still far behind those of the U.S. \u2014 a point that was tested and confirmed this week by the folks at ChinaTalk. Huawei will do good business supplying Chinese companies while China\u2019s overall AI development falls further and further behind.\nIf you see AI as a fight between the U.S. and China (as most of the U.S. government does), then this is a win \u2014 but it leaves Nvidia in a surprisingly vulnerable place. Without continual improvements, it will be hard to sustain the current AI hype, which will make it hard to sustain the intense demand for Nvidia\u2019s products. The history of AI research is full of these lulls \u2014 known among researchers as \u201cAI winters.\u201d It\u2019s easy to imagine another winter coming soon if OpenAI and others don\u2019t live up to their initial promise.\u00a0\nThat winter is the biggest threat to Nvidia\u2019s fortunes over the next few years \u2014 and it\u2019s a threat that AI researchers all over the world are fighting together.\n\n\n \n\n\n Russell Brandom was the U.S. tech editor at Rest of World.

As the best-performing S&P 500 stock, NVDA, alongside other tech giants, propelled the market index to new multi-month highs.\u00a0\nDespite a slight pullback from its peak valuation, speculation abounds on whether Nvidia can sustain its momentum.

Source: CoinCodex\nWithin a month, that decline is projected to extend down to $404.79, while the platform\u2019s 1-year forecast indicates an even more bearish outlook, forecasting a 17% nosedive to $388.66.\u00a0\nNVDA technical analysis\nFollowing the market opening on December 6, Nvidia\u2019s stock was sitting at $466.67, up around 0.3% at the time of writing.\u00a0\nAt the current price level, NVDA is located slightly above the 100-day moving average (MA), which acts as the stock\u2019s support. Declining below this threshold could send the stock toward the next major support lines at $416 and $399.\u00a0\nNVDA technical analysis chart.

Many companies are sprinting to harness its ability to ingest text, voice and video to churn out new content that can revolutionize productivity, innovation and creativity.\nEnterprises are riding the trend. Deep learning algorithms like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, further trained with corporate data, could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually across 63 business use cases, according to McKinsey & Company.\nYet managing massive amounts of internal data often has been cited as the biggest obstacle to scaling AI. Some NVIDIA experts in AI predict that 2024 will be all about phoning a friend \u2014 creating partnerships and collaborations with cloud service providers, data storage and analytical companies, and others with the know-how to handle, fine-tune and deploy big data efficiently.\nLarge language models are at the center of it all. NVIDIA experts say advancements in LLM research will increasingly be applied in business and enterprise applications. AI capabilities like RAG, autonomous intelligent agents and multimodal interactions will become more accessible and more easily deployed via virtually any platform.\nHear from NVIDIA experts on what to expect in the year ahead:\n\nMANUVIR DAS\nVice President of Enterprise Computing\nOne size doesn\u2019t fit all: Customization is coming to enterprises. Companies won\u2019t have one or two generative AI applications \u2014 many will have hundreds of customized applications using proprietary data that is suited to various parts of their business.\nOnce running in production, these custom LLMs will feature RAG capabilities to connect data sources to generative AI models for more accurate, informed responses. Leading companies like Amdocs, Dropbox, Genentech, SAP, ServiceNow and Snowflake are already building new generative AI services built using RAG and LLMs.\nOpen-source software leads the charge: Thanks to open-source pretrained models, generative AI applications that solve specific domain challenges will become part of businesses\u2019 operational strategies.\nOnce companies combine these headstart models with private or real-time data, they can begin to see accelerated productivity and cost benefits across the organization. AI computing and software are set to become more accessible on virtually any platform, from cloud-based computing and AI model foundry services to the data center, edge and desktop.\nOff-the-shelf AI and microservices: Generative AI has spurred the adoption of application programming interface (API) endpoints, which make it easier for developers to build complex applications.\nIn 2024, software development kits and APIs will level up as developers customize off-the-shelf AI models using AI microservices such as RAG as a service. This will help enterprises harness the full potential of AI-driven productivity with intelligent assistants and summarization tools that can access up-to-date business information.\nDevelopers will be able to embed these API endpoints directly into their applications without having to worry about maintaining the necessary infrastructure to support the models and frameworks. End users can in turn experience more intuitive, responsive and tailored applications that adapt to their needs.\n\nIAN BUCK\nVice President of Hyperscale and HPC\nNational treasure: AI is set to become the new space race, with every country looking to create its own center of excellence for driving significant advances in research and science and improving GDP.\nWith just a few hundred nodes of accelerated computing, countries will be able to quickly build highly efficient, massively performant, exascale AI supercomputers. Government-funded generative AI centers of excellence will boost countries\u2019 economic growth by creating new jobs and building stronger university programs to create the next generation of scientists, researchers and engineers.\nQuantum leaps and bounds: Enterprise leaders will launch quantum computing research initiatives based on two key drivers: the ability to use traditional AI supercomputers to simulate quantum processors and the availability of an open, unified development platform for hybrid-classical quantum computing. This enables developers to use standard programming languages instead of needing custom, specialized knowledge to build quantum algorithms.\nOnce considered an obscure niche in computer science, quantum computing exploration will become more mainstream as enterprises join academia and national labs in pursuing rapid advances in materials science, pharmaceutical research, subatomic physics and logistics.\n\nKARI BRISKI\nVice President of AI Software\nFrom RAG to riches: Expect to hear a lot more about retrieval-augmented generation as enterprises embrace these AI frameworks in 2024.\nAs companies train LLMs to build generative AI applications and services, RAG is widely seen as an answer to the inaccuracies or nonsensical replies that sometimes occur when the models don\u2019t have access to enough accurate, relevant information for a given use case.\nUsing semantic retrieval, enterprises will take open-source foundation models, ingest their own data so that a user query can retrieve the relevant data from the index and then pass it to the model at run time.\nThe upshot is that enterprises can use fewer resources to achieve more accurate generative AI applications in sectors such as healthcare, finance, retail and manufacturing. End users should expect to see more sophisticated, context-sensitive and multimodal chatbots and personalized content recommendation systems that allow them to talk to their data naturally and intuitively.\nMultimodality makes its mark: Text-based generative AI is set to become a thing of the past. Even as generative AI remains in its infancy, expect to see many industries embrace multimodal LLMs that allow consumers to use a combination of text, speech and images to deliver more contextually relevant responses to a query about tables, charts or schematics.\nCompanies such as Meta and OpenAI will look to push the boundaries of multimodal generative AI by adding greater support for the senses, which will lead to advancements in the physical sciences, biological sciences and society at large. Enterprises will be able to understand their data not just in text format but also in PDFs, graphs, charts, slides and more.\n\nNIKKI POPE\nHead of AI and Legal Ethics\nTarget lock on AI safety: Collaboration among leading AI organizations will accelerate the research and development of robust, safe AI systems. Expect to see emerging standardized safety protocols and best practices that will be adopted across industries, ensuring a consistent and high level of safety across generative AI models.\nCompanies will heighten their focus on transparency and interpretability in AI systems \u2014 and use new tools and methodologies to shed light on the decision-making processes of complex AI models. As the generative AI ecosystem rallies around safety, anticipate AI technologies becoming more reliable, trustworthy and aligned with human values.\n\nRICHARD KERRIS\nVice President of Developer Relations, Head of Media and Entertainment\nThe democratization of development: Virtually anyone, anywhere will soon be set to become a developer. Traditionally, one had to know and be proficient at using a specific development language to develop applications or services. As computing infrastructure becomes increasingly trained on the languages of software development, anyone will be able to prompt the machine to create applications, services, device support and more.\nWhile companies will continue to hire developers to build and train AI models and other professional applications, expect to see significantly broader opportunities for anyone with the right skill set to build custom products and services. They\u2019ll be helped by text inputs or voice prompts, making interactions with computers as simple as verbally instructing it.\n\u201cNow and Then\u201d in film and song: Just as the \u201cnew\u201d AI-augmented song by the Fab Four spurred a fresh round of Beatlemania, the dawn of the first feature-length generative AI movie will send shockwaves through the film industry.\nTake a filmmaker who shoots using a 35mm film camera. The same content can soon be transformed into a 70mm production using generative AI, reducing the significant costs involved in film production in the IMAX format and allowing a broader set of directors to participate.\nCreators will transform beautiful images and videos into new types and forms of entertainment by prompting a computer with text, images or videos. Some professionals worry their craft will be replaced, but those issues will fade as generative AI gets better at being trained on specific tasks. This, in turn, will free up hands to tackle other tasks and provide new tools with artist-friendly interfaces.\n\nKIMBERLY POWELL\nVice President of Healthcare\u00a0\nAI surgical assistants: The day has come when surgeons can use voice to augment what they see and understand inside and outside the surgical suite.\nCombining instruments, imaging, robotics and real-time patient data with AI will lead to better surgeon training, more personalization during surgery and better safety with real-time feedback and guidance even during remote surgery. This will help close the gap on the 150 million surgeries that are needed yet do not occur, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.\nGenerative AI drug discovery factories: A new drug discovery process is emerging, where generative AI molecule generation, property prediction and complex modeling will drive an intelligent lab-in-the-loop flywheel, shortening the time to discover and improving the quality of clinically viable drug candidates.\nThese AI drug discovery factories employ massive healthcare datasets using whole genomes, atomic-resolution instruments and robotic lab automation capable of running 24/7. For the first time, computers can learn patterns and relationships within enormous and complex datasets and generate, predict and model complex biological relationships that were only previously discoverable through time-consuming experimental observation and human synthesis.\n\nCHARLIE BOYLE\nVice President of DGX Platforms\nEnterprises lift bespoke LLMs into the cloud: One thing enterprises learned from 2023 is that building LLMs from scratch isn\u2019t easy. Companies taking this route are often daunted by the need to invest in new infrastructure and technology and they experience difficulty in figuring out how and when to prioritize other company initiatives.\nCloud service providers, colocation providers and other businesses that handle and process data for other businesses will help enterprises with full-stack AI supercomputing and software. This will make customizing pretrained models and deploying them easier for companies across industries.\nFishing for LLM gold in enterprise data lakes: There\u2019s no shortage of statistics on how much information the average enterprise stores \u2014 it can be anywhere in the high hundreds of petabytes for large corporations. Yet many companies report that they\u2019re mining less than half that information for actionable insights.\nIn 2024, businesses will begin using generative AI to make use of that untamed data by putting it to work building and customizing LLMs. With AI-powered supercomputing, business will begin mining their unstructured data \u2014 including chats, videos and code \u2014 to expand their generative AI development into training multimodal models. This leap beyond the ability to mine tables and other structured data will let companies deliver more specific answers to questions and find new opportunities. That includes helping detect anomalies on health scans, uncovering emerging trends in retail and making business operations safer.\n\nAZITA MARTIN\nVice President of Retail, Consumer-Packaged Goods and Quick-Service Restaurants\u00a0\nGenerative AI shopping advisors: Retailers grapple with the dual demands of connecting customers to the products they desire while delivering elevated, human-like, omnichannel shopping experiences that align with their individual needs and preferences.\nTo meet these goals, retailers are gearing up to introduce cutting-edge, generative AI-powered shopping advisors, which will undergo meticulous training on the retailers\u2019 distinct brand, products and customer data to ensure a brand-appropriate, guided, personalized shopping journey that mimics the nuanced expertise of a human assistant. This innovative approach will help set brands apart and increase customer loyalty by providing personalized help.\nSetting up for safety: Retailers across the globe are facing a mounting challenge as organized retail crime grows increasingly sophisticated and coordinated. The National Retail Federation reported that retailers are experiencing a staggering 26.5% surge in such incidents since the post-pandemic uptick in retail theft.\nTo enhance the safety and security of in-store experiences for both customers and employees, retailers will begin using computer vision and physical security information management software to collect and correlate events from disparate security systems. This will enable AI to detect weapons and unusual behavior like the large-scale grabbing of items from shelves. It will also help retailers proactively thwart criminal activities and maintain a safer shopping environment.\n\nREV LEBAREDIAN\nVice President of Omniverse and Simulation Technology\nIndustrial digitalization meets generative AI: The fusion of industrial digitalization with generative AI is poised to catalyze industrial transformation.Generative AI will make it easier to turn aspects of the physical world \u2014 such as geometry, light, physics, matter and behavior \u2014 into digital data. Democratizing the digitalization of the physical world will accelerate industrial enterprises, enabling them to design, optimize, manufacture and sell products more efficiently. It also enables them to more easily create virtual training grounds and synthetic data to train a new generation of AIs that will interact and operate within the physical world, such as autonomous robots and self-driving cars.\n3D interoperability takes off: From the drawing board to the factory floor, data for the first time will be interoperable.\nThe world\u2019s most influential software and practitioner companies from the manufacturing, product design, retail, e-commerce and robotics industries are committing to the newly established Alliance for OpenUSD. OpenUSD, the universal language between 3D tools and data, will break down data siloes, enabling industrial enterprises to collaborate across data lakes, tool systems and specialized teams easier and faster than ever to accelerate the digitalization of previously cumbersome, manual industrial processes.\n\nXINZHOU WU\nVice President of Automotive\nModernizing the vehicle production lifecycle: The automotive industry will further embrace generative AI to deliver physically accurate, photorealistic renderings that show exactly how a vehicle will look inside and out \u2014 while speeding design reviews, saving costs and improving efficiencies.\nMore automakers will embrace this technology within their smart factories, connecting design and engineering tools to build digital twins of production facilities. This will reduce costs and streamline operations without the need to shut down factory lines.\nGenerative AI will make consumer research and purchasing more interactive. From car configurators and 3D visualizations to augmented reality demonstrations and virtual test drives, consumers will be able to have a more engaging and enjoyable shopping experience.\nSafety is no accident: Beyond the automotive product lifecycle, generative AI will also enable breakthroughs in autonomous vehicle (AV) development, including turning recorded sensor data into fully interactive 3D simulations. These digital twin environments, as well as synthetic data generation, will be used to safely develop, test and validate AVs at scale virtually before they\u2019re deployed in the real world.\nGenerative AI foundational models will also support a vehicle\u2019s AI systems to enable new personalized user experiences, capabilities and safety features inside and outside the car.\nThe behind-the-wheel experience is set to become safer, smarter and more enjoyable.\n\nBOB PETTE\nVice President of Enterprise Platforms\nBuilding anew with generative AI: Generative AI will allow organizations to design cars by simply speaking to a large language model or create cities from scratch using new techniques and design principles.\nThe architecture, engineering, construction and operations (AECO) industry is building the future using generative AI as its guidepost. Hundreds of generative AI startups and customers in AECO and manufacturing will focus on creating solutions for virtually any use case, including design optimization, market intelligence, construction management and physics prediction. AI will accelerate a manufacturing evolution that promises increased efficiency, reduced waste and entirely new approaches to production and sustainability.\nDevelopers and enterprises are focusing in particular on point cloud data analysis, which uses lidar to generate representations of built and natural environments with precise details. This could lead to high-fidelity insights and analysis through generative AI-accelerated workflows.\n\nGILAD SHAINER\nVice President of Networking\u00a0\nAI influx ignites connectivity demand: A renewed focus on networking efficiency and performance will take off as enterprises seek the necessary network bandwidth for accelerated computing using GPUs and GPU-based systems.\nTrillion-parameter LLMs will expose the need for faster transmission speeds and higher coverage. Enterprises that want to quickly roll out generative AI applications will need to invest in accelerated networking technology or choose a cloud service provider that does. The key to optimal connectivity is baking it into full-stack systems coupled with next-generation hardware and software.\nThe defining element of data center design: Enterprises will learn that not all data centers need to be alike. Determining the purpose of a data center is the first step toward choosing the appropriate networking to use within it. Traditional data centers are limited in terms of bandwidth, while those capable of running large AI workloads require thousands of GPUs to work at very deterministic, low-tail latency.\nWhat the network is capable of when under a full load at scale is the best determinant of performance. The future of enterprise data center connectivity requires separate management (aka north-south) and AI (aka east-west) networks, where the AI network includes in-network computing specifically designed for high performance computing, AI and hyperscale cloud infrastructures.\n\nDAVID REBER JR.\nChief Security Officer\nClarity in adapting the security model to AI: The pivot from app-centric to data-centric security is in full swing. Data is the fundamental supply chain for LLMs and the future of generative AI. Enterprises are just now seeing the problem unfold at scale. Companies will need to reevaluate people, processes and technologies to redefine the secure development lifecycle (SDLC). The industry at large will redefine its approach to trust and clarify what transparency means.\nA new generation of cyber tools will be born. The SDLC of AI will be defined with new market leaders of tools and expectations to address the transition from the command line interface to the human language interface. The need will be especially important as more enterprises shift toward using open-source LLMs like Meta\u2019s Llama 2 to accelerate generative AI output.\nScaling security with AI: Applications of AI to the cybersecurity deficit will detect never-before-seen threats. Currently, a fraction of global data is used for cyber defense. Meanwhile, attackers continue to take advantage of every misconfiguration.\nExperimentation will help enterprises realize the potential of AI in identifying emergent threats and risks. Cyber copilots will help enterprise users navigate phishing and configuration. For the technology to be effective, companies will need to tackle privacy issues inherent in the intersection of work and personal life to enable collective defense in data-centric environments.\nAlong with democratizing access to technology, AI will also enable a new generation of cyber defenders as threats continue to grow. As soon as companies gain clarity on each threat, AI will be used to generate massive amounts of data that train downstream detectors to defend and detect these threats.\n\nRONNIE VASISHTA\nSenior Vice President of Telecoms\nRunning to or from RAN: Expect to see a major reassessment of investment cases for 5G.\nAfter five years of 5G, network coverage and capacity have boomed \u2014 but revenue growth is sluggish and costs for largely proprietary and inflexible infrastructure have risen. Meantime, utilization for 5G RAN is stuck below 40%.\nThe new year will be about aggressively pursuing new revenue sources on existing spectrum to uncover new monetizable applications. Telecoms also will rethink the capex structure, focusing more on a flexible, high-utilization infrastructure built on general-purpose components. And expect to see a holistic reduction of operating expenses as companies leverage AI tools to increase performance, improve efficiency and eliminate costs. The outcome of these initiatives will determine how much carriers will invest in 6G technology.\nFrom chatbots to network management: Telcos are already using generative AI for chatbots and virtual assistants to improve customer service and support. In the new year they\u2019ll double down, ramping up their use of generative AI for operational improvements in areas such as network planning and optimization, fault and fraud detection, predictive analytics and maintenance, cybersecurity operations and energy optimization.\nGiven how pervasive and strategic generative AI is becoming, building a new type of AI factory infrastructure to support its growth also will become a key imperative. More and more telcos will build AI factories for internal use, as well as deploy these factories as a platform as a service for developers. That same infrastructure will be able to support RAN as an additional tenant.\n\nMALCOLM DEMAYO\nVice President of Financial Services\u00a0\nAI-first financial services: With AI advancements growing exponentially, financial services firms will bring the compute power to the data, rather than the other way around.\nFirms will undergo a strategic shift toward a highly scalable, hybrid combination of on-premises infrastructure and cloud-based computing, driven by the need to mitigate concentration risk and maintain agility amid rapid technological advancements. Firms that handle their most mission-critical workloads, including AI-powered customer service assistants, fraud detection, risk management and more, will lead.\n\nMARC SPIELER\nSenior Director of Energy\nPhysics-ML for faster simulation: Energy companies will increasingly turn to physics-informed machine learning (physics-ML) to accelerate simulations, optimize industrial processes and enhance decision-making.\nPhysics-ML integrates traditional physics-based models with advanced machine learning algorithms, offering a powerful tool for the rapid, accurate simulation of complex physical phenomena. For instance, in energy exploration and production, physics-ML can quickly model subsurface geologies to aid in identification of potential exploration sites and assessment of operational and environmental risks.\nIn renewable energy sectors, such as wind and solar, physics-ML will play a crucial role in predictive maintenance, enabling energy companies to foresee equipment failures and schedule maintenance proactively to reduce downtimes and costs. As computational power and data availability continue to grow, physics-ML is poised to transform how energy companies approach simulation and modeling tasks, leading to more efficient and sustainable energy production.\nLLMs \u2014 the fix for better operational outcomes: Coupled with physics-ML, LLMs will analyze extensive historical data and real-time sensor inputs from energy equipment to predict potential failures and maintenance needs before they occur. This proactive approach will reduce unexpected downtime and extend the lifespan of turbines, generators, solar panels and other critical infrastructure. LLMs will also help optimize maintenance schedules and resource allocation, ensuring that repairs and inspections are efficiently carried out. Ultimately, LLM use in predictive maintenance will save costs for energy companies and contribute to a more stable energy supply for consumers.\n\nDEEPU TALLA\nVice President of Embedded and Edge Computing\nThe rise of robotics programmers: LLMs will lead to rapid improvements for robotics engineers. Generative AI will develop code for robots and create new simulations to test and train them.\nLLMs will accelerate simulation development by automatically building 3D scenes, constructing environments and generating assets from inputs. The resulting simulation assets will be critical for workflows like synthetic data generation, robot skills training and robotics application testing.\nIn addition to helping robotics engineers, transformer AI models, the engines behind LLMs, will make robots themselves smarter so that they better understand complex environments and more effectively execute a breadth of skills within them.\nFor the robotics industry to scale, robots have to become more generalizable \u2014 that is, they need to acquire skills more quickly or bring them to new environments. Generative AI models \u2014 trained and tested in simulation \u2014 will be a key enabler in the drive toward more powerful, flexible and easier-to-use robots.\nExplore generative AI sessions and experiences at NVIDIA GTC, the global conference on AI and accelerated computing, running March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., and online.\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Data Center | Deep Learning | Driving | Generative AI | Networking | Pro Graphics | Research | Robotics | Software | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | Cloud Services | Digital Twin | Embedded Computing | Energy | Financial Services | Healthcare and Life Sciences | High-Performance Computing | Media and Entertainment | Retail | Supercomputing | Synthetic Data Generation | Telecommunications | Trustworthy AI \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

To skip the detailed analysis of the semiconductor industry, go directly to the 5 Best Semiconductor Stocks According to Billionaires. The semiconductor industry is arguably one of the most important segments of the market. It is the backbone of our modern digital era. Our society\u2019s dependence on electronic devices and interconnected systems increases day by day, and due to that, the importance of the semiconductor industry becomes more and more definite. The semiconductor industry is directly or indirectly connected to all the sectors of the market.  Over the last few years, the importance and demand of semiconductors have become ever more pronounced. Initially, it started from an increased interest in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. As that trend started to fade away, the generative AI trend led to another boom in the industry. The computational needs for such technologies paved the way for some of the best semiconductor stocks, like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), to create ample opportunities for investors. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s market cap was somewhere around $400 billion in December 2022 and jumped to $1 trillion by the second quarter of 2023. At the time of writing on December 8, the company had a market cap of $1.17 trillion. Furthermore, its stock has gained over 230% year-to-date (YTD) Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the company that makes all of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s chips. While the company\u2019s third-quarter revenues fell year-over-year (YoY), its stock price is up nearly 35% YTD at the time of writing on December 8. However, its stock price gain is not solely dependent on the AI boom but also on better-than-expected sales due to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s iPhone 15 launch. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the primary chip supplier of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has also made some noise in the AI segment as it unveiled its latest AI accelerator, Instinct MI300X, on December 6. The company also raised its AI Accelerator total addressable market to $400 billion from the prior $150 billion. At the Barclays\u2019 Global Technology Conference, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\u2019s CFO Jean Hu said: \u201cIt's actually a very important milestone and inflection point for AMD to be a strong player in AI compute space. We all know the opportunities are tremendous, and we are really pleased we get to the point we can be very competitive in this marketplace. There are so many announcements yesterday. So, what I'll do today is just highlight some of the key things we announced yesterday. You can absolutely listen to the webcast and it's super exciting. First and foremost is, we formally launched MI300A and MI300X and highlighted the performance advantage we have, especially when you think about the inference, MI300X has the industry-leading memory bandwidth and capacity. So, it provide better TCOs for customers. You can either run more models or you can use less GPUs. So, it's a great product, very competitive. And as we said during our last earnings call, MI300 will be the fastest revenue, $2 billion in our history. And we are very confident about the $2 billion-plus revenue number we talk about for 2024.\u201d    Story Continues Talent Shortage Concerns in the IndustryA report by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) states that the semiconductor industry\u2019s workforce will increase from 345,000 in July 2023 to 460,000 jobs by 2030, representing a 33.33% growth. While the availability of jobs is something that should be considered good news, the SIA predicts that 58% of projected new jobs are at risk of being unfilled, considering the current degree completion rates. Additionally, while AI is just one growth catalyst of the industry that we mentioned, McKinsey believes that due to autonomous and e-mobility technologies, the semiconductor demand in the automotive sector could triple by 2030. These factors can lead to labor and supply shortages in the future.While the SIA predicts this labor shortage at the end of the decade, recent events have shown that the industry is already lacking skilled labor. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)\u2019s Arizona plant has been delayed till 2025 due to labor shortages. Furthermore, the company\u2019s plan to build a facility in Germany is also facing the problem of insufficient skilled labor.Semiconductor Industry OutlookA December report by the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics organization predicts that the annual global semiconductor sales will decline by 9.4% YoY in 2023 yet increase by over 13% in 2024 to $588.4 billion. The previously mentioned McKinsey report believes that it will become a trillion-dollar industry by 2030, growing at the rate of 6%-8%.We previously reported that the global semiconductor market was valued at $664.2 billion in 2023 and will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 12.28% through 2032, reaching $1.88 trillion.Going by the forecasts, it is evident that there is no stopping the semiconductor industry's growth. Billionaires are also buying into the industry. Some of the best semiconductor stocks, according to billionaires, include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX). One of the most famous hedge fund billionaires, Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Capital, kept NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as his 13F portfolio\u2019s top stock pick in the third quarter of 2023 and said:\"If it's as big as I think it is, Nvidia is something we are going to want to own for at least two or three years [...] I do believe, unlike crypto, AI is real \u2026 it could be as transformative as the internet.\" If you aren\u2019t sure about which semiconductor stocks you should invest in, here are the 10 Best Semiconductor ETFs.

You need a plan.\n\nWhether it's just a Santa Claus rally, a sigh of relief from falling inflation, or a sign that investors are not particularly concerned about a recession, the stock market indices are knocking on the door of record highs.\nThis is great for stock portfolios but makes it much more difficult to find solid bargains. For instance, Microsoft\u00a0trades near its all-time high, and its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36 hasn't been seen since the tech bubble of 2021. It isn't alone.\nWith CDs and bonds offering 5% yields, some investors are sitting more on cash or trimming their stock holdings as the market becomes increasingly expensive. This could be a smart move. Stock market pullbacks are tricky to time (or else we would all be rich, right?), but they will inevitably come.\nWhen they do, it's good to have a wish list of terrific companies to buy. Here is mine.\n\nThe AI enabler\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) market is exploding. Companies are dedicating significant funding to generative AI (things like chatbots), speech recognition, robotic process automation, and more. Nvidia's (NVDA -2.53%) powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) and other hardware and software make this possible. Its most significant problem in 2023 wasn't marketing but rather making enough products to keep up with booming demand.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a visual that really brings Nvidia's dominance to light:\n\n\n\nOEM = original equipment manufacturer.\nAs you can see on the top left, data center revenue exploded last quarter to $14.5 billion on an unbelievable 279% growth. The other huge takeaway is in the top-right corner: $9.2 billion in net income -- a 50% margin. Nvidia's margins are a Business 101 lesson on supply and demand. Demand is so high that Nvidia has incredible pricing power and, hence, industry-leading margins.\nNone of this is a secret, so the stock is up more than 230% in 2023, and the forward P/E ratio is nearly 40. Nvidia is poised for many years of success, but much of this is priced in. However, if the market pulls back and drags Nvidia stock down with it, I'll be first in line to pick up shares.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA cybersecurity leader\nI've been bullish on cybersecurity lately because it's indispensable. Rain or shine, recession or shine, companies cannot afford not to spend for top-notch cybersecurity. Palo Alto Networks (PANW -0.97%) is a leader in network, cloud, and endpoint security, and its stock is up over 110% year to date (YTD). Total sales rose 25% in fiscal 2023, reaching $6.9 billion, and another 20% in Q1 fiscal 2024.\nPalo Alto's cloud-based next-gen security platform is driving growth. This platform's annual recurring revenue (ARR) reached $3.2 billion last quarter on 53% year-over-year (YOY) growth. Another 34% increase is forecast for this fiscal year. The terrific performance hasn't gone unnoticed. The stock trades near its highest price-to-sales (P/S) ratio since 2016, as shown below.\n\nPANW PS Ratio data by YCharts. PS Ratio = price-to-sales ratio.\nPalo Alto is a much stronger company now, so it deserves a higher multiple. However, the price is still high. A market dive would be an excellent time to consider this stock.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe future of surgery\nSurgeons worldwide use robotic-assisted, minimally invasive surgical systems to produce better patient outcomes. The Mayo Clinic confirms that these procedures cause fewer complications, less discomfort, less time in the hospital, and less scarring for patients.\u00a0The global system of choice is the da Vinci Surgical Systems made by Intuitive Surgical (ISRG -1.29%).\nMore than 13 million procedures have been performed with da Vinci, including 1.8 million in 2022. Procedures have grown 15%, compounded annually, since 2019. The number of procedures is the key to Intuitive's success because more than 75% of its revenue is recurring from instruments, accessories, and services.\n\nIt's a classic \"razor-and-blades\" model. The razor seller doesn't make much money on the razor, but it makes hay selling the replacement blades repeatedly. This is the key to Intuitive's long-term success as the market becomes saturated with its machines.\nIntuitive has terrific financials. It produced $5.2 billion in sales through Q3 and $1.3 billion in operating income, a strong 25% margin. The company's balance sheet is a fortress: $7.5 billion in cash and investments and zero long-term debt.\u00a0Intuitive trades in the range of its highs from the tech bubble in 2021, with a 79 P/E ratio, shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nISRG data by YCharts. PE Ratio = price-to-earnings ratio.\nJust like Palo Alto and Nvidia, it's a great company but expensive stock. Intuitive should definitely be on an investor's wish list if the market hits a rough patch.\nMarket downturns often appear when we least expect and can recover quickly, as the market did after the March 2020 COVID-19 crash. Sell-offs are opportunities for investors, and you don't want to be caught flatfooted when it happens. That's why having a shopping list in advance is vital.\n\n\n\nBradley Guichard has positions in Intuitive Surgical, Nvidia, and Palo Alto Networks and has the following options: long September 2024 $630 calls on Nvidia.

Semiconductor stalwart\u00a0NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is 0.7% higher to trade at $498.56 at last check, on track to finish the calendar year with a four-day win streak and an over 240% return. How did it all go down?\nAmongst the tech disruptors labeled the 'Magnificent Seven,'\u00a0NVDA outpaced them all in 2023, joining the hyper-exclusive club trillion. The Nasdaq-100 (NDX), for all its outperformance, only mustered a 55.6% return for the year.\n\nApproximately 364 days ago on Dec. 30, 2022, closed at $146.14. The shares logged monthly losses in April, September, and October, but these were contained by their respective 40-, 100-, and 160-day trendlines. The equity hit an all-time high of $505.48 on Nov. 20, and the post-peak pullback once more found support at the 40-day moving average. The elusive $500 area remains resistance above, however, which coincides with the $1 trillion market cap level.\u00a0\n\nAmidst this frenetic climb, any contrarian potential has been snuffed out. There's not a single \"sell\" rating to be found amongst the brokerage bunch, and a slim 1.1% of the stock's total available float is sold short.\u00a0\nPremium, however, is still affordably priced, per the stock's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 31% -- in the lowest annual percentile, meaning short-term options are pricing in lower-than-usual volatility expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow @Schaeffers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhich of These SUB-$5 Stocks Could 26x From Here?\u00a0(AD)\nHe called a rare 11x on Tesla\u2026\nThen he called a 26x on Workhorse\u2026\nThen an even rarer 35x on Nio Inc\u2026\nNow Tim Bohen says these 5 tiny \u201cAmerica First\u201d stocks are next up in 2025.\nThey\u2019re trading for less than $5 right now.\nBut thanks to Elon & Trump\u2019s new alliance\u2026\nThey could be off to the races in Trump\u2019s first 100 days.\nAnd right now for a limited time\u2026\nYou can get the names & tickers for just $1 here.\u00a0(AD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFeatured Articles from Trusted Partners:\n\ud83d\ude80 One Stock Pick Could Change Everything in 2025\nWhat if one stock pick could define your success next year?

Currently, the price of Nvidia is once again rallying towards this significant level.\nThe critical question now is whether Nvidia\u2019s stock price will successfully surpass the crucial Fibonacci (Fib) resistance at the $500 mark. This level is pivotal, as a successful breach could signal a strong bullish momentum. On the other hand, there is the possibility of another bearish rejection at this threshold, which could lead to a pullback or consolidation in the stock price.\nIs Nvidia Poised to Break the $493 Fibonacci Resistance?\nIf Nvidia\u2019s stock price successfully overcomes the Fibonacci (Fib) resistance level at approximately $493, it may potentially surpass its previous high of around $505.\nHowever, the technical indicators present a mixed outlook. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram has been trending downwards in a bearish pattern for the past four months, although the MACD lines are still in a bullish crossover. Significantly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is indicating a massive bearish divergence, a signal that was reflected in the stock\u2019s performance four months ago.\n\nSponsored\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored\n\nDuring September and October, Nvidia\u2019s stock experienced a decline of about 21%. It then found support in the range of $403 to $410, leading to a rebound that is bringing the price back towards the Fib resistance at around $493.\nNVIDIA Price Chart. Source: Tradingview\nIf Nvidia manages to break through this resistance level with bullish momentum, the stock could be poised to reach a new all-time high. This is assuming market conditions and company fundamentals remain favorable. This scenario underscores the dynamic nature of stock market movements. This is influenced by a blend of technical indicators and broader market factors.\nNvidia\u2019s Weekly Chart Shows Bearish Divergence in RSI\nIn Nvidia\u2019s weekly chart, there is a mix of bullish and bearish signals. On the bearish side, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) lines are in a bearish crossover, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates a bearish divergence.\nHowever, there are bullish indicators as well. Notably, the MACD histogram has started ticking upward bullishly since last week, and the Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) exhibit a golden crossover. These signals suggest that the medium-term trend for Nvidia remains bullish.\nIf Nvidia faces a bearish rejection at the Fibonacci (Fib) resistance just below the $500 mark and subsequently breaks through the support zone between approximately $403 and $410, it may find its next significant support at the 50-week EMA, around $378.\nNVIDIA Price Chart. Source: Tradingview\nShould the price fall further, the next notable Fib support levels are anticipated to be around $354 and, more substantially, around $255. These levels could be critical junctures for potential rebounds or further price corrections.\n\nSponsored\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored\n\nNvidia Daily Chart Reveals Emerging Bullish Price Pattern\nIn the daily chart for Nvidia, the technical indicators largely signal bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is neutral, suggesting a balanced market condition without strong overbought or oversold signals. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) lines are nearing a bullish crossover. While the MACD histogram is showing an upward trend, both indicative of potential bullish momentum.\n\n\n\nRead More: 9 Best AI Crypto Trading Bots to Maximize Your Profits \n\n\n\nAdditionally, the golden crossover of the Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) further confirms a bullish trend in the short to medium term. This crossover occurs when a shorter-term EMA (like the 50-day EMA) crosses above a longer-term EMA (such as the 200-day EMA). This is often interpreted as a bullish signal.\nAn interesting development in the daily chart is the emergence of a bullish price pattern. More specifically, it is an \u201cinverse head and shoulders\u201d pattern. This pattern is typically seen as a bullish reversal indicator. If Nvidia\u2019s stock price rises above $540, it could confirm a bullish breakout from this pattern. This could potentially lead to further upward price movement. \nNVIDIA Price Chart. Source: Tradingview\nThe inverse head and shoulders pattern, combined with the other bullish indicators, suggests a favorable outlook for Nvidia in the short to medium term. However, this depends on the stock\u2019s ability to breach the key price level of $540.\n\nSponsored\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored\n\nNvidia\u2019s 4H Chart Analysis: Indicators Point to Bullish Trend\nIn the 4-hour (4H) chart for Nvidia, the trend is predominantly bullish, as evidenced by several key indicators. The golden crossover of the Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) is a significant bullish signal. This crossover occurs when a shorter-term EMA (like the 50-period EMA) crosses above a longer-term EMA (such as the 200-period EMA), suggesting upward momentum.\nAdditionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram is trending upwards. Further indicating increasing bullish momentum, and the MACD lines are in a bullish crossover, reinforcing this positive trend.\n\n\n\nRead More:\u00a0 Top 9 Telegram Channels for Crypto Signals in 2023\n\n\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI), on the other hand, is in neutral territory. This neutrality indicates a balance in the market. But with no strong overbought or oversold conditions, and provides neither distinctly bullish nor bearish signals at this time.\nNVIDIA Price Chart. Source: Tradingview\nOverall, combining a bullish MACD and a golden crossover in the EMAs, along with a neutral RSI, presents a generally bullish outlook in the 4H chart for Nvidia, suggesting a favorable short-term trend.\n\nSponsored\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored\n\nRising Correlation Observed Between Bitcoin and Nvidia\nCurrently, the correlation between Bitcoin and Nvidia stock prices is moderate but has seen a notable increase in recent weeks. Currently standing at approximately 0.47. This positive correlation coefficient indicates that the price movements of Bitcoin and Nvidia have been somewhat aligned. Both have been moving in a similar direction to a moderate extent.\nIt\u2019s important to note that a correlation coefficient of 0.47, while significant, does not imply a very strong relationship. It suggests that while there is some level of synchronization in their price movements. However, they are not heavily dependent on each other.\n\nSponsored\n\n\nSponsored\n\nNVIDIA Price vs BTC Chart. Source: Tradingview\nHistorically, there have been periods where the correlation between Bitcoin and Nvidia was more pronounced. This stronger correlation in the past could be attributed to various factors, including market sentiment, technological developments, or investment patterns that linked the performance of cryptocurrency markets, particularly Bitcoin, with tech stocks like Nvidia. \nHowever, correlation levels can fluctuate over time due to changing market dynamics, economic conditions, and investor behavior.\n\n\n\nRead More: Best Crypto Sign-Up Bonuses in 2023\n\n\n\n\n\nTop crypto platforms \n\n\n\n\n\nTonTrader\nExplore\n        \n\n\n\n\n\nPhemex\nExplore\n        \n\n\n\n\n\nMargex\nExplore\n        \n\n\n\n\n\nBingX\nExplore\n        \n\n\n\n\n\nHTX\nExplore\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop crypto platforms \n\n\n\n\n\nTonTrader\nExplore\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhemex\nExplore\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMargex\nExplore\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBingX\nExplore\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTX\nExplore\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop crypto platforms \n\n\n\nTonTrader\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhemex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMargex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBingX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

Share prices of Nvidia have surged 226% in 2023. It now has a market cap of $1.2 trillion, which makes it the sixth-largest company in the world.\nApple (AAPL -0.74%) remains the world's most valuable company with a market cap of nearly $3.1 trillion, but there is a good chance that Nvidia could dethrone the iPhone maker by the end of the decade. Let's see why.\nApple hasn't been able to match Nvidia's growth\nOver the past seven years, Nvidia's market cap has jumped an astonishing 2,300%, which is significantly higher than Apple's growth of just over 400% during the same period.\n\nNVDA market cap data by YCharts.\nIt is easy to see why this has been the case. The market has rewarded Nvidia for the tremendous growth in its revenue and earnings over the years, driven by the growing applications of the company's GPUs in multiple industries ranging from computers to data centers to cars and even factories.\n\n\n\n\n\nApple's growth, on the other hand, has been slower than Nvidia's. Again, that's not surprising as Apple operates in markets that have reached their saturation points.\n\nNVDA revenue (TTM) data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\nFor instance, sales of smartphones were flat in the third quarter of 2023, according to market intelligence firm IDC. Meanwhile, personal computer (PC) shipments are set to drop almost 14% this year. The state of these markets explains why Apple's revenue in fiscal 2023 (which ended on Sept. 30, 2023) fell almost 3% year over year to $383 billion. Its adjusted earnings were almost flat year over year at $6.13 per share.\nApple got two-thirds of its revenue from selling smartphones and personal computing devices such as iPads and MacBooks in the previous fiscal year. Also, there is a lot of competition in these markets thanks to the presence of multiple participants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, Apple is the second-largest smartphone manufacturer, but it has a market share of just under 18%. The company's share of the PC market stands at 10.6%, making it the fourth-largest player in this space.\nSales of both PCs and smartphones aren't expected to increase significantly in the long run. IDC expects the PC market to clock a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of just 3.1% through 2027. Smartphone shipments are expected to have an even slower CAGR of 1.7% over the next four years. Not surprisingly, analysts aren't expecting much of an acceleration in Apple's growth, which is evident from the following chart.\n\nAAPL revenue estimates for current fiscal year; data by YCharts.\nAnd the company's earnings are expected to increase at an annual pace of just 6% over the next five years. That's way slower than the 21% annual earnings growth Apple clocked in the past five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuming it can sustain 6% earnings growth for the next seven years, its bottom line could increase to $9.20 per share in 2030 (using its fiscal 2023 earnings of $6.13 per share as the base).\nIf we multiply the projected 2030 earnings with Apple's five-year average forward earnings multiple of 24, the stock price could jump to $221 by the end of the decade. That would be an increase of just 15%, indicating that its market cap could hit $3.45 trillion in 2030.\n\nNvidia, on the other hand, is expected to clock annual earnings growth of a whopping 112% for the next five years. Let's see why that's the case, and check if that would be enough to help the company overtake Apple's market cap by 2030.\nNvidia is sitting on a massive growth opportunity\nWhile Apple is struggling with saturated and crowded markets, Nvidia is the dominant force in the rapidly growing market for AI chips. It is estimated that the global AI chip market could hit $304 billion in annual revenue in 2030 as compared to $20 billion in 2021. Nvidia controls between 80% and 95% of this market, as per various third-party estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis, however, is not the only massive growth opportunity Nvidia could benefit from over the next seven years. Including cloud gaming, automotive uses, and digital twins, there are multiple lucrative markets that the company could take advantage of. It estimates its total addressable market to be worth $1 trillion spread across multiple end markets.\nThe company is expected to finish its ongoing fiscal year with almost $59 billion in revenue, which would be a jump of 118% over the prior year. So, there is still a lot of room for growth for Nvidia, which explains why analysts consistently raise their estimates.\n\nNVDA revenue estimates for current fiscal year; data by YCharts.\nAssuming Nvidia manages to hit $107 billion in revenue in fiscal 2026, its three-year revenue CAGR would stand at an impressive 58% based on its fiscal 2023 revenue of $27 billion. If the company manages to sustain a relatively conservative long-term revenue growth rate of 25% from fiscal 2027 to fiscal 2031 (which will coincide with calendar 2030), its top line could hit $325 billion by the end of the decade.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has an average five-year price-to-sales ratio of 20. Assuming it trades at a discount 15 times forward sales in 2030, its market cap could jump to almost $4.9 trillion in 2030. As such, there is a chance of Nvidia overtaking Apple's market cap in the long run, and this won't be surprising given how fast the former is anticipated to benefit from multiple growth drivers.\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

These stocks include Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Meta Platforms META, Microsoft MSFT, Nvidia NVDA and Tesla TSLA. These companies are considered the new leaders in the stock market.  There is a pureplay ETF called Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS on this theme. The ETF has surged more than 32% this year. There is another ETF called Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF XLG, which invests about 50% of the basket in Magnificent Seven. That fund is up about 34% this year. Individually, Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft are up more than 50% each, Meta shares are up about 165%, Amazon has gained 70%, Nvidia has skyrocketed about 233% and Tesla is up nearly 118% this year (as of Dec 12, 2023). But there are a few tech ETFs that have beaten even the Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS. These include Inside the Dominance of Magnificent Seven The Magnificent Seven stocks have a significant impact on the Nasdaq index, as they collectively account for a major portion of its total weighting. Despite recent fluctuations in the market, some of the Magnificent Seven Stocks, including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Nvidia, and Meta, continue to exert a substantial impact on the tech-heavy Nasdaq index mainly due to their meaningful positions in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) space. The AI boom made them stars in 2023. What About Other Tech Jewels? Even in the narrow market breadth in 2023, some other tech ETFs that are not solely focused on \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d shined. With the Fed expected to cut rates by 75 bps in 2024, overall tech space should do well as the area thrives better in a low-rate environment. Already, market breadth has continued to broaden, and smaller tech companies are likely to excel. Plus, the AI boom is ongoing, which is expected to push the space to another height next year. ETF Picks Below, we highlight those winning tech ETFs that trumped even Magnificent Seven in 2023.

Here's What It Means for the Stock.\n\n\n  \n      By Alex Carchidi\n  \n  \u2013\n  \n    \n      Dec 19, 2023 at 9:53AM\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is forging collaborations and making investments in biotech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's positioning to facilitate using artificial intelligence for drug discovery. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's a good chance that it's just getting started in these endeavors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$2.9T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(-2.53%)\u00a0-$3.02\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$116.51\n\n\nPrice as of March 18, 2025, 3:18 p.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIts positioning in biotech will likely take a long while to pay off.\n\nNvidia (NVDA -2.53%) is on a shopping spree in the biotech industry. While it has no intention of developing medicines or pharmaceutical technologies for the laboratory, its strategy clearly calls for getting some exposure to the sector, and when it makes a move, others tend to follow.\nBut how could making investments in an area so far outside of its traditional wheelhouse end up supporting shareholder value in the future rather than destroying it? Let's dive in and examine why it's staking out its biotech claims.\n\nA certain kind of biotech is getting all of the attention\nNvidia isn't cutting deals and making investments in just any old biotech. Its quarries are biotechs using artificial intelligence (AI) as part of their drug discovery and development process. In July, the chipmaker made a $50 million equity investment in Recursion Pharmaceuticals, a biotech dedicated to developing medicines more efficiently using its AI platform.\nBut that's just one out of an ever-growing handful of investments it's making in the space. In 2023 alone, it invested in at least six different AI-enabled biotechs in the U.S. and the U.K. It's also pursuing a collaboration in drug development using AI with Genentech, a subsidiary of Roche.\nWhile the sizes of its investments are often not disclosed, one thing's for sure. With more than $18 billion in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments on hand, Nvidia has an abundance of funds available to allocate to potential drivers for its long-term growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first glance, biotech seems like it's an odd fit for Nvidia's traditional business model of developing and selling new chips and computing services. But in the broader context of being in the early days of the ongoing AI revolution, these plays make a lot more sense.\nIt's currently developing a service it calls BioNeMo, which it markets as an AI platform for accelerating drug discovery. Both Recursion Pharmaceuticals and Schrodinger, which are already popular AI-driven drug discovery biotechs in their own right, are paid collaborators contributing to the service's capabilities.\nEventually, BioNeMo could be the go-to tool for biopharmas at the very start of the drug discovery process. And that would open the door to charging them subscription fees or perhaps even a small cut of the royalties from any of the medicines commercialized with the help of the system.\nThese investments will take quite a while to pay off\nNvidia is currently working to develop a suite of services that would make it into an AI foundry of sorts, wherein all types of businesses rely on it to help them build AI systems that are adapted to their specific needs. But today, despite its run of investments in biotech, its revenue from all healthcare sources combined is marginal and well beneath $1 billion annually.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat makes it insignificant in comparison to the $18 billion it brought in during the third quarter of its 2024 fiscal year, the most recent quarter. The segment isn't even mentioned consistently in its earnings materials or investor presentations -- at least for now.\nAt the moment, Nvidia is clearly positioning itself to gain from any breakthroughs or progress made in the field of AI for drug discovery by incorporating elements from the most promising players into its own AI platform via its investments. It can likely realize some value from its committed cash if it can onboard more customers to its drug development platform.\nBut getting new customers will be a lot easier a few years down the line, when the biotechs contributing to its platform today will be approaching the commercialization of the medicines they made with the help of AI, not to mention Nvidia. If regulators grant those biotechs permission to sell their drugs, it'll be possible to do a retrospective analysis regarding the utility that AI provided along the way.\nOnce there are clear examples of success in using AI to make the drug development process faster, more reliable, and cheaper, companies will flock to use its tools for their own benefit, and that could drive some more significant revenue growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nWill Nvidia's revenue from biopharma services ever approach the tens of billions that it makes from its other segments? Probably not. Still, it's very probable that at least a few of the bets it made recently will have huge returns that'll grow the value of the business.\nDiversifying into a new area will also provide a bit of downside protection in case its other segments struggle. And for a headline-driven stock like Nvidia's, it's always beneficial to get another injection of good news to build the hype up even further.\nSo keep your eyes out for news of more biopharma investment activity -- it won't make much of a difference today, but in the long run, it's a bullish driver for Nvidia stock.\n\n\n\nAlex Carchidi has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

It seems that as it approaches its resistance area, it is becoming difficult for NVDA to maintain its upward trajectory.We had a good reaction near the Fibonacci retracements, which, as we warned in our last public study, was our main area of support. Now the price is trying to recover, but there are still some challenges ahead. The link to our previous analysis is below this post, as usual.It's interesting to note that despite losing momentum, the price could still seek out the $487.61 region, a secondary resistance and previous top that can be seen on the hourly chart:At the moment, there is no clear sign of a bearish reversal, but we should remain vigilant as the price is finding it difficult to break through the resistance of its Ascending Channel, as evidenced by the purple lines.A correction down to the 21 EMA is plausible, but if the price loses this support, then we could see NVDA near the support of its channel again.So, in the short term, it's all about the Ascending Channel, and in which direction there will be a breakout, as well as the 21 EMA. In the medium term, we should focus on the Fibonacci retracements, and the resistance at $487.I must admit that I would like to see the price at $487 again, since that point has been a personal target for me since the first buy signal at $469: Ignition Bar + above the support of the ascending channel + breaking a pivot point + breaking the 21 ema on the 1h chart = Clear buy signal (to me, at least). However, depending on how the price reacts today, maybe the bullish thesis will be thwarted.I\u2019ll keep you updated on this, so remember to like this idea, and follow me for more analysis like this.All the best,Nathan,Dec 20, 2023NoteIn the absence of a clear bearish reversal pattern, NVDA shares continue their upward trajectory, as expected, and since our last study, the price has broken through some resistance levels.We see that in the hourly chart above the price has broken through the resistance of the ascending channel, a clear indicator of a healthy uptrend, while the 21 EMA has served as a reliable support point - and still is. What\u2019s more, the previous resistance of its ascending channel is now acting as a support level too, near the 21 EMA, following the Principle of Polarity (previous support levels are supposed to act as future resistance levels and vice-versa).However, although there is still no sign of a top in NVDA, we need to remain vigilant as we have reached a critical point on the daily chart, a strong resistance in the area of the historical high.Any sign of a top here could start a correction in the medium term, and the 21 EMA on the daily chart could become our next support point.Jan 4, 2024NoteThe ATH area acted as a resistance level, as expected, and we now see NVDA back at the $476 line, which is a support line we identified a long time ago, as seen in the previous charts of this analysis.It's important to see the price reacting above this support, but if NVDA loses it in the next few days, we could see a sharper correction to $460, close to the first Fibonacci retracement at 38.2%.Nathan_The_Finance_HydraFollowAlso on:Ascending ChannelcandlestickpatternchartpatterntradingFibonacciFibonacci RetracementignitionbarmtfanalysisNVDASupport and ResistancesupportandresistancezonesTrend AnalysistrendanalysisexplainedRelated publicationsNVDA: A Dangerous Turning Point (D and H charts).by Nathan_The_Finance_HydraDisclaimerThe information and publications are not meant to be, and do not constitute, financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice or recommendations supplied or endorsed by TradingView.

Shares of the semiconductor giant have more than tripled this year, gaining a whopping 238% thanks to an astronomical acceleration in the company's revenue and earnings. Booming demand for its graphics cards is playing a major role in training artificial intelligence (AI) models.\nThe good news is that analysts are anticipating Nvidia stock to head higher in 2024. According to 46 analysts covering the stock, Nvidia has a median 12-month price target of $650. That points toward a 35% jump from current levels. The Street-high price target sits at $1,100, which points toward a 123% jump over the next year.\nLet's find out if Nvidia can outpace the median stock price target and double in 2024 from current levels of around $480.\n\nNvidia is expected to deliver another year of terrific growth in 2024\nNvidia's revenue stands at almost $39 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. Its guidance for $20 billion in revenue in the current quarter means that it will finish the fiscal year (which ends next month) with a top line of $59 billion. That would be a 118% jump over Nvidia's fiscal 2023 revenue.\nConsensus estimates, however, indicate that Nvidia could finish the year with $54 billion in revenue. Analysts are expecting $18.4 billion in revenue from the company in the ongoing quarter, which is well below its guidance. There is a good chance that Nvidia could easily crush Wall Street's expectations given that its AI graphics cards are selling like hotcakes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company reportedly sold half a million units of its popular A100 and H100 data center GPUs (graphics processing units) in the previous quarter, according to Omdia, and it is expected to exceed that mark in the current quarter. So, Nvidia stock could get a nice boost in February next year, when its fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter results are due, by delivering better-than-expected sales growth.\nMore importantly, Nvidia is setting itself up to sustain its impressive growth momentum through 2024 by focusing on expanding its manufacturing capacity and encouraging its foundry partner to produce more chips. For instance, Nvidia is reportedly mulling partnerships with Vietnam and Malaysia to manufacture more chips. At the same time, foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, popularly known as TSMC, is reportedly going to open a new fabrication plant in Japan in February 2024 and plans to add two more fabs.\nMoreover, TSMC is already working on the expansion of its advanced chip packaging capacity in a bid to make more AI chips. Based on this, Tianfeng Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is anticipating a massive jump of 150% in Nvidia's AI graphics card shipments in 2024. The launch of two new AI GPUs in the form of the H200 and the next-generation Blackwell B100 cards, as well as the big backlog of Nvidia's current graphics cards, could play an instrumental role in driving such solid growth in shipments.\nNvidia's data center business has generated $29 billion in revenue in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, accounting for almost three-fourths of its top line. The company's $20 billion revenue estimate for the current quarter indicates that it could generate $15 billion in revenue from this segment in fiscal Q4 and end the year with data center revenue of $44 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuming the 150% jump in shipments of data center GPUs next year translates into an identical jump in revenue, the company could generate a whopping $110 billion in sales from this segment alone. That would be significantly higher than analysts' expectations of $85 billion in revenue from Nvidia in fiscal 2025 (which will coincide with 11 months of calendar 2024).\nWhy Nvidia stock seems set to double in 2024\nWe have seen that Nvidia can outperform Wall Street's growth expectations next year, which could help the stock deliver eye-popping gains once again. According to consensus estimates, Nvidia's earnings could jump 60% in fiscal 2025 to $19.72 per share. That seems like a conservative view as Nvidia is on track to almost quadruple its bottom line in the current fiscal year.\n\nNVDA EPS Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YCharts\nBut even if Nvidia's earnings growth decelerates to a respectable 60% and indeed hits $19.72 per share, its stock price could exceed $1,000 based on the company's forward earnings multiple of 55. So, there is a chance that this AI stock could indeed hit the Street-high price target on the back of further acceleration in the data center business, as well as emerging catalysts in the personal computer business.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs such, investors would do well to continue holding Nvidia stock in their portfolios as there is a possibility that it may double next year.\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

There are few small companies that are pure AI plays, and the large companies like Microsoft and Alphabet that are big players in AI also have enormous non-AI related business. But, there are some almost \u201cpure play\u201d AI companies out there, and this one, Vertiv, doesn\u2019t even have a horse in the AI technology race.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Steven Adams Dec 19, 2023  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular Stories\n\n\u2022 Has the Next Bear Market Already Arrived?\n\u2022 How Low Will Stocks Go?\n\u2022 Why is Stock Market Outlook So Uncertain?\n\u2022 Trump or the Fed More Important to Stock Investors?\n\u2022 Investors in \u201cWait and See\u201d Mode\nView All Top stories\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAs 2023, the year of AI, comes to a close an abundance of questions remain around how companies will profit from the new technology. But, one thing is certain, AI is here to stay, and is growing at an incredibly rapid rate. You need look no further than any NVIDIA (NVDA) earnings report this year for confirmation.\u00a0\nI\u2019ve talked about several companies employing the new AI technology in a variety of ways. But, there are also non-technology centric (at least not AI focused technology) ways to get in on the AI boom, that should have long term legs regardless of how AI is eventually employed. And one backdoor play in the world of AI is Vertiv Holdings (VRT).\nVertiv (VRT) had its beginnings as one of the much maligned, and mostly deserved, SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies) of the late 2019s and early 2020s. The company came public via a merger with a SPAC headed by Dave Cote, former CEO and renowned leader of Honeywell (HON). Cote still serves as Chairman of the Board at Vertiv.\nVertiv, like NVIDIA, could be a stock defined by the phrase, being at the right place at the right time. That\u2019s because Vertiv provides one of the essential elements in the AI equation, just like NVIDIA. While NVIDIA has made a killing off of AI chips, Vertiv is making a killing providing infrastructure for the data centers which house all of those expensive AI chips.\u00a0\nVertiv makes racks, power connectors, power management systems, thermal control and cooling systems, and basically any and all of the products that support the infrastructure in a data center. They have been a huge beneficiary of the data center boom that is being driven by the need to build out massive data centers that can handle the demand for AI driven computing power.\u00a0\nAnd their earnings reflect the rapid ramping up of demand this year. Vertiv recently reported net sales that were 18% higher in the quarter YoY, an 11% rise in orders. They also added a record high backlog of $5.0 billion. And, they\u2019ve handled the influx of orders, which might compress margins for many companies, by increasing operating margins almost 8% to 17% in the quarter.\nVertiv also raised guidance in the recent report, predicting free cash flow of $600 to $650 million for the full year. This is huge for a smaller company not to need to raise additional capital in what is still a relatively high interest rate environment compared to when the company went public in 2019.\nAddressing where we are in the AI lifecycle, CEO Giordano Albertazzi, made it very clear, \u201cWe are still in the early stages, but the industry is gearing up to deploy the data center infrastructure needed to meet the compute capacity that AI is demanding.\u201d\u00a0\nOne of the difficulties in AI investing is that there are few pure AI plays available to investors. And while Vertiv is not a pure AI play, as an AI infrastructure play it\u2019s pretty close. Albertazzi emphasized this in the earnings release, stating, \u201cAs the only pure-play data center infrastructure company able to deliver across the entire spectrum of thermal and power technologies, Vertiv is uniquely positioned to partner with our customers to meet their data center needs for the present and the future.\u201d\nVertiv has an overall B rating in our POWR Ratings. The company outscores 85.55% of the stocks we track. On the two most relevant scores to the Vertiv AI story, the company has a score of 98.99% in the Growth component and a 97.32% rating in the Sentiment component\u2026both right in line with the AI growth story.\nVertiv is a great way to play AI without actually having to pick a winning technology company. There is one thing that everyone agrees with, that the demand for AI is on a steep upward trajectory\u2026and meeting this demand will without a doubt require additional product and services from Vertiv.\nWhat To Do Next?\nGet your hands on this special report with 3 low priced companies with tremendous upside potential even in today\u2019s volatile markets:\n3 Stocks to DOUBLE This Year >\nWant More Great Investing Ideas?3 Stocks to DOUBLE This Year\nVRT shares were trading at $48.69 per share on Tuesday afternoon, up $0.89 (+1.86%).

As a result, the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030, exceeding $1 trillion before the decade's end (per Grand View Research). \nCompanies across tech have pivoted their businesses to the budding industry, creating several attractive ways to invest in the sector. Nvidia (NVDA -2.53%) and Microsoft (MSFT -1.37%) are two attractive options, with both companies holding powerful positions in AI. These companies could see considerable gains from the market in the new year, making their stocks attractive options as 2023 comes to a close.\nSo, let's consider whether Nvidia or Microsoft is the better stock to invest in artificial intelligence for 2024.\nNvidia\nAs a leading chipmaker, Nvidia creates the hardware necessary to train and run AI models. The company is massively profiting from an uptick in demand for graphics processing units (GPUs), which has seen its stock climb 237% this year. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn the third quarter of its fiscal 2024 (which ended October 2023), Nvidia posted revenue growth of 206% year over year and a 1,600% spike in operating income. The immense growth was mainly attributed to a 279% increase in its data center segment, reflecting a significant rise in AI GPU sales.\n\nNvidia has dominated the GPU market for years, while competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have primarily focused on central processing units (CPUs). Consequently, Nvidia was well-positioned to take full advantage of the boom in AI, snapping up an estimated 90% market share in AI chips since the start of 2023, while its peers have yet to catch up. \nSeveral chipmakers have plans to launch new AI GPUs in 2024. However, the market is expanding quickly, with increased competition unlikely to make a significant dent in Nvidia's projected growth.\nMicrosoft\nLike Nvidia, Microsoft was an early investor in AI. The company sunk $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019 and has since increased that investment to achieve a 49% stake in the start-up. The partnership has granted Microsoft exclusive access to some of the most advanced AI technology, which the tech giant has used to introduce AI features across its product lineup.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past year, new AI tools have been added to the company's Azure cloud platform, ChatGPT-like features have been introduced to its Bing search engine, and AI upgrades have been brought to many of its Office productivity services.\nAnd Microsoft has already begun making moves to monetize its venture into AI. In March, Microsoft 365 unveiled Copilot, an AI assistant that members can use for $30 on top of the regular cost of a subscription. The company's command of the productivity and cloud markets gives it massive earnings potential in AI, which will likely see its revenue soar next year and beyond.\n\nIn fiscal 2024's first quarter (ended September 2023), Microsoft posted revenue growth of 13% year over year, beating analysts' expectations by $2 billion. Meanwhile, it hit over $63 billion in free cash flow this year. \nThe company is on a promising growth path, with the funds to continue investing in R&D and expand its role in AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs Nvidia or Microsoft the better AI stock for 2024?\n\nData by YCharts\nNvidia and Microsoft have lucrative positions in artificial intelligence, with one killing it in hardware and the other cornering the market on software tools. They're both compelling investment options for the new year. However, the charts suggest Nvidia could have more to offer stockholders.\nNvidia's earnings could hit $24 per share over the next two fiscal years, while Microsoft's will potentially reach $15 per share. Multiplying these figures by their respective forward price-to-earnings ratios (Nvidia's 40 and Microsoft's 33) yields a stock price of $960 for Nvidia and $495 for Microsoft. \nBased on their current positions, these figures indicate Nvidia's stock could rise 95% over the next two fiscal years, while Microsoft's has the potential to increase by 32%. As a result, Nvidia looks like the better AI stock for 2024 and the following year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDani Cook has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

These two are leading the charge in different areas and represent logical companies to invest in if trying to take advantage of the AI race.\nBut of these two, which is the better buy? Let's find out.\nAlphabet is a much wider AI investment\nFirst, let's discuss how these two tackle different areas of AI.\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are widely used in AI supercomputers because they have created an optimized system for processing data. The demand explosion caused by the generative AI development race created unprecedented demand for its GPUs, causing Nvidia's stock to rise an incredible 234% in 2023. \n\nAlphabet's AI investment case is a bit wider. Its generative AI model, Gemini AI, beats most competitors (including OpenAI's GPT-4) in head-to-head competitions. It also has a cloud computing division, which allows clients to rent out computing power and data storage for many uses, including AI. Lastly, the company recently announced a reorganization in its advertising division to focus on further integrating AI. \n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, Nvidia is a one-trick pony, but its one trick has been incredible. Alphabet is a much wider AI investment, making it a more conservative investment. There's no winner here, as the two represent different ways to invest in AI.\nCall it a tie.\nNvidia is growing at unparalleled speeds\nAs mentioned above, the demand for Nvidia's GPUs has been unbelievable. In the 2024 third quarter (ending Oct. 29), its revenue rose 206% year over year to $18.1 million. It also guided for $20 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, so this wasn't just a single quarter of strength.\nAlphabet's revenue growth was respectable at 11%, but it's not even in the same world as Nvidia. \n\n\n\n\n\nWinner: Nvidia.\nAlphabet's growth is more sustainable\nOne part of the Nvidia investment thesis that's often overlooked is how sustainable these revenue levels are. It isn't a subscription company (for the most part); once it sells its GPUs, its client likely won't need to build another system for a while. This could create a problem in the future, as demand for GPUs might (or might not) disappear.\nShould Nvidia's revenue fall off a cliff, the stock will follow suit, as it's priced like its growth is permanent (even though it's cyclical).\n\nAlphabet's products are mostly subscription-based or must be purchased regularly (like ads). This makes Alphabet's gains much more permanent than Nviida's.\nWinner: Alphabet.\nAlphabet looks like a bargain\nValuing Nvidia on a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) basis can only be done with a caveat. It hasn't lapped its substantial growth yet, so it still has a few quarters that didn't produce the same earnings as its most recent ones.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if Nvidia's sales decline after the sales boom cools, it would give investors an idea of how expensive the stock would be valued.\n\nNVDA PE Ratio data by YCharts.\nUsing either metric, Nvidia is quite expensive. On the other hand, Alphabet's stock is much cheaper.\n\nGOOGL PE ratio data by YCharts.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, on this basis, Alphabet looks like a much better buy.\nWinner: Alphabet.\nNvidia's growth potential is higher\nThe demand for Nvidia's GPUs right now is insatiable, but how long that demand lasts is unknown. It could be two quarters, two years, or two decades. As a result, the company's upside is unknown.\nAlphabet likely won't grow much faster than 15% each year, but it should post revenue growth nearly every quarter.\nSo, depending on your risk tolerance, Nvidia could be a better buy if you want absolute upside, while Alphabet is better for consistent, long-term growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis one is another tie.\nThe verdict\nChoosing a winner here is really a matter of preference. The two stocks represent different investment philosophies. I'm more partial to Alphabet, as I would rather have a slower, more guaranteed upside than Nvidia's boom or bust.\nI'm still concerned with what will happen with Nvidia's stock when the AI supercomputer demand is satisfied, and that is enough to keep me from investing in it (which could be a huge mistake on my part).\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

However, finding individual stocks that could turn $10,000 into a million dollars in the long run isn't an easy task. A stock will have to jump 100-fold to achieve this feat. In other words, the stock you picked will have to clock a compound annual growth rate of 20% for 25 consecutive years to appreciate this much. That's tough.\nHowever, let me highlight one stock that has achieved this milestone in an even shorter period -- Nvidia (NVDA -2.53%). A $10,000 investment made in Nvidia stock a decade ago is now worth almost $1.2 million.\n\nNVDA data by YCharts\nThe company now has a market cap of $1.18 trillion. A 100x jump from here means that Nvidia's market cap could hit $118 trillion. The global economy's size is expected to hit $105 trillion this year, which makes another 100x jump at Nvidia look like a fantasy.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that doesn't mean investors looking to achieve big gains should not invest in this chipmaker. Let's look at the reasons why.\nUnderstanding how Nvidia has multiplied 100-fold in the past decade\nNvidia's eye-popping surge over the past decade has been driven by outstanding growth in the company's revenue and earnings, which is evident from the chart below.\n\nNVDA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\nDuring this time, the company has witnessed a rapid expansion in the application of the graphics cards that it sells. Nvidia's graphics cards were primarily deployed in gaming PCs (personal computers) and workstation PCs a decade ago. Its chips were also gaining traction in the automotive and high-performance computing markets at that time. However, the size of these markets was way smaller as the company delivered annual revenue of $4.1 billion in fiscal 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\nCut to the present, and Nvidia is set to finish fiscal 2024 with an estimated revenue of almost $59 billion (based on its revenue guidance of $20 billion for the current quarter). In simpler words, Nvidia's top line has multiplied by 15 in the past 10 years. The company's non-GAAP net income stood at $588 million in fiscal 2014. For comparison, Nvidia has generated almost $20 billion in non-GAAP net income in the first nine months of fiscal 2024.\nThe company's data center business has been the biggest driver of Nvidia's terrific growth, accounting for 80% of its top line in the previous quarter. This segment has benefited from the explosive demand for the company's artificial intelligence (AI)-focused graphics cards, which come with steep price tags and reportedly command a waiting period of up to a year. More importantly, the market for AI GPUs is going to unlock the next big growth opportunity for Nvidia over the next decade. Here's why.\nMeet Nvidia's next big growth driver\nNvidia is the biggest seller of chips deployed in AI servers for training large language models such as ChatGPT. Analysts estimate that the company controls 80% of this market right now, leaving competitors such as AMD and Intel way behind. For instance, AMD expects just $2 billion in revenue from sales of AI chips in 2024. Nvidia, on the other hand, reportedly sold half a million of its AI chips last quarter, which sent its data center segment's revenue up 279% year over year to $14.5 billion.\n\nGiven that Nvidia is expected to triple the output of its flagship H100 AI graphics card in 2024, the company may be able to generate $45 billion to $60 billion in revenue from the sale of this chip alone. So, there is a solid chance that the company is likely to maintain its hegemony over the lucrative AI chip market, which is expected to generate $400 billion in revenue in 2027.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we assume that Nvidia's competitors pull up their socks, introduce competitive products, and reduce its share of the AI chip market to 50% after five years, even then the company could generate $200 billion in revenue from this space. That would be more than triple the revenue Nvidia is on track to generate in the current fiscal year, and that too from one segment alone.\nOne Wall Street analyst is even more optimistic. Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho predicts that Nvidia could generate $300 billion in AI-related annual revenue by 2027 by maintaining a 75% share of the AI chip market. That would be more than 10 times the revenue Nvidia generated in its most recent fiscal year.\nInvestors shouldn't miss these additional catalysts that could help the stock multiply\nWhile the data center business has been in the spotlight thanks to AI, Nvidia isn't a one-trick pony. The company has other notable catalysts that could add more fuel to its growth, such as digital twins and cloud gaming.\nFor instance, Nvidia sees a $150 billion revenue opportunity in the digital twin market in the long run thanks to the growing adoption of this technology in factories and other industrial applications. The company has already started capitalizing on this market by striking deals with big automakers such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW, which will be using Nvidia's GPUs and software to virtually design factories before beginning physical construction.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the cloud gaming market looks set to become another important growth driver for Nvidia in the long run. The company is the dominant force in this nascent space with a solid market share, which is likely to translate into a substantial jump in its revenue.\nIn all, it is not surprising to see why analysts are anticipating Nvidia's earnings to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 113% over the next five years. That's substantially higher than the 48% annual earnings growth Nvidia has clocked in the past five years.\nAssuming Nvidia's earnings increase at a relatively conservative pace of 50% over the next five years (nearly half of what analysts are projecting), its earnings could jump to $93 per share after five years (using the current fiscal year's projected earnings of $12.29 per share as the base). Multiplying the projected earnings with Nvidia's five-year forward earnings multiple of 42 points toward a stock price of $3,900 per share after five years. That would be an eight-fold jump from current levels.\nThat's why if you have $10,000 in investible cash after paying your bills, clearing your high-interest loans, and saving enough for a rainy day, buying Nvidia could turn out to be a smart move as this tech stock has the capability of delivering outstanding gains in the long run -- even if it doesn't make you a millionaire -- and could give your portfolio a massive boost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Nvidia Corporation stands as the global leader in these industries, offering you the opportunity to become a part of its ownership by purchasing its stock. Let\u2019s examine how you can buy Nvidia stock and explore everything you need to know in this simple guide.\n Highlights and Key Takeaways\n\nNvidia stands as one of the most significant technology companies globally. You can take part in its ownership by placing a buy order through your broker\u2019s platform.\n\n\nSome of Nvidia\u2019s strengths lie in its products, such as the GeForce graphics cards, and the utilization of its products in electric vehicles and self-driving systems. It is also known for its strategic acquisitions and partnership.\n\n\nYou can track Nvidia\u2019s performance through price and volume charts, market news, the company\u2019s financial statements, and its investor relations website.\n\n\nInvesting in Nvidia through funds is also possible. It\u2019s advisable to consider using index funds or ETFs that include Nvidia among their holdings to mitigate systemic risk.\n\n\n Understanding Nvidia as an Investment\nWhy Invest in Nvidia?\nNvidia ranks as the sixth-largest company globally, boasting a market capitalization of 1.469 trillion dollars. Its business units are dedicated to continuous innovation within the GPU (graphics processing unit) market, widely utilized across diverse electronic devices. For instance, the GeForce line of video cards stands out as one of the most extensively used brands in personal computers worldwide.\nThe significance of Nvidia\u2019s products extends to electric vehicles, playing a fundamental role by providing processing technology essential for self-driving systems and integrated software in onboard computers. In essence, Nvidia not only is a leader in the production of current goods and services but also drives the development and innovation of future products.\nIf Nvidia has caught your attention and you\u2019re keen on investing in the stock market, we recommend exploring how to invest in stocks. Keep in mind that investing in stocks involves typical market-related risks. While Nvidia stands as a major player in the tech market, its future returns, like any other company, aren\u2019t assured. This is why you should be aware of the major risks associated with investing in Nvidia.\nRisks Associated With Investing in Nvidia\nLike many other stocks, investing in Nvidia entails similar risks. This includes exposure to market volatility, economic shifts, and the industry\u2019s dynamics. Recessions, unexpected interest rate hikes, the competitive nature of the technology sector, or changes in consumer preferences are among the potential risks associated with investing in Nvidia.\nThe cryptocurrency market, reliant on graphics cards for token mining, is another area associated with Nvidia, which the company provides professional GPU mining hardware. As a result, Nvidia can be impacted, either positively or negatively, by developments in the crypto market.\u00a0\nBesides these conventional economic risks, the semiconductor industry is significantly affected by events in Taiwan, which accounts for approximately 50% of global chip production. Any disruptions related to Taiwan can consequently impact Nvidia.\n How To Buy Nvidia Stock\nChoosing a Brokerage\nThe first step in purchasing Nvidia stocks involves selecting a broker to open a brokerage account and execute your trades. A brokerage account will enable you to buy and sell different types of investments. When choosing a broker, consider your needs and the services they offer. For instance, a user-friendly platform and robust customer service are crucial aspects of investing.\nMoreover, the costs associated with conducting your trades are another significant factor when setting up your brokerage account. There isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all \u2018best\u2019 broker; it\u2019s about finding the one that suits your needs. If you\u2019re interested in learning more about some of the most relevant brokerage accounts in the market, you can explore our broker guide.\nPlacing a Stock Order\nThe next step to buying Nvidia stock is placing an order in the market and completing the transaction. You can do this using the platform provided by your broker and create either a market order or a limit order. Both options can be used to finalize the purchase. Keep in mind that these orders work differently.\nA market order secures the purchase at the best available market price and is executed automatically. On the other hand, with a limit order, you specify the maximum price you\u2019re willing to pay for Nvidia shares. However, if you choose a price lower than the market price, your transaction may not be executed. Remember, there are multiple types of orders to complete your transactions.\n\n Monitoring Your Investment\nUnderstanding Stock Performance\nAfter acquiring Nvidia shares, you\u2019d undoubtedly want to stay updated on their performance, the company\u2019s developments, industry trends, and your investment\u2019s financial results. To achieve this, there are several essential aspects you should consistently monitor over time.\n\nTracking the price movement of your shares can be done through charts that provide detailed price and transaction volume data.\n\n\nThe latest news regarding Nvidia and the chip industry is crucial for understanding market fluctuations.\n\n\nUnderstanding the company\u2019s financial data and board projections is the key to assessing operational results and conducting a thorough fundamental analysis.\n\n\nUtilizing technical analysis tools aids in identifying market trends and patterns, offering valuable insights. These tools include; the moving average, MACD indicator, trend lines, trading volume, chart patterns, candlesticks, among others.\u00a0\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s official investor relations page contains comprehensive company-related information.\n\nAll these aspects are highly useful in gauging whether your investment is on the right track or not. Furthermore, they are crucial in determining the future outlook and the suitability of retaining Nvidia shares in your portfolio. Remember, an investment might not yield the expected results in the short run, but prospects of future returns may not change. Longer investment horizons are good option for portfolios.\nWhen To Sell Your Stock\nThere are many possible reasons to consider selling stocks in your portfolio. However, choosing the ideal moment to sell is more of an art than a science. For example, if Nvidia\u2019s shares hit a specific price target determined through technical analysis, you might opt to place a sell order in the market.\nOther pivotal factors, such as substantial shifts in fundamentals or reaching a personal financial objective, can also guide your decision to sell stocks. The key is to make decisions as rationally and knowledgeably as possible, avoiding choices influenced by emotions or fear.\n How To Invest in Nvidia With Funds\nInvesting in Nvidia without directly buying the company\u2019s stocks is also possible. Investment funds offer instant diversification, a structured investment strategy, and the advantage of not needing personal time commitment as a portfolio manager handles asset allocation. Among the most popular choices are index funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) that include Nvidia among their holdings.\nTo access index funds or ETFs, you\u2019ll need an account with a regulated broker. Index funds are effective in diversifying risk across various sectors while including Nvidia in your portfolio. The cost of index funds are relatively low and also, you do not need to possess much financial knowledge. Classic examples include funds mirroring the S&P 500 or Dow Jones. Additionally, there are ETFs replicating specific industries, like the technology sector. If you\u2019re keen on how to buy ETFs, our guide offers deeper insights.\n\n Conclusion\nNvidia stands as one of the world\u2019s largest companies and a leader in the technology sector. Its innovation focus secures a pivotal position in shaping the future, especially in areas like electric vehicles and autonomous driving systems. To buy Nvidia shares, you\u2019ll need an account with a regulated broker and place an order in the market. When purchasing, you can choose between a limit or a market order.\nYou can monitor the performance of your investment using various tools. For example, charts allow you to analyze the current price and conduct technical analysis. Additionally, you can also review the company\u2019s operational results in its financial statements or access Nvidia\u2019s investor relations page for more relevant information.\nIt\u2019s crucial to remember that investing in any stocks involves risks, but you can mitigate some of them by investing indirectly through index funds or ETFs. These methods offer automatic diversification and a structured investment strategy, which helps reduce overall risk exposure.\n FAQ\nHow Can I Purchase Nvidia Stock?\nTo buy Nvidia shares, it\u2019s crucial to have a brokerage account. Through this account, you\u2019ll place a buy order on your broker\u2019s platform, enabling access to the market for the transaction.\nDoes Nvidia Pay Dividends?\nNvidia pays dividends every quarter, according to their policy. However, these dividends aren\u2019t very substantial because it\u2019s a technology company focused more on growth than on dividend payouts.\nAre Nvidia Shares a Good Buy?\nNvidia ranks as the sixth-largest company globally based on its market capitalization, establishing it as a reliable entity.

Think Again.\n\n\n  \n      By Adam Spatacco\n  \n  \u2013\n  \n    \n      Updated Jan 3, 2024 at 1:22PM\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are in high demand for AI applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company's revenue has soared over the last year, but margin expansion and rising profits shouldn't go unnoticed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to its peers, Nvidia stock looks attractively valued on a forward price-to-earnings basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$2.9T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(-2.53%)\u00a0-$3.02\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$116.51\n\n\nPrice as of March 18, 2025, 3:18 p.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia may have reached the $1 trillion club, but the stock looks cheap compared to its peers.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) dominated financial headlines throughout 2023. While myriad companies are participating in the AI marathon, the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks are setting the pace. Among this cohort of stocks, perhaps the biggest beneficiary from the AI boom is Nvidia (NVDA -2.53%). The company recently reported earnings for its third quarter of fiscal 2024, ended Oct. 29, handily beating its revenue guidance and setting a new record.\nBut even after its 240% stock return so far this year, there are plenty of reasons to believe the party is just getting started for Nvidia. Let's dig into the tailwinds pushing demand for the company's semiconductor chips and assess if now is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nArtificial intelligence is fueling demand\nNvidia specializes in the production of graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs play a critical role in gaming, crypto mining, and AI. When it comes to AI use cases, GPU chips are designed to help power large language models (LLMs). This is important because LLMs are a core component of generative AI applications.\nGiven the skyrocketing rise of Microsoft's ChatGPT and Alphabet's Bard, it's easy to draw a dotted line connecting Nvidia to a host of other major AI players. To get a sense of just how much demand Nvidia is experiencing, let's take a look at the company's financial picture and how its valuation has shifted.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's path to a $1 trillion valuation\nThe table below illustrates some of Nvidia's key financial metrics over the last year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nQ3 FY 23\nQ4 FY 23\nQ1 FY 24\nQ2 FY 24\nQ3 FY24\n\n\nRevenue\n$5.9 billion\n$6.1 billion\n$7.2 billion\n$13.5 billion\n$18.1 billion\n\n\nGross margin %\n53.6%\n63.3%\n\n64.6%\n\n70.1%\n74%\n\n\nDiluted earnings per share\n$0.27\n$0.57\n$0.82\n$2.48\n$3.71\n\n\n\nData source: Nvidia Investor Relations.\u00a0\nYou can see that Nvidia's revenue has increased by 206% over the last year. But perhaps even better is the company's bottom line. The impressive margin expansion has helped fuel a rise in profits, as diluted earnings per share increased from $0.27 during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to $3.71 for the most recent quarter -- over 1,200% growth in just one year.\nNvidia's eye-popping growth on both the revenue and earnings lines sheds light not only on the demand for its products, but the pricing power that the company can command given its market-leading position.\n\nNVDA Market Cap data by YCharts\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart above illustrates Nvidia's market cap over the last year. Nvidia's market cap has grown over 200% to eclipse $1 trillion. Although this valuation might appear steep, a thorough analysis benchmarked against its peers might prove otherwise.\nShould you buy Nvidia stock in 2024?\nThe chart below illustrates Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio compared to its \"Magnificent Seven\" cohorts. Investors can see that Nvidia's forward P/E of roughly 40 is right in the middle of the pack. What is actually surprising to me is that Tesla, which is a known customer of Nvidia, is trading at a forward P/E nearly double that of Nvidia's.\n\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\nPerhaps an even more head-scratching dynamic can be seen in the chart below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\nAdvanced Micro Devices is Nvidia's top rival. While AMD has been posting some impressive results of its own, the disparity between its forward P/E and Nvidia's is astounding. It may sound convoluted to say that a trillion-dollar company is cheap. But when you measure Nvidia against its megacap peers as well as its No. 1 rival, the case for buying the stock becomes increasingly clear.\nAs demand for AI applications continues to gain momentum, I see Nvidia continuing to play an integral role. And with the stock trading at discounts to smaller rivals as well as end customers reliant on the company's technology, now looks like a terrific opportunity for long-term investors to scoop up shares.\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

NVIDIA also achieved a massive milestone in May 2023 by joining the exclusive club of companies with a $1 trillion market capitalization.  The surge reflects investors' confidence in NVIDIA's strategic positioning, robust financial performance and pivotal role in shaping transformative technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), gaming and data center solutions. However, the looming question remains \u2014 Can NVIDIA sustain this momentum through 2024? NVIDIA Corporation Price and Consensus NVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-chart | NVIDIA Corporation Quote Will GenAI Investments Aid NVDA\u2019s Surge? NVIDIA\u2019s robust stock price performance has been primarily driven by hopes that the company will be a prime beneficiary of growing investments in generative AI. Given generative AI\u2019s inherited opportunities and the company\u2019s leadership in the space, we believe the NVDA stock is poised to carry the momentum in 2024. NVIDIA dominates the market for AI chips. The meteoric rise of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and its adoption among enterprises have already proven generative AI technology\u2019s usefulness across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy & utilities and video game development.  The growing demand to modernize the workflow across industries is expected to drive the demand for generative AI applications. The global generative AI market size is anticipated to reach $109.37 billion by 2030, according to a new report by Grand View Research. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 35.6% from 2023 to 2030. However, generative AI requires vast knowledge to create content and needs huge computational power. As a result, enterprises looking to create generative AI-based applications will be required to upgrade their existing network infrastructure. NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation chips with high computing power can be the top choice for enterprises. The company\u2019s GPUs are already being applied in AI models. This is expanding NVDA\u2019s footprint in untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing. The generative AI revolution is likely to create huge demand for its next-generation high computing powerful chips. Considering surging AI investments across the data center end market, NVDA expects its fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues to reach $20 billion from $6.05 billion in the year-ago quarter.   Story Continues Additionally, NVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a Growth Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.Other Stocks in the $1T ClubApart from NVIDIA, only four companies \u2014 Apple Inc.

It\u2019s been a generational rally and one that remains difficult to view from the sidelines as the so-called \u201cAI chip rip\u201d continues into the holiday season. As Nvidia does its best to stay on the \u201cmaxed out\u201d expectations treadmill, it will certainly be interesting to see how the AI kingpin fares in 2024. \nAfter more than tripling in less than a year, I\u2019d not be a chaser of Nvidia stock, as even a continuation of the broader rally in AI stocks may do little good for Nvidia, given how far it\u2019s climbed and how frothy its valuation multiples have become. As a result, I\u2019m inclined to take a more neutral stance, even though Nvidia still looks like a king among men.\n\nAI Enthusiasm Could Carry Into 2024, but Nvidia May Not Benefit\nOn Thursday, the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) rocketed higher. The rally was due to renewed AI enthusiasm following Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) official entry into the large language model (LLM) arena with the much-awaited Gemini product. With the wind at the back of firms with skin in the AI game again, it seems like a good time to check in with Nvidia again after its recent November correction. Although the next leg of the AI run could have the potential to be considerable, I\u2019m still not sure whether Nvidia will be able to add to its rally. After all, the stock may have booked many years\u2019 worth of gains in 2023, and it may be time for others to feel the AI tailwinds at their backs.\nAt writing, Nvidia stock goes for 61.3 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), which is well ahead of the semiconductor industry average of 34.1 times and certainly ahead of its peers in the so-called Magnificent Seven, many of whom likely have more room to run on the back of AI in 2024.\nIn 2024, I\u2019d look for Alphabet, which has its own line of AI chips \u2014 Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) \u2014 to join the AI leadership group alongside the likes of Nvidia going into the new year. Though Alphabet TPUs may not have the same firepower as the latest and greatest Nvidia-powered AI chip today, I view the firm\u2019s eagerness to build custom AI chips as posing a potential threat to Nvidia at some point down the road.\n\t\t\n\n\nFor now, Nvidia seems to be sprinting to the endzone, with few combatants in sight that can make the tackle. That said, it\u2019s unclear how long Nvidia can remain dominant as some of the market\u2019s less-appreciated AI heavyweights like Alphabet and even Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) really look to flex their muscles in 2024. Further, there seems to be no endzone in sight for the top AI players.\nThe Rise of Custom AI Chips May Harm Nvidia\nMoving forward, the trend of big-tech firms building their own custom chips will likely continue as they seek to get a piece of the economic profits from Nvidia. Whether we\u2019re talking about CPUs (central processing units) or AI chips, many firms have recognized the value of building one\u2019s own silicon, largely thanks to iPhone maker and custom chip pioneer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has seen its custom chip efforts pay massive dividends in recent years. On a side note, Apple has also been innovating on the front of AI hardware with its Neural Engine AI accelerator.\nEvery time a big-tech firm like Apple, Amazon, or Alphabet flexes an AI hardware offering to go up against Nvidia\u2019s best chip, look for significant action in Nvidia stock as investors ponder whether new competing products stand to erode the company\u2019s dominance. \nThe more firms that choose to build their own, the less demand there may be for future Nvidia AI chips if custom chips can keep up (or surpass) the performance of Nvidia\u2019s offerings. That\u2019s a massive if, though. So, the stakes remain high, and with such a lofty valuation, there exist bull- and bear-case scenarios for Nvidia as we advance further into the AI age.\nIs Nvidia Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\nOn TipRanks, NVDA stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 34 analyst ratings, there are 31 Buys and three Hold recommendations. The\u00a0average Nvidia stock price target is $661.00, implying upside potential of 41.9%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $560.00 per share to a high of $1,100.00 per share.\n\t\t\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\nI predict that Nvidia stock will have a tougher time doubling up again and could trail the rest of the AI plays in the Magnificent Seven in 2024. The stock is expensive right now and could feel the heat as more players look to break into the AI chip market.\nWith Dr. Michael Burry \u2014 the underestimated genius who bet against the housing market in the face of the Great Financial Crisis \u2014 betting against semiconductor stocks with a big short position on the Nvidia-heavy iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX), I think it\u2019d be wise to temper one\u2019s enthusiasm for red-hot AI stocks like Nvidia, at least until a pullback brings forth more reasonable valuations.\nDisclosure\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\n\n\n FACEBOOK\n\n\n\n\n TWITTER\n\n\n\n\n EMAIL\n\n\n\n\n COPY LINK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNVIDIA NewsMORE  \n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX PRO Comes to Workstations and Servers for Designers, Developers, Data Scientists and Creatives to Build and Collaborate With Agentic AIGlobeNewswire 21m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces DGX Spark and DGX Station Personal AI ComputersGlobeNewswire 23m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces Spectrum-X Photonics, Co-Packaged Optics Networking Switches to Scale AI Factories to Millions of GPUsGlobeNewswire 38m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell Ultra AI Factory Platform Paves Way for Age of AI ReasoningGlobeNewswire 48m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Dynamo Open-Source Library Accelerates and Scales AI Reasoning ModelsGlobeNewswire 1h \n\n\n\nNvidia GTC 2025: Rubin, reasoning, robotics and moreSeeking Alpha 1h \n\n\n\nGeneral Motors and NVIDIA Collaborate on AI for Next-Generation Vehicle Experience and ManufacturingGlobeNewswire 2h \n\n\n\nNVIDIA and Telecom Industry Leaders to Develop AI-Native Wireless Networks for 6GGlobeNewswire 2h \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tStart Trading Futures\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n\n\n\n\nNVDA\n\n\n\n116.50\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-3.03 (-2.53%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t03:13:43 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time NVDA charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFind News\n\t\t\t\tNews\n\n\n\n\n\nGO\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n            See also:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                - Explore more categories\n            \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

(AVGO), to ascertain which holds the potential to yield superior returns this month. Let\u2019s understand this in detail.\nThe semiconductor demand stands resilient, affirmed by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA). The global semiconductors sales in October amounted to $46.6 billion, up 3.9% over September\u2019s $44.9 billion. Moreover, worldwide semiconductor sales totaled $134.7 billion in the third quarter of 2023, a 6.3% rise from the second quarter.\nThe surge in demand for high-performance GPU-based servers and accelerator cards within data centers, propelled by advancements in generative AI (GenAI) and large language models, constitutes a significant driver of growth in the semiconductor industry.\nThe memory market, which is predicted to grow by more than 40% year-over-year to more than $130 billion in 2024, is the primary engine of the industry\u2019s expected growth. Other significant areas, such as discrete, sensors, analog, logic, and micro, are expected to grow in the single digits simultaneously.\n\n\nDemand will rise further as a result of the ongoing development and integration of technologies such as 5G, AI, and the Internet of Things (IoT) in various industries. According to Gartner (IT), global semiconductor revenue will climb 16.8% to $624 billion in 2024.\nFurthermore, as per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the semiconductor industry is expected to reach $1.09 trillion by 2028, rising at a CAGR of 10.9%.\nIn terms of price performance, NVDA has marginally declined over the past month, while AVGO gained 2.6% during the same period. Moreover, NVDA witnessed a 3.3% plunge over the past three months, while AVGO climbed by 3.6% over the same duration.\nHowever, NVDA has surged 184.6% over the past year, closing the last trading session at $455.03, whereas AVGO has gained 71.9% during the same period, closing the last trading session at $903.64.\n10 STOCKS TO SELL NOW!But which Semiconductor & Wireless Chip stock could be a better pick?

Still, the company is facing at least two very tough challenges, and the valuation of NVDA stock is quite high.\n Given the latter two points, I believe that there\u2019s a significant chance of the shares underperforming the Nasdaq and other AI plays in the medium term and the long term.  As a result, I urge investors to trim NVDA stock to 5% or less of their portfolios. \nPromising Partnerships and Continued Rapid Growth on the Horizon \nOf course, Nvidia\u2019s top and bottom lines are soaring as it benefits from robust demand for its AI chips. Moreover, in the future, the company\u2019s multiple, impressive partnerships should provide the chip maker with additional positive catalysts. \nFor example, Nvidia is partnering with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to \u201coffer the first cloud AI supercomputer with NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip and AWS UltraCluster scalability\u201d through Amazon\u2019s cloud unit, AWS. And on the automotive front, Nvidia is collaborating with multiple major manufacturers, including BMW (OTC:BMWYY), Mercedes Benz, and the Taiwan-based giant, Foxconn. \nSpeaking of automotive, I expect Nvidia\u2019s auto-chip business to accelerate tremendously as many more vehicles adopt advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), self-driving technology, and other high-tech offerings. \nIn light of these points, I expect Nvidia\u2019s overall growth to continue to be very strong for years.\nA High Valuation and Two Important Threats\n Based on many metrics, Nvidia\u2019s valuation remains quite high. For example, its trailing price-sales ratio is a huge 26 times, while its enterprise value/EBITDA ratio is quite elevated at 50. \nAdding further to my caution about the stock\u2019s valuation, research firm Morningstar recently set a \u201cfair value estimate\u201d of $480 on the name. That\u2019s only a few percentage points above the shares\u2019 current level.\nFurther, Morningstar noted that NVDA expects its sales to China to fall meaningfully due to U.S. sanctions against the Asian country. Morningstar warned that additional American sanctions against China could hurt Nvidia. \nAdditionally, with the U.S. government seemingly determined to crush cryptocurrencies sooner or later, I fear that such a development would meaningfully and negatively impact Nvidia\u2019s top and bottom lines.  \nAccording to one source, a change in the method of mining Ethereum (ETH-USD) contributed a great deal to a $1.5 billion decline in Nvidia\u2019s revenue in Q3 of 2022. \nTherefore, if Washington largely destroys the crypto sector, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Nvidia\u2019s gaming revenue sink by $1.5 billion per quarter or $6 billion per year. (Its gaming revenue in Q3 came in at $2.86 billion).  That would lower its overall top line by about 8%, likely resulting in a sizeable decline of the shares. \nThe Bottom Line on NVDA Stock\nMorningstar wrote that it expects two of Nvidia\u2019s competitors, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), to also generate \u201ctremendous revenue growth\u201d in the future. I recommend that investors looking to capitalize on the AI chip boom consider diversifying their holdings by owning Intel and or AMD in addition to Nvidia, given the latter company\u2019s high valuation and multiple threats. \nThose for whom NVDA shares already constitute 5% or less of their portfolios can hold their positions at their current levels, while the investors who don\u2019t already own the name should consider buying it if it falls 10% or more.\n\u00a0On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in INTC.

More specifically, consensus estimates forecast Nvidia's earnings to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 103% over the next five years. That would be more than double the 48% CAGR Nvidia's bottom line has clocked in the past five years.\nA closer look at Nvidia's key growth drivers will tell us exactly why its bottom-line growth is expected to step on the gas over the next five years.\n\nNvidia's huge catalysts point toward red-hot growth\u00a0\nNvidia was a much smaller company five years ago. It generated just under $12 billion in revenue in fiscal 2019 (which ended in January 2019 and coincided with 11 months of calendar year 2018). Gaming was Nvidia's biggest business segment at that time, accounting for 53% of its top line, while the data center business produced a quarter of its total revenue five years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe situation has changed dramatically since then. The company now gets 80% of its revenue from selling graphics processing units (GPU) for the data center market. Gaming is now a smaller component, with just under 16% of Nvidia's fiscal 2024 third-quarter revenue. Still, Nvidia is the leader in both of these markets.\nAccording to third-party estimates, Nvidia controls more than 80% of the AI chip market, and it has a similar position in the market for discrete graphics cards that are deployed in PCs. The good news is that both of these markets are built for solid growth over the next five years. According to Nvidia's peer Advanced Micro Devices, the AI chip market could generate annual revenue of $400 billion in 2027, up nearly 10x from this year's $45 billion.\nOn the other hand, the gaming GPU market is forecast to grow at an annual pace of almost 34% through the end of 2028, according to Mordor Intelligence. The cloud gaming market, which is forecast to clock annual growth of 39% through 2028 and generate annual revenue of $23 billion at the end of the forecast period, could be another catalyst for Nvidia given the company's dominant position in this space.\nMore importantly, Nvidia has been taking steps to ensure that it remains the leading player in these markets by way of its product development moves. The company has already accelerated its product roadmap in AI chips, and it is reportedly going to make its next-generation gaming cards on a more advanced 3-nanometer (nm) process as compared to the current RTX 40-series processors that are made on a 5nm process.\n\n\n\n\n\nA smaller manufacturing node should ideally allow Nvidia's new gaming chips to pack more computing power and consume less electricity at the same time. This explains why Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, from whom Nvidia sources its chips, claims that the 3nm chips could boost performance by 15% and lower power consumption by 30% as compared to the 5nm chips.\nAll this indicates that Nvidia is setting itself up to make the most of the impressive growth in the key end markets that contribute significantly to its business. That's why it won't be surprising to see the company's earnings indeed growing at a much faster pace over the next five years as compared to the past five.\nHow much upside can investors expect over the next five years?\nNvidia is on track to finish fiscal 2024 with revenue of $59 billion. That translates into a five-year revenue CAGR of 38% using the company's fiscal 2019 revenue of $11.7 billion as the base. For comparison, Nvidia's revenue growth is expected to be much faster over the next couple of years, as the following chart indicates.\n\nNVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company is expected to generate almost $108 billion in revenue in fiscal 2026. That points toward a three-year revenue CAGR of 58% using the fiscal 2023 revenue of $27 billion as the base. If we assume that Nvidia's annual growth slows down to even 30% in the three fiscal years following fiscal 2026, its top line could hit $237 billion in fiscal 2029.\nNvidia has a five-year price-to-sales ratio of 20. Multiplying that with the company's projected revenue in fiscal 2029 would translate to a market cap of $4.75 trillion. That's nearly 4x of Nvidia's current market cap, indicating that a $100 investment in this hot tech stock could multiply once again in the next five years and make investors richer.\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

(Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\nWhich stock benefited most from 2023\u2019s boom in Generative AI? If you thought the winner is Santa Clara, Calif.-based Nvidia \u2014 the chip designer with 85% of the market for the GPUs that power ChatGPT and other large language models \u2014 you would be wrong.\n\n\nThe right answer is Vertiv \u2014 a provider of power-management and cooling equipment for data centers \u2014 located in Westerville, Ohio.\n\nWhile Nvidia stock \u2014 up 246% in 2023 \u2014 came in second place in my Generative AI Stock Index, Vertiv shares led the pack by popping 269% this year.\n\nDoes the steep rise in its share price mean it is too late to buy Vertiv stock? I don\u2019t know for sure \u2014 but it\u2019s clearly a leader in a fast-growing industry being propelled by demand for the LLMs that power Generative AI.\n\n\nThe Generative AI Stock Index\nBefore getting into all of that, let\u2019s take a look at the GAISI. It keys off Brain Rush \u2014 a book I am writing about Generative AI \u2014 part of which explores how to invest and compete in the business ecosystem powering those buzzy chatbots.\nThe GAISI \u2014 which rose 82% in 2023 compared to 43% for the Nasdaq Composite \u2014 tracks a subset of publicly traded stocks in five industries supporting Generative AI.\nBelow I list the GAISI\u2019s industry components and provide the stock market performance of the average company I tracked in each:\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\n\n\nGenerative AI consulting: +30%.\nGenerative AI software: +91%.\nGenerative AI cloud services: +70%.\nGenerative AI hardware: +135%.\n\n\n\nFor now, I will set aside a discussion of which companies are included in each sub-industry and why Generative AI hardware stocks did better than the other four.\nI will say the hardware category includes Nvidia and Vertiv \u2014 both of which were the only companies whose share prices increased more than 200% in 2023.\n\n\nWhat Vertiv Makes And Why It Wins\nVertiv has undergone many corporate transformations before emerging as a leading beneficiary of the Generative AI boom.\nVertiv was formerly the network-power business of Emerson Electric\nEMR\n built with help from the 2010 acquisition for $1.5 billion of Chloride Group. Emerson later took a $508 million write-down on that deal \u2013 causing its former CEO Dave Farr to express his regret for getting into the industry, according to Bloomberg.\nEmerson acquired the business in 2016 and sold it to Platinum Equity for $4 billion. In 2020, the business \u2013 called Vertiv \u2013 went public by merging with a Goldman Sachs-led special purpose acquisition company. Vertiv\u2019s Executive Chair Dave Cote had previously served as CEO of Honeywell, Bloomberg noted, and as an executive at GE.\nIn 2023, Vertiv was a major beneficiary of data centers\u2019 need to cool off the GPU-laden computing systems used to train and operate LLMs. As Bank of America\nBAC\n analyst Andrew Obin wrote in a June 2023 report, a 10% increase in power use would require \u201ca more than 10% increase in electrical-equipment capacity because of the need for redundant infrastructure to help guard against power failures,\u201d Bloomberg reported.\nHigher power means more heat generated \u2013 creating demand for equipment to cool down the servers to ambient temperature. Vertiv\u2019s liquid cooling systems solved the problem of overheated data centers very effectively. In June 2023, Vertiv was struggling to satisfy demand for its products from data centers processing Generative AI workloads.\nAbout a third of Vertiv\u2019s revenue came from hyperscale data-center customers \u2013 considerably higher than the single-digit percentages at larger rivals such as Eaton and Schneider, noted Obin.\nVertiv\u2019s Generative AI Products\nVertiv provides immersive cooling systems and other products for data centers hosting Generative AI applications. The level of densely packed servers doing calculations all day long boosts the amount of heat that data centers must remove to keep the equipment from overheating, as I wrote in November.\nLiquid cooling \u2014 which circulates water or other coolants through heat exchangers to absorb the heat generated by computer components \u2014 is more efficient than fans or air conditioning, KPMG Managing Director Brian Lewis said.\nDespite the advantage, data center operators need to make sure their buildings can handle the added weight of liquid cooling products. \u201cLiquid cooling adds weight because it is sitting on the floor and is embedded into the circuit boards,\u201d Forrester Research\nFORR\n senior analyst Abhijit Sunil told me in November. \u201cIt is heavier than air cooled which has big fans blowing in the data center.\u201d\nTo satisfy the demands Generative AI places on data centers, Vertiv offers products including the following:\n\n\nImmersive cooling. In December 2023, Vertiv announced it would provide liquid cooling to Intel\u2019s\nINTC\n Gaudi AI accelerator, according to Network World. Vertiv\u2019s liquid cooling product handles four times the power and much higher temperatures than air-cooled solutions. Vertiv's pumped two-phase liquid cooling product uses a low power pump to move non-toxic refrigerant through cold plates attached directly to the chip. Vertiv\u2019s P2P system transfers heat from the chips to the fluid by changing phases from liquid to gas. The system captures and cools the gas \u2013 turning it back into a liquid \u2013 thus reducing or eliminating a data center\u2019s need for chillers. Intel\u2019s principal engineer Devdatta Kulkarni said Vertiv\u2019s P2P system would help Intel Gaudi AI accelerator customers to \u201cmeet critical sustainability goals,\" Network World reported\nMicrogrids. Since Generative AI requires more power, data center operators need to anticipate the capacity and availability limitations of traditional electric utilities. To address this, Vertiv collaborated with American Electric\nAEP\n Power to implement the microgrid application. Microgrids meet the power needs of processing Generative AI while reducing data centers\u2019 dependency on the electrical grid for power capacity and availability, according to Data Center News. They also present an alternative to frequent diesel generator backups. Vertiv\u2019s microgrids reduce the risk to data centers of electric utility outages by supplementing the electrical utility with solar arrays and hydrogen fuel cells, Data Center News reported.\n\n\nVertiv\u2019s Financial Performance And Prospects\nIn 2023, Vertiv\u2019s performance and prospects appeared strong. However, the trajectory of its stock price depends on whether the company continues to exceed investor expectations. Vertiv has two things going in its favor:\n\n\nThe liquid cooling industry is growing quickly \u2013 propelled in part by demand for Generative AI. Liquid cooling represents a fast-growing market opportunity. According to Polaris Market Research, it was valued at $1.81 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a 24% average annual rate over through 2026, I noted in November.\nVertiv dominated its industry. In its third quarter of 2023, Vertiv posted better-than-expected results and provided investors with an ambitious forecast for the year. Specifically, revenue increased about 18% to $1.74 billion and analysts expected nearly 20% growth for the company in fiscal 2023 to $6.82 billion. Moreover, Vertiv\u2019s earnings per share grew 126% in the third quarter of 2023 and analysts forecast the company\u2019 EPS would rise by 203% in fiscal 2023, I noted last month.\n\n\nIn 2023, Wall Street analysts were optimistic about Vertiv stock. Deutsche Bank wrote, \u201cVertiv clearly caught the AI wave,\u201d in a September 14 research note. The firm \u2014 which raised its price target to $48 per share \u2014 saw potential for more than 50% further upside \u201cif data center investments continue growing at a double-digit clip,\u201d I wrote in November.\nMeanwhile, Evercore\nEVR\n ISI saw Vertiv as an industry leader. In an October 1 investor note, the firm wrote the company \u201chas the top market share for thermal management solutions and is a powerhouse in the arena.\u201d Evercore added the company\u2019s association with Leibert \u2014 the inventor of precision cooling \u2014 gave Vertiv an advantage over rivals such as Eaton and APC.\nMoreover, Evercore \u2014 which set a $50 price target on the company\u2019s shares \u2014 noted Vertiv offers contracts on energy savings \u201cto earn higher payouts, if a higher percentage of operating expenses is saved,\u201d I noted last month.\nVertiv was optimistic about its future. The company expected strong demand for products related to Generative AI as well as products to help data centers handle more traditional processing. \u201cIf we talk about technologies that are applied to high-density GPU or compute, as for example, liquid cooling, GPUs or some rack-level power distribution solutions. I will still say our order book is in the tens of millions of dollars,\u201d Vertiv CEO Giordano Albertazzi told investors in October.\nHe added, \u201cMany elements of our portfolio, chillers, direct expansion cooling, heat rejection systems, switchgear, busbars, UPS, you name them are used \u2014 regardless if GPU or CPU compute, high density or normal density. The majority of our products will support many types of compute, including AI. That is the beauty of having a comprehensive portfolio of all critical infrastructure technologies, across the entire span of the powertrain, the thermal chain and IT-wide space infrastructure, something that very few companies truly have.\u201d\nAlthough Nvidia \u2014 its revenue soared 205% in the third quarter \u2014 is growing much faster than Vertiv, the chip giant faces headwinds due to U.S. limitations on the power of the chips it can ship to China. That could make it difficult for Nvidia to sustain its rapid growth pace.\nVertiv expects 20% revenue growth and could grow even faster than that.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Two prime examples are Palantir Technologies (PLTR -3.11%), up 180% since January, and Nvidia (NVDA -2.53%), up 210%.\nThat's how the two stocks have done in the recent past, but investing is about looking to the years ahead. Nvidia is now one of the world's largest companies, worth $1.1 trillion. Palantir, worth $40 billion, is building momentum, picking up new business from the government and private sector.\nWhich is the better investment moving forward? Could Palantir be worth more than Nvidia by 2030? Here is what you need to know.\n\nPalantir is heating up\nPalantir is a software company that sells data analytics software that can utilize AI models, identify trends in large data pools, and aid strategic decision-making.\nRising interest rates have pressured spending across the corporate world, which may have slowed Palantir's revenue growth over the past 24 months. However, things are beginning to accelerate again. Revenue growth bottomed midway through the year but rebounded to nearly 17% year-over-year growth in the third quarter. Palantir's customer count as of Q3 is 37% higher year over year and 12% higher quarter over quarter. In other words, Palantir is winning more customers faster, which bodes well for future revenue growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPLTR Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts\nThe company recently won a massive $412 million contract with England's public healthcare system, which should further bolster growth over the next several years. Palantir's financials are also turning the corner; it's now consistently profitable under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and analysts expect that to continue. Earnings could grow at an estimated 72% annually over the long term.\n\nNvidia's impressive AI lead\nNvidia has an excellent reputation for its high-performance GPU chips. Still, few could have predicted the massive boost artificial intelligence would give its business this year. Revenue growth accelerated to over 200%, a blistering pace that surely won't last but has infused lots of new cash into the business. Free cash flow over the past year is now at $17.5 billion.\nCompanies have overwhelmingly looked to Nvidia for their AI chips, giving it an estimated 80% market share. It's an early lead, and there's a good chance competition will turn up the pressure, but it's clear Nvidia is on higher ground than the field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts\nGrowth from AI raised expectations of the company from analysts, who now estimate a 39% annual earnings growth rate. That's remarkable for a company already as large as Nvidia.\nCan Palantir catch Nvidia?\nIt's important to understand just how large Nvidia has become in such a short amount of time. The company's market cap has added more than $500 billion in value over the past year, more than 10 times what Palantir is worth today.\nPalantir's smaller size does help it grow faster, but looking for a more than 20-fold increase from Palantir over the next decade is asking a lot. Earnings could grow by 50% annually for 10 years, and the resulting $8.5 billion in net income at a 30 times P/E ratio would value Palantir at $255 billion, still a fraction of what Nvidia is worth today (not considering Nvidia's future growth).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPLTR Market Cap data by YCharts\nBut Palantir remaining smaller than Nvidia isn't a loss for investors. Palantir's expected earnings growth is stellar, and the stock's current forward P/E of 73 creates a PEG ratio of just 1, meaning the stock is a great price for the growth you could get.\nNo, Palantir probably won't catch Nvidia, but you can buy and hold the stock anyway.\n\n\n\nJustin Pope has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Here, the companies will develop Malaysia's fastest supercomputers using Nvidia's AI chips. YTL will also use Nvidia's AI cloud computing platform to build a large language model in Malay.\"Malaysia is an important hub for Southeast Asia computing infrastructure, which requires access to land, facilities, and power, and YTL could play a great role in that,\" said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, prior to the announcement of the partnership.Prime Minister Anwar said of the agreement: \"The decision to invest in Malaysia is a clear signal that foreign investors, especially technology giants, continue to make the country a primary destination of choice in this region.\"The YTL data center park was first announced in August 2022 and is planned to eventually be a 500MW campus. Singaporean IT firm Sea is reported to be the anchor tenant for the development, and GDS is also developing a data center on the campus.Earlier this month, DCD reported that 15 percent of Nvidia's Q3 revenue came from Singapore, notably making the city-state on Malaysia's border the company's fourth biggest customer globally. Per capita, Singapore spent $600 on Nvidia chips, compared to $60 in the US and $3 in China.It is unclear what has led to this huge demand, be it shell companies using the location, or that Singapore is developing products that will be sent elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in Asia Pacific\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDCD>Connect |  Investment APAC - Sponsorship Brochure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\nSK Telecom partners with Elice, Schneider, Giga Computing for AI data centers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nScaling AI-ready data centers in India\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in HPC & Quantum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28 Feb 2025\n\n\n\n\nCanadian government seeks Sovereign AI Compute Strategy proposals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 Oct 2024\n\n\n\n\nAnsys and TSMC team up with Microsoft for silicon photonic simulations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nThe architecture of a supercomputer: A journey into advanced HPC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nJensen Huang\n\n\nYTL Power\n\n\nMalaysia\n\n\nPrime Minister Anwar\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\nJohor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

Only three survive to ride out of town at the end of the movie. The odds look much better for the seven tech companies recently dubbed the magnificent seven after dominating US stock markets in 2023. But there are problems that could ambush some of these companies in 2024. \nApple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Nvidia have driven a rally in US stocks in 2023. They now make up nearly a third of the S&P 500 measure of the largest listed US companies, which has risen more than 20% since January. These tech stocks had provided shareholders with a whopping 71% return by mid-November while the other 493 names added just 6%.\nThis impressive performance led Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to name these companies the magnificent seven earlier this year. Goldman Sachs soon followed, calling their massive outperformance the \u201cdefining feature\u201d of the equity market in 2023.\nBut as dramatic as this performance has been \u2013 and although they\u2019re all essentially tech companies \u2013 don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking they\u2019re all the same. In fact, the outlook for the magnificent seven next year is mixed, particularly in light of expected changes in their core markets.\nRising competition in the EV market\nLet\u2019s start with the bad news first. Electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla Motors will continue to lose market share in 2024. While chief executive Elon Musk has been dealing with advertising problems on X (formerly Twitter), one of his other businesses, over the first three quarters of this year, Tesla has seen its US market dominance shrink from 62% to just over 50% of the market. Both BMW Group and Mercedes-Benz Cars have expanded their footprints. \nAnd over the next few years, the growing global heft of Chinese manufacturers looks hard to beat. Chinese EV players such as BYD, Nio, Wuling and Xpeng produced almost 60% of the world\u2019s EVs in 2022 \u2013 and they have been doing so in a very affordable manner. In the first half of 2023, the average cost of an EV in China was US$33,000 (\u00a326,040), more than half the US$70,700 (\u00a355,800) people pay for EVs in Europe and the US$72,000 (\u00a356,800) paid in the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nUS president Joe Biden has proposed strict new car pollution controls that will require almost two-thirds of new cars sold in the US to be electric by 2032. But the cost of EVs will need to come down if they are to achieve mass market appeal. \n\n\n\nA Tesla Model S.\ncanadianPhotographer56/Shutterstock\n\n\nSunny outlook for cloud computing\nMagnificent seven members Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet make up two-thirds of the cloud computing market, which will continue to grow in 2024, although perhaps not quite as much as in the past. \nStill, the market for cloud infrastructure services is expected to expand from US$122 billion in 2023 to US$446 billion by 2032. In particular, concerns about the macroeconomic environment have seen some customers focus on using the cloud more to reduce costs in recent years, although this has yet to have any meaningful impact on revenues.\nAnd for Amazon in particular, there are some niggling questions around its outlook. Although its cloud business remains solid, its original e-commerce business has seen growing competition recently, notably from rival retail giant Walmart, which is eating into its business in the US.\nThis is one reason why holding Amazon shares provided an annual return over the past two years of -16.7%, as of early December, according to my calculations.\nUnstoppable AI\nAlso linked to the cloud computing industry, California-based chip maker Nvidia Corporation has been the runaway success of the magnificent seven this year. This is all thanks to its dominance in processing AI workloads on the cloud. The majority of cloud players use Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs). \nBut while its two-year return of 43.3% is the most impressive of the seven tech companies, there are competitors on the horizon that could nibble away at some market share.\nNvidia\u2019s nearest rival AMD drew attention with its latest chip offering in 2023 \u2013 it\u2019s betting the market will be worth US$400 billion by 2027. A number of other start-ups are also developing chips for niche AI fields.\nCan Nvidia maintain its dominance? If it does, its earnings will skyrocket\nalongside the growth of AI. But even if it loses some market share, the AI market will boom for years.\n\n\n\nJen-Hsun Huan, NVIDIA\u2019s founder, president and CEO.\njamesonwu1972/Shutterstock\n\n\nThe outliers\nFor those keeping track, that just leaves two final members of the magnificent seven. \nApple Inc \u2013 the world\u2019s largest company by market capitalisation \u2013 consistently delivers solid returns: 16.2% over the past two years by my calculations. At the other end of the scale, social media company Meta (owner of Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp) is the only one of the group to have shown an essentially flat stock market performance over the past two years.\nAlthough Meta\u2019s revenues and earnings have consistently beaten expectations this year, the threat of anti-trust legislation in the US and Europe hangs over the company, as does an advertising market that is bottoming out. Both of these issues could harm Meta\u2019s revenue outlook next year.\nSo, the magnificent seven have all survived to ride out of town at the end of 2023, but it\u2019s as clear as a tumbleweed rolling down a deserted main street that not all of them are in for a leisurely horseback ride through 2024.

In a blog post last week, the accelerator specialist rejected the accuracy and relevance of AMD's benchmarks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Friday, AMD had responded, sharing a further set of optimized figures, claiming a performance advantage even when taking into account Nvidia's optimized software libraries and support for lower precision.\nWhy Nvidia is so worked up\nDuring AMD's launch event earlier this week, the chipmaker claimed its MI300X \u2013 that's the GPU variant of the chip \u2013 was able to achieve 40 percent lower latency than the H100 when inferencing Meta's Llama 2 70 billion parameter model.\nThe problem, according to Nvidia, is AMD's benchmarks don't take advantage of its optimized software or the H100's support for FP8 data types, and were instead conducted using vLLM at FP16. Generally speaking, lower precision data types trade accuracy for performance. In other words, Nvidia says AMD was holding the H100 back.\n\nNvidia claims its H100 outperforms AMD's MI300X when using the chipmaker's prefered software stack and FP8 precision\n\nNvidia claims that when benchmarked using its closed source TensorRT LLM framework and FP8, the H100 is actually twice as fast as the MI300X.\nNvidia also argues that AMD is presenting the best-case scenario for performance here by using a batch size of one \u2013 in other words, by handling one inference request at a time. This, Nvidia contends, is unrealistic as most cloud providers will trade latency for larger batch sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Nvidia's optimized software stack, it says a DGX H100 node with eight accelerators is able to handle a batch size of 14 in the time it takes a similarly equipped node with eight of AMD's MI300X to handle one.\nSemiAnalysis chief analyst Dylan Patel agrees that single batch latency is a \"pointless\" metric. However, he does see Nvidia's blog post as an admission that AMD's latest accelerators have it spooked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nvidia is clearly threatened by the performance of AMD's MI300X and volume orders from their two largest customers, Microsoft and Meta,\" he told The Register. \"In gaming, Nvidia hasn't compared themselves so openly to AMD in multiple generations because AMD is not competitive. They've never cared to in datacenter either when AMD racked up datacenter wins. But now, they have to fight back because AMD is winning deals in multiple clouds.\"\nAMD's rebuttal\nWithin a day of the Nvidia post going live, AMD had responded with a blog post of its own arguing that Nvidia's benchmarks aren't an apples-to-apples comparison.\nIn addition to using its own optimized software stack, AMD points out Nvidia is comparing the H100's FP8 performance against the MI300X at FP16. Every time you halve the precision you double the chip's floating point operations \u2013 so this discrepancy can't be understated.\nMI300X does support FP8. vLLM, which was used in AMD's testing, however, doesn't support the data type yet, so for inferencing on the MI300X we're stuck with FP16 benchmarks for now.\nFinally, AMD called out Nvidia for inverting AMD's performance data from relative latency to absolute throughput.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the AMD blog post didn't address Nvidia's criticism regarding single batch latencies, a spokesperson told The Register this is standard practice.\n\"Batch size 1 is the standard when measuring the lowest latency performance and max batch size is used to highlight the highest throughput performance. When measuring throughput, we typically set batch to max size that fits within a customer's SLA.\"\nThe spokesperson added that AMD's launch day performance claims did include throughput performance at \"max batch size\" for the 176 billion parameter Bloom model. In that case, AMD claimed a 1.6x advantage over Nvidia's H100, but as we'll get to later a lot of that is down to MI300X's more robust memory configuration.\n\nEven when using Nvidia's prefered software stack, AMD says its MI300X is 30 percent more performant in FP16 AI inference\n\nIn addition to picking apart Nvidia's blog post and performance claims, AMD presented updated performance figures that take advantage of new optimizations.\u00a0\"We have made a lot of progress since we recorded data in November that we used at our launch event,\" the post read.\nAMD claimed these improvements boosted the MI300X's latency lead in Llama 2 70B from 1.4x to 2.1x when using the common vLLM framework at FP16 accuracy.\nEven using Nvidia's TensorRT-LLM framework on the H100-equipped node, AMD claimed the MI300X platform still offers a 30 percent improvement in latency at FP16.\nAnd even when pitting MI300X at FP16 against the H100 at FP8 and Nvidia's preferred software stack, AMD claimed to be able to achieve comparable performance.\nNvidia didn't directly address our questions regarding AMD's most recent blog post, directing us instead to its GitHub page for details on key benchmarks.\nSoftware's growing role in AI\nNvidia and AMD's benchmarking spat highlights a couple of important factors \u2013 including the role software libraries and frameworks play in boosting AI performance.\nOne of Nvidia's chief arguments is that by using vLLM rather than TensorRT-LLM, the H100 was put at a disadvantage.\nAnnounced back in September and released in late October, TensorRT-LLM is a combination of software functions including a deep learning compiler, optimized kernels, pre- and post-processing steps, as well as multi-GPU and multi-node communication primitives.\nUsing the optimized software, Nvidia claimed it was able to effectively double the H100's inferencing performance when running the six billion parameter GPT-J model. Meanwhile, in Llama 2 70B, Nvidia claimed a 77 percent performance uplift.\nAMD made similar claims with the launch of its ROCm 6 framework earlier this month. The chipmaker claimed its latest AI framework was able to achieve between 1.3x and 2.6x improvement in LLM performance thanks to optimizations to vLLM, HIP Graph, and Flash Attention.\nCompared to the MI250X running on ROCm 5, AMD argued the MI300X running on the new software framework was 8x faster.\nBut while software as an enabler of performance shouldn't be overlooked, hardware remains a major factor \u2013 as evidenced by a push toward faster, larger capacity memory configurations on current and upcoming accelerators.\nAMD's memory advantage\nAt both FP8 and FP16m AMD's MI300X holds about a 30 percent performance advantage over the H100. However, AI inferencing workloads are complex and performance depends on a variety of factors including FLOPS, precision, memory capacity, memory bandwidth, interconnect bandwidth, and model size \u2013 to name just a few.\nAMD's biggest advantage isn't floating point performance \u2013 it's memory. The MI300X's high bandwidth memory (HBM) is 55 percent faster, offering 5.2TB/sec, and it has more than twice the capacity at 192GB, compared to the H100's 80GB.\nThis is important for AI inferencing, because the size of the model is directly proportional to the amount of memory required to run it. At FP16 you're looking at 16 bits or 2 bytes per parameter. So for Llama 70B you'd need about 140GB plus room for KV Cache, which helps to accelerate inference workloads, but requires additional memory.\nSo at FP16, AMD's MI300X automatically has an advantage, since the entire model can fit within a single accelerator's memory with plenty of room left over for KV Cache. The H100 on the other hand is at a disadvantage since the model needs to be distributed across multiple accelerators.\nAt FP8, on the other hand, Llama 2 70B only requires about 70GB of the H100's 80GB memory. While it is possible to fit a 70 billion parameter model into a single H100's memory, Patel notes that it leaves very little room for KV Cache. This, he explains, severely limits the batch size \u2013 the number of requests that can be served.\nAnd from Nvidia's blog post, we know the chipmaker doesn't consider a batch size of one to be realistic.\nAt a system level, this is particularly apparent \u2013 especially looking at larger models like the the 176 billion parameter Bloom model highlighted in AMD's performance claims.\nAMD's MI300X platform can support systems with up to eight accelerators for a total of 1.5TB of HBM. Nvidia's HGX platform meanwhile tops out at 640GB. As SemiAnalysis noted in its MI300X launch coverage, at FP16, Bloom needs 352GB of memory \u2013 leaving AMD more memory for larger batch sizes.\n\nAWS unveils core-packed Graviton4 and beefier Trainium accelerators for AI\nWhen it comes to AMD's latest AI chips, it's follow the money and the memory\nIntel wants to run AI on CPUs and says its 5th-gen Xeons are ones to do it\nAMD slaps together a silicon sandwich with MI300-series APUs, GPUs to challenge Nvidia's AI empire\n\nH200 and Gaudi3 on the horizon\nIf you need more evidence that memory is the limiting factor here, just look at Nvidia's next-gen GPU, the H200. The part is due out in the first quarter of the new year and will boast 141GB of HBM3e good for 4.8TB/sec of bandwidth.\nIn terms of FLOPS, however, the chip doesn't offer any tangible performance uplift. Digging into the spec sheet shows identical performance to the H100 it replaces.\nDespite this, Nvidia claims the H200 will deliver roughly twice the inferencing performance in Llama 2 70B compared to the H100.\nWhile the MI300X still has more memory and bandwidth than the H200, the margins are far narrower.\n\"Customers choose the Nvidia full-stack AI platform for its unmatched performance and versatility. We deliver continual performance increases through innovation across every layer of our technology stack, which includes chips, systems and software,\" a spokesperson told The Register.\nTo this end, the H200 isn't Nvidia's only GPU due early next year. The reigning GPU champ recently made the switch to a yearly release cadence for accelerators and networking equipment beginning with the B100 in 2024.\nAnd while we don't know much about the chip yet, it's safe to assume it'll be even faster and better tuned for AI workloads than its predecessor.\nIt's a similar story for Intel's upcoming Gaudi3 accelerators. Intel hasn't shared much about Habana Lab's third-gen chips, but we do know it'll boast memory bandwidth 1.5x that of its predecessor. The chip will also double the networking and is said to offer 4x the brain float 16 (BF16) performance. The latter is a particularly strange claim, since Intel won't tell us what Gaudi2's BF16 performance actually was \u2013 preferring to talk about real-world performance.\nIntel declined our offer to weigh in on its competitors' benchmarking shenanigans. In any case, AMD's MI300X won't just have to compete with Nvidia in the new year. \u00ae \nGet our Tech Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n

CentersNext-Gen Data CentersAMD Takes On Nvidia with New GPU for AIAMD Takes On Nvidia with New GPU for AIAMD Takes On Nvidia with New GPU for AIAMD introduces two new data center processors for AI and HPC workloads with support from Microsoft Azure, Meta, Oracle Cloud, Dell, HPE and others.Wylie Wong, Chips and Hardware WriterDecember 6, 20236 Min ReadAMD President Dr. Lisa Su presents the new AMD Instinct MI300X accelerator.AMDAMD today announced the availability of AMD Instinct MI300X, a new powerful data center GPU that the company hopes will grab market share from Nvidia in the lucrative AI chip market.The MI300X GPU, designed for cloud providers and enterprises, is built for generative AI applications and outperforms Nvidia\u2019s H100 GPU in two key metrics: memory capacity and memory bandwidth, which enables AMD to deliver comparable AI training performance and significantly higher AI inferencing performance, AMD executives said. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s the highest performance accelerator in the world for generative AI,\u201d said AMD CEO Lisa Su at the company\u2019s \u201cAdvancing AI\u201d event in San Jose, Calif. today.AMD today also announced the availability of AMD Instinct MI300A, an integrated \u00a0CPU and GPU chip that the company calls an accelerated processing unit (APU). It is designed for high-performance computing (HPC) and AI workloads, and is optimized for performance and energy-efficiency, the company said. \u00a0Analysts say AMD has introduced competitive AI chips and has good potential for making inroads into the market, particularly with Nvidia struggling to meet the enormous demand for its popular H100 GPU because of supply chain constraints. Nvidia currently dominates with more than 70% of the AI chip market, according to analyst firm Omdia.Related:AMD's AI Optimism Helps Investors Look Past Tepid Forecast\u201cAMD is taking advantage of Nvidia\u2019s inability to fully meet the needs of the market,\u201d says Matt Kimball, vice president and principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. \u201cNvidia can\u2019t make them fast enough. They literally have backlogs that go quarters long of customers that want the H100. AMD comes along and says, \u2018guess what? We have a competitive product.\u2019 And AMD is doing it through better performance and what I believe will be better price/performance.\u201dAMD did not announce pricing for the MI300X. But the H100 often costs more than $30,000.Kimball expects AMD will see success with the new MI300 Series processors \u2013 and so does AMD, which expects strong sales. During AMD\u2019s third quarter earnings call on Oct. 31, Su said data center GPU revenue will exceed $2 billion in 2024 and that the MI300 line will be the fastest product to ramp to $1 billion in sales in AMD history.Kimball said he doesn\u2019t doubt that AMD will reach that sales goal \u201cbecause there is such a hunger for GPUs for AI.\u201d\u201cThere are two factors going on: people don\u2019t want to wait for Nvidia, and the industry doesn\u2019t want to be locked into Nvidia,\u201d he said. \u201cSo both these factors are going to accelerate the adoption of the MI300 among hyperscalers and within the enterprise.\u201dAI: Transformational, But Will Require Infrastructure InvestmentsDuring her speech today, Su said AI is the single most transformational technology over the past 50 years. \u201cMaybe the only thing that has been close has been the introduction of the internet, but what\u2019s different about AI is that the adoption rate is much, much faster,\u201d she said.Last year, AMD estimated that the data center AI accelerated market would grow 50% over the next few years, from $30 billion in 2023 to $150 billion in 2027. Today, she updated that prediction, saying the data center accelerator market will grow more than 70% annually over the next four years and reach more than $400 billion in 2027.\"The key to all of this is generative AI,\" Su said. \"It requires a significant investment in new infrastructure. And that's to enable training and all of the inference that's needed. And that market is just huge.\u201dMore Details on the MI300X and MI300AThe MI300 Series of processors, which AMD calls \u201caccelerators,\u201d was first announced nearly six months ago when Su detailed the chipmaker\u2019s strategy for AI computing in the data center.AMD has built momentum since then. Today\u2019s announcement that MI300X and MI300A are shipping and in production comes with widespread industry support from large cloud companies such as Meta, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud and hardware makers such as Dell, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro.The AMD Instinct MI300X GPU, powered by the new AMD CDNA 3 architecture, offers 192 GB of HBM3 memory capacity, which is 2.4 times more than Nvidia\u2019s H100\u2019s 80 GB of HBM3 memory capacity. The M1300X reaches 5.3 TB/s peak memory bandwidth, which is 1.6 times more than Nvidia\u2019s H100\u2019s 3.3 TB/s.In a media briefing before today\u2019s AMD event, Brad McCredie, AMD\u2019s corporate vice president of data center GPU, said the MI300X GPU will still have more memory bandwidth and memory capacity than Nvidia\u2019s next-generation H200 GPU, which is expected next year.When Nvidia announced plans for the H200 in November, it said the H200 will feature 141 GB of HBM3 memory and 4.8 TB/s of memory bandwidth.Moving forward, McCredie expects fierce competition between the two companies on the GPU front.\u201cWe do not expect (Nvidia) to stand still. We know how to go fast, too,\u201d he said. \u201cNvidia has accelerated their roadmap once, recently. We fully expect them to keep pushing hard. We\u2019re going to keep pushing hard, so we fully expect to stay ahead. They may leapfrog. We\u2019ll leapfrog back.\u201dThe AMD Instinct MI300A APU, built with AMD CDNA 3 GPU cores and the latest AMD Zen 4 x86-based CPU cores, offers 128GB of HBM3 memory. When compared to the previous generation M250X processor, the MI300A offers 1.9 times more performance per watt on HPC and AI workloads, the company said.\u201cAt the node level, the MI300A has twice the HPC performance-per-watt of the nearest competitor,\u201d said Forrest Norrod, executive vice president and general manager of AMD\u2019s data center solutions business group, during today\u2019s AMD event. \u201cCustomers can thus fit more nodes in their overall facility power budget and better support their sustainability goals.\u201dThe Energy Department\u2019s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is using MI300A APUs to build its El Capitan supercomputer, which will surpass speeds of more than 2 exaflops per second and will become the nation\u2019s third exascale supercomputer when it debuts in 2024.AMD Beefs Up Software EcosystemTo increase adoption of the new MI300 Series chips, AMD today announced enhancements to its software ecosystem. The company announced ROCm 6, the latest version of its open-source software stack. ROCm 6 \u2013 which is a layer of software for GPUs to support computational workloads \u2013 has been optimized for generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), the company said.ROCm 6 software, paired with MI300 Series accelerators, will deliver an eight times performance improvement when compared with ROCm 5 and the previous generation MI250 accelerator, the company said.Cloud and Hardware Maker SupportDuring the AMD event, executives from hyperscalers and hardware vendors announced plans to include the MI300 Series accelerators in their offerings.For example, Microsoft today said its new Azure virtual machine offering powered by MI300X is available in preview today. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure plans to offer MI300X-based bare metal instances for AI. And Meta said it is adding MI300X to its data centers to power AI inferencing workloads.On the hardware front, Dell unveiled the Dell PowerEdge XE9680 server, featuring eight MI300 Series accelerators. HPE, Lenovo and Supermicro also announced it will support MI300 Series accelerators in its product portfolios.About the AuthorWylie WongChips and Hardware WriterWylie Wong is a journalist and freelance writer specializing in technology, business and sports.

Allgood said she left because Nvidia \"wasn't willing to lead in an area that was very important to me.\"\n\nTsado, a former product-marketing manager at Nvidia, said he wanted Huang to understand the importance of the issue.\"We're building these tools, and I'm looking at them, and I'm thinking, this is not going to work for me because I'm Black,'' he said.In the meeting, which Allgood described as the \"most devastating 45 minutes of my professional life\" in a post on LinkedIn, the two former presidents of the company's Black employees group warned that the unforeseen impacts of the new technology would be disproportionately felt by minority groups, Bloomberg reported. The duo spent a year collecting employee concerns about AI, the report said.\n\nAllgood told the outlet she raised concerns that AI facial-recognition systems used in self-driving-car technology could pose a threat to minorities, with studies suggesting some facial-recognition technologies have more difficulty identifying people of color.She said Huang pushed back on this, replying that self-driving vehicles could be tested on highways where they would pose less of a threat to pedestrians.Self-driving technology has come under increased scrutiny in recent months following a grisly accident involving a Cruise robotaxi in San Francisco.\n\nIn the weeks after the crash, which led to Cruise recalling its entire fleet of autonomous vehicles, reports suggested the driverless-car company's technology had difficulty identifying children and large holes in the past.Similar concerns have been raised around AI and minorities. The biased nature of many of the huge datasets that AI models are trained on has meant that some have shown discriminatory behavior.In 2015, Google faced backlash after its image recognition systems were found to classify Black people as \"Gorillas\" \u2014 an issue it fixed by blocking it from identifying gorillas altogether.\n\nMore recently, AI image generators such as OpenAI's DALL-E have been found to perpetuate harmful stereotypes when prompted for images of \"African workers.\"Nvidia is a vital part of the AI arms raceNvidia has seen its share price soar as a result of the AI revolution, with tech companies clamoring for its graphics-processing units, or GPUs, that are crucial for training AI models.A company spokesperson told Bloomberg the chipmaker had undertaken substantial work to make its AI products safe and inclusive since Allgood and Tsado departed.\n\nHuang did appear to give the green light to some of the proposals suggested by Allgood in internal emails viewed by Bloomberg, and the company has now established an AI & Legal Ethics program.But the chipmaker continues to lag behind other tech companies in diversity. Of its US workforce, 7.8% is Black, Hispanic, or Native American, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, compared with 18% at its rival Intel, for example.Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, made outside normal working hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider\n      subscribers.

This is exactly what Nvidia does: it not only pre-purchases TSMC's wafer capacity and packaging capacity, but it also secures the supply of HBM3 memory.\u00a0Korean publication\u00a0Chosun Biz\u00a0reports that the company pre-purchased over $1.3 billion of HBM3 memory from Micron and SK Hynix.According to the publication's conversations with industry insiders, Nvidia has made upfront payments ranging from 700 billion to 1 trillion Korean won (about $540 to $770 million) to\u00a0Micron and SK Hynix. While\u00a0there is no specific information about the designation of the payments, which could range between $1.080 billion and $1.54 billion, it is widely\u00a0speculated within the industry that\u00a0the purpose of the payments is to\u00a0ensure a steady supply of HBM3E\u00a0memory for its upcoming 2024\u00a0AI and HPC\u00a0GPU releases.Nvidia is ramping up two products featuring HBM3E memory: the H200 AI and HPC GPU featuring 141GB of HBM3E and the GH200 platform featuring a Grace CPU and an H200 GPU outfitted with 141GB of HBM3E memory. Both devices will be popular and require a tremendous amount of memory, so buying in advance makes a lot of sense for Nvidia.\u00a0In fact, it is not uncommon for GPU makers to pre-purchase expensive memory products from their suppliers as it is easier to sell advanced GPUs with memory, particularly to smaller graphics card makers. In the case of AI and HPC GPUs used for computing, Nvidia tends to sell the finished PCIe cards and SXM modules rather than just the GPU die, so it makes sense for Nvidia to procure the HBM3E, too.Keeping in mind that Nvidia's AI and HPC GPUs are sold out for quarters to come, the company needs to ensure a steady supply of memory for its H100, H200, GH200, and other products that use HBM3 or HBM3E.It remains to be seen if Micron, SK Hynix, and Samsung will have enough capacity to supply HBM3 and HBM3E memory to other developers of AI and HPC solutions, such as AMD, AWS, and Intel. If they do not, Nvidia will be able to strengthen its position further in the growing AI hardware market in 2024.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (0)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

            "response": "\n\n\nAMD Launches Instinct MI300 AI Chips To Challenge Nvidia With Backing From Microsoft, Dell And HPE | CRN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Launches Instinct MI300 AI Chips To Challenge Nvidia With Backing From Microsoft, Dell And HPE\nThe MI300 chips\u2014which are also getting support from Lenovo, Supermicro and Oracle\u2014represent AMD\u2019s biggest challenge yet to Nvidia\u2019s AI computing dominance. It claims that the MI300X GPUs, which are available in systems now, come with better memory and AI inference capabilities than Nvidia\u2019s H100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD said its newly launched Instinct MI300X data center GPU exceeds Nvidia\u2019s flagship H100 chip in memory capabilities and surpasses it in key AI performance metrics.\nBut while the company said the chip provides the same training performance for a large language model, its improved memory capabilities will enable big cost savings compared to its rival.\nThe chip designer announced the launch of the Instinct MI300X alongside its CPU-GPU hybrid chip, the Instinct MI300A data center APU, at a Thursday event in San Jose, Calif., in its biggest challenge yet to Nvidia\u2019s dominance of the AI computing space.\n[Related: LLM Startup Embraces AMD GPUs, Says ROCm Has \u2018Parity\u2019 With Nvidia\u2019s CUDA]\n\u201cIt\u2019s the highest performance accelerator in the world for generative AI,\u201d AMD CEO Lisa Su said of the MI300X in her keynote at the event.\nThe MI300X will go in servers from several OEMs, including Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro. Dell said its MI300X servers are available today while other vendors are expected to release their designs over the next several months.\nThe third generation in AMD\u2019s Instinct data center GPU family, the MI300X will also power upcoming virtual machine instances from Microsoft Azure and bare metal instances from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\nOther cloud service providers planning to support the MI300X include Aligned, Akron Energy, Cirrascale, Crusoe and Denvr Dataworks.\nThe MI300A, on the other hand, will go into servers arriving next year from HPE, Supermicro, Gigabyte and Atos subsidiary Eviden.\nAMD also announced the release of its ROCm 6 GPU programming platform, which it promotes as an \u201copen\u201d alternative to Nvidia\u2019s CUDA platform.\nThe latest version of the platform comes with advanced optimizations for large language models, updated libraries to improve performance and expanded support for a variety of frameworks, AI models and machine learning pipelines.\nThe chip designer launched the new Instinct chips as Nvidia experiences significant demand for its GPUs to power AI workloads, particularly large language models and other types of generative AI models.\nHigh demand for Nvidia\u2019s most powerful GPUs such as the H100 has resulted in shortages, prompting businesses to look for alternatives, including those from the AI chip giant\u2019s rivals.\nInstinct MI300X Specs And Performance Metrics\nThe Instinct MI300X is based on the CDNA 3 architecture, the third generation of AMD\u2019s GPU architecture purpose-built for AI and HPC workloads in the data center.\nBut while AMD is putting a greater emphasis on workloads at the convergence of HPC and AI for the MI300A, the company believes the MI300X will have greater appeal for training and running inference on large language models such as Meta\u2019s open-source Llama 2 family.\nIt comes with 192GB of HBM3 high-bandwidth memory, which is 2.4 times higher than the 80GB HBM3 capacity of Nvidia\u2019s H100 SXM GPU from 2022. It\u2019s also higher than the 141GB HBM3e capacity of Nvidia\u2019s recently announced H200, which lands in the second quarter of next year.\nThe MI300X\u2019s memory bandwidth is 5.3 TB/s, which is 60 percent higher than the 3.3 TB/s capacity of the H100 and also greater than the 4.8 TB/s capacity of the H100.\nBut whereas the SXM form factor of the H100 requires 700 watts of power, the MI300X is slightly more demanding with a power envelope of 750 watts.\nIn terms of HPC performance, AMD said the MI300X can achieve up to 163.4 teraflops for matrix operations with double-precision floating point math, also known as FP64. For FP64 vector operations, the chip can hit 81.7 teraflops. These figures represent a 2.4 increase over Nvidia\u2019s H100.\nFor single-precision floating point math, also known as FP32, the MI300X can hit 163.4 teraflops for both matrix and vector operations. The chip\u2019s vector performance is 2.4 times greater than what the H100 can achieve, according to AMD. It added that the H100 is not capable of FP32 tensor operations, so there is no comparison for matrix operations.\nAs for key AI performance metrics, AMD said the MI300X is 30 percent faster than the H100 for TensorFloat-32 or TF32 (653.7 teraflops), half-precision floating point or FP16 (1307.4 teraflops), brain floating point or BFLOAT16 (1307.4 teraflops), 8-bit floating point or FP8 (2614.9 teraflops), and 8-bit integer or INT8 (2614.9 teraflops)\nWhen it comes to performance for the most common large language model kernels, the MI300X is slightly faster than the H100, according to AMD.\nFor the kernel of Meta\u2019s 70-billion-parameter Llama 2 model, the MI300x is 20 percent faster for the medium kernel and 10 percent faster for the large kernel. For Flash Attention 2, the MI300X is 10 percent faster for the medium kernel and 20 percent faster for the large kernel.\n\u201cWhat this means is the performance at the kernel level actually directly translates into faster results,\u201d Su said.\nInstinct MI300X Platform And System-Level Performance\nAMD plans to make the MI300X available to OEMs in the Instinct MI300X Platform, which will consist of eight MI300X chips, provide roughly 10.4 petaflops of peak FP16 or BF16 performance, offer 1.5TB of HBM3 and about 896 GB/s of Infinity Fabric bandwidth.\nThat gives the MI300X Platform 2.4 times greater memory capacity, 30 percent more compute power and similar bi-directional bandwidth compared to Nvidia\u2019s H100 HGX platform, according to AMD.\nThe MI300X Platform also supports PCIe Gen 5 with a bandwidth of up to 128 GB/s, a maximum of 400 gigabit Ethernet and 440 GB/s of single node ring bandwidth, which the company said is comparable to the H100 HGX platform.\nFor training the 30-billion-parameter MPT model, AMD said MI300X Platform offers the same throughput as the H100 HGX for tokens per second.\nBut for inference performance of large language models on a single eight-GPU server, the MI300X offers a clearer advantage against the H100, AMD said.\nFor the 176-billion-parameter Bloom model, the chip offers 60 percent higher throughput. For the 70B Llama 2 model, it offers 40 percent lower chat latency.\nWhile Su said the MI300X Platform offers the same throughput for training a large language model like the 176B Bloom model, its real advantage comes from improved memory capabilities.\nHigher memory capacity and bandwidth allows the MI300X Platform to run twice as many models and double the model size compared to the H100 HGX platform, according to Su.\n\u201cThis directly translates into lower [capital expenditures], and especially if you don\u2019t have enough GPUs, this is really, really helpful,\u201d Su said.\nAMD said the platform is an industry-standard design that will allow OEMs to \u201cdesign-in MI300X accelerators into existing AI offerings and simplify deployment and accelerate adoption of AMD Instinct accelerator-based servers.\u201d\nInstinct MI300A Specs And Performance Metrics\nShipping in volume today, the Instinct MI300A is what AMD is calling the \u201cworld\u2019s first data center APU for HPC and AI.\u201d APU is the company\u2019s nomenclature for a chip that combines CPU cores and GPU cores on the same die, and it has been relegated to processors for PCs until now.\nThe MI300A contains the same x86-based Zen 4 cores that power AMD\u2019s latest Ryzen and EPYC processors. Those cores are combined with GPU cores based on AMD\u2019s new CDNA 3 architecture as well as 128GB of HBM3 memory, which is 60 percent higher than the H100\u2019s 80GB HBM3 capacity but lower than the 141GB HBM3e capacity of the H200 arriving next year.\nThe chip\u2019s memory bandwidth is the same as the MI300X at 5.3 TB/s.\nServer vendors can configure the MI300A\u2019s thermal design power between 550 watts and 760 watts. The H100, by contrast, is 700 watts.\nIn terms of HPC performance, AMD said the MI300A can achieve up to 122.6 teraflops for FP64 matrix operations. For FP64 vector operations, the chip can hit 61.3 teraflops. These figures represent an 80 percent increase over the H100, according to AMD.\nFor FP32 math, the MI300A can hit 122.6 teraflops for both matrix and vector operations. The chip\u2019s vector performance is 80 percent higher than the H100, according to AMD.\nAs for AI performance, AMD said the MI300A provides almost the same performance but slightly worse than the H100 for TF32 (490.3 teraflops), FP16 (980.6 teraflops), BFLOAT16 (980.6 teraflops), FP8 (1961.2 teraflops), and INT8 (1961.2 teraflops).\nBut while the MI300A has less GPU compute power than the MI300X, AMD said it shines when it comes to energy efficiency, shared memory between the chip\u2019s CPU and GPU cores, an easily programmable GPU platform and \u201cfast AI training.\u201d\n\u201cThe key advantage of the APU is no longer needing to copy data from one processor to another because the memory is unified, both in the in the RAM as well as in the cache,\u201d said Forrest Norrod, executive vice president and general manager of AMD\u2019s data center solutions business unit.\nAMD demonstrated the MI300A\u2019s energy efficiency prowess by comparing it to Nvidia\u2019s GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, which combines an Arm-based CPU and its H200 GPU on a module. The company said the MI300A offers two times greater peak HPC performance.\n\u201cThe second advantage is the ability to optimize power management between the CPU and the GPU. That means dynamically shifting power from one processor to another, depending on the needs of the workload, optimizing application performance,\u201d Norrod said.\nThe company also showed the benefit of combining unified memory with high memory bandwidth and GPU performance using the HPC benchmark OpenFOAM, for which the MI300A, configured at 550 watts, provides four times faster performance than the H100.\nAcross other HPC benchmarks, the 550-watt MI300A is 20 percent faster on MINI- NBODY, 10 percent faster on HPCG and 10 percent faster on GROMACS, according to AMD.\nAMD did not provide details on the platform OEMs will use to integrate MI300A chips into servers.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Part One set out the debate in neoclassical terms between the elders would slow down AI and the young who would speed it up. Part Two shared the story of the visionary herald of AI. Ray Kurzweil: Google\u2019s prophet of superintelligent AI who will not slow down. In Part Three we share the story of Jen-Hsun \u201cJensen\u201d Huang, the CEO and founder of NVIDIA, the U.S. chip manufacturer that makes super AI possible.\nNVIDIA, now valued at over $1.3 Trillion, designs and builds new types of specialized, super-fast, neural net imitating chips. Jen-Hsun Huang, who now goes by Jensen Huang, faced great adversity as a nine-year old immigrant. He overcame these challenges to start Nvidia twenty years later. Jensen fears business failure, not AI, which he knows like the back of his hand. All the leading AI software companies like OpenAI and Google need his hardware for their LLM software to work. He and his scientist and engineers at Nvidia know more about what is going on in the AI industry that anyone. Here is Nvidia\u2019s 2023 marketing video that shows what they do.

Short music video explanation of the company.\n\n\n\nNvidia helps all other companies to manufacture intelligence. So when Jensen Huang predicted on November 30, 2023, that AGI would be attained in five years, 2028, a year before Kurzweil\u2019s prediction, the whole world took notice. Watch him make this prediction in the video below when he answered a question by New York Times reporter, Andrew Sorkin, at the November 30, 2023, NY Times Deal Book Summit.

Excerpt from NYT video: Jensen Huang of Nvidia on the Future of A.I. | DealBook Summit 2023..https://youtu.be/vX05P7lQdcQ\n\n\n\n \nAs will be shown in this article, Jensen Huang also supports reasonable product regulation and safety certification, in the manner that has already been done successfully with other potentially dangerous products, such as aviation and automobiles. He also describes how AGI will increase and improve employment, and bring greater prosperity to all willing to learn.\n \nThe Incredible Story and Character of Jensen Huang\nJensen himself is a very impressive person with a rags to riches immigrant story that reads like a graphic novel. Jensen recently revealed new details of his story to Stephen Witt, author of the The New Yorker article. How Jensen Huang\u2019s Nvidia Is Powering the A.I. Revolution, (The New Yorker, 11/27/23). Born in 1973 in Taiwan as Jen-Hsun Huang, his parents soon moved to Thailand. Due to the dangers caused by the dramatic end of the Vietnam War, his parents were forced to send him and his older brother, alone, to an uncle in the U.S.\nThey made it through immigration somehow, but the uncle sent Jen-Hsun Huang, age nine, and his brother, away to what he thought it was a good, private, yet surprisingly affordable boarding school. Wrong. It was actually a notorious reform school in rural Kentucky, a living hell for anyone sent there. It was especially bad for these two undersized Asian immigrants with long hair and heavily accented English.\n\n\n\nTwo happy Asian kids arrive at a reform school right off the boat thinking it\u2019s an exclusive private boarding school in Kentucky. Image depicted in graphic novel style using Visual Muse by Ralph Losey.\n\n\n\nThey had been taught a kind of English by their mother, who did not actually speak or even understand the language, but she had a book, from which she would pick ten random words every day for them to learn. The Huang boys in the back woods of Kentucky were perfect targets at a school for juvenile delinquents. In the New Yorker interview Jen-Hsun admitted that he was at first attacked daily, even stabbed. Knife attacks were common in this religious reform school in Kentucky where many were illiterate, and all smoked cigarettes, except for the Huangs. He and his older brother were subject to constant ethnic slurs, harassment and bullying, often life threatening. Jen-Hsun survived. Little Huang used his wits and he exercised. He eventually did one hundred push-ups every night and learned how to defend himself. He also helped other kids with homework.\nIn an earlier interview with Stratechery, Jen-Hsun said he was nine and brother eleven when they arrived and they were happy to be there. But he did admit that his brother was forced to work on tobacco farms and that he was forced to clean bathrooms, alone and unpaid. You\u2019d have to call it child, slave labor. He thought that was normal in America, the land of opportunity. So he learned to work hard and survive bullying with a smile.\n\n\n\nLille kid forced to clean bathrooms alone thinking that was the American way. Depicted in graphic novel style using Visual Muse by Ralph Losey.\n\n\n\nTwo years or so later, his parents were able to immigrate to the United States, realized their kids\u2019 situation and rescued them. Amazingly in 2019 by then billionaire Jensen Huang donated money to the school for a new building. No hard feelings I guess. Of course, Jen-Hsun also quietly promotes Asian-American rights, where racist discrimination continues to this day throughout the United States.\n\n\n\nAsian American equal rights image portrayed in a combined graphic novel and photo realism style using Visual Muse by Ralph Losey.\n\n\n\n \nI am sure Jen-Hsun\u2019s inner strength and determination also has a lot to do with his strong family values. He and his brother must have been very happy when their father (an engineer in Taiwan) and mother were finally able to immigrate to the U.S. and rescue their sons.\n\n\n\nJen-Hsun Huang and his parents, Sidney and Maria Huang. Date unknown. Nvidia photo.\n\n\n\n \nUpon his escape from the reform school and reuniting with his parents, Jensen attended Aloha High School just outside Portland. He graduated a year early and was also a nationally ranked table-tennis player. Jensen then went to Oregon State University and graduated in 1984. He met his future wife to be there, Lori Mills, who was his lab partner. Lori graduated from Oregon in 1985, also with an electrical engineering degree. Sometime after graduation they married, and both found work in Silicon Valley as microchip designers. Jensen likes to share that Lori made more money than he did at their first engineering jobs.\nIn a few years, Lori left the workforce to raise their two children. By then, Huang was running his own division at LSI Logic and attending graduate school at Stanford at night. He earned a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 1992.\n\n\n\nJensen and Lori at Jensen\u2019s graduation. Nvidia photo.\n\n\n\n \nSeven years later, ever courageous Jensen left his comfortable job to start his own chip company, Nvidia, at age twenty-nine. Jensen loved video games and his original idea was to specialize in design and manufacture of graphics chips to make the game graphics run better. He started Nvidia with two other, older chip designer friends, Chris Malachowsky, a University of Florida graduate, my law school alma mater, and Curtis Priem. They had only $40,000 between them to start the company. They decided Jensen should be the CEO because Chris and Curtis knew he was a fast learner. This all happened at a Denny\u2019s restaurant booth, which Jensen often used at the start as an office. He had worked at Denny\u2019s in Oregon in the 1980s as a dishwasher and busboy. The rest, as they say, is history. Nvidia is now the sixth largest company in the world. How Jensen Huang\u2019s Nvidia Is Powering the A.I. Revolution.\nWith their kids now grown Lori Huang serves as the president of the Jen-Hsun and Lori Huang Foundation, supporting higher education, public health, and STEM initiatives across the U.S. Here is a photo of them in 2022 at which time they had just donated $50 Million to their alma mater, Oregon State University.\n\n\n\nLori and Jensen Huang. Oregon State photo on occasion of their donation of $50M to the school.\n\n\n\n \nHuang and NVIDIA\nAs a result of Jensen\u2019s childhood struggles as an immigrant, including life threatening attacks, he learned to thrive under grave pressure. He now has tremendous inner strength, drive and focus, along with a confident, low-key sense of humor. He literally thrives on great adversity, gets into the flow, concentrates and does his best work. This probably explains why the unofficial motto of the Nvidia is \u201cOur company is thirty days from going out of business.\u201d He used to open all of his big employees talks by saying this. It became expected. His calm, inner-warrior, super-hero persona came out in the recent NY Times, 2023 DealBook summit interview below.

Jensen Huang learned to thrive on adversity at an early age, including dangerous crossings of a rickety bridge in Kentucky. Here shown as hero saving his company using graphic novel style and Visual Muse by Ralph Losey.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJensen Huang shows\noff his Nvidia logo tattoo.\nRobert Galbraith, Reuters.\n\n \n\nJensen Huang loves his company, he even put a tattoo of the Nvidia company logo on his arm when the stock price hit 100. The stock price is now past 480. Jensen whines that he\u2019ll never get another tattoo because it hurts too much, far more than his kids said it would! Unlike other tech billionaires, Jensen Huang is still a family man. His two children now work for Nvidia.\nJensen is also unusual in that his employees all seem to love him and his hard working, self-effacing style. I am sure the great pay helps too! His witty personality shows in his hands-on, creative management style, which includes writing hundreds of very short emails every day to the fifty employees who report directly to him. That\u2019s right, fifty direct reports. This is an unprecedented number of employees to report directly to a CEO. Most corporations have six to ten direct reports. The Nvidia leaders say, without revealing any content, that his emails are very short, and poetic, like Haikus or one said, laughing, like ransom notes. The direct reports submit short lists to him every week of the five most important things they\u2019re working on. He reads each report late the same night. Then he often shows up at their offices unannounced to talk to them about it. Stephen Witt, How Jensen Huang\u2019s Nvidia Is Powering the A.I. Revolution, (The New Yorker, 11/27/23). Yes, he\u2019s a very hard worker, and he likes what he\u2019s doing now far better than cleaning toilets in a reform school.\nJensen is intense and sometimes has a temper, but is naturally affable, and due to his superintelligence, is a modest, creative-type boss. You can tell from the videos and his actions. Although Jensen Huang is now personally worth over Forty Billion Dollars, and is CEO of one of the most important Trillion Dollar corporations in the world, he still seems to be a genuine, kind-hearted person. Plus, many people, myself included, love his modest, deadpan sense of humor.\n\n\n\nJensen image in a style merging a photo with a Visual Muse graphic novel style drawing of employees laughing at his deadpan jokes by Ralph Losey.\n\n\n\nAbout the only thing bad I can say about him is that he doesn\u2019t like science fiction, but he makes up for that by his love of video games. His employees must also love and appreciate the wealth that working for Nvidia has brought. Most of his long-term employees are by now very wealthy. They keep on working anyway for love of the job, the company, its leader and its mission. By the way, Jensen does not object to remote work and Nvidia\u2019s beautiful, state of the art million square foot headquarters in Santa Clara is never full.\n\n\n\nInterior of Nvidia Headquarters. Courtesy Nvidia newsroom, Gensler \u2013 Jason O\u2019Rear photography.\n\n\n\nOn November 30, 2023, during an on-stage interview of Jensen Huang by New York Times reporter, Andrew Sorkin, Jensen revealed an important insight into his courageous character and bold business operations. Jensen Huang of Nvidia on the Future of A.I. | DealBook Summit 2023. This ties in nicely with the classical myth of young Icarus and his cautious Dad, Daedalus, that began this series on fear of AI. In truth they are both right in some respects. Plato and Young Icarus Were Right: do not heed the frightening shadow talk giving false warnings of superintelligent AI \u2013 Part One.

Image portrays naive teenager attitude of \u201cHow hard could it be?\u201d The Courage and Confidence of Youth to Fly to the Sun. Icarus and Daedalus depicted in graphic novel style using Visual Muse by Ralph Losey.\n\n\n\nThe brave character of Jensen, forged as a little kid in a fire of immigrant adversity, enabled him to boldly lead Nvidia to conceive and build a new type of computer, one that takes us into the bright fire of superintelligence. Nvidia has already been flying with these Icarus wings of AI for years. That is how Nvidia was able to reinvent computing and transform the computer industry. Nvidia used AI to design and build its supercomputers that all high-tech companies of the world now crave. In another excerpt from the excellent NYT interview, you can hear Jensen\u2019s own description of the new breakthrough heights to which Nvidia computers have flown. This is very important information here. I suggest you listen to this a few times, and moreover listen to the entire interview by Andrew Sorkin, shown on this clip.

This video excerpt of the NYT video shows Jensen Huang described the new type of computer system Nvidia is building. Excerpt from NYT\u2019s A.I. | DealBook Summit 2023.\n\n\n\n \nAs Jensen Huang says: \u201cWe are in the beginning of a brand-new generation of computing.\u201d This is the first reinvention of computing in sixty years. Jensen has touched the sun and come back to Plato\u2019s cave of old technology to share his new knowledge.\n \n\n\n\nJensen returns to Plato\u2019s cave with an AI computing device depicted in graphic novel style using Visual Muse by Ralph Losey.\n\n\n\n \nJensen is trying to tell people, \u201cEveryone is a programmer now. You just have to say something to the computer.\u201d Nvidia chief Jensen Huang says AI is creating a \u2018new computing era\u2019 (Financial Post, 5/30/23). For more details watch Huang\u2019s two hour Keynote at the 2023 Nvidia annual conference.\n \nAI Safety, Regulation and Full Employment\nJensen Huang views of safety, regulation and employment are sophisticated and convincing. They echo the thoughts of Ray Kurzweil, but they do so based on his experience as one of the most successful entrepreneurs of our era. Stephen Witt in his article, How Jensen Huang\u2019s Nvidia Is Powering the A.I. Revolution, observes and quotes Jensen, and two of his direct reports, on the subject of AI safety.\n\nHe has never worried about the (potential dangers of AI) technology, not once. \u201cAll it\u2019s doing is processing data,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many other things to worry about.\u201d . . .\nWhen I questioned them (Huang\u2019s lead AI researcher, Catanzaro, and lead software developer, Diercks) about the wisdom of creating superhuman intelligence they looked at me as if I were questioning the utility of the washing machine. I had wondered aloud if an A.I. might someday kill someone. \u201cEh, electricity kills people every year,\u201d Catanzaro said. I wondered if it might eliminate art. \u201cIt will make art better!\u201d Diercks said. \u201cIt will make you much better at your job.\u201d I wondered if someday soon an A.I. might become self-aware. \u201cIn order for you to be a creature, you have to be conscious. You have to have some knowledge of self, right?\u201d Huang said. \u201cI don\u2019t know where that could happen.\u201d\nHow Jensen Huang\u2019s Nvidia Is Powering the A.I. Revolution\nThis was also discussed in the NYT interview. Here is the relevant excerpt where Huang talks about regulation of AI as a product, like we inspect airplanes and regulate flight with the FAA. Click image or here to see the video on YouTube.\n\n\n\nHuang on AI Safety Regulations. Excerpt from NYT\u2019s A.I. | DealBook Summit 2023. Graphic novel style image of a AI product and safety testing lab using Visual Muse by Ralph Losey.\n\n\n\n \nFor more insights into Huang\u2019s reasonably cautious attitude on AI safety and regulation, we turn to the lengthy Acquired Interview of Jensen Huang in late October 2023. Here Jensen responds to questions by young podcasters related to the supposed danger of AI, especially employment loss. Jensen Huang\u2019s spontaneous, often funny language flow provides a good glimpse into how he thinks.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Acquired Interview of Jensen Huang on Safety and Jobs.\n\n\n\n\nWell, first of all we have to keep AI safe. There are a couple of different areas of AI safety that are really important. Obviously, in robotics and self-driving cars, there is a whole field of AI safety and we\u2019ve dedicated ourselves to functional safety and active safety and all kinds of different areas of safety. When to apply human in the loop, when is it ok for the human not to be in the loop. How do you get to a point where, increasingly, human doesn\u2019t have to be in the loop, but human is largely in the loop. In the case of information safety: obviously bias, false information and then appreciating the rights of artists and creators, that whole area deserves a lot of attention. You\u2019ve seen some of the work that we\u2019ve done. Instead of scraping the internet, we partnered with Getty and Shutterstock to create a commercially fair way of applying artificial intelligence in terms of AI.\nIn the area of Large Language Models and their future of increasingly greater agency AI, clearly the answer is for as longs as its sensible, and I think its going to be sensible for a long time, is human in the loop. The ability for an AI to self-learn and improve and change out in the wild in the digital form should be avoided. We should collect data, carry the data, train the model, we should test the model, validate the model, before we release it out in the world again. So human is in the loop. . . .\nWith respect to automation, my feeling is that, and we\u2019ll see, but it is more likely that AI is going to create more jobs in the near term. The question is what\u2019s the definition of near term. The reason for that is, the first thing that happens with productivity is prosperity. With prosperity, then the companies get more successful, they hire more people because they want to expand into more areas. So the question is, if you think about a company and say, if we improve the productivity then they need fewer people. Well, that\u2019s because the company has no more ideas. (interviewers laugh) But that\u2019s not true for most companies. If you become more productive and the company becomes more profitable, then, usually, they hire more people to expand into new areas. So long as we believe that there are more areas to expand into \u2013 there are more ideas in drug discoveries, more ideas in transportation, there are more ideas in retail, more ideas in entertainment, that there\u2019s more ideas in technology. So long as we believe that there are more ideas, the prosperity of the industry, which comes from improved productivity, results in hiring more people, more ideas.\nNow go back in history, we can fairly say that today\u2019s industry is larger than the world\u2019s industries a thousand years ago. The reason for that is because obviously humans have a lot of ideas. I think that there\u2019s plenty of ideas yet for prosperity and plenty of ideas that can begat from productivity improvements, and my sense if that it is likely to generate jobs. Now obviously net generation of jobs doesn\u2019t guaranty that any one human doesn\u2019t get fired. Ok. That\u2019s obviously true. It\u2019s more likely that someone will lose a job to someone else, some other human, that uses an AI. Not likely to an AI, but to some other human that uses an AI. So, I think that the first thing that everybody should do is learn how to use AIs, so that they can augment their own productivity. . . .\nI think jobs will change. My guess is that we\u2019ll actually have higher employment, we\u2019ll create more jobs. I think industries will be more productive. Many of the industries that are currently suffering from lack of labor, workforce, are likely to use AI to get themselves off their feet, and get back to growth and prosperity. So I see it a little bit differently but I do think jobs will be effected and I\u2019d just encourage everybody to learn AI.\nAcquired Interviews, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang (10/23) at 1:00:11 \u2013 1:05:20.\nSo the message here is that AI will create more jobs than it replaces, but the new jobs will require knowledge of AI and AI tools. There are many free education resources online. One good place to look that we just discovered is NVIDIA On Demand, which has many instructional videos.\n\n \nThis concludes Part Three of the Plato and Young Icarus series.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Founder and Principal Analyst,\nCambrian-AI Research LLCFollow AuthorDec 13, 2023, 06:19pm ESTShareSaveCommentAt the MI300 launch, AMD claimed it had significantly better performance than Nvidia. While the AMD chip does look good, and will probably run most AI just fine out of the box, the company did not use the fastest Nvidia software. The difference is enormous.\n\nAt a recent launch event, AMD talked about the inference performance of the H100 GPU compared to that of its MI300X chip. The results shared did not use optimized software, and the H100, if benchmarked properly, is 2x faster at a batch size of 1.\n\n\nNvidia has just released a blog that counters AMD's claim that its latest chip, the MI300X, is 40-60% faster in latency and throughput than Nvidia in inference processing for generative AI. Here is one of AMD\u2019s slides at the MI300 launch event, which we covered here.\nOne of the incorrect slides AMD shared last week.AMD\n\nBelow is from Nvidia\u2019s counterclaim. While this sort of tit-for-tat isn\u2019t what anyone wants to hear, it is massively relevant this time; all the press and analyst reporting I\u2019ve seen echo AMD\u2019s claims, which are inaccurate and misleading.\n\nThe latest results, run on software available long before AMD prepared its presentation, doubled the performance claimed by AMD. And with batching for the 2.5-second latency AMD used, a standard in the industry, Nvidia beats the MI300 by an astonishing 14-fold.\nThe latest data from Nvidia leaves no doubt as to whose GPU is the fastest.NVidia\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\nHow Could This Happen?\nIt is simple. AMD did not use Nvidia\u2019s software, which is optimized to improve performance on Nvidia hardware. \u201cThough TensorRT-LLM is freely available on GitHub, recent comparisons by AMD used alternative software that does not yet support Hopper\u2019s Transformer Engine and is missing these optimizations,\u201d said the Nvidia blog post. Additionally, AMD did not take advantage of the TensorRT-LLM software that Nvidia released in September, doubling the inference performance on LLMs, nor the Triton inference engine. No TensorRT-LLM + no Transformer Engine + No Triton = non-optimal performance.\n\n\nSince AMD has no equivalent software, it probably thought this was a better apples-t0-apples metric. These chips are expensive; I doubt anyone would not use the Nvidia software for production AI. It is free. \u201cAs LLM inference continues to grow in complexity, maximizing GPU performance on larger, increasingly sophisticated models using the latest inference software is critical to reducing cost and broadening adoption,\u201d said Nvidia\u2019s blog post.\nWhat Does This Mean?\nFirst, you can calm down if you are invested in Nvidia (stock or hardware). Nvidia remains the GPU leader. As Barron\u2019s previously reported, \u201cInvestors Don\u2019t Need to Worry.\u201d And that was published before this latest news.\nSecond, if you are interested in the MI300X, we are not saying the new GPU is a bad AI platform. It appears to be the third fastest AI chip, behind Cerebras' massive WSE CS2 (for which there are no benchmarks) and the Nvidia H100. And that is probably good enough for those seeking a more available GPU that should be reasonably priced (whatever that means; AMD did not release pricing).\nThe AI hardware market is moving extremely fast, and the H100 will soon become old news. The H200 is coming more quickly than AMD probably hopes. We note that the MI300 FLOP specs are indeed better than Nvidia H100, and the MI300 also has more HBM memory. But it takes optimized software to make any AI chip sing and translate all those flops and bytes into customer value. The AMD ROCm software has made significant progress, but AMD still has much to do.\n\"AI is moving fast. NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA ecosystem enables us to quickly and continuously optimize our stack. We look forward to continuing to improve AI performance with every update of our software,\u201d said Nvidia.\nConclusions\nWhile all this may seem like a tempest in a teapot to the uninitiated, all silicon vendors should work carefully to ensure accurate performance claims with actual data (not just normalized bar charts) and provide all the details necessary to reproduce those results. Handicapping a competitor's platform by not using the vendor's software isn't okay. That\u2019s why MLCommons has published peer-reviewed MLPerf inference and training performance benchmarks every three months for several years.\nDespite the kerfuffle, we stand by our earlier comments that AMD will sell every MI300 it can produce next year.\nWe asked AMD for a response and did not hear back.\nWhen I asked Mark Papermaster, AMD CTO, if his company planned to run these benchmarks, he said they would publish MLPerf, but did not say when. We expect AMD will address the need for optimizations before they publish, and we can\u2019t wait!\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Disclosures: This article expresses the opinions of the author, and is not to be taken as advice to purchase from nor invest in the companies mentioned.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has taken a shot at his main rival in high performance computing, dismissing Nvidia's success in providing GPUs for AI modelling as \"extraordinarily lucky.\" Gelsinger also implied that it would have been Intel, not Nvidia, currently coining it in AI hardware had the company not killed one of his pet projects nearly 15 years ago.During a broad ranging discussion at MIT, Gelsinger was asked what Intel is doing to drive the development of AI. His answer? Among other things, to point out how lucky he thinks Nvidia has been with its AI-accelerating GPUs.Discussing the emergence of GPUs as the weapon of choice for the latest large AI models, Gelsinger explained how he thinks Nvidia and its CEO, Jensen Huang, just happened to be in the right place at the right time.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nIntel nixes its next-gen AI GPU but still has plans to take on Nvidia\n\n\n\n\nBill Gates laments Pat Gelsinger's failure to save Intel: 'I was hoping for his sake, for the country's sake that he would be successful'\n\n\n\n\"Jensen worked super hard at owning throughput computing, primarily for graphics initially, and then got extraordinarily lucky,\" Gelsinger said. Gelsinger also emphasised that AI wasn't part of Nvidia's original plan for GPGPU or general purpose computing on GPUs. \"They didn't even want to support their first AI project,\" Gelsinger observed.What's more, Gelisnger also claimed things would have been very different had Intel not cancelled the Larrabee project shortly after he left for an 11-year stint outside of Intel before returning as CEO in February 2021.\"When I was pushed out of Intel 13 years ago, they killed the project that would have changed the shape of AI,\" Gelsinger said of Larrabee.Larrabee was an Intel GPU project long before its current Arc graphics cards that was intended to go head-on with Nvidia in the gaming and GPGPU markets courtesy of scores of tiny x86 CPU cores. The gaming graphics cards were cancelled in late 2009 and the rest of the Larrabee project withered thereafter.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Exactly when Nvidia really began bigging up its GPUs as tools for AI models is debatable. For sure, AI wasn't in the mix when the company first began promoting GPGPU.Here's a passage from an early Nvidia document from 2007 describing the usage and benefits of its original CUDA 1.0 platform, the software that enables high performance computing on Nvidia GPUs, beyond mere graphics and image processing.\u00a0\"Many algorithms outside the field of image rendering and processing are accelerated by data-parallel processing, from general signal processing or physics simulation to computational finance or computational biology.\"That was absolutely typical of Nvidia's messaging at the time. In other words, no mention of AI as a key application for GPGPU. To an extent, then, Gelsinger has a point.Your next machine(Image credit: Future)Best gaming PC: The top pre-built machines.\nBest gaming laptop: Great devices for mobile gaming.On the other hand, it was Nvidia that pushed GPGPU forward, that developed CUDA and Nvidia GPUs into the mighty force they are today. Nvidia might not have necessarily seen the AI revolution coming from the beginning. But the company did bet far bigger on GPUs than anybody else.So was Nvidia lucky? In part, certainly. Nvidia and Huang did not see the AI revolution coming when they first embarked on the GPGPU project. Or if they did, they conspicuously failed to mention it. But there's also a saying attributed to everyone from Founding Father Thomas Jefferson to pro golfer Gary Player that surely applies here and goes something like this: \"I\u2019m a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work the more I have of it.\"It'll be interesting to see how lucky Intel gets over the next few years of Gelsinger's leadership.\n\n\nJeremy LairdSocial Links NavigationHardware writerJeremy has been writing about technology and PCs since the 90nm Netburst era (Google it!) and enjoys nothing more than a serious dissertation on the finer points of monitor input lag and overshoot followed by a forensic examination of advanced lithography.

Thousands of companies are trying to come up with the best AI innovations.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, tech giant Nvidia is busy making a fortune selling chips to these companies for the supercomputers that power their AI programs. ChatGPT, the most popular AI in the world, was trained on a supercomputer that uses 10,000 Nvidia chips.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a war going on out there in AI, and Nvidia is the only arms dealer,\u201d according to a Wall Street analyst. So, how did Nvidia manage to do this?\u00a0\nThe magic of turning data into graphics\nNvidia was founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, three engineers fascinated with graphic processing technology.\nWhatever visuals you see on your computer, whether it is a chart, an image, a game, or a 4K video, comes to the computer in the form of data. To render this data into images, computers use graphic processing units (GPUs).\u00a0\nCPU chips like the ones made by Intel (for example, i5 and i7 processors) also have some graphic processing capabilities. Still, GPUs take it to the next level by working as a parallel chip dedicated to graphic processing.\u00a0\nThis is why, even in computers with the latest Intel processors, gamers use Nvidia GPUs so that their computers can seamlessly render high-end visual information.\u00a0\nIn the early days, Nvidia manufactured GPUs (comprising a chip, one or more fans, and some additional components such as ports) largely for those who wanted to play high-graphic video games on their computers.\u00a0\nAlong with the hardware, they also provided software (drivers) that allowed users to optimize and regulate the performance of their GPUs.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nJensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia.\n\nNVIDIA Taiwan/Wikimedia Commons \n\n\n\nIn 2006, the company also began selling chips to supercomputer users who realized that compared to CPUs, GPUs are faster and better at processing high amounts of data and performing complex calculations, which are crucial for tasks like scientific simulations and machine learning modeling.\nBy the year 2013, these developments convinced CEO Jensen Huang that GPUs could also play a significant role in powering AI solutions.\u00a0\n\u201cHe sent out an email on Friday evening saying everything is going to deep learning, and that we were no longer a graphics company. By Monday morning, we were an AI company. Literally, it was that fast,\u201d Greg Estes, vice president of marketing at Nvidia, told The New Yorker.\nIn the following years, Nvidia invested hugely in operations aimed at developing programmable GPUs.\u00a0\nWhile traditional GPUs were designed primarily for rendering graphics in video games and visual applications, programmable GPUs could be customized to perform various computational tasks beyond just graphics processing.\nIt was considered a risky move because, back then, AI was not a hotshot technology. Huang himself calls this decision a \u201cbet the company moment.\u201d\u00a0\nHighlighting the fear around Huanng\u2019s move, Bryan Catanzaro, who was working as a deep learning researcher at Nvidia, said, \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to fall into the same trap that the AI industry has had in the past. But, ten years plus down the road, he was right.\u201d\nCurrently, 50 out of the 100 biggest US tech companies buy supercomputer chips from Nvidia. \u201cWhat Nvidia is to AI is almost like what Intel was to PCs,\u201d Dan Hutcheson, a tech expert and Vice Chair at TechInsights, told BBC.\nIn the past year, Nvidia\u2019s market cap has also increased from $364 billion to $1.87 trillion, making it the sixth most valuable company in the world and the first chip-maker to cross a one trillion dollar valuation.\u00a0\nNvidia seems unbeatable in the AI game\n\nWhile big competitors AMD and Intel kept their focus on CPUs, Nvidia began selling their GPUs for deep learning to companies like Microsoft, Toyota, Google, Meta, and Baidu back in 2017.\u00a0\nAs more and more companies began to develop cloud computing, machine learning, and autonomous driving, the demand for Nvidia\u2019s GPU also surged.\u00a0\nThis is mainly because, while everyone else was working on better CPU chips (Apple, Intel), smarter chatbots (OpenAI, Meta, Google, Microsoft), and autonomous vehicle tech (Google, Tesla), Nvidia kept its focus on building the AI-compatible GPUs that were necessary to make all these technologies work.\nToday, companies such as Google, Amazon, IBM, Intel, and Meta have also developed their own AI chips. However, Nvidia is already way ahead in the race with a whopping 80 percent market share in the chip market.\u00a0\nTom Graham, CEO of Metaphysic, the AI company that created the viral Tom Cruise deepfakes in 2021, said in an interview with the BBC, \u201cThere are no alternatives to Nvidia for doing what we do. It is so far ahead of the curve.\u201d\nMoreover, in the last 10 years, a large community of AI programmers has become used to working on Nvidia GPUs. \u201cEverybody builds on Nvidia first. If you come out with a new piece of hardware, you\u2019re racing to catch up,\u201d Naveen Rao, a tech entrepreneur, told The New York Times.\nBig challenges ahead\nAlthough Nvidia is currently a leader in the AI chip market, there is no guarantee it will continue to hold this position.\u00a0\nRecently, AMD claimed that its newly-released Instinct MI300X chips are faster than Nvidia\u2019s H100 and have the potential to deliver better computational performance.\u00a0\nIntel made similar claims while launching its latest Gaudi3 computer chips this week. However, all these claims are yet to be verified by experts.\u00a0\nAnother threat to Nvidia\u2019s dominance is that, as big companies continue to make their own powerful AI chips, they are likely to get better at it, and there might come a time when they ditch Nvidia and start using their own technology.\nThis has also happened in the past. For instance, for years, Intel was the go-to chip supplier for Apple. However, by 2020, the iPhone maker decided to use its own chips in its devices, ending a 15-year-old partnership with Intel.\nGeopolitical factors also have an effect. For instance, the Biden administration doesn\u2019t want China to have easy access to American chip technology, and this is why they\u2019ve been bringing new restrictions to keep American companies from selling their chips to Chinese clients.\nThe company also suffered losses from the Ukraine conflict, as they had to completely shut down their operations in Russia.\nThey are competing with the world\u2019s biggest tech giants, many of whom are also their clients. \nHowever, nobody can predict how long these clients will continue to rely on Nvidia GPUs as everybody strives for maximum control and market share.\n\u201cNvidia is the one with the target on its back that everybody is trying to take down,\u201d Kevin Krewell, a chip expert and principal analyst at TIRIAS Research, told BBC.\nThe current status and the road ahead\nCurrently, Nvidia\u2019s H100 GPUs are considered the world\u2019s most powerful AI chip, and they\u2019ve been selling like hotcakes.\u00a0\nWhile Google and Microsoft are currently the biggest buyers of this product, the UAE and Saudi Arabian governments are also placing big orders for the H100, as these countries have plans to launch their own AI applications.\nElon Musk is also building a billion-dollar supercomputer, Dojo, reportedly set to run on H100 GPUs. During a conference call, he said, \u201cThey\u2019ve got so many customers. They\u2019ve been kind enough to, nonetheless, prioritize some of our GPU orders.\u201d\u00a0\nA market report reveals that the demand for these GPUs is so high that Nvidia sold 300,000 H100s in just the second quarter of 2023 \u2014 more than 3,000 GPUs every day.\u00a0\u00a0\nMeanwhile, the company has also been working on the H200, upcoming AI chips that will have more memory capacity and bandwidth than the H100.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia literally sells tons of its H100 AI GPUs, and each consumes up to 700W of power, which is more than the average American household. Now that Nvidia is selling its new GPUs in high volumes for AI workloads, the aggregated power consumption of these GPUs is predicted to be as high as that of a major American city. Some quick back-of-the-envelope math also reveals that the GPUs will consume more power than in some small European countries.\n\nThe total power consumption of the data centers used for AI applications today is comparable to that of the nation of Cyprus, french firm\u00a0Schneider Electric\u00a0estimated\u00a0back in October. But what about the power consumption of the most popular AI processors \u2014 Nvidia's H100 and A100?\u00a0Paul Churnock, the Principal Electrical Engineer\u00a0of\u00a0Datacenter\u00a0Technical Governance and Strategy at Microsoft, believes that Nvidia's H100 GPUs will consume more power than all of the households in Phoenix, Arizona, by the end of 2024 when millions of these GPUs are deployed. However, the total power consumption will be less than larger cities, like Houston, Texas.\"This is Nvidia's H100 GPU; it\u00a0has a peak power consumption of 700W,\" Churnock wrote in a LinkedIn post.\u00a0\"At a 61% annual utilization, it is equivalent to the power consumption of the average American household occupant (based on 2.51 people/household). Nvidia's estimated sales of H100 GPUs is 1.5\u00a0\u2013\u00a02\u00a0million\u00a0H100 GPUs in 2024. Compared to residential power consumption by city, Nvidia's H100 chips would rank as the 5th largest, just behind Houston, Texas, and ahead of Phoenix, Arizona.\"Indeed, at 61% annual utilization, an H100 GPU would consume approximately 3,740\u00a0\u00a0kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity annually. Assuming that Nvidia sells 1.5 million H100 GPUs in 2023 and two million H100 GPUs in 2024, there will be 3.5 million such processors deployed by late 2024. In total, they will consume a whopping\u00a013,091,820,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity per year, or\u00a013,091.82\u00a0GWh.To put the number into context, approximately 13,092 GWh is the\u00a0annual power consumption\u00a0of some countries, like Georgia, Lithuania, or Guatemala. While this amount of power consumption appears rather shocking, it should be noted that AI and HPC GPU efficiency is increasing. So, while Nvidia's Blackwell-based B100 will likely outpace the power consumption of H100, it will offer higher performance and, therefore, get more work done for each unit of power consumed.\u00a0Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (16)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

Tom's summary is not. That's the point trying to be made. Here a direct quote from the very first line: \"...each consumes up to 700W of power, which is more than the average American household.\"\n\nTom's left out \"per person\".\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDSzymborski\n\n\njp7189 said:Not to be nit picky, but the article states 61% utilization, so that's more like 10kwh per day per H100 or 1/3 that of the average American household.

I was pointing out that the objection made things even worse, not better.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH4UnT3R\n\n\nWell... now just count consumption of banks... and compare with this one... or BTC ;-) Love these nonsense articles by some Greta lovers (and Greta supports terroristm).\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHansSchulze\n\n\nPeak power is needed during very intense operations that are compute bound. It is hard to achieve full peak power consumption in most apps unless they are hand tuned. Some workloads like inference are more memory bound, so GPU isn't running as hard, and memory power is a small fraction of the GPU power. Likewise 60% utilization is pulling a rabbit out of a hat, server centers run multiple workloads which could put them up against the wall for 24/7 (efficient) or bursty web traffic (GPT?) which would reduce lifetime due to temperature fluctuations. If the 60% number was what the fraction of peak power, I would believe that - easy to misread or misquote sources.\nServer centers like AWS, Azure are designed to find 24/7 workloads for all their expensive GPUs. But the GPUs aren't the most expensive part, as the article correctly alludes to. The larger part of the operating budget is electricity, so the primary goal is to use the most recent chips with the highest perf per watt. So imagine using V100 or K180 class supercomputers instead of H100, it would take similar power and take 10x or 50x longer. \nThen, ask yourself what the goal is. Do we need to train 59 different AI models? No. Do we need a way to compile models incrementally? Yes. Pancake more layers of knowledge into them without starting over each time? Yes. Do we need to find ways to simplify their representation? Yes.\nSource: I am NV alumni.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 16 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel finally releases the XeSS 2.0 SDK for developers \u2014 Technology still gated by closed-source barriers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070-series GPU supply to stabilize after April claims AIB partner Yeston\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew undersea cable tech listens for sabotage \u2014 can be retrofitted to existing fiber optic lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm debuts new Snapdragon G handheld gaming PC chips to compete with Intel and AMD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina to spend $55 billion on R&D in 2025 \u2014 Semiconductor, AI and quantum computing fields to benefit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBambu Lab Announces New Printer: H2D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotherboard dies after marathon 100-hour BIOS update process, vigil attended by thousands online\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD boasts its Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is up to 12.2x faster than Lunar Lake in AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreeware image editor GIMP 3.0 arrives after seven years of incubation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle's Gemini 2.0 Flash is reportedly capable of removing watermarks \u2014 Also found to generate AI celebrity photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

In a new profile by the New Yorker, Huang revealed a slew of details about himself and his company.\u00a0\n\n\nHere are the six most interesting tidbits about Huang and Nvidia, according to the recent profile.\n1. Nvidia's corporate motto is that it's only 30 days from going out of business\nNvidia almost went out of business in 1996. The company had to lay off half of its staff and it was just a few weeks away from missing payroll. Huang said the company had a 50-50 chance of saving the business with the upcoming launch of its Riva 128 graphics chip.\nThe chip was a success, but the desperation experienced in 1996 fueled what has become the company's unofficial corporate motto.\n\n\n\"Huang encouraged his employees to continue shipping products with a sense of desperation, and for years to come he opened staff presentations with the words 'Our company is thirty days from going out of business,\" The New Yorker wrote.\n2. Nvidia embraces failure and puts it on full display\nJensen Huang has a radical belief that \"failure must be shared,\" he told The New Yorker. And that's exactly what the company does.\nAfter the launch of a faulty graphics chip in the early 2000's, instead of firing the product managers, Huang had them give a presentation to hundreds of employees about all of the decisions the team made leading up to launch of the failed product.\u00a0\n\n\nThe chip had a loud, overactive fan, and Nvidia went as far to distribute a satirical video to the press in which the card was repurposed as a leaf blower.\n3. Jensen Huang writes hundreds of e-mails every day\nNvidia has an agile corporate structure, which means Huang participates in all facets of the business. That results in Huang responding to hundreds of e-mails every single day, though each e-mail is usually only a few words long.\u00a0\n\"One executive compared the e-mails to haiku, another to ransom notes,\" The New Yorker wrote.\u00a0\n\n\n4. Jensen Huang does not think AI is a threat to humanity\nThere's a lot of worry in the AI community that one day, the technology could become powerful enough to overtake and replace its creators. Those concerns are shared by tech icons like Elon Musk, and speculation suggests that those fears played a part in the OpenAI management fiasco earlier this month.\nBut Huang simply is not concerned about a doomsday scenario related to AI.\nWhen asked if AI might someday kill somebody, one Nvidia executive said, \"Eh, electricity kills people every year.\"\n\n\nAnother question posed was whether AI might become self-aware one day, but Huang wasn't buying it.\n\"In order for you to be a creature, you have to be conscious. You have to have some knowledge of self, right? I don't know where that could happen,\" Huang said.\u00a0\u00a0\n5. Huang encourages employees to develop products for \"zero-billion-dollar markets\"\nA bulk of Nvidia's success can be chalked up to the company skating to where the puck is going, years in advance. And Huang encourages that level of thinking as its employees develop new products.\n\n\nHuang calls it the \"zero-billion-dollar market.\" These exploratory products might not have competitors or even potential customers today, but that could change years down the road.\u00a0\nHuang compared this idea of thinking to the movie \"Field of Dreams\", in which the main character builds a baseball field in the middle of a cornfield, then waits for players and fans to come\n6. Huang's big gamble on the future is the Omniverse\nHuang took big risks over the past few decades, betting his company could develop technology for a market that didn't yet exist.\n\n\nWhen asked what Nvidia might be doing today that mirrors the \"zero-billion-dollar\" bets the company took in years past, Huang responded with a single word: \"Omniverse.\"\nHuang said the Omniverse is an \"industrial metaverse\" that will be able to simulate the real world at an incredibly fine level of detail. The Omniverse could ultimately enable humans to safely train robots and self-driving cars in a digital world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Market\n\n\nAI\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\nYour Market View\n\n\nNAME / PRICE\n+ / -\n%\nDATE\n\n\n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n                          Disclaimer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n                See also:\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                    - Explore more categories\n                \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

Its AI-powered abilities, like smart braking and a rock-my-baby mode, captured the attention of media outlets like Good Morning America and The Times of London as well as an NVIDIA AI Podcast interview with its husband-and-wife cofounders.\nA member of NVIDIA Inception, a free program for cutting-edge startups, Gl\u00fcxkind was one of seven companies with NVIDIA-powered products recognized at the Las Vegas event in January. They included:\n\nJohn Deere for its fully autonomous tractor,\nAGRIST for its robot that automatically harvests bell peppers,\nInception member Skydio for its drone that can fly at a set distance and height without manual intervention,\nNeubility, another Inception member, for its self-driving delivery robot,\nSeoul Robotics, a partner in the NVIDIA Metropolis vision AI software, for its Level 5 Control Tower that can turn standard vehicles into self-driving cars, and\nWHILL for its one-person vehicle that automatically guides a user inside places like airports or hospitals.\n\nDexterous Food Packer\nInception startup Soft Robotics, of Bedford, Mass., introduced its mGripAI system to an $8 trillion food industry hungry for automation. It combines 3D vision and AI to grasp delicate items such as chicken wings, attracting investors that include Tyson Foods and Johnsonville.\nSoft Robotics uses the NVIDIA Omniverse platform and NVIDIA Isaac Sim robotics simulator to create 3D renderings of chicken parts on conveyor belts or in bins. With help from AI and the ray-tracing capabilities of NVIDIA RTX technology, they help the robot gripper handle as many as 100 picks per minute, even under glare or changing light conditions.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in on Omniverse and Isaac Sim, and that\u2019s been working great for us,\u201d David Weatherwax, senior director of software engineering at Soft Robotics, said in a January interview.\n\nA Keen Eye in the Factory\nIn a very different example of industrial digitalization, leading electronics manufacturer Quanta is inspecting the quality of its products using the TM25S, an AI-enabled robot from its subsidiary, Techman Robot.\nUsing Omniverse, Techman built a digital twin of the inspection robot \u2014 as well as the product to be inspected \u2014 in Isaac Sim. Programming the robot in simulation reduced time spent on the task by over 70%, compared to programming manually on the real robot.\nThen, with powerful optimization tools in Isaac Sim, Techman explored a massive number of program options in parallel on NVIDIA GPUs. The end result, shown in the video below, was an efficient solution that reduced the cycle time of each inspection by 20%.\n\nSailing the Seas for Data Science\nFor its part, Saildrone, an Inception startup in Alameda, Calif., created uncrewed watercraft that can cost-effectively gather data for science, fisheries, weather forecasting and more. NVIDIA Jetson modules process data streams from their sensors, some with help from NVIDIA Metropolis vision AI software such as NVIDIA DeepStream, a development kit for intelligent video analytics.\nThe video below shows how three of its smart sailboats are helping evaluate ocean health around the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nDestination: Mars\nThe next stop for one autonomous vehicle may be the red planet.\nCaltech\u2019s Multi-Modal Mobility Morphobot, or M4, can configure itself to walk, fly or drive at speeds up to 40 mph (video below). An M42 version is now under development at NASA as a Mars rover candidate and has attracted interest for other uses like reconnaissance in fire zones.\nSince releasing a paper on it in Nature Communications, the team has been inundated with proposals for the shape-shifting drone built on the NVIDIA Jetson platform.\n\nDelivery Drone Flies High\nThe year ended on a high note with San Francisco-based Zipline announcing its delivery drones flew more than 65 million miles and made more than 850,000 deliveries since the company\u2019s start in 2011. Zipline now completes one delivery every 70 seconds, globally.\nThat\u2019s a major milestone for the Inception startup, the field it\u2019s helping pioneer and the customers who can receive everything from pizza to vitamins 7x faster than by truck.\nZipline\u2019s latest drone uses two Jetson Orin NX modules. It can carry eight pounds of cargo for 10 miles at up to 70 mph to deliver packages in single-digit minutes while reducing carbon emissions 97% compared to gasoline-based delivery vehicles.\nMachines That Inspire, Amuse\nIndividual makers designed two autonomous vehicles this year worth special mentions.\nGoran Vuksic with his AI-powered droid\nKabilan KB, a robotics developer and student in Coimbatore, India, built an autonomous wheelchair using Jetson to run computer vision models that find and navigate a path to a user\u2019s desired destination. The undergrad at the Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences aspires to one day launch a robotics startup.\nFinally, an engineering manager in Copenhagen who\u2019s a self-described Star Wars fanatic designed an AI-powered droid based on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit. Goran Vuksic shared his step-by-step technical guide, so others can build their own sci-fi companions.\nMore than 6,500 companies and 1.2 million developers \u2014 as well as a community of makers and enthusiasts \u2014 use the NVIDIA Jetson and Isaac platforms for edge AI and robotics.\nTo get a look at where autonomous machines will go next, see what\u2019s coming at CES in 2024.\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: Agriculture and Food | Artificial Intelligence | CES 2023 | Customer Stories | Data Science | Digital Twin | Embedded Computing | Hardware | Inception | Industrial and Manufacturing | Isaac | Jetson | Machine Learning | Metropolis | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA Isaac Sim | NVIDIA Jetson | Omniverse | Science | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

AWS will be the first cloud service to offer the next-gen Nvidia GH200 to it customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen ChatGPT was released a year ago, every chip maker, except for Nvidia, was caught sleeping. Nvidia\u2019s GPUs powered the initial surge of users for the AI chatbot.\nThe AI rush resulted in an overwhelming demand for Nvidia\u2019s technology. A long line included Elon Musk, who had to wait for the GPUs to improve Tesla\u2019s AI backend for its self-driving cars. Even large cloud providers had to wait as long as six months to receive their orders of GPUs.\nBut a year on, chip makers have woken up with their own AI chips, which are being marketed as alternatives to Nvidia\u2019s latest H100 GPUs.\nThe AI chips, such as AMD\u2019s MI300X and Google\u2019s TPU v5p, which were introduced this month, will not have the long waits. AMD\u2019s chip will be cheaper, but the AI software support for the GPU is still a work-in-progress.\nNvidia knows the competition is coming and has taken steps to maintain its dominance. The first, and perhaps most significant, is the acceleration of the GPU product release cycle.\nNvidia\u2018s Strategy for Dominance\nNvidia will now release a new GPU every year, a step up from its previous two-year release cycle. The company\u2019s H100 GPUs are still in short supply, but last month announced the H200 GPU, which delivers the same performance but has more memory capacity. Larger memory can store more data as AI jobs get longer and queries get more complex.\nNvidia H200 (Nvidia)\nNvidia\u2019s former enemies, bitcoin miners, are now turning into allies. Cryptocurrency hunters are shying away from mining and turning data centers into AI computing centers. The miners will provide computing capacity on Nvidia H100 GPUs at significantly cheaper prices than conventional cloud providers.\nCrusoe Energy is borrowing $200 million to acquire 20,000 H100 GPUs. The GPUs will become available to customers in the first quarter of next year. Crusoe used the GPUs as collateral to secure financing.\nNonprofit AI cloud provider Voltage Park, founded by blockchain billionaire Jed McCaleb, acquired 24,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, which were ordered in April 2023. Voltage Park aims to be like eBay, with the highest bidder receiving AI computing time on the H100.\nMining company Bit Digital has acquired a fleet of H100 GPUs that will be deployed in a data center, the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company has also signed a multimillion-dollar contract for three years with a customer committed to using the GPUs.\nNvidia Topping Export Restrictions\nThe China market is important to Nvidia, and the U.S. government has put the company under the microscope.\nThe U.S. government has twice created restrictions to restrict the sales of some of Nvidia\u2019s top GPUs to China, but Nvidia creatively changed the specifications of the chip that allowed sales to China.\nOne such chip, the H800 GPU, which is a China market variant of the H100, has been withdrawn. The U.S. government announced restrictions in October that banned the sale of H800, and server makers stopped sales shortly after. Lenovo pulled the GPU from its China server products on Oct. 31.\nNvidia has announced H20, a variant of its fastest GPU, for the China market but has delayed its release.\nHowever, the chip maker is also facing competition from local AI chip makers. Chinese firms Huawei and Biren Technology have developed GPUs.\nAMD\u2018s GPU Is Faster than Nvidia\u2018s Fastest\nAMD was sleeping when ChatGPT was released. Its GPU wasn\u2019t ready for AI, its software stack was broken, and AI wasn\u2019t featured on its long-term roadmap.\nBut the company knows how to catch up quickly.\nAMD this week launched its new MI300X, which the company CEO Lisa Su claimed was the world\u2019s fastest AI accelerator. The GPU has more memory capacity and comparable throughput to an Nvidia GPU.\nThe AMD MI300X Accelerator.\nAMD has claimed better raw AI and computing performance. But those metrics are highly reliant on the foundational model, algorithms, software tools, compilers, and other variables. Nvidia has a stronger software stack with CUDA and has better customization of AI applications to its chips.\nOutside of performance, most AI chip makers outside Nvidia are still trying to prove the viability of their silicon. But AMD is eroding that dominance by scoring major customers, including Microsoft, Meta, and Oracle, which are putting MI300X in their data centers.\nMicrosoft\u2019s infrastructure is heavily reliant on Nvidia hardware, and GPT-4 is now loaded on the MI300X. Microsoft also announced a preview of an MI300X virtual machine, and Oracle is testing the MI300X in its cloud services.\nMeta plugged in MI300X into an OCP-compliant server, which was one of the fastest server deployments in Meta\u2019s history, said Ajit Mathews, senior director of engineering at Meta, in an on-stage appearance.\nAMD CEO Lisa Su said there was space for many AI chip makers. \u201cWe\u2019re now expecting that the data center accelerator TAM will grow more than 70% annually over the next four years to over $400 billion in 2027,\u201d Su said.\nGoogle\u2019s TPU v5p\u00a0 \nGoogle\u2019s AI chips, called TPUs, have been around for a decade but were not very accessible and mostly used internally. Google last week released the TPU v5p, which is its first AI chip for training with mass availability.\nThe chip\u2019s release coincided with the launch of Gemini, which is Google\u2019s next-generation large-language model. Google also announced a new type of supercomputer called Hypercomputer, which connects the conventional cloud-based consumption model with a supercomputing infrastructure.\nThe TPU v5p chips are limited to running AI workloads, while GPUs are designed to run general-purpose workloads. The TPU v5p chips are only available through Google Cloud but it easily accessible. A new feature called Dynamic Work Scheduling guarantees flexible on-demand or scheduled availability.\nSource: Google\nThe current version of Gemini was trained on the TPU v4 and TPU v5e chips. The TPU v5e is designed more for inferencing, while the TPU v5p is a beefier variant that can handle training.\nThe Hypercomputer server system bunches together 8,960 Cloud TPU v5p chips in a pod. The pods are interconnected via optical circuit switches (OCS), which provide a throughput of 4,800 Gbps. The Hypercomputer supports GPUs, but the optical interconnect, which is faster than copper wires, is reserved for the TPUs.\nThe TPU v5p is a result of hardware-software co-design, Mark Lohmeyer, Google vice president and general manager of compute and machine learning infrastructure, told The New Stack.\n\u201cGoogle is uniquely able to do that because of our depth and research, own in-house models, our ecosystem of partner models, our experience scaling those and applications that served multiple billions of consumers on top of this infrastructure,\u201d Lohmeyer said.\nMany AI companies are running on Google infrastructure and will use TPUs v5p chips, Lohmeyer said.\nMore Competition on Tap\nIntel\u2019s best AI bet for now remains its CPUs, which are being designed for inference. The Xeon server chips include extensions such as AMX that speed up inferencing on models such as Llama 2.\nIntel\u2019s got multiple AI accelerators but none have caught fire. The general-purpose Ponte Vecchio GPU, which is in the world\u2019s second-fastest supercomputer called Aurora, has found limited adoption. Another AI chip called Gaudi2 shows more promise \u2014 it matches the H100 on AI performance in some cases and is being used in an AI supercomputer being built for StabilityAI.\nIntel canceled the successor to Ponte Vecchio and revised its roadmap to release its next-generation GPU in 2025. The AI megachip, called Falcon Shores, merges the Gaudi accelerators with Intel\u2019s GPU accelerators.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tTRENDING STORIES\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup\nCreated with Sketch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAgam Shah has covered enterprise IT for more than a decade.

Zensors is a member of NVIDIA Metropolis, a partner program for improving operations with visual data and AI, and NVIDIA Inception, a free program that nurtures cutting-edge startups.\nThe Zensors platform uses anonymized data to count travelers in lines, identify congested areas and predict passenger wait times \u2014 and it can send alerts to help speed operations. Other startups have landed in this space to reduce flight delays.\n\u201cZensors is making visual AI easy for all to use,\u201d said Anuraag Jain, the company\u2019s cofounder and head of product and technology.\nInspect Your Gadget\nTaiwanese manufacturers like Foxconn Industrial Internet, Pegatron, Quanta and Wistron are embracing NVIDIA Metropolis for Factories to enable automated optical inspections.\nPegatron makes motherboards, smartphones, laptops, game consoles and much more. It uses Metropolis for Factories to support its printed circuit board factories, achieving 99.8% accuracy on its automated optical inspection systems.\nHow\u2019s that for a smarter workspace.\nPepsiCo\u2019s AI Pop\nBeverage giant PepsiCo has deployed vision AI from KoiReader Technologies, an NVIDIA Metropolis partner, for efficiency gains in reading warehouse labels.\nThe startup\u2019s technology is being tapped to train and run the deep learning models behind PepsiCo\u2019s AI label and barcode scanning system.\n\u201cIf you find the right lever, you could dramatically improve our throughput,\u201d said Greg Bellon, senior director of digital supply chain at PepsiCo.\nDriving Digital Production\nWith NVIDIA Omniverse \u2014 a collaborative platform for developing Universal Scene Description applications to design, plan and operate manufacturing and assembly facilities \u2014 Mercedes-Benz is using digital twins for production.\nHarnessing Omniverse, Mercedes-Benz can interact directly with its suppliers, reducing coordination processes by 50%.\n\u201cUsing NVIDIA Omniverse and AI, Mercedes-Benz is building a connected, digital-first approach to optimize its manufacturing processes, ultimately reducing construction time and production costs,\u201d said Rev Lebaredian, vice president of Omniverse and simulation technology at NVIDIA.\nJuicing AI for Batteries\nSmart spaces often begin in the virtual world.\nSiemens showcased an immersive digital model for a look into future FREYR Battery factories, powered by Omniverse.\nThe industrial giant demoed a blueprint for how teams can harness comprehensive digital twins virtually using models of existing and future plants. The technologies aim to help FREYR meet surging demand for high-density, cost-effective battery cells.\nThat\u2019s AI to get charged up about.\nLearn about building smart spaces with NVIDIA Metropolis.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\n\n\n\nThough Nvidia and AMD (and ATI before 2006) have long struggled for supremacy in the world of graphics, it's pretty clear that the green giant has generally held the upper hand. But despite Nvidia's track record and ability to rake in cash, the company has put out plenty of bad GPUs \u2014 just like the five worst AMD GPUs. (See also: The five best AMD GPUs \u2014 we're covering the good and the bad.) Sometimes Nvidia rests on its laurels for a little too long, or reads the room terribly wrong, or simply screws up in spectacular fashion.\n\nWe've ranked what we think are Nvidia's five worst GPUs in the 24 years since the beginning of the GeForce brand in 1999, which helped usher in modern graphics cards. We're working from the best of the worst down to the worst of the worst. These choices are based both on individual cards and whole product lines, which means a single bad GPU in a series of good GPUs won't necessarily make the cut.5 \u2014 GeForce RTX 3080: The GPU generation you couldn't buy(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Nvidia achieved a comfortable lead over AMD with its GTX 10-series in 2016, and going into 2020 Nvidia was still able to maintain that lead. However, AMD was anticipated to launch a GPU that was truly capable of going toe-to-toe with Nvidia's best, which meant the upcoming GPUs would need to match that. The situation was complicated by the fact that the RTX 20-series neglected traditional rasterization performance in favor of then-niche ray tracing and AI-powered resolution upscaling. For the first time in a long time, Nvidia was caught with its pants down.\n\nWhat Nvidia came up with for the RTX 30-series was the Ampere architecture, which addressed many of the issues with Turing-based RTX 20-series chips. Nvidia upgraded from TSMC's 12nm process (essentially its 16nm node but able to make big chips) to Samsung's 8nm, which meant increased density for additional cores and more efficiency. Ampere also made the dedicated integer execution units in floating-point plus integer units, meaning it could trade integer performance for additional floating point compute, depending on the workload. Nvidia advertised this change as a massive increase in core count and TFLOPS, which was a bit misleading.\n\nLaunching in September of 2020 with the RTX 3080 and 3090, Nvidia preempted AMD's RDNA 2-powered RX 6000-series. The 3080 at $699 was about on par with the $1,499 3090, and it was easily faster than the RTX 2080 Ti in both ray-traced and non-ray traced games. AMD's $649 RX 6800 XT and RX 6800 showed up in November, with the RX 6900 XT in December, and while they did tie the 3080 and 3090 in non-ray traced scenarios, they lagged behind with ray tracing enabled, and they also lacked a resolution upscaler like DLSS.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)We originally rated the 3080 with 4.5 out of 5 stars, so you might be wondering how in the world it could have ended up on this list. Well, it boils down to everything that happened after launch day. The 3080's most immediate problem was that you couldn't realistically buy it at MSRP, and a big part of the problem was the infamous GPU shortage induced by the Covid pandemic, and then massively exacerbated by cryptocurrency miners pushing prices up well north of $1,500. But even after the shortage technically ended in early 2022, almost no 3080 10GBs went for $699 or less.\n\nMeanwhile, high-end RX 6000 cards like the 6800 XT came out of the GPU shortage with sub-MSRP pricing. The 6800 XT has been going for less than its $649 MSRP all this year and into last year, and today it costs less than $500 brand-new. AMD also now has FSR2, which doesn't quite match DLSS, but it's a viable resolution upscaling and frame generation alternative. RTX 30 cards don't even get DLSS 3 frame generation and have to rely on FSR 3 frame generation instead.\n\nThen there's the wider problems with the RTX 30-series. Pretty much every 30-series card has much less memory than it should, except for the 3060 12GB and the 3090 with its 24GB of VRAM. On launch day things were fine, but more and more evidence is cropping up that most RTX 30-series cards just don't have enough memory, especially in the latest games. Then there's the RTX 3050, the lowest-end member of the family with an MSRP of $249 and a real price of $300 or more for most of its life. Compare that to the $109 GTX 1050; in just two generations, Nvidia raised the minimum price of its GPUs by $140.\n\nEven without the GPU shortage, it seems that the RTX 30-series was doomed from the start thanks to its limited amount of memory and merely modest advantage in ray tracing and resolution upscaling. The extreme retail prices were enough to make the RTX 3080 and most of its siblings some of Nvidia's worst cards, and directly led to Nvidia increasing prices on its next generation parts.4 \u2014 GeForce RTX 4060 Ti: One step forward, one step back(Image credit: Nvidia)It might be premature to call a GPU that came out half a year ago one of the worst ever, but sometimes it's obvious that it has to be. Not only is the RTX 4060 Ti a pretty bad graphics card in its own right, but it's something of a microcosm for the entire RTX 40-series and all of its problems.\n\nNvidia's previous RTX 30 GPUs had some real competition in the form of AMD's RX 6000-series, especially in the midrange. Though the RTX 3060 12GB was pretty good thanks to its increased VRAM capacity, higher-end RTX 3060 Ti and 3070 GPUs came with just 8GB and didn't have particularly compelling price tags, even after the GPU shortage ended. An (upper) midrange RTX 40-series GPU could have evened the playing field.\n\nThe RTX 4060 Ti does have some redeeming qualities: It's significantly more power efficient than 30-series cards, and it uses the impressively small AD106 die that's three times as dense as the GA104 die inside the RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 Ti. But there's a laundry list of things that are wrong with the 4060 Ti, and it primarily has to do with memory.\n\nThere are two models of the 4060 Ti: one with 8GB of VRAM and the other with 16GB. That the 8GB model of this GPU even exists is problematic, because it's so close in performance to the 3070 that already has memory capacity issues. So, obviously you should get the 16GB model just to make sure you're future-proofed, except the 16GB model costs a whopping $100 extra. With the 4060 Ti, Nvidia is basically telling you that you need to spend $499 instead of $399 to make sure your card actually performs properly 100% of the time.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The 4060 Ti also cuts corners in other areas, particularly when it comes to memory bandwidth. Nvidia gave this GPU a puny 128-bit memory bus, half that of the 256-bit bus on the 3070 and 3060 Ti, and this results in a meager bandwidth of 288GB/s on the 4060 Ti, whereas the previous generation had 448GB/s. Additionally, the 4060 Ti has eight instead of 16 PCIe lanes, which shouldn't matter too much, but it's still yet more penny pinching. A larger L2 cache helps with the bandwidth issue, but it only goes so far.\n\nIn the end, the RTX 4060 Ti is basically just an RTX 3070 with barely any additional performance, decently better efficiency, and support for DLSS 3 Frame Generation. And sure, the 8GB model costs $399 instead of $499 (now $449-ish), but it's also vulnerable to the same issues that the 3070 can experience. That means you should probably just buy the 16GB model, which is priced the same as the outgoing 3070. Either way, you're forced to compromise.\n\nThe RTX 4060 Ti isn't uniquely bad, echoing what we've seen out of the RTX 40-series as a whole. To date it's Nvidia's most expensive GPU lineup by far, ranging from the RTX 4060 starting at $299 to the RTX 4090 starting at $1,599 (and often costing much more). The 4060 Ti isn't the only 40-series card with a controversial memory setup, as Nvidia planned to initially launch the RTX 4070 Ti as the RTX 4080 12GB. Even with the name change and a $100 price cut, that graphics card warrants a mention on this list. But frankly, nearly every GPU in the RTX 40-series (other than the halo RTX 4090) feels overpriced and equipped with insufficient memory for 2022 and later.\n\nLet's be clear. What we wanted from the RTX 40-series, and what Nvidia should have provided, was a 64-bit wider interface at every tier, and 4GB more memory at every level \u2014 with the exception of the RTX 4090, and perhaps an RTX 4050 8GB. Most of our complaints with the 4060 and 4060 Ti would be gone if they were 12GB cards with a 192-bit bus. The same goes for the 4070 and 4070 Ti: 16GB and a 256-bit bus would have made them much better GPUs. And the RTX 4080 and (presumably) upcoming RTX 4080 Super should be 320-bit with 20GB. The higher memory configurations could have even justified the increase in pricing to an extent, but instead Nvidia raised prices and cut the memory interface width. Which reminds us in all the bad ways of the next entry in this list...3 \u2014 GeForce RTX 2080 and Turing: New features we didn't ask for and higher prices(Image credit: Nvidia)Nvidia's influence in gaming graphics was at its peak after the launch of the GTX 10-series. Across the product stack, AMD could barely compete at all, especially in laptops against Nvidia's super efficient GPUs. And when Nvidia had a big lead, it would often follow it up with new GPUs that would offer real upgrades over the existing cards. Prior to the launch of the Turing architecture, the community was excited for what Jensen Huang and his team were cooking up.\n\nIn the summer of 2018, Nvidia finally revealed its 20-series of GPUs \u2014 and they weren't the GTX 20-series, but instead debuted as the RTX 20-series, with the name change signifying the fact that Nvidia had introduced the world's first real-time ray tracing graphics cards. Ray tracing was and still is an incredible technological achievement, described as the \"holy grail\" of graphics. That technology had made its way into gaming GPUs, promising to bring about a revolution in fidelity and realism.\n\nBut then people started reading the fine print. And let's be clear: More than any other GPUs on this list, this is really one where the entirety of the RTX 20-series family gets the blame.\n\nFirst, there were the prices: These graphics cards were incredibly expensive (worse in many ways than the current 40-series pricing). The RTX 2080 Ti debuted at $1,199? No top-end Nvidia gaming graphics card using a single graphics chip had ever gotten into four digit territory before, unless you want to count the Titan Xp (we don't). The RTX 2080 was somehow more expensive than the outgoing GTX 1080 Ti. Nvidia also released the Founders Edition version of cards a month before the third-party models, with a $50 to $200 price premium \u2014 a premium that didn't really go away in some cases.\n\nAlso, ray tracing was cool and all, but literally no games supported it when the RTX 20-series released. It wasn't like all the game devs could suddenly switch over from traditional methods to ray tracing, ignoring 95% of the gaming hardware market. Were these GPUs really worth buying, or should people just skip the 20-series altogether?(Image credit: Teclab/YouTube)Then the reviews came in. The RTX 2080 Ti by virtue of being a massive GPU was much faster than the GTX 1080 Ti. However, the RTX 2080 could only match the 1080 Ti and they were nominally the same price \u2014 plus, the 2080 had 3GB less memory. The RTX 2070 and RTX 2060 faired a bit better, but they didn't offer mind-boggling improvements like the previous GTX 1070 and GTX 1060 did, and again increased generational pricing by $100. The single game in 2018 that offered ray tracing, Battlefield V, ran very poorly even on the RTX 2080 Ti: It was only able to get an average 100 FPS in our 1080p testing. To be clear, the 2080 Ti was advertised as a 4K gaming GPU.\n\nBut hey, building an ecosystem of ray traced games takes time, and Nvidia had announced 10 additional titles that would get ray tracing. One of these games got cancelled, and seven of the remaining nine added ray tracing. However, one of those games only added ray tracing for the Xbox Series X/S version, and another two were Asian MMORPGs. Even Nvidia's ray tracing darling Atomic Heart skipped ray tracing when it finally came out in early 2023, five years after the initial RT tech demo video.\n\nThe whole RTX branding thing was also thrown into even more confusion when Nvidia later launched the GTX 16-series, starting with the GTX 1660 Ti, using the same Turing architecture but without ray tracing or tensor cores. If RT was the future and everyone was supposed to jump on that bandwagon, why was Nvidia backpedaling? We can only imagine what Nvidia could have done with a hypothetical GTX 1680 / 2020: A smaller die size, all the rasterization performance, none of the extra cruft.\n\nTo give Nvidia some credit, it did at least try to address the 20-series' pricing issue by launching 'Super' models with the 2080, 2070, and 2060. Those all offered better bang for buck (though the 2080 Super was mostly pointless). However, this also indicated that the original RTX 20-series GPUs weren't expensive because of production costs \u2014 after all, they used relatively cheap GDDR6 memory and were fabbed on TSMC's 12nm node, which was basically 16nm but able to make the big chip for the 2080 Ti. AMD shifted to TSMC 7nm for 2019's RDNA / RX 5000-series. RTX 20-series was probably expensive just because Nvidia believed they would sell at those prices.\n\nIn hindsight, the real \"holy grail\" in the RTX 20-series was Deep Learning Super Sampling, or DLSS, which dovetails into today's AI explosion. Although DLSS got off to a rocky start \u2014 just like ray tracing, with lots of promises being broken and the quality not being great \u2014 today the technology is present in 500 or so games and works amazingly well. Nvidia should have emphasized DLSS much more than ray tracing. Even today, only 37% of RTX 20-series users enable ray tracing, while 68% use DLSS. It really should have been DTX instead of RTX.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.2 \u2014 GeForce GTX 480: Fermi round one failed to deliver(Image credit: Bilibili)Although Nvidia was used to being in first place by the late 2000s, in 2009 the company lost the crown to an ATI recently acquired by AMD. The HD 5000-series came out before Nvidia's own next-generation GPUs were ready, and the HD 5870 was the first winning ATI flagship since the Radeon 9700 Pro. Nvidia wasn't far behind though, with its brand-new graphics cards slated for early 2010.\n\nIt's important to note how differently Nvidia and AMD/ATI approached GPUs at this time. Nvidia was all about making massive dies on older nodes that were cheap and had good yields, while ATI had shifted to smaller dies on more advanced processes with the HD 3000-series, and kept that design strategy up to the HD 5000-series. Nvidia's upcoming GPUs, codenamed Fermi, would be just as big as its prior generation, though this time Nvidia would be equal in process, using TSMC's 40nm just like the HD 5000 lineup.\n\nLaunching in March 2010, the flagship GTX 480 was a winner. In our review, it beat the HD 5870 pretty handily. The top-end HD 5970 still stood as the fastest graphics card overall, but it used two graphics chips in CrossFire, which wasn't always consistent. But the GTX 480 cost $499, much higher than the roughly $400 HD 5870. Nvidia's flagships always charged a premium, so this wasn't too different here... except for one thing: power.\n\nNvidia's flagships were never particularly efficient, but the GTX 480 was ludicrous. Its power consumption was roughly 300 watts, equal to the dual-GPU HD 5970. The HD 5870 in contrast consumed just 200 watts, meaning the 480 had a 50% higher power draw for maybe 10% to 20% more performance. Keep in mind, this was back when the previous record was 236 watts on the GTX 280, and that was still relatively high for a flagship.\n\nOf course, power turns into heat, and the GTX 480 was also a super hot GPU. Ironically, the reference cooler sort of looked like a grill, and the 480 was derided with memes talking about \"the way it's meant to be grilled,\" satirizing Nvidia's \"The Way It's Meant To Be Played\" game sponsorships, and meme videos like cooking an egg on a GTX 480. It was not a great time to be an Nvidia marketer.\n\nIn the end, the issues plaguing the GTX 400-series proved to be so troublesome that Nvidia replaced it half a year later with a reworked Fermi architecture for the GTX 500-series. The new GTX 580 still consumed about 300 watts, but it was 10% faster than the 480, and the rest of the 500-series had generally better efficiency than the 400-series.\n\nNvidia really messed up with the 400-series \u2014 you don't replace your entire product stack in half a year if you're doing a good job. AMD was extremely close to overtaking Nvidia's share in the overall graphics market, something that hadn't happened since the mid 2000s. Nvidia still made way more money than AMD in spite of Fermi's failures, so at least it wasn't an absolute trainwreck. It also helped pave the way for a renewed focus on efficiency that made the next three generations of Nvidia GPUs far better.1 \u2014 GeForce FX 5800 Ultra: aka, the leaf blowerIn the years following the introduction of the GeForce brand with the inaugural GeForce 256 in 1999, Nvidia was on a winning streak. Its last remaining rival was Canadian graphics company ATI Technologies, and although the company still had some fight in it, Nvidia kept winning for several consecutive generations. Then ATI changed the game with the Radeon 9700 Pro in 2002, which decimated the GeForce 4-series thanks to its record-smashing die size.\n\nNvidia would of course strike back with its own large GPU, which was likely in development before the 9700 Pro. However, if Nvidia had any doubts about making a chip with a big die size, ATI dispelled them. Besides, considering the massive lead ATI had with its Radeon 9000-series, Nvidia didn't really have much of a choice. But with Nvidia moving to the 130nm node while the 9700 Pro was on 150nm, Nvidia definitely had a big technical advantage on its side.\n\nIn early 2003, Nvidia fired back with its GeForce FX 5800 Ultra, which was competitively priced at $399, the same price the 9700 Pro launched at. However, the 5800 Ultra was only partially successful in reclaiming the lead, especially at higher resolutions. This was down to the 5800 Ultra's much lower memory bandwidth of 16GB/s compared to the nearly 20GB/s on the 9700 Pro.\n\nThere was also an issue where anisotropic filtering just didn't look very good, and that further undermined the performance lead the 5800 Ultra supposedly had. This turned out to be a driver issue (drivers were pretty important for visual quality back then), and although that meant it was fixable, it was nevertheless an issue.\n\nThen there was the power consumption. Although a power draw of 75 watts or so might seem pretty quaint nowadays, back then that was truly massive. By contrast the 9700 Pro in our testing just hit 54 watts, so it was nearly 50% more efficient than Nvidia's much newer flagship. And the noise? \"Like a vacuum cleaner,\" according to our review from two decades ago \u2014 others dubbed it the leaf blower.\n\nNvidia quickly got to work releasing a newer, improved flagship in the form of the GeForce FX 5900 Ultra just half a year later. This new GPU\u00a0featured a massive 27GB/s worth of bandwidth, fixed drivers, and a much more reasonable power consumption of around 60 watts. Nvidia did bump the price up by $100, but that's fair enough given Nvidia had also improved its performance lead, even though the Radeon 9800 Pro had come out in the mean time.\n\nNote that the GTX 400-series wasn't the first Nvidia GPU to reclaim the performance lead from ATI by a slim margin, while having power consumption issues, and to get replaced half a year later. But what pushes the GeForce FX 5800 Ultra into first (or last?) place is the fact that it was on a much more advanced process and yet still struggled so much against the 9700 Pro. That must have been a very humbling moment for Nvidia's engineers.Dishonorable Mention: Proprietary technology nonsense(Image credit: Shutterstock, AMD, Nvidia)Nvidia isn't just a hardware company, it has software too. And what Nvidia seems to love doing most of all with its hardware plus software ecosystem is making it closed off. The company has introduced tons of features that will only work on Nvidia hardware, and sometimes only on specific types of Nvidia hardware. If that wasn't bad enough, these features also tend to have lifespans comparable to many of Google's products and projects.\n\nLook, we get that sometimes a company wants to move the market forward with new technologies, but these should be the same technologies that the game developers and graphics professionals want, not just arbitrary vendor lock-in solutions \u2014 DirectX Raytracing (DXR) is a good example of this approach. Nearly every item in the following list could have been done as an open standard; Nvidia just used its market share to try and avoid going that route, and it often failed to pan out. Here's the short version.\n\nSLI: First introduced by 3dfx, which went bankrupt and was subsequently acquired by Nvidia, SLI was a technology that allowed two (or more) GPUs to render a game. In theory, this meant doubling performance, but it hinged on good driver support, was prone to frame stuttering and visual glitches, and consumed tons of power. It was a staple of Nvidia's mainstream GPUs for years but was effectively discontinued with the RTX 30-series in 2020. RIP SLI and the red herring promise of increased performance from multiple GPUs.\n\nPhysX: PhysX is physics software made for games that eventually ended up in the hands of Ageia. That company created Physics Processing Units (or PPU) cards to accelerate the usage of PhysX, which would have normally run on the CPU. Nvidia acquired Ageia in 2008 and added PhysX support directly into its GeForce GPUs, and there was a big push from Nvidia to convince users to get an extra graphics card just to speed up PhysX.\n\nHowever, tons of people didn't like GPU-accelerated physics, including legendary game dev John Carmack, who argued physics belonged on the CPU. He was eventually proven correct, as PhysX was eventually opened up for CPUs and then made open source, and it hasn't really been used on GPUs since Batman: Arkham Asylum. PhysX, at least as a proprietary technology, is dead \u2014 and good riddance.\n\n3D Vision: Debuting in 2009, 3D Vision sought to capitalize on the 3D vision craze of the 2000s and 2010s. It had two parts: the drivers that enabled stereoscopic vision in DirectX games, and glasses that could actually produce the 3D effect. Although we pondered that 3D Vision might be \"the future of gaming,\" it turns out that people just didn't like 3D, and enthusiasm for 3D died down in the early to mid 2010s. 3D Vision limped along until 2019, when it was axed.\n\nG-Sync: G-Sync, which first came out in 2013, was a piece of hardware installed into gaming monitors that could dynamically alter the refresh rate to match the framerate, which prevented screen-tearing. Although a superior solution to V-Sync, which locked the framerate, G-Sync monitors were super expensive and the feature didn't work with AMD GPUs.\n\nMeanwhile, Vesa's Adaptive Sync and AMD's FreeSync (based on Adaptive Sync) did the same thing and didn't really cost anything extra, making G-Sync an objectively worse solution for Nvidia users. In 2019, Nvidia finally allowed its users to use Adaptive Sync and FreeSync monitors, and also introduced G-Sync Compatible branding for monitors based on Adaptive Sync \u2014 those could work on Nvidia and AMD cards. There are still proprietary G-Sync monitors, but they're almost exclusively top-end models and seem to represent a dying breed.\n\nVXAO: Basically a high-end version of ambient occlusion that could create more realistic shadows. However, VXAO was very GPU intensive and only ever got into two games, Rise of the Tomb Raider in 2016 and Final Fantasy XV in 2018. The advent of real-time ray tracing has made VXAO redundant, though it was essentially dead on arrival.\n\nDLSS: Deep Learning Super Sampling is one of the premiere features of RTX GPUs, and although it's pretty great and works well, it's still proprietary. It doesn't run on AMD GPUs at all, and it doesn't run on any non-RTX cards from Nvidia either. That means even the GTX 16-series, which use the Turing architecture in the RTX 20-series, don't support DLSS. DLSS 3 Frame Generation is also limited to RTX 40-series cards and later. It would have been nice if Nvidia did what Intel did with XeSS, and offered two versions: one for its RTX GPUs using Tensor cores, and a second mode for everything else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (46)\n\n\n\nMatthew ConnatserSocial Links NavigationMatthew\u00a0Connatser is a freelancing writer for Tom's Hardware US.

I cringe at the 10GB for that price, but they (kind of) made it less horrible with the 12GB version (even less obtainable XD), but they do perform well. I do remember the power issue at launch though, so yeah, not quite perfect. Now, why do I think it's not a good pick for the list? Simply because the 3050 6GB will exist shortly. I know we can't predict the future and all, but... Come on. The other strong contender to that list is any DDR version of a GDDR GPU they've put out. And, if you wan a specific model, the 1630. That thing is just trash.\n\nOther than that nitpick, the list is pretty spot on, yes. Another addition to the honorable mention could be the 8000 series that just fell off their PCBs. I think those were G92 dies?\n\nRegards.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\natomicWAR\n\n\nPEnns said:What a strange article.\n\nSo, the 3080 was bad because......................people couldn't buy it???Yeah that one rubbed me a little wrong too. I think I would have put the a either a 4070 or Ti version in its place as they are starved for ram considering the resolutions they aim for. Heck even the 4080 with it high price and its huge gap trailing the 4090 in performance would have worked for 5th.\n\nBut for sure I agree with the 5800 FX ultra being supreme trash earning the top spot (I got a 9700 Pro that gen after four gens of Nvidia on my primary rig). But hey they remembered the bring up the Geforce 256 this time even if in passing...It should have made the list of top 5 best Nvidia GPUs if you asked me.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthestryker\n\n\nA pretty deserving list outside of the 3080. The 400 series was a really weird stop as the 460 was a really good card for its segment. \n\nI don't think the 3080 should be in this list because the only real knock against it is the 10GB VRAM. The market was godawful, but none of that can really be blamed on nvidia so much as miners and then consumers for keeping the costs up when availability got better. I certainly bought a 6800 XT for a second machine this year over anything nvidia because the $/perf was so much better. \n\nI think the instances of releasing the \"same\" card with meaningfully difference specs would be far more deserving. The 30 series example of that would be the 3060 8GB (and likely forthcoming 3050 6GB), because not only did it have less VRAM but the bus width drop caused the performance to plummet. There's also the multiple types of VRAM on the 1030, and the 1060 3GB which had fewer cores on top of less VRAM.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 46 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive Best Photoshop Alternatives Tested: Image Editing for Free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the most out of your processor with this motherboard's Turbo Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAwekeys Antiques Metal keycaps are Viking-themed luxury for your fingertips\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD RDNA 4 and Radeon RX 9000-series GPUs start at $549: Specifications, release date, pricing, and more revealed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTested: Intel's Arrow Lake 140T iGPU mostly maintains an edge over AMD's older 880m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia DLSS4, MFG, and full ray tracing tested on RTX 5090 and RTX 5080\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m typing this on the world\u2019s largest keyboard, a 178-key beast designed to make you more productive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMontech\u2019s Heritage Pro case is like a designer handbag for your Micro ATX PC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel Battlemage and Arc B-series GPUs: Specifications, release dates, pricing, and everything we know\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverclocking Arrow Lake: How I set world records, plus simple tips to push your Core Ultra to the limit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Nvidia's chief executive, Jensen Huang, will discuss potential semiconductor collaboration with the Vietnamese government and companies in Hanoi on Monday, Reuters reports. The move could be an attempt by Nvidia to diversify its supply chain and reduce reliance on its traditional partners.The meetings will explore potential partnerships and technology sharing between Nvidia and its partners. Reuters claims an invitation letter to the event points to ways 'to boost the semiconductor industry' in Vietnam and 'Nvidia's potential partnership with Vietnamese tech firms.'Vietnam is not known for chip manufacturing, but the first name that comes to mind when discussing this country in the semiconductor context is Intel, which has an extensive test and assembly facility near Ho Shin Minh City. This facility plays a crucial role in Intel's global supply chain, yet the company scrapped plans to make additional investments in the facility.Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions open the doors for Vietnam to move beyond chip assembly to chip production. One of the main points of interest is whether Nvidia agrees to share technology with at least one Vietnamese company.\u00a0An industry insider, who wished to stay anonymous, suggested that such a deal is expected to happen at the meeting. This could be a big step in transferring important technology to Vietnam, helping it become more influential in the global semiconductor market.Major Vietnamese companies like FPT, Vingroup, and Viettel are set to attend the meeting, though they are not sharing any specific deals they might be discussing. The report says the Vietnamese investment ministry, which is organizing the event, has not made any comments either.\u00a0Many companies are trying hard to reduce reliance on China-based and sometimes Taiwan-based production facilities due to geopolitical risks and the U.S. crackdown against China's artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing (HPC), and semiconductor sectors.\u00a0Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Nvidia has already moved the assembly of its AI and HPC hardware from China, but its chips are still made and assembled in Taiwan. It is evident that the company might be exploring ways to diversify its supply chain further, but how Nvidia could use Vietnam remains to be seen.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (2)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n\n\n\nA new video released by notorious rumour channel Moore's Law is Dead is digging into the potential RTX 5090 release date and quotes a source, claiming to be from inside Nvidia, stating that whether it launches its next-gen cards in 2024 will be largely down to how competitive AMD's RDNA 4 GPUs will be.The claim is that the next-gen consumer architecture will be based on the Blackwell GPU design, and is being \"prepared to be ready to launch in Q4 2024 if we want it to.\" The two things that will reportedly make Nvidia's decision for it will be how well the current RTX 40-series is selling through the next year, and whether AMD launches its own next-gen cards in a state that can claw back end-of-year sales from the green team.Given that AMD's RDNA 4 GPUs are said to be focusing purely on the mid-range market it would be unlikely that any new Radeon graphics card would take any sales away from Nvidia's high end. But if it does have a successful launch, and starts to really impact Nvidia's volume sales, then that might encourage Jen-Hsun to drop a new halo product to turn peoples' heads and remind them there's a new GeForce gen on the way.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5090\n\n\n\n\nNvidia announces the RTX 50-series, led by the $1,999 RTX 5090 with 'twice the performance of the 4090'\n\n\n\nSo yeah, if you want a next-gen Nvidia GPU in 2024 then you've got to pin your hopes on AMD sticking the RDNA 4 launch, and sucking up as much potential graphics card market share as possible.On the other hand, if Nvidia's proposed launch of the new RTX 40-series Super cards at the start of 2024 pushes prices down and performance up then that could cement the Ada generation as the go-to cards for the next 12 months. And that in turn would make it tough to see why Nvidia would then cannibalise itself with an RTX 5090 launch at the end of the year.Still, however things look by this time in 2024, the source is suggesting that it is \"currently planning to make a big deal about RTX 5000 efficiency at CES 2025. So either way we will be launching next-gen by the start of 2025.\"Which is certainly earlier than I feared when we first heard the reports of Nvidia's next-gen cards not arriving until 2025. I had a horrible feeling it might just sit on its Ada laurels for a late year launch and we'd be hanging on an age before we saw Blackwell in the desktop. It's still going to be at least a year, but it does mean there's a chance, just a chance we might have truly next-gen GPUs in 2024.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD.\nBest gaming motherboard: The right boards.\nBest graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.\nBest SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest.But how will they perform? That's the key question and the final bit of the MLID quote claims that, as an architecture, Blackwell won't deliver the same level of pure raster uplift that you saw going from the RTX 30-series to the RTX 40-series. The caveat to this is that final specs are still far from set in stone and the suggestion is a full GB202 chip might have enough about it to deliver a sufficient performance boost over the current RTX 4090 to make it feel like just as big of a jump as it was from the RTX 3090.The RTX 4090 after all doesn't use the full AD102 GPU, largely because Nvidia didn't feel like it needed to use up each perfect chip on its top consumer card.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDave JamesSocial Links NavigationEditor-in-Chief, HardwareDave has been gaming since the days of Zaxxon and Lady Bug on the Colecovision, and code books for the Commodore Vic 20 (Death Race 2000!).

[+] sector focused on mobile devices, 5G, IOT, AI and big data, celebrated in Barcelona, on March 3, 2022 in Barcelona, Spain.  (Photo by Joan Cros/NurPhoto via Getty Images)NurPhoto via Getty Images\nAdvanced Micro Devices stock (NASDAQ\nNDAQ\n: AMD) hosted an event to unveil its latest chips tailor-made for the booming artificial intelligence market. The newly launched chips include the Instinct MI300X - the third iteration of AMD\u2019s Instinct line of data center GPUs - and the Instinct MI300A, a CPU-GPU hybrid chip for servers. Tech giants, such as Meta and Microsoft\nMSFT\n, have expressed their intention to buy AMD\u2019s newest AI chip, as they look for alternatives to Nvidia. Nvidia currently holds a dominant position in the accelerated computing and AI applications market with high-end chips like the H100, known for training large language models and deploying AI applications. These Nvidia chips, priced at up to $40,000 apiece, are currently in short supply.\n\n\nFollowing the launch of OpenAI\u2019s surprisingly competent generative AI tool, ChatGPT, major tech players have been scrambling to incorporate AI into their software offerings, leading to a surge in demand for graphics processing units, the de-facto chips for running AI-related workloads. To get a sense of how big the demand surge is, we can take a look at Nvidia\u2019s recent earnings. Sales for Q3 rose by over 3x to $18 billion, while net income surged over 10x compared to last year to $9.2 billion.\n\nNow, AMD is an established player in the GPU space, although its chips have typically been used more for gaming and professional applications compared to Nvidia\u2019s chips which have been the go-to chips for accelerated computing. However, with the MI300 series, AMD is addressing its handicap in the AI space. AMD says that the MI300X platform will have 2.4x greater memory capacity, and 30% more compute power compared to Nvidia\u2019s H100 HGX platform. While AMD says that training performance for a large language model will be similar, the improved memory capabilities should result in greater cost savings, which could be crucial given the scale at which AI models operate. The memory specs of the new AMD chip are also ahead of Nvidia\u2019s newest chip, called the H200, which is expected to be launched during the second quarter of 2024. That said, Nvidia does have an edge compared to AMD given that it has spent years developing an ecosystem of sorts around its AI chips, with CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) programming languages and software, which give the company an edge in locking in some customers. This means that customers who have already invested in building applications using Nvidia\u2019s GPUs will likely continue to remain customers in the long run. While AMD is also improving its software suite called ROCm, Nvidia does have a head start on the software front.\n\n\nAMD stock has shown strong gains of 30% from levels of $90 in early January 2021 to around $115 now, vs. an increase of about 20% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 3-year period. However, the increase in AMD stock has been far from consistent. Returns for the stock were 57% in 2021, -55% in 2022, and 80% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 19% in 2023 - indicating that AMD underperformed the S&P in 2022.\n\nIn fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 - in good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Information Technology sector including AAPL, MSFT, and NVDA, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and AMZN.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Tax Software Of 2022Best Tax Software For The Self-Employed Of 2022Income Tax Calculator: Estimate Your Taxes\n\nIn contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could AMD face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?\n\nThe AI processor space is still in its infancy and it is unlikely to be a \u201cwinner takes all\u201d type of market. AMD still has a good shot at scaling up if its new chipsets perform as promised. The growth prospects are sizable. AMD has indicated the total market for AI GPUs could rise to $400 billion over the next four years. However, AMD isn\u2019t forecasting sizable sales for its new AI chips just yet, indicating that its total data center GPU revenue for 2024 could come in at about $2 billion. This compares to $14 billion in data center sales for Nvidia in Q3 alone (although this includes all the company\u2019s data-center-focused offerings, AI chips are likely to be the biggest contributor). AMD\u2019s valuation isn\u2019t exactly cheap at the current market price of $116 per share, considering that the stock trades at about 44x consensus 2023 earnings, despite revenue expected to contract for the year. We value AMD stock at about $122 per share, which is about 5% ahead of the current market price.

In a wide-ranging interview with Gelsinger, hosted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the Intel boss told attendees that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang \u201cgot extraordinarily lucky.\u201d He went on to lament Intel giving up the Larrabee project, which could have made Intel just as \u2018lucky,\u2019 in his view. However, the VP of Applied Deep Learning Research at Nvidia, Bryan Catanzaro, took to Twitter / X earlier today to dismiss Gelsinger\u2019s hot take on the status quo in the AI hardware industry, saying Intel lacked the vision and execution to succeed in its prior initiatives.\u00a0The Intel CEO\u2019s highlighting of \u2018lucky\u2019 Nvidia came in response to a question about 17 minutes into the video recorded by MIT. Daniela Rus, a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Director of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT, asked, \u201cWhat is Intel doing for the development of AI hardware, and how do you see that as a competitive advantage?\u201dGelsinger began his answer by talking about Intel\u2019s mistakes. According to the current CEO of Intel, the firm\u2019s fortunes took a dive when he left, but it is again on the path to glory. He recounted his 11 years in the wilderness (at EMC, then VMWare) and the sad fate that met Larrabee.Intel Larrabee prototype board (Image credit: leodanmarjod)\u201cWhen I was pushed out of Intel 13 years ago, they killed the project that would have changed the shape of AI,\u201d Gelsinger told his MIT audience, referencing the end of development work on Larrabee. Meanwhile, Jensen Huang is characterized as a hard worker who was single-mindedly pursuing advances in graphics but lucked out when AI acceleration began to be a much sought-after computing feature.Jensen Huang \u201cworked super hard at owning throughput computing, primarily for graphics initially, and then he got extraordinarily lucky,\u201d stated Gelsinger. He illustrated his point by asserting that when the green shoots of AI first popped up, Nvidia \u201cdidn't even want to support their first AI project.\u201dContinuing to lament the loss of Larrabee, or any kind of similar development thrust at Intel, Gelsinger explained Nvidia\u2019s dominance came partly from the fact that \u201cIntel basically did nothing in the space for 15 years.\u201d Don\u2019t worry, though, as Gelsinger heralds his own return, \u201cI come back, I have a passion, okay, we're going to start showing up in that space.\u201dAs well as developing hardware to accelerate AI, Gelsinger is keen on what he calls his number one strategy of democratizing AI. New hardware alone isn\u2019t the answer he says, it is also vital to \u201celiminate proprietary Technologies like CUDA.\u201d In the not-too-distant future, the Intel CEO sees this democratizing force as making high-performance AI available on every machine, from modest home users to developers, enterprises, and super-powerful servers.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Interestingly, Gelsinger predicts that, largely thanks to AI, we are on the precipice of \u201cone to two decades of sheer innovation.\u201d He reckons that we will get AI to tap resources far beyond the large but rather simple data sets that are being used now (mostly textual). Moreover, Intel is busy executing its plans and will \u201cbuild lots of fabs, so we can build lots of compute\u201d to address AI.Nvidia says noNvidia\u2019s VP of Applied Deep Learning Research, Bryan Catanzaro, issued a concise dismissal of Gelsinger\u2019s assertions about Nvidia benefitting from simple luck.I worked at Intel on Larrabee applications in 2007. Then I went to NVIDIA to work on ML in 2008. So I was there at both places at that time and I can say:NVIDIA's dominance didn't come from luck. It came from vision and execution. Which Intel lacked. https://t.co/ygUJZIQWLHDecember 20, 2023In the above Tweet (click to expand), we see a key Nvidia VP explain why he thinks \u201cNvidia\u2019s dominance didn't come from luck.\u201d Rather, he insists, \u201cIt came from vision and execution. Which Intel lacked.\u201dCatanzaro has worked at both companies, including spending time working on Larrabee applications in 2007, so he has insight into management decisions. However, we must temper his words with the knowledge that he is currently a green team player.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (51)\n\n\n\nMark TysonSocial Links NavigationNews EditorMark Tyson is a news editor at Tom's Hardware.

Xeon Phi didn't get cancelled... at least not until it had a chance to prove that x86 just couldn't match Nvidia in either HPC or AI workloads. And the reason Larrabee, itself, got cancelled was that it just couldn't compete with existing GPUs.\n\nHe should blame himself for his decision to use x86 in Larrabee, and not the ISA of their i915 chipset (and later iGPU) graphics.\n\nJensen Huang \u201cworked super hard at owning throughput computing, primarily for graphics initially, and then he got extraordinarily lucky,\u201d stated Gelsinger.What certainly wasn't luck was Nvidia's pivot towards HPC, their investments in CUDA (which, if you don't know, is totally separate from what games and interactive graphics use), and Nvidia's efforts to court and support users of GPU Compute in academia.\n\nOn that latter point, Nvidia created an entire academic symposium for stimulating development of GPU Compute, way back in 2009:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_GTC\nNone of that is \"luck\". Nvidia might not have guessed that AI would be the GPU Compute application which would take them to the next level, but they made sure they were positioned to benefit from any domains where GPU Compute took off.\n\n\nP.S. I'm neither a Nvidia fan, nor an Intel hater, but this revisionist history just bugs me. Credit (and blame) where it's due, please!\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthisisaname\n\n\nThe same could be said of Intel and it's chips, they got lucky too.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMakaveli\n\n\ni'm liking this NV vs intel a nice change from both of them vs AMD lol.\n\nLet them duke it out in the AI space and maybe we all benefit.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nendocine\n\n\nIntel has got to stop making stupid comments. \"Glued together\", \"AMD is in the rear view mirror\" \"Nvidia got lucky\". This is just garbage, no one cares what the current CEO thinks about nvidia, how does that help intel get out of the mess they dug themselves into, for which they have no one else to blame? Is Intel blaming its uncompetitive products on \"bad luck\", or is the reality that other companies out engineered them, identified novel markets, and executed?\nIntel: show us the competitive products that are better, otherwise, you are whining about losing, people are laughing at you, and no one is buying your garbage, your GPUs which totally suck, were late, buggy, non performant and have to be priced at firesale in order to move, or your crappy CPUs on old nodes from consumer to enterprise that use insane amounts of power\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwaltc3\n\n\nIt's very amusing to hear Gelsinger call both AMD and nVidia \"lucky\" (not the first time he's said this), with the proviso that the reason Intel found itself non-competitive was because Intel was merely \"unlucky.\" Just more proof that Gelsinger was the wrong man for the job. He can't get the old, dead Intel out of his mind, the monopolistic Intel that paid companies not to ship competitor's products for years. Gelsinger is a relic from those days, and apparently his mind is still there. More's the pity for Intel. \n\nBTW, Larrabee never worked, never did what people thought it would do--which it never could do--so Intel finally cancelled it prior to launching it. Had Larrabee actually launched, it would have been so disappointing compared to the pre-launch speculation and hype by Internet pundits who had never spent a day ray tracing themselves that it would have died quickly, anyway. Intel knew it, and canceled it. It was funny in those days to see the Internet pundits squirm when all that they maintained Larrabee would be died with a whimper. So many people had egg on their faces! I thought it was quite amusing at the time, as I never bought into the Larrabee hype and said so often--the \"real-time ray-tracing CPU that never was.\" Chip design and production execution are not accidents that fall out of the sky...! Gelsinger cannot face talking about the real reasons Intel lost its way--its obsession with being a monopoly instead of a brutally efficient competitor. Lots of that old, rancid corporate culture still lives inside of Intel, obviously. The suits have a hard time letting go of what was, but is no more. \"Luck\" has nothing to do with it.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nekio\n\n\nWell, both are right\u2026\nNGreedia would not even sell a tenth of their gpus to their best friend bitcoin farm if AI didn\u2019t take off like that.\n\nIntel was managed by incompetent greedy morons with short term vision for the past 15 years and now they almost collapsed.\nThey are literally being saved by the US government right now while Pat is pouring himself dozens of millions a year of salary\u2026\n\nI wish they both learn about being humble and work to get better products rather that get better stock prices\u2026 because better products make stock price skyrocket\u2026 look at AMD over the past 10 years.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit_user\n\n\nendocine said:Is Intel blaming its uncompetitive products on \"bad luck\",No. Did you read the article? He blamed it on the people who forced him out and killed Larrabee.\n\nwaltc3 said:with the proviso that the reason Intel found itself non-competitive was because Intel was merely \"unlucky.\"He never said Intel was \"unlucky\".\n\nwaltc3 said:Larrabee never worked, never did what people thought it would do--which it never could do--so Intel finally cancelled it prior to launching it.

I'm not sure about ROPs.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\natomicWAR\n\n\nbit_user said:He should blame himself for his decision to use x86 in Larrabee, and not the ISA of their i915 chipset (and later iGPU) graphics.You're on point here. Only thing I'd add is Intel has also killed their discrete gpu presence in in the late 90s with the i740 by under supporting it. They could have been light years ahead of where they are had they continued to progress with their discrete gpus instead of pivoting to iGPUs only at that time. Their lack of innovation in the gpu and AI space by extention is purely on them.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit_user\n\n\natomicWAR said:Only thing I'd add is Intel has also killed their discrete gpu presence in in the late 90s with the i740 by under supporting it.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\n\n\n\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger came out swinging at Nvidia's CUDA technology, claiming that inference technology will be more important than training for AI as he launched Intel Core Ultra and 5th Gen Xeon datacenter chips in an event here in New York City. Taking questions at the NASDAQ, Gelsinger suggested that Nvidia\u2019s CUDA dominance in training wouldn't last forever.\n\n\"You know, the entire industry is motivated to eliminate the CUDA market,\" Gelsinger said. He cited examples such as MLIR, Google, and OpenAI, suggesting that they are moving to a \"Pythonic programming layer\" to make AI training more open.\n\n\"We think of the CUDA moat as shallow and small,\" Gelsinger went on. \"Because the industry is motivated to bring a broader set of technologies for broad training, innovation, data science, et cetera.\"\n\nBut Intel isn't relying just on training. Instead, it thinks inference is the way to go.\"As inferencing occurs, hey, once you've trained the model\u2026 There is no CUDA dependency,\" Gelsinger continued. \"It's all about, can you run that model well?\" He suggested that with Gaudi 3, shown on stage for the first time, that Intel will be up to the challenge, and will be able to do it as well with Xeon and edge PCs. Not that Intel won't compete in training, but \"fundamentally, the inference market is where the game will be at,\" Gelsinger said.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)He also took the opportunity to push OpenVINO, the standard that Intel has gathered around for its AI efforts, and predicted a world of mixed computing, some that occurs in the cloud, and others that happen on your PC.\n\nSandra Rivera, executive vice president and general manager of the Data Center and AI Group at Intel, added that Intel's scale from the data center to the PC may make it a partner of choice, as it can produce at volume.\n\n\"We're going to compete three ways for 100% of the datacenter AI TAM.\" Gelsinger said, tacking onto Rivera's comment. \"With our leadership CEOs, leadership accelerators, and as a foundry. Every one of those internal opportunities is available to us: The TPUs, the inferentias, the trainiums, et cetera. We're going to pursue all of those. And we're going to pursue every commercial opportunity as well, with NVIDIA, with AMD, et cetera. We're going to be a foundry player.\"\n\nIt's a bold strategy, and Gelsinger appeared confident as he led his team through presentations today. Can he truly take on CUDA? Only time will tell as applications for the chips Intel launched today \u2014 and that his competitors are also working on \u2014 become more widespread.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (63)\n\n\n\nAndrew E.

TMSC provides these \u201cchip plants,\u201d and the company is said to be considering building a third fab in Japan to meet demand.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJapan latest nation to want GPU reserve\u00a0\nJapan is the latest country to look to GPUs as a national strategic asset.\nEarlier this year, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and the UK said that they were each planning on building their own GPU stockpiles \u2013 a necessity for countries that want to have a leading role in this frontier industry.\nChina is also trying to build out its supply of GPUs, but this is being complicated by US sanctions that prohibit chips of a certain speed from being exported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo-called sanctions-friendly chips are in the pipeline from Nvidia but are reportedly delayed.\nThese restrictions have meant that firms in China are reportedly re-purposing consumer-grade GPUs to fill this gap for processing-hungry companies with AI workloads. Recent data from Jon Peddie Research shows that the PC-based GPU market grew to 71.9 million units, while PC CPU shipments fell by 5.1% year over year.\u00a0\u00a0\nNvidia faced increased scrutiny\nAuthorities in the US are not fans of Nvidia\u2019s tactic of creating regulatory-compliant chips for export to China, with Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo recently saying, \u201cIf you redesign a chip around a particular cut line that enables them to do AI, I\u2019m going to control it the very next day.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently, Taiwan\u2019s economics minister Wang Mei-hua reminded firms on the island to be compliant with US rules. A delegation of US officials is expected to arrive in Taipei later in December to meet with industry officials to discuss the regulations.\u00a0\nChina\u2019s Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba, and Bytedance were all large purchasers of Nvidia\u2019s H100 GPUs with the four companies collectively purchasing 125,000 of the chips.\nIn comparison, Microsoft and Meta each reportedly purchased 150,000 of the GPUs in 2023 with Google and Amazon purchasing 50,000 each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s Huang has noted that US sanctions mean there\u2019s a massive incentive for Chinese chip designers to play catch-up to Nvidia, and there are dozens of companies trying.\nSo far, the latest GPU chips from China\u2019s Longsoon have a long way to go, according to publicly available benchmarks.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRelated content\n\n \n\n\nOpinion\n\nApple has to climb the mountain\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Jonny Evans \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n5 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIT Leadership\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTechnology Industry\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nIDC: 80% of companies plan to buy AI PCs this year\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Lucas Mearian \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 14, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n6 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCPUs and Processors\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Privacy\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDesktop PCs\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\nDeepSeek \u2014 Latest news and insights\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Dan Muse \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 13, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n6 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmerging Technology\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGenerative AI\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTechnology Industry\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nGoogle reportedly looking at smart glasses \u2014 again\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Lynn Greiner \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n5 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAugmented Reality\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGoogle\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTechnology Industry\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Sections\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPodcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVideos\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tResources\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEvents\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpotlight: Managing modern risks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom our editors straight to your inbox\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tGet started by entering your email address below.\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email address\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                        by                                                             Sam Reynolds\n\n\nContributor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Reynolds is a Taipei-based journalist and contributing writer.\n\n\n\n\nMore from this author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnewsMeta sues former executive over alleged AI theft Mar 12, 2024 3 minsnewsAI chips don\u2019t need trillion-dollar investments: Nvidia CEO Feb 13, 2024 3 minsnewsIntel to make chips in US for Taiwan\u2019s UMC Jan 31, 2024 5 minsnewsTeradyne is the latest victim of the US-China chip war Jan 30, 2024 2 minsnewsAI-enabled PCs will drive PC sales growth in 2024, say research firms Jan 11, 2024 3 minsnewsAdobe anticipates \u2018significant penalty\u2019 for complex cancellation practices Dec 14, 2023 3 minsnewsTaiwan\u2019s \u2018silicon shield\u2019 is cracking as US-China chip war rages Dec 07, 2023 4 minsnewsOpenAI signed $51M deal to buy \u2018brain\u2019 chips from Sam Altman portfolio firm Dec 04, 2023 4 mins \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow me morePopularArticlesPodcastsVideos\n\n\nopinion  Enterprises seeking on-prem AI deployments should look at the Mac By Jonny Evans\nMar 18, 20255 mins\nAppleGenerative AIMac\n\n\n\n\nnews  HP rolls out new AI-powered laptops and desktops for enterprises By Taryn Plumb\nMar 18, 20255 mins\nHPWindows PCs\n\n\n\n\nnews  Windows 11 update accidentally removes Copilot, causes issues for Citrix users By Gyana Swain\nMar 18, 20255 mins\nCitrix SystemsMicrosoftWindows 11\n\n\n\n\npodcast  Podcast: Employees want more AI tools from their employers \nMar 11, 202530 mins\nArtificial IntelligenceEmployee ExperienceGenerative AI\n\n\n\n\npodcast  Podcast: A deeper look at how banks, financial firms are exploring agentic AI \nFeb 18, 202530 mins\nArtificial IntelligenceBankingGenerative AI\n\n\n\n\npodcast  Podcast: What are digital employees, and will your next co-worker be one?

Founder and Principal Analyst,\nCambrian-AI Research LLCFollow AuthorDec 05, 2023, 08:36am ESTShareSaveCommentNvidia\u2019s pre-emptive strike may blunt AMD MI300 news, pointing to the company's key advantage in AI software. \n\nAMD will host a big announcement this week in San Jose, where the company will announce details about its new flagship GPU for generative AI, the MI300. Nonetheless, Nvidia remains confident that its hardware, software and integrated systems will keep the company in the lead. To prove the point, Nvidia announced new benchmarks changing the game. Again.\n\n\nFor the first time, Nvidia has run three sizes of Llama2, the popular open-source AI model from Meta, on the H200, comparing it to the older A100 chip with earlier versions of its Nemo LLM framework. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nWhat did Nvidia Announce?\nThe company ran two benchmarks, one measuring training performance and the second measuring inference performance. Nvidia ran both with an updated version of the TensorRT-LLM software announced last September and a new version of its Nemo foundation model framework that, among other enhancements outlined in Nvidia\u2019s blog, uses the new TRT-LLM. Amazon used Nemo to train their Titan model at the recent re:invent announcements highlighting the renewed partnership with Nvidia.\n\n\nFor training, Nvidia ran three model sizes on the new H200. Model sizes ranged from a 7B (Billion parameter) model to a more capable 70B parameter LLM model. In all cases, the new Nemo produced excellent performance improvements.Nvidia HW and SW improved inference performance by over 5XNvidia\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of September 2023By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of September 2023By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nNone of this should surprise anyone; Nvidia has always said that Hopper would be 4-6 times faster than the older A100. And it is.\nHowever, the performance increase in inference performance due to new software is astonishing. Nvidia demonstrated up to 5.6 times better performance on Llama2 on the same H100 hardware. The 5.6x improvement was with Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) using Llama 2. The net here is that Nvidia now provides open-source software that can significantly improve the performance of currently available hardware.\n\nAs another example, Nvidia can now support inference processing for the Falcon 180B on a single GPU, leveraging TensorRT-LLM\u2019s advanced 4-bit quantization feature while maintaining 99% accuracy. Part of the improvement is a software optimization that Nvidia researchers developed a new Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ) technology that enables 4-bit precision while preserving prediction accuracy. Falcon is a conversational LLM developed by the UAE's Technology Innovation Institute (TII), and the 180B model is its largest. As a reference, it can take 8-16 GPUs to infer text on GPT-3 and -4.\n\n Nvidia also published a suite of training benchmarks on its blog, demonstrating up to 5.6 times ... [+] better performance than the A100.Nvidia\nConclusions\nNo matter how competitive an LLM platform can be, whether from Intel, Google, Cerebras or AMD, continually optimized software remains Nvidia\u2019s ace in the hole. Nvidia has more software than hardware engineers, and as these results show, it is software that makes AI sing. This update is the second major update in just three months after launching the TensorRT-LLM in September.\nWe remain optimistic about the new chip from AMD. Nvidia will have a significant challenger in AMD for the first time, and we are anxious to hear how AMD's software strategy has improved.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Disclosures: This article expresses the author's opinions andshould not be taken as advice to purchase from or invest in the companies mentioned.

NVIDIA Reflex is now used by over 50 million players each month, is available in 9 of the top 10 competitive shooters, including Counter-Strike 2, Fortnite, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Call of Duty: Warzone, and is activated by 90% of GeForce gamers in over 90 supported titles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex is synonymous with responsive gaming, and can be found in the latest and greatest games. Since our last update, RoboCop: Rogue City, THE FINALS, and THRONE AND LIBERTY have all launched with support, and the latest seasons of your most played games are enhanced with Reflex, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Warzone Season 1, Diablo IV: Season of Blood, Fortnite: Chapter 5, and Overwatch 2: Season 8.\nRead on for all the details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE FINALS Is Out Now & Plays Best On GeForce RTX\nEmbark Studios\u2019 THE FINALS is a free-to-play shooter set in a highly destructive world, making each match unique. Players form teams of three and enter tournaments that see the lowest-ranked teams dropped, concluding with a one-on-one grand finale for the title of champion. The goal is to collect, carry, and bank boxes of cash - the team with the most cash at the end of the round wins. But team wipes and steals see the pendulum of success swing widely from moment to moment, putting contestants on the edges of their seats each and every match.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday evening at The Game Awards, THE FINALS was launched on Steam in a surprise announcement, giving gamers instant access to environments that can be blown apart by explosives and an arsenal of weapons. As buildings are blown open, and walls come crashing down, the world\u2019s lighting needs to react realistically as light is occluded or disoccluded. To make this a reality, NVIDIA RTXGI is used to accurately calculate and update light and shadow in real-time on all platforms.\nWith a GeForce RTX GPU in your PC or laptop, RTXGI can leverage hardware-accelerated ray tracing to produce richer and more realistic global illumination effects. When enabled, you\u2019ll experience light realistically bouncing around the environment, reacting to destruction, and interacting with volumetric fog and smoke. And light and shadow will look even better.\nTo ensure frame rates stay high in this fast-paced shooter, GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers can activate NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation, and all other GeForce RTX players can enable DLSS 2 Super Resolution.\nUsing DLSS 3, performance multiplies, with ray tracing and all other settings maxed out. To make gameplay even more responsive in THE FINALS, all GeForce gamers with GPUs dating back to the GTX 900 Series can enable NVIDIA Reflex, which reduces system latency by up to 57%.\nWith Reflex, DLSS, and hardware-accelerated ray tracing, GeForce RTX gamers will receive the definitive experience in THE FINALS. See for yourself in our new frag video, leveraging all three technologies to deliver the best gameplay possible:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload THE FINALS on Steam, and install our new Game Ready Driver to further optimize gameplay.\nCall of Duty: Warzone Adds DLSS 3, Modern Warfare III Pre-Game Full Ray Tracing; Reflex Supported In All Modes\nOn December 6th, Season 1 for Call of Duty\u00ae: Modern Warfare\u00ae III and Call of Duty\u00ae: Warzone\u2122 went live. Tons of new in-game content was introduced, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Warzone lobbies added full ray tracing to enhance the appearance of your loadout, characters and vehicles, and Call of Duty: Warzone added support for DLSS 3, following its addition to all other modes and campaigns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Call of Duty: Warzone, the free-to-play massive combat arena title, players can now deploy to Urzikstan, the game\u2019s newest big map, which is sure to excite veterans and newcomers alike. This high-density urban layout has exciting points of interest, and players can move through this city landscape with the return of slide cancel, as well as more responsive movement allowing for faster-paced play. With exhilarating new features such as the Drivable Train, Horizontal Ziplines, new Gulag map, and gameplay features, it\u2019s time to call up the squad and drop in.\nFor GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers, Season 1 sees the debut of NVIDIA DLSS 3 in Call of Duty: Warzone, multiplying performance. GeForce RTX 20 Series and 30 Series gamers can boost performance with DLSS 2 Super Resolution.\nAnd if performance is high enough already in your opinion, you can instead enable NVIDIA DLAA, an AI-based anti-aliasing mode that utilizes the same technology developed for DLSS. DLAA uses a native resolution image to maximize image quality, rather than boosting performance, for an even richer, more detailed experience.\nAdditionally, all GeForce gamers, dating back to users of the GeForce GTX 900 Series, can activate NVIDIA Reflex.\nIn Call of Duty: Warzone, NVIDIA Reflex reduces system latency by up to 28%, and combined with the super fast frame rates delivered by DLSS, you can let your skill shine when competing on the battlefields of Urzikstan, Ashika Island and Vondel.\nWith the release of Season 1 for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Warzone, NVIDIA DLSS 3, NVIDIA DLSS 2, NVIDIA DLAA, NVIDIA Reflex, and NVIDIA Image Scaling are now supported in all modes, as well in every Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II mode, giving GeForce RTX gamers the definitive PC experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, pre-game full ray tracing has been added to Modern Warfare III and Warzone lobbies, and the Firing Range, enabling you to view your operators and loadouts in an entirely new light. All GeForce RTX gamers can activate full ray tracing via the Video options menu, and doing so will automatically enable NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 with DLSS Ray Reconstruction. Ray Reconstruction replaces hand-tuned ray tracing denoisers with a new unified AI model, elevating the image quality of ray-traced effects and full ray tracing to new heights, further enhancing detail, realism and immersion. Get all the details here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFortnite Chapter 5 Now Available, New Fortnite Experiences, Each Enhanced By Reflex, DLSS 2, & Ray Tracing\nFortnite\u2019s Unreal Engine 5 upgrade brought astonishing new visuals to the world\u2019s most popular Battle Royale.

Explore iconic locations and meet familiar faces from the world of RoboCop, with voice work by Peter Weller, the original RoboCop who\u2019s returned to duty in RoboCop: Rogue City.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 40 Series gamers can activate DLSS 3 Frame Generation in this Unreal Engine 5-powered shooter, all other GeForce RTX players can enable DLSS 2 Super Resolution, and players with performance to spare can max out image quality with DLAA.\nOn GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards, DLSS 3 multiplies performance by an average of 2.6X at 4K, enabling players with the GeForce RTX 4070 through 4090 to play at over 60 FPS, and up to 170 FPS, with every option cranked to the max. And by activating NVIDIA Reflex, system latency is reduced by up to 52%, further improving the responsiveness of gunplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiablo IV: Season of Blood Is Enhanced By Reflex\nGeForce gamers can improve responsiveness in Diablo\u00ae IV by enabling NVIDIA Reflex. In the game\u2019s latest season, Season of Blood, system latency is reduced by up to 55%\u2014and GeForce gamers can now measure their PC Latency in Diablo IV using GeForce Experience\u2019s Performance Overlay or FrameView.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad your system with a GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU and you can play at up to 390 FPS thanks to DLSS 3 - together with Reflex\u2019s improvements, you\u2019ll have the definitive Diablo IV experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounter-Strike 2 Available Now For All, Featuring NVIDIA Reflex\nIn case you missed the news, Counter-Strike 2 has been officially released, and we\u2019ve worked closely with Valve to integrate NVIDIA Reflex for reduced system latency. If you\u2019ve got a GeForce GTX 900 Series or newer GPU, you can reduce system latency by up to 35% by simply enabling NVIDIA Reflex. See for yourself in our Counter-Strike 2 frag video, where frame rates exceed 400 FPS, and latency is as low as 5.5 milliseconds:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoupled with a GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU, gamers can hit sub 15 ms latency, which is why Counter-Strike 2 GeForce gamers have overwhelmingly adopted Reflex, with over 90% of them playing with Reflex enabled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivating Reflex lowers system latency, allowing you to acquire targets faster, react more quickly, and increase aim precision in Counter-Strike 2. 3kliksphilip and Shroud recently tried it out for themselves - watch their videos to hear their thoughts on how Reflex helps deliver a superior experience:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more in our Counter-Strike 2 NVIDIA Reflex launch article, and further reduce your system\u2019s latency by following our Counter-Strike 2 Reflex Steam guide.\nOverwatch 2 Season 8: Call of the Hunt Available Now & Enhanced By Reflex\nNVIDIA Reflex enables GeForce gamers to play with minimal system latency in Overwatch 2\u2019s highly competitive multiplayer matches. Overwatch 2 Season 8: Call of the Hunt launched earlier this week, and headlining the season is the introduction of Mauga, a powerful, brawling Tank Hero who will tear through the competition with his incendiary and volatile chainguns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMauga features a kit that is designed to bash through the front lines and brawl with his opponents in close-quarter combat, by wielding two powerful chainguns that can either be fired individually or in unison. Ignite enemies with his Incendiary Chaingun \u201cGunny\u201d to burn them when they take enough damage, then finish them with a critical hit from his Volatile Chaingun \u201cCha-Cha.\u201d Paired with his Berserker Passive ability, which grants Mauga temporary health whenever he deals critical damage, he\u2019s a mountain on the battlefield.\nMauga\u2019s not just a leading star\u2014he also brings a host of new abilities to support his team as well. Mauga can break his way through the front lines with Overrun, a charging ability that cannot be stopped by any crowd control abilities, and stomps into opponents dealing a powerful knockback. When the fight gets intense for his team, he has Cardiac Overdrive to engage both of his hearts and create an aura that reduces incoming damage and allies to heal themselves while dealing damage.\nFinally, when he really wants to tango up close with his foes, Mauga can unleash Cage Fight, his Ultimate ability. Cage Fight traps nearby opponents in a cylindrical fighting ring. This barrier blocks enemy incoming damage or healing from the outside, forcing those trapped inside to face Mauga with Gunny, Cha Cha, and a barrage of infinite ammunition. If you can\u2019t take him down quickly, the last thing you might see is his charming smile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing NVIDIA Reflex on a GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU, your actions have improved responsiveness in Overwatch 2 Season 8, occurring virtually without delay, and performance is so high that you\u2019ll see the action at its best with maximum clarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivate NVIDIA Reflex now and in all future seasons of Overwatch 2 to give yourself the best chance of success.\nMore To Come Soon\nEven more new NVIDIA Reflex games, plus Reflex-compatible mice and monitors are on their way, so stay tuned to GeForce.com to learn more when the news drops; check out the complete list of currently supported games and devices on our NVIDIA Reflex website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In more recent times, we\u2019ve had a strange kind of love-hate relationship with Team Green, mainly because it makes great graphics cards, but then tends to also make massive dents in our bank balance if we want to, you know, actually buy them.The pricing of Nvidia\u2019s Lovelace GPUs was sky-high for the high-end models released last year, but what about this year? How did the company fare when more affordable RTX 4000 graphics cards were launched? Let\u2019s dig into this, and also where Team Green made its big bucks \u2013 spoiler alert, not from you or me, or other gamers \u2013 as we evaluate Nvidia\u2019s 2023.(Image credit: NVIDIA)Nvidia kicks off with big guns for laptops and the RTX 4070 TiRight at the start of the year, Nvidia was ready to pounce with a raft of Lovelace launches at CES 2023.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia in 2024: year in review\n\n\n\n\nAMD in 2024: year in review\n\n\n\nFirst of all, we got RTX 4000 GPUs for laptops, and there were a bunch of these. A full house, in fact: RTX 4050, 4060, 4070, 4080 and 4090 GPUs.These mobile graphics cards were generally well-received, even if there were some complaints about the RTX 4090\u2019s relative spec compared to the desktop incarnation \u2013 though it\u2019s still an undeniably powerful laptop performer (if very pricey \u2013 no surprises there, though). And also there was the matter of the RTX 4070 mobile being perceived as something of a weak link in some quarters (with the 4080 offering a pretty sizeable step up in performance).Secondly, Nvidia brought in a new desktop Lovelace graphics card to follow up on the RTX 4090 and 4080, the first two RTX 4000 GPUs which were launched late in 2022.(Image credit: Future)The upper-mid-range RTX 4070 Ti was revealed at CES 2023 and went on sale swiftly after the show, but there was a problem with this new graphics card. Yes, it was cheaper \u2013 and finally a more affordable Lovelace GPU, hitting shelves with an MSRP of $799 in the US (and in line with that elsewhere), compared to the RTX 4080 which was a far weightier $1,199 (a truly wallet-worrying increase in comparison to the RTX 3080).Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.However, the trouble with the RTX 4070 Ti was that it looked suspiciously like the canceled RTX 4080 12GB \u2013 and some were disappointed at the relatively modest upgrade compared to its predecessor. Still, it wasn\u2019t a bad GPU as such, just not everything we hoped it would be (and the 12GB of VRAM remained a definite blot on the spec landscape).This was only the start of the desktop GPU launches for Lovelace in 2023, though, and one particular graphics card was to make a much more impressive entrance and bigger impact on the market.(Image credit: NVIDIA)Nvidia\u2019s RTX 4070 \u2013 the Lovelace championThe RTX 4070 took a while to turn up after its 4070 Ti stablemate hit the shelves, but the graphics card that took the crown of the best Nvidia GPU in 2023 finally arrived in April.We called the RTX 4070 the \u201cultimate 1440p gaming card\u201d and praised its fantastic price/performance ratio, even though it did notch up the price over the RTX 3070 (by 20%), meaning it was undeniably pricey for what\u2019s a mid-range card. Still, this GPU was such a power-packed mid-ranger that it held the top spot in our best graphics card roundup for around half a year, until AMD\u2019s RX 7800 XT turned up in September to steal the crown.So, while the price hike was regrettable, the value proposition was still strong, and the RTX 4070 offered performance levels that equated to the RTX 3080, or even 3080 Ti in some cases \u2013 and it was certainly more affordable than those cards.This was, and remains, the highlight of Nvidia\u2019s Lovelace range in our books, and a high point for Team Green in 2023.(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)Trio of RTX 4060 models brought some budget relief (of sorts)From a high point, to a considerably lower one in some respects, we also witnessed the debut of RTX 4060 models this year. These were much-awaited graphics cards, given Nvidia\u2019s lackluster performance at the budget end of the market as we discussed at length this time a year ago in our overview of Nvidia\u2019s 2022.The RTX 4060 Ti was the first model to pitch up in May and it was seriously disappointing with its pricing and lack of VRAM (just 8GB, combined with a narrower memory bus than its predecessor, though it made up for this in other ways to an extent). Overall \u2013 DLSS 3 and Lovelace bells and whistles aside \u2013 this initial debut was not all that much faster than the RTX 3060 Ti, and rather underwhelming, frankly.The 8GB version was also shied away from due to the knowledge that a 16GB variant of the 4060 Ti was in the works, and it came out in July. But this spin disappointed too, with the same memory bus holding back the larger quantity of video RAM \u2013 no other upgrades were applied, aside from the VRAM doubling \u2013 and the 4060 Ti was a good deal pricier too.The most sensible release in this bracket of Lovelace GPUs was the RTX 4060, which arrived in-between the two 4060 Ti models, landing in June. While the RTX 4060 caught a good deal of flak from gamers and reviewers alike, as we argued at the time, it\u2019s actually a pretty solid value-for-money graphics card \u2013 if unfortunately positioned (in terms of comparisons drawn to the RTX 3060 Ti, a board that was unusually good from Nvidia\u2019s last-gen).The RTX 4060 also had its thunder rather stolen by AMD\u2019s RX 7600 which took the top spot in our list of the best cheap graphics cards and held it.All in all, the RTX 4060 family was a somewhat shaky proposition, but the RTX 4060 itself is a 1080p workhorse that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked (even though it was, to some extent). Finally, Nvidia offered something palatable at the budget end of the market (particularly when you consider the additional benefits of DLSS 3, of course, for games that support it).(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)Lovelace in 2023: pricing and sales woesAn overriding factor with Nvidia\u2019s graphics cards this year was that price tags remained pitched on the high side. As noted, there was some relief at least with the RTX 4060, but elsewhere gamers were still left with a feeling that Nvidia was determined to push the boundaries with levels of pricing, trying to extract as much profit as possible without turning off buyers completely.This led to some pretty terrible reported sales for some of its graphics cards, like the RTX 4060 Ti (8GB), which sold poorly on its release \u2013 and the 16GB version was launched without any notice (or sending out cards to reviewers). It\u2019s no surprise Nvidia wanted to keep that model released on the quiet, though.The most woeful tale of graphics cards sitting on shelves gathering dust this year was the RTX 4080, though (a GPU launched last year, of course). According to rumors and anecdotal reports \u2013 though there was a good old weight of these \u2013 sales levels were truly dire for the RTX 4080 throughout 2023. Gamers either went for the RTX 4070 Ti, or pushed to save for an RTX 4090 if they wanted to go really powerful, skipping over the RTX 4080 (or so went the whispers from the grapevine).And it makes sense that the RTX 4080 performed in a distinctly wobbly fashion, demand-wise, when you consider the strong rumors that Nvidia is going to revamp this whole space in the Lovelace line-up, scrapping the 4080 in theory and replacing it with an RTX 4080 Super. (Along with an RTX 4070 Ti Super, maybe, or plain 4070 Super, or perhaps both of these GPUs).In other words, this heavy reworking could be read as Nvidia admitting it has made a mistake in terms of where its existing upper-mid-to-high-end GPUs are pitched, particularly the RTX 4080. Rather backing up those stories of dreadful sales figures, it must be said.There were definite problems here, in short, for Nvidia, but we shouldn\u2019t forget that despite these speedbumps, Team Green is still by far the dominant player in the desktop GPU market. AMD\u2019s graphics cards did take advantage of these mentioned weaknesses, and sold better certainly according to some metrics, but it was hardly a case of Nvidia losing its GPU crown. (Team Green still holds around an 80% share of the desktop market).(Image credit: Nvidia)Sky high AIWe can talk about GeForce graphics cards until the polygonal cows come home \u2013 in a beautiful ray-traced sunset no doubt \u2013 but this wasn\u2019t what Nvidia was really focused on in 2023. It wasn\u2019t gaming that was the priority for Team Green, of course, but AI \u2013 where the real cash cows were to be milked.AI chips were the force that helped drive record revenue in Q3 2023 as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang declared that the \u201cera of generative AI is taking off\u201d and Team Green joined the $1 trillion club with its market value spiralling upwards. Even the US ban on selling this silicon to China, a huge market, that kicked in from November, didn\u2019t dampen the prospect of massive profits going forward (the money will just be raked in from other regions, we\u2019re told). So, the importance of this growth market that Nvidia is firmly plugged into can\u2019t be underestimated.Why are we banging on about AI? Because it could, in theory, explain high pricing maintained on the consumer front. With the boom in AI chip sales offering such a tempting level of profits, this may have been part of the reason why Nvidia held on to higher levels of pricing for consumer GPUs (and purportedly pulled back on GeForce production mid-year). Why sell off Lovelace at anything less than a premium, when producing these GeForce graphics cards is a distant second fiddle to the money to be made in the explosive growth of AI right now?Indeed, here at TechRadar this year we\u2019ve even had conversations about whether regarding gaming GPUs, Nvidia might just chuck it all in down the line (maybe after RTX 5000, or 6000) and focus on AI full-stop. There are a lot of factors to consider there, mind you, not the least of which is that the big players have plans to make their own AI chips to save costs, with Microsoft being the latest tech giant to be heading down that particular avenue.(Image credit: Remedy Entertainment)DLSS 3.5 \u2013 the best gets even betterNvidia continued to impress with its efforts to boost frame rates with upscaling tricks, following up on the release of DLSS 3 last year with DLSS 3.5. This new version arrived in August and was made to improve ray tracing fps (frames per second) specifically, using \u2018ray reconstruction\u2019 for better image quality.Essentially, with DLSS 3.5 turned on in ray-traced games that support it \u2013 like Cyberpunk 2077 and Alan Wake 2 \u2013 you\u2019ll get a higher level of detail and sharpness, and faster frame rates.This marked a major development as it helps to make ray tracing a more realistic proposition without tanking the poor old frame rate excessively, and the really exciting bit \u2013 for those who don\u2019t have an RTX 4000 GPU \u2013 is that ray reconstruction also benefits RTX 3000 and 2000 graphics cards. Finally, some of Nvidia\u2019s new graphics trickery has made its way to previous-gen GPUs.On top of this, as the year rolled to an end, Nvidia announced that over 500 games (and apps) now support RTX technologies, meaning ray tracing or DLSS (or both). That\u2019s a pretty wide-ranging level of support now.(Image credit: NVIDIA)GeForce Now also got betterIn January, the top tier of the cloud gaming service was upgraded to the GeForce Now Ultimate subscription, powered by RTX 4080 GPUs and streaming at up to 240 fps, while bringing lag (ping) down considerably to make for a much smoother gameplay experience.Furthermore, Nvidia\u2019s streaming service got a whole lot of new games in 2023, and that included titles from Microsoft\u2019s PC Game Pass library (a hundred of them, in fact). Along with this (and tied up with Microsoft\u2019s acquisition) we witnessed the first appearance of Activision games on GeForce Now (since they were briefly available at launch, then vanished). A trio of Call of Duty titles pitched up in November: Modern Warfare 3, Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone.(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)Concluding thoughtsNvidia had a great 2023 in a lot of ways \u2013 certainly when it came to the company coffers. Team Green joined the $1 trillion club and rode the AI wave \u2013 the hottest bandwagon in tech town in a long, long time \u2013 with considerable glee.But while Nvidia made friends with all those big tech companies desperate for high quality, heavyweight GPUs to drive their AI advancements, the firm\u2019s relationship with gamers remained a more torrid affair.Okay, there\u2019s no doubting some good things happened with PC gaming this year. Finally, we experienced some budget joy with the RTX 4060, and a sterling mid-range GPU in the RTX 4070, even if the latter was more costly than we ideally would\u2019ve liked. But there were also disappointments, particularly with pricing on a general level, which continued to be a thorn in the side of gamers in the main, as the RTX 4060 Ti and last year\u2019s RTX 4080 sold particularly poorly by all accounts. Not to mention that Nvidia let AMD take the budget crown with the RX 7600.DLSS 3 remained the gift that keeps on giving \u2013 with older-generation GPUs getting some love, finally, with ray reconstruction \u2013 leaving AMD huffing and puffing to catch up with its own take on upscaling (FSR).On balance, 2023 must go down as a good year overall for Nvidia, there can be no arguing on that score \u2013 but we can only hope for some further relief on the pricing front when it comes to the GeForce GPUs that arrive next year to complete the Lovelace line-up.\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.Nvidia is launching a graphics card specifically for China to comply with US export controls. In a product page on the Chinese version of Nvidia\u2019s website, the chipmaker introduces the RTX 4090D: a GPU that\u2019s less powerful than the flagship RTX 4090 it sells elsewhere.The RTX 4090D has fewer CUDA cores than its RTX 4090 counterpart, topping out at 14,592 as opposed to 16,384. It also has a slightly lower power draw at 425W instead of 450W. Although most of the other specs remain the same between the two versions of the chips, the RTX 4090D is still around \u201c5% slower in gaming and creating,\u201d Nvidia spokesperson Benjamin Berraondo said in an emailed statement to The Verge.Image: Nvidia ChinaNvidia launched the GPU after the US tightened export restrictions on high-end chips shipped to China. Not only do the new restrictions prevent Nvidia from selling the less-powerful H800 and A800 AI GPUs it developed for the Chinese market, but they also bar the company from selling the RTX 4090 in the country.\u201cThe GeForce RTX 4090 D has been designed to fully comply with U.S. government export controls,\u201d Berraondo said, adding that the company \u201cextensively engaged with the U.S. government\u201d when developing the chip.Image: Nvidia ChinaThe RTX 4090D will be available in China starting in January for \uffe512,999 (~$1,836 USD). Its release may help quell the increasing demand for powerful graphics cards in China, which has reportedly led some factories in the country to dismantle and repurpose the banned RTX 4090 for AI.Update December 29th, 1:13PM ET: Added a statement from Nvidia.See More: AINewsNvidiaPolicyTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

To facilitate this, Nvidia has established a dedicated venture capital arm called NVentures, which, alongside its corporate development team, has built a portfolio that includes prominent AI players such as Inflection AI and Cohere.\nNvidia\u2019s portfolio also features investments in Hugging Face, a provider of data and tools for AI developers, and CoreWeave, a cloud infrastructure company specializing in high-performance computing applications that depend on Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs), per the report. Recently, Nvidia made a substantial investment in Mistral, a Paris-based AI startup valued at 2 billion euros (about $2.2 billion).\nAll the companies in Nvidia\u2019s portfolio are also customers of the chipmaker, utilizing either its GPU chips or software, according to the report. Particularly sought-after this year in Silicon Valley is Nvidia\u2019s H100 GPU, a powerful processor that enables creators of \u201clarge language models\u201d to train their systems more efficiently, making it a valuable asset for companies in the generative AI field.\nNvidia\u2019s investment approach involves writing significant checks, often in the tens of millions of dollars, from its own balance sheet, the report said. While NVentures aims to generate healthy returns from its investments, the corporate development team focuses on strategic purposes. Nvidia takes the lead in investment rounds and also co-invests alongside venture capital firms.\nIt was reported in September that Nvidia has become the go-to company for computer chips used in AI processes, which has shut off the funding tap for its potential competitors.\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n                        Recommended                    \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Financial Leaders: How AI Transforms Compliance and Risk Management                                \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Klarna Files for IPO, Promises Investors \u2018New Era of Finance\u2019                                \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Gen Z Accounts for Largest Increase in Paycheck-to-Paycheck Consumers                                \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Levelpath Integrates Procurement Automation Capabilities With Coupa\u2019s Spend Management Platform                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee More In:                    AI, artificial intelligence, chipmakers, Cohere, funding, Inflection AI, Investments, News, NVIDIA, PYMNTS News, software, startups, Technology, What's Hot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Trending News    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Exclusive: Citi Ventures Partner on Emerging AI Trends in FinTech            \n\n\n\n\n                Apple Brings Tap to Pay to 9 New European Countries            \n\n\n\n\n                Bakkt Suffers Major Set Back as Bank Partners Drop Platform            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        The Big Story    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Why the EV Dream May Be Crashing in America            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n        Featured News    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Why Account Validation Changes When Banks Say Yes            \n\n\n\n\n                Study Finds Cash Flow Crisis Deepening for Small Businesses Amid Tariffs and Consumer Pullback            \n\n\n\n\n                90% of Healthcare C-Suite Sees Positive Return From GenAI            \n\n\n\n\n                AI\u2019s Next Job Is as Your Collaborative \u2018Digital Chief of Staff\u2019            \n\n\n\n\n                Washington Weekly: CFPB\u2019s Future and the Impact of CDFI Cuts on Credit Unions            \n\n\n\n\n                Retail Sales Show Dining Out Declines and eCommerce Gains Ground as Consumers Pull Back            \n\n\n\n\n                3 Ways Embedded Finance Solutions Are Remaking B2B Procurement            \n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPYMNTS Today\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency\n\n\n\n\n\nB2B\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital Transformation\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nLoading... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartner with PYMNTS\n\nWe\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.\nLearn More\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It\u2019s an achievement anchored by NVIDIA\u2019s revolutionary RTX technology, which has transformed gaming graphics and performance.\nThe journey began in 2018 at an electrifying event in Cologne. In a steel and concrete music venue amidst the city\u2019s gritty industrial north side, over 1,200 gamers, breathless and giddy, erupted as NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang introduced NVIDIA RTX and declared, \u201cThis is a historic moment \u2026 Computer graphics has been reinvented.\u201d\nThis groundbreaking launch, set against the backdrop of the world\u2019s largest gaming expo, Gamescom, marked the introduction of the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, 2080 and 2070 GPUs.\nLaunched in 2018, NVIDIA RTX has redefined visual fidelity and performance in modern gaming and creative applications.\nThe most technically advanced games now rely on the techniques that RTX technologies have unlocked.\nRay tracing, enabled by dedicated RT Cores, delivers immersive, realistic lighting and reflections in games.\nThe technique has evolved from games with only a single graphics element executed in ray tracing to games such as Alan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Minecraft RTX and Portal RTX that use ray tracing for all the light in the game.\nAnd NVIDIA DLSS, powered by Tensor Cores, accelerates AI graphics, now boosting performance with DLSS Frame Generation and improving RT effects with DLSS Ray Reconstruction in titles like Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty.\nBeyond gaming, these technologies revolutionize creative workflows, enabling real-time, ray-traced previews in applications that once required extensive processing time.\nRay tracing, a technique first described in 1969 by Arthur Appel, mirrors how light interacts with objects to create lifelike images.\nRay tracing was once limited to high-end movie production. NVIDIA\u2019s RTX graphics cards have made this cinematic quality accessible in real-time gaming, enhancing experiences with dynamic lighting, reflections and shadows.\nHigh engagement rates in titles like Cyberpunk 2077, NARAKA: BLADEPOINT, Minecraft with RTX, Alan Wake 2 and Diablo IV, where 96% or higher of RTX 40 Series t gamers use RTX ON, underscore this success.\n\nTo commemorate this milestone, 20 $500 Green Man Gaming gift cards and exclusive #RTXON keyboard keycaps are up for grabs. Participants must follow GeForce\u2019s social channels and comply with the sweepstakes rules.\nStay tuned for more RTX 500 giveaways.\nNVIDIA\u2019s advancement from the first RTX graphics card to powering 500 RTX games and applications with advanced technologies heralds a new gaming and creative tech era. And NVIDIA continues to lead, offering unparalleled experiences in gaming and creativity.\nStay tuned to GeForce News for more updates on RTX games and enhancements.\n\n\nCategories: Gaming \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The achievement \u2014 as in other technology success stories \u2014 was surprising for its speed.Investors \u2014 who sniff out trends and the most profitable business ventures \u2014 have followed the trail of artificial intelligence (AI) like no other this year. And in this sector, all roads lead to Nvidia. The big economic changes that AI promises have raised the company\u2019s high expectations on the S&P 500 index. It\u2019s been the best-performing stock of 2023, with a revaluation of more than 200%\u2026 very lucrative for those who were able to anticipate its rise.With this massive leap in stock market valuation, Nvidia is now among the largest corporations on the planet. It currently occupies sixth place among listed companies, only surpassed by Apple, Microsoft, Saudi Aramco, Alphabet (Google) and Amazon. It\u2019s ranked above Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta Platforms or Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway.Of all these companies, Nvidia is definitely the one that is most unknown to the general public. The reason for this is that its star products travel in the guts of devices. Customer interaction is less visible than with Apple\u2019s iPhone, Google\u2019s search engine, or Amazon\u2019s website. No one sees the tiny high-tech semiconductors created by Nvidia, used to train the AI systems that subsequently power applications such as ChatGPT. The graphic cards for video games or the high-performance computing systems are also invisible to the naked eye. Average consumers aren\u2019t able to interact with the software that Nvidia uses to teach self-driving cars, which allows the vehicles to process large volumes of sensor data and make decisions in real-time.In a sector as competitive as that of computer chips, where leading companies such as Intel or AMD have been operating for decades, what\u2019s made Nvidia stand out from the rest in such a pronounced way? American historian Chris Miller \u2014 the author of Chip War: The Fight for the World\u2019s Most Critical Technology (2022) \u2014 responds to this question by email, offering EL PA\u00cdS an X-ray of how this industry has evolved: \u201cNvidia realized before anyone else that GPU chips (semiconductors that were initially designed for graphics processing) would also be very suitable for training artificial intelligence systems. More than 15 years ago, Nvidia began building a specialized software ecosystem around its GPU semiconductors, to allow companies to efficiently train them on artificial intelligence systems. This has been key to its ability to become the dominant player in AI training today.\u201dThat is to say, the origin of today\u2019s success wasn\u2019t a miracle that occurred overnight. It began to take shape a decade-and-a-half ago. The firm \u2014 which gets its curious name from the Latin word invidia (envy) \u2014 is an example of stability at the top. Its founder \u2014 Taiwanese citizen Jen-Hsun Huang, an electrical engineer trained at Oregon State University and Stanford University \u2014 has been CEO for 30 years.With so many disruptive possibilities attributed to the technological change that is AI, the money tends to go to the leading companies in the field. Nvidia has no competition for now\u2026 although this exaggerated dominance may be questioned soon, as Miller warns. \u201cIt has an estimated 90% market share in AI training, but other companies will try to produce competitive GPUs. AMD and Intel, for example, are investing heavily in this market. Additionally, cloud computing companies \u2014 such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft \u2014 are building their own specialized chips for internal AI training, which will also compete with Nvidia.\u201dIt\u2019s the law of the market. When Nike launched its revolutionary running shoes \u2014 each with a carbon-infused nylon plate \u2014 the rest of the brands didn\u2019t take long to make their own versions. Now, the same thing is happening again, although the difference is that the level of Nvidia\u2019s sophistication is greater than a shoe, meaning that there are no guarantees that its competitors will be able to imitate them. \u201cNvidia has been ousting rivals in a way that was seen as impossible years ago,\u201d affirms Mateo Valero, professor of Computer Architecture and Technology at the Technical University of Catalonia. He\u2019s also the director of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. According to Valero, each of the new self-driving cars has one or two of the most powerful chips installed, each of which can cost around $30,000. They\u2019re produced by Nvidia.The technological dependence on a single company is a notorious phenomenon. It\u2019s also Nvidia\u2019s greatest strength. \u201cNeural networks need a lot of high-speed chips and competitors have been left behind. Intel failed in the race eight or 10 years ago, [while] AMD started late. Most accelerators for supercomputers come from Nvidia. And now, it has a privileged position in both software and hardware. If Nvidia said: \u2018Hey, we\u2019re not going to sell Europe any more chips,\u2019 we wouldn\u2019t even be able to use AI.\u201dThere are investors who have sold off their positions in Nvidia, thinking that, given its astronomical price, the normal occurrence would be for it to begin to lose market share. But Gonzalo Le\u00f3n \u2014 professor emeritus at the Technical University of Madrid \u2014 points out that the company isn\u2019t resting on its laurels. \u201cThe emergence of generative AI and the need to train large language models (LLMs) have dramatically increased demand. [In the past, Nvidia] had the right chip to respond: the H100. Now, they have announced the H200 for the beginning of 2024, with performance that\u2019s double that of the previous one. It\u2019ll be a new success.\u201dAMD has already responded to the challenge. Last week, the rival company launched a new chip \u2014 the MI300X \u2014 which they classify as the most advanced on the market for AI purposes. It\u2019s AMD\u2019s best bet to get a piece of the pie\u2026 the pie being the AI processor market, which the company estimates will be worth $400 billion by 2027.Next year, investors will judge whether Nvidia still has the fuel to continue growing. Nobody knows whether it will get closer to the position of becoming the most valuable company in the world \u2014 a feat that\u2019s no longer so far away \u2014 or, on the contrary, if the expectations surrounding AI will turn out to be exaggerated.Of course, the final outcome doesn\u2019t just depend on Nvidia: it\u2019s also contingent on what comes out of its competitors\u2019 laboratories.Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA EditionTu suscripci\u00f3n se est\u00e1 usando en otro dispositivo\u00bfQuieres a\u00f1adir otro usuario a tu suscripci\u00f3n?A\u00f1adir usuarioContinuar leyendo aqu\u00edSi contin\u00faas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podr\u00e1 leer en el otro.\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 est\u00e1s viendo esto?Flecha Tu suscripci\u00f3n se est\u00e1 usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PA\u00cdS desde un dispositivo a la vez.

With the implementation of autonomous robots and other advancing technologies, farm equipment is gathering more information than ever before, writes Karli Petrovic at GOFAR. Normally, this would be a good thing. More data often translates to greater knowledge, deeper insights and better decision-making \u2014 if you can understand it, that is. This is the challenge for farmers. The data is available, but the ability to interpret it and use it effectively can be tricky. That\u2019s where NVIDIA comes in. The accelerated computing company is developing solutions that help farmers do more with their ag equipment, the technologies that power the machines and the data that is collected as a result. It\u2019s a big job. NVIDIA has the expertise to get it done. \u201cPeople often wonder what a company that makes chips and hardware is doing at an agriculture event like FIRA, but we\u2019re not a general purpose computing company,\u201d says Amit Goel, NVIDIA\u2019s head of product management and ecosystem. \u201cAccelerated computing requires you to have a deep domain understanding. You really need to know the application and understand the customer\u2019s workflow and figure out how you can map it. We see all the issues that an industry faces, and we try to see where we can add value. We\u2019re thinking about how we can solve agriculture\u2019s problems using our computing platform.\u201d NVIDIA is engaged with the agriculture industry in a number of important ways. One big project within the company is Earth-2. The technology provides high-resolution climate and weather simulations to help farmers and others predict weather conditions and act based on what they learn. NVIDIA also uses generative artificial intelligence and large language models to help ag professionals aggregate the massive amount of data they collect and consume it in a way that enables them to answer questions and make informed decisions.

For example, a vehicle can have the highest-quality sensors, but without the right software, the system can\u2019t use them to execute the right decisions.\nGenerative AI plays a key role, enabling synthetic data generation so AV makers can use a model\u2019s previous experiences to create and simulate novel driving scenarios.\nIt can \u201ctake crowds of pedestrians and snow and bring them together\u201d to \u201ccreate a snowy, crowded pedestrian scene\u201d that the vehicle has never experienced before.\nAccording to Kendall, that will \u201cplay a huge role in both learning and validating the level of performance that we need to deploy these vehicles safely\u201d \u2014 all while saving time and costs.\nIn June, Wayve unveiled GAIA-1, a generative world model for developing autonomous vehicles.\nThe company also recently announced LINGO-1, an AI model that allows passengers to use natural language to enhance the learning and explainability of AI driving models.\nLooking ahead, the company hopes to scale and further develop its solutions, improving the safety of AVs to deliver value, build public trust and meet customer expectations.\u00a0Kendall views embodied AI as playing a definitive role in the future of the AI landscape, pushing pioneers to \u201cbuild better\u201d and \u201cbuild further\u201d to achieve the \u201cnext big breakthroughs.\u201d\nFor more on NVIDIA\u2019s Inception startup accelerator program, visit https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/.\nExplore generative AI sessions and experiences at NVIDIA GTC, the global conference on AI and accelerated computing, running March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., and online.\nYou Might Also Like\nDriver\u2019s Ed: How Waabi Uses AI Simulation to Teach Autonomous Vehicles to Drive\nTeaching the AI brains of autonomous vehicles to understand the world as humans do requires billions of miles of driving experience\u2014the road to achieving this astronomical level of driving leads to the virtual world.

It knows the right settings to tweak to achieve good framerates on demanding games like Alan Wake 2 and Cyberpunk 2077.\n                        \n\n                                        The tool provides helpful descriptions and screenshots of the settings being adjusted, making it easier for users to understand the impact. \n                        \n\n\n\n\n2023 was a pretty good year for video games, with a ton of big, excellent games finally getting released. Thankfully, a lot of them were released on consoles. It was a particularly painful year to be a PC gamer, with a surprising number of PC versions shipping with issues just being poorly optimized to run on even the most powerful gaming PCs.\nNot all titles were downright unplayable, thankfully, and it was easy to salvage a lot of them with the right tweaks. I prefer optimizing the games myself, but I hate having to go through the pain of optimizing each game before jumping into the action. This is what triggered me to try Nvidia's built-in game optimizer, a tool that I used to rely heavily on back in the days when it was relatively easy to run games on a PC without having to second guess the hardware. But is the built-in game optimizer in Nvidia GeForce Experience utility reliable in 2023 with all of these complicated, modern titles? \n                        Surprisingly easy to set up\n               \n            Very approachable for beginners\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: XDA\n\nThe best thing about the GeForce Experience game optimizer is that it's very easy to use. All you have to do is select the target resolution, the display mode, and the kind of optimization you're looking for: Performance, Quality, or Optimal, the latter of which is the middle ground between the two. The optimizer will then tweak the settings in real time based on your selection. There's also a handy launch button to let you run your optimized games and see how they perform.\nThe overall process is just as simple as I remember it being a few years ago. It's especially great for beginners who might not know their way around game optimization and graphics settings. \n                        Optimizing the games with GeForce Experience\n               \nThis is all great, but is it even worth using the tool? I tried optimizing two different games using the GeForce Experience. Here are the results. \n            Adjusts more than preset settings\n    \nAlan Wake 2 is one of the most demanding titles out there right now, so I decided to see how the GeForce Experience optimized it. The Optimal settings suggested for this particular game on my PC with an AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti were close to the settings I had manually adjusted myself. That's a good start because it means the utility knows the right settings to tweak to get good framerates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlan Wake 2 running with GeForce Experience \"Optimized\" settings.\n\nI manually optimized Alan Wake 2 to average around 72FPS on my PC with a combination of High and Ultra graphics settings, complete with DLSS and Ray Reconstruction. However, the Optimal settings did disable or lower a couple of options, like post-processing quality, to add more frames to the board. While the GeForce optimization didn't add too many frames, I was able to consistently get more than 80FPS without a noticeable hit to the visual fidelity. In fact, tweaking the optimization slide just a few more notches to optimize more for performance instantly delivered better results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077 performance benchmark with GeForce Experience \"Optimized\" settings.\n\nI observed similar behavior with Cyberpunk 2077, another demanding title that may take a lot of effort to run smoothly on even the highest-end rigs. The optimized settings suggested by GeForce Experience for Cyberpunk 2077 were also close to those I chose for smooth performance. Cyberpunk 2077 averaged 95FPS with my manual tweaks, whereas the GeForce Experience was able to adjust it to an average of 101FPS. I was able to further improve it by turning the slider a couple of more notches in favor of performance. With GeForce Experience optimized settings, the game now runs at around 130FPS. I don't see a drastic difference in visual fidelity, albeit in a few places. \n\n\n\n\nGame\n\n\nAvg FPS with manual tweaks\n\n\nAvg FPS with GeForce Experience \"Optimal\" settings\n\n\nAvg FPS with GeForce Experience adjusted settings to favor performance\n\n\n\n\nAlan Wake 2\n\n\n72\n\n\n80\n\n\n114\n\n\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077\n\n\n95\n\n\n101\n\n\n135\n\n\n\n\n\nI like how the GeForce Experience utility gives you a description of the settings you're changing, along with screenshots from the game to show exactly what you're tweaking. This makes it easier for beginners to understand what they're looking at and what kind of impact it'll have on visual fidelity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI also tried optimizing other titles like Apex Legends and The Finals using the GeForce Experience, and they were all adjusted to run at max settings by default. These titles, however, are known to run quite smoothly on PC, to begin with, so I wouldn't necessarily judge how the utility works based on those optimizations. \n                        So, should you use GeForce Experience?\n               \nThe built-in optimizer in GeForce Experience turned out better than I thought when it comes to graphics optimization. Not only does it make it easy to understand the settings you're tweaking and give you optimal settings based on the hardware, but it also applies those settings promptly for instant results. The optimization itself was pretty reliable, too. It did change a few settings I wouldn't personally tweak, but I am glad the performance improvement didn't come at a significant cost of visual fidelity. Both Alan Wake 2 and Cyberpunk 2077 looked great even with all the adjusted settings, meaning the optimizer isn't randomizing to some preset values.\nI like having more control over the graphics and other in-game settings, but I can see myself using the game optimizer in the future when I want to quickly jump into a game without spending too much time on settings. More importantly, it's a fantastic tool for beginners that will not only allow them to get better performance out of their machines but also help them understand the settings in detail. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nGaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support XDA.
