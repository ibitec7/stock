Shares of the chip giant exploded 27% in trading on Thursday as results trounced analyst estimates. The company's ticker page was the most active on the Yahoo Finance platform, followed closely by rival chip players such as AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC).  If the gains in Nvidia hold, the company\u2019s market value would rise more than $200 billion, which would mark the biggest one-day rise in history. Apple's $191 billion pop in November 2022 is the current record holder. It was Nvidia's outlook that truly surprised the investing masses. The company expects second-quarter revenue to come in at about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was anticipating $7.2 billion.   Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang told analysts on the conference call the very upbeat outlook reflects a fundamental shift to accelerated computing. In turn, that places Nvidia's chips that power generative AI in high demand. \"We're seeing incredible orders to retool the world's data centers. And so I think you're seeing the beginning of, call it, a 10-year transition to basically recycle or reclaim the world's data centers and build it out as accelerated computing,\" Huang said. \"You'll have a pretty dramatic shift in the spend of a data center from traditional computing and to accelerate computing with SmartNICs, smart switches, of course GPUs and the workload is going to be predominantly generative AI.\" Here's the vibe on Wall Street after Nvidia's big quarter and outlook. Ruben Roy, Stifel (Hold rating; $370 price target, up from $300): \"Nvidia's recent momentum continued as first quarter results beat consensus expectations and the company's second quarter revenue outlook was significantly above high expectations. Nvidia remains in the sweet spot of AI-infrastructure wallet share as build outs of accelerated computing networks continue. As the company's data center numbers grow, questions on the near-term supply environment are likely to continue. For now, while not providing explicit longer-term guidance, Nvidia management noted that data center-related demand visibility has increased and that the company has procured substantially higher supply for the second half of the year. We raise our estimates and target price and continue to view Nvidia as the best positioned near-term beneficiary of CSP capex spending trends.\"   Story Continues     Nvidia Corp CEO Jensen Huang holds one of the company's new RTX 4090 chips for computer gaming in this undated handout photo provided September 20, 2022. Courtesy of Nvidia Corp/Handout via REUTERS \u00b7 Handout . / reuters  Tristan Gerra, Baird (Outperform rating, upgrade from Hold; $475 price target, up from $300): \"We raised our estimates above consensus and added a Fresh Pick designation to Nvidia on March 20 reflecting our channel feedback about strong H100 orders notably related to ChatGPT emerging in March but we failed to upgrade at that time. As AI-related order momentum continues into the second half, annualized earnings of $10 are at reach within 2-3 quarters in our view, reflected in the valuation post earnings. Our raised next two-year EPS forecast assumes continued AI-related momentum driven by two secular growth trends: continued adoption rate for parallel processing-based acceleration in data centers, and the emergence of AI models notably related to ChatGPT and LLMs [large language models], all of which require GPUs.\"   Atif Malik, Citi (Buy rating; $420 price target, up from $353): \"While we had raised our target price and estimates into the earnings, Generative AI upside was bigger than we expected. Nvidia expects data center sales to roughly double in the July quarter driven by Gen AI demand from CSPs, consumer internet companies, and accelerated computing in enterprises. Nvidia estimates only ~4% of the $1 trillion data center CPU installed base over the last four years has been GPU accelerated, implying AI adoption remains in early innings.\" Dan Ives, Wedbush (no rating/price target): \"There is not one better indicator around underlying AI demand going on in the hyperscale/cloud and overall enterprise market than the foundational Nvidia story. We view Nvidia at the core hearts and lungs of the AI revolution given its core chips train and deploy generative AI applications like ChatGPT. The Street was all awaiting last night's Nvidia quarter and guidance to gauge the magnitude of this AI demand story with many skeptics saying an AI bubble was forming and instead Jensen & Co. delivered guidance for the ages.\"   Ross Seymore, Deutsche Bank (Hold rating; $390 price target, up from $170): \"After such a massive beat/raise/share price pop, the key question going forward is sustainability. We believe the drivers of it appear to be much more secular than cyclical (AI, DC accelerators crowding out CPUs, etc.), and Nvidia's lead in this market remains sizable, but we remain uncertain as to the pace of such growth post second quarter and if/when the next DC digestion period may occur. Consequently, we are raising our 2024 revenue/EPS by a significant +37%/+70%, with our price target rising to $390 (based upon a consistent 40x P/E multiple). With Nvidia's unique AI market leadership and the scarcity of alternative plays, we see little that could diminish investor optimism and recommend continuing to enjoy the ride.\" Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Discover how to track all 535 Congress member stock trades today.\r\nNvidia Corporation NVDA shares have been on a tear this year, thanks to its exposure to artificial intelligence. The stock is the best-performing S&P 500 stock for the year-to-date period with a gain of about 114%.\nAhead of its quarterly results on Wednesday, here's a look at how profitable an investment in the stock at its 1999 initial public offering would have been now,\nThe Nvidia IPO: Nvidia went public on January 22, 1999, offering its shares at $12. The company raised $40 million in its IPO, giving the company a valuation of around $625 million. The company's market value has swelled since then and is currently at about $773 billion.\nNvidia's Businesses: Nvidia has grown from a graphics card designer to a leading technology firm with a diverse product portfolio. Its products have found use in a variety of applications, ranging from gaming and professional visualization to data centers and automotive.\nNvidia Stock Split: Over the years, Nvidia has undergone a stock split multiple times to make it more accessible to investors. The company had its first 2-for-1 stock split on June 27, 2000. It then had two more 2-for-1 stock splits on September 12, 2001, and April 7, 2006. On Sept. 11, 2007, the company announced a 3:2 stock split. The company most recently had a 4-for-1 stock split on July 20, 2021.\nSee Also: How To Buy Nvidia (NVDA) Stock\nInvestment Returns: If an investor had put $1,000 into Nvidia at its IPO price of $12 per share, they would have initially purchased approximately 83.33 shares. Considering the five stock splits since then, the investor would now hold approximately 4,000 shares.\nWith the stock\u2019s closing price at $312.64 on Friday, the value of the initial $1,000 investment would be worth approximately $1.25 million today. This represents a return on the initial investment of about 1,250% over the 24-year period.\nIn comparison, the S&P 500 Index would have fetched a return of around 226% over the same period.\nA Beneficiary of the AI Revolution: Nvidia has long been recognized as a key player in the artificial intelligence space. The company\u2019s GPUs are instrumental in training the neural networks of powerful AI models like ChatGPT, a large language model developed by OpenAI. As these AI models scale up and their use becomes more widespread, the demand for Nvidia\u2019s technology is expected to grow significantly.\nNvidia\u2019s CEO, Jensen Huang, has expressed optimism about the company\u2019s position in the AI industry, emphasizing the democratizing potential of AI technologies like ChatGPT. Analysts have also highlighted the company\u2019s potential, estimating that the rise of AI could represent a market opportunity in the multiple tens of billions of dollars annually for Nvidia.\nIs Nvidia Overvalued? At the current stock price, Nvidia is valued at a forward price-earnings multiple of 63.29, a premium to the information technology sector's 24.7. The average price target for Nvidia stock, based on data compiled by TipRanks, is $296.29, which suggests over 5% downside from current levels.\nAnalysts, however, are upbeat about the company's fundamentals. KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh said in a note on Monday that Nvidia represents one of the best-positioned companies in semis this year given due to its dominant positioning in generative AI and multiple new product cycles across both data center (H100) and gaming (RTX40).\nRead Next: Best Technology Stocks Right NowNVDANVIDIA Corp$117.16-1.99%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock \u2013 anytime.Reveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum84.14Growth88.69Quality96.81Value6.97Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Since then, NVDA has secured its place as the breakout stock of 2023, rising from less than $300 per share a month ago to nearly $400 per share today. This growth spurt has helped Nvidia touch a trillion-dollar valuation, in keeping with recent predictions.\nAlmost a week after the earnings report, Nvidia\u2019s success is still powering tech stocks. This is unsurprising when we consider the dominating market trends over the past year. Between the artificial intelligence (AI) boom and the rush to the metaverse, everything seems to be shifting in favor of this Silicon Valley darling. In turn, all of this leads to a question: Which company will be the next Nvidia?\nThe answer may be complicated. Of course, many chip stocks have surged on news of Nvidia\u2019s earnings. But rivals like Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) may actually suffer as Nvidia continues to grow. Per Investopedia:\n\u201cNvidia\u2019s current wave will not lift all boats as technology in the industry moves from CPU to GPU processing. Intel (INTC) was the dominant player in CPUs with AMD (AMD) as its main rival. Nvidia is the market leader in GPU technology and its recent growth is driven by the rush to embrace AI technologies.\u201d\nInvestopedia also notes that AI demand is growing very steadily, which could ultimately allow any companies in the space to secure market share. However, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that some chipmakers will have better opportunities than others. To find the next Nvidia, let\u2019s look at companies still trading at low enough levels to offer investors an attractive point of entry.\n\n\nThe Next Nvidia: SkyWater Technology (SKYT)\nSource: Shutterstock\nThis little-known company doesn\u2019t see as much coverage as its larger-cap peers, but that\u2019s part of what makes SkyWater Technology (NASDAQ:SKYT) worth watching. Operating as an engineering and fabrication foundry for semiconductors, the firm describes itself as \u201cthe only US-owned pure-play silicon foundry.\u201d\nIf that\u2019s true, the company certainly has a lucrative niche offering plenty of room to run in the coming months. Even before Nvidia earnings boosted chip stocks, SkyWater had a competitive edge stemming from President Joe Biden\u2019s focus on spurring domestic chip manufacturing. That may be why shares have risen 35% year-to-date (YTD). While only five analysts tracked by CNN Business have issued takes on SKYT stock, it has been collectively rated as a \u201cbuy\u201d since August 2022.\nNow that investor enthusiasm for chip stocks is soaring, SkyWater has even more opportunity to ride the wave to the top. After an impressive year, SKYT still trades at around $10 per share, giving investors an excellent chance to buy in.\nAccording to InvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto, SKYT stock has high return potential despite its \u201cless-than-satisfactory financials.\u201d Even if SkyWater doesn\u2019t reach Nvidia levels, the firm is still in an excellent position to ride the current chip boom. The stock\u2019s average analyst price target on TipRanks is currently $21.50, implying significant upside.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM)\nSource: ToyW / Shutterstock\nIt\u2019s impossible to have a conversation about chip stocks without bringing up this sector staple. Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) has been enjoying the momentum generated by Nvidia\u2019s Q1 earnings. Shares have rocketed to their best trading week in more than a year.\nThis bodes very well for its growth prospects. As InvestorPlace contributor Joel Baglole notes, both microchips and semiconductors are increasing in importance and Taiwan Semiconductor produces roughly 60% of the global supply. For that reason, Baglole says TSM stock has millionaire-maker potential. He wrote earlier this month:\n\u201cThe good news for investors is that TSM stock is only starting to recover from a 52-week low in November of last year. Over the past 12 months, Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s stock has been down 4%. It\u2019s currently trading 16% below its 52-week high. This presents a great opportunity for investors looking for a long-term growth stock to add to their portfolio.\u201d\nOn top of that, Taiwan Semiconductor works closely with Nvidia, putting it in a prime position to ride the sector leader\u2019s wave to the top of the AI boom. TSM also boasts market share that\u2019s hard to compete with. Even though geopolitical tensions have caused some investors to regard Taiwan-related stocks with skepticism, it\u2019s impossible to ignore the tempting exposure that TSM stock can offer investors.\n\nThe Next Nvidia: MaxLinear (MXL)\nSource: Shutterstock\nLike SkyWater, this company often flies under Wall Street\u2019s radar when the focus is on chip stocks. However, it may be among the most undervalued plays on the sector.\nMaxLinear (NASDAQ:MXL) services the communications sector, providing \u201chighly integrated radio-frequency analog and mixed-signal semiconductor products.\u201d InvestorPlace contributor Alex Sirois notes that this type of technology is helping provide the world with faster data delivery, something just about everyone is hungry for. This means there will be plenty of continued demand for MaxLinear\u2019s services.\nOf course, it hasn\u2019t been an easy year for MXL stock, which is down more than 10% YTD. However, as Sirois also notes, the company boasts mostly strong fundamentals and offers investors ample opportunity for growth. Eight out of 10 Wall Street analysts rate MXL stock as a \u201cbuy\u201d on TipRanks with an average price target of $36.30. Considering that MXL currently trades at less than $30, that\u2019s pretty good upside potential.\nPart of Nvidia\u2019s stellar earnings were driven by the company\u2019s thriving data center business. MaxLinear will have the chance to cash in on the data rush as the chip boom takes it higher as well.\nOn the date of publication, Samuel O\u2019Brient did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

It was the talk of Wall Street on Thursday as Nvidia's stock price soared.For bitcoin (BTC) miners, it's a reminder that they already have the expertise and data-center space to join in and run AI applications. Whether they'll dive in remains to be seen.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDon't miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Long & Short Newsletter today. See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy.\"The overwhelmingly positive market reaction\" to Nvidia's news \"will incentivize more mining companies to follow suit making announcements of their own and allocating more of their power capacity to other forms of compute,\" said Ethan Vera, chief operating officer at mining services firm Luxor Technologies.Vera noted the Wednesday announcement that Applied Digital (APLD) is working with data center design firm Supermicro (SMCI) on its AI cloud offering.Applied Digital is one of a handful of miners that have had their eyes on diversifying their data center space into other areas of computing for a while, along with peers Hut 8 Mining (HUT) and Hive Blockchain (HIVE). Miners will see better margins in AI than mining, said Applied Digital CEO and Chairman Wes Cummins \u2013 at least before another bull run in the price of bitcoin.However, the transition might not be a straight line. High-performance computing such as AI and cloud applications \"requires a different level of infrastructure build\" than bitcoin mining, Vera said. Firms will have to hire engineers to plan their sites differently and sales staff to sign up clients, he said.\"It's not a straightforward process for a miner to repurpose their mines for AI compute \u2013 latency, compliance, cooling, environmental factors (humidity, dust) and power redundancy all need to be factored in when upgrading a site,\" said Erin Dermer, Hut 8's senior vice president of communications and culture, echoing Vera.The cost to build a data centre in North Dakota that meets the standards of the AI industry was ten times higher than mining, said Cummins, sharing his experience.Even though most miners are not likely to repurpose their facilities for AI, \"there are some miners who have always had a more diverse approach to their business operation, with high-performance compute or edge-compute services, in addition to bitcoin mining. With the rapid growth of AI, these companies may accelerate the development of those business lines,\" said Juri Bulovic, head of mining at Foundry Digital (which, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group).Meanwhile, Nvidia\u2019s forecast is lifting AI-linked crypto tokens, including SingularityNET (AGIX), which climbed about 13% on Thursday. Fetch.ai (FET) and Render (RNDR) are up more than 5% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.Read more: Crypto and Bitcoin Miners Rebrand and Diversify to Survive: A Look at Their New StrategiesUPDATE (May 25, 2023, 20:24 UTC): Adds quote from Foundry Digital's Juri Bulovic.UPDATE (May 26, 2023, 12:40 UTC): Adds second quote from Applied Digital's Wes Cummins.MiningBitcoin MiningGPUsAINvidiaEliza GkritsiEliza Gkritsi is a CoinDesk contributor focused on the intersection of crypto and AI, having previously covered mining for two years.

This latest software update adds support for AV1 streaming to YouTube over Enhanced RTMP.\n\nAll GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs \u2014 including laptop GPUs and the recently launched GeForce RTX 4070 \u2014 support real-time AV1 hardware encoding, providing 40% more efficient encoding on average than H.264 and delivering higher quality than competing GPUs.\nAV1 vs. H.264 encode efficiency based on BD-SNR.\nThis reduces the upload bandwidth needed to stream, a common limitation from streaming services and internet service providers. At higher resolutions, AV1 encoding is even more efficient. For example, AV1 enables streaming 4K at 60 frames per second with 10 Mbps upload bandwidth \u2014 down from 20 Mbps with H.264 \u2014 making 4K60 streaming available to a wider audience.\nAV1 \u2014 The New Standard\nAs a founding member of the Alliance for Open Media, NVIDIA has worked closely with industry titans in developing the AV1 codec. This work was necessitated by gamers and online content creators who pushed the boundaries of old formats that were defined roughly 20 years ago. The previous standard for livestreaming, H.264, usually maxed out with 1080p at 60 fps at the commonly used bitrates of 6-8 Mbps, and often produced blocky, grainy images.\nAV1\u2019s increased efficiency enables streaming higher-quality images, allowing creators to stream at higher resolutions with smoother frame rates. Even in network-limited environments, streamers can now reap the benefits of high-quality video shared with their audience.\nSupport for AV1 on YouTube comes through the recent update to RTMP. The enhanced protocol also adds support for HEVC streaming, bringing new formats to users on the existing low-latency protocol they use for H.264 streaming. Enhanced RTMP ingestion has been released as a beta feature on YouTube.\nLearn how to configure OBS Studio for streaming AV1 with GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs in the OBS setup guide.\nBetter Streams With NVENC, NVIDIA Broadcast\nGeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs usher in a new era of high-quality streaming with AV1 encoding support on the eighth-generation NVENC. A boon to streamers, NVENC offloads compute-intensive encoding tasks from the CPU to dedicated hardware on the GPU.\nComparison of 4K image quality in AV1 livestream1.\nDesigned to support the rigors of professional content creators, NVENC preserves video quality with a higher accuracy than competitive encoders. GeForce RTX users can stream higher-quality images at the same bitrate as competitive products or encode at a lower bitrate while maintaining a similar picture quality.\n\nNVIDIA Broadcast, part of the exclusive NVIDIA Studio suite of software, transforms any room into a home studio. Livestreams, voice chats and video calls look and sound better with powerful AI effects like eye contact, noise and room echo removal, virtual background and more.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

The project is being led by the University of Bristol, as part of the research consortium the GW4 Alliance, together with the universities of Bath, Cardiff and Exeter.\nIsambard 3 joins a growing wave of NVIDIA Arm-based supercomputers around the world, with additional systems that include GPUs being built at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre and the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the U.S.\n\u201cAs climate change becomes an increasingly existential problem, it\u2019s vital for computing to embrace energy-efficient technologies,\u201d said Ian Buck, vice president of hyperscale and HPC at NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA is working alongside the Arm Neoverse ecosystem to provide a path forward for the creation of more energy-efficient supercomputing centers, driving important breakthroughs in scientific and industrial research.\u201d\n\u201cFrom climate change to medicine, supercomputing is already enabling academic and industry leaders to take on some of the world\u2019s biggest challenges,\u201d said Mohamed Awad, senior vice president and general manager of infrastructure at Arm. \u201cExpanding on important areas of research requires a level of performance and energy efficiency that Arm Neoverse uniquely delivers, and through our collaboration with NVIDIA, we\u2019re proud to bring this to life in the Isambard 3 system.\u201d\nIsambard 3 to Supercharge Breakthroughs in Life Science, Medicine, More\r\nIsambard 3, to be built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, will enable Europe\u2019s scientific research community to supercharge breakthroughs in AI, life sciences, medical, astrophysics and biotech. It will be able to create detailed models of exceptionally complex structures, such as wind farms and fusion reactors, to help researchers unlock new advances in clean and green energy.\nThe Arm-based NVIDIA Grace-powered system will also continue Isambard 2\u2019s work of simulating molecular-level mechanisms to better understand Parkinson\u2019s disease and find new treatments for osteoporosis and COVID-19. These compute-intensive applications benefit from the highest-performing cores, highest memory bandwidth and the optimal memory capacity per core provided by Grace.\n\u201cIsambard 3\u2019s application performance efficiency of up to 6x its predecessor, which rivals many of the 50 fastest TOP500 systems, will provide scientists with a revolutionary new supercomputing platform to advance groundbreaking research,\u201d said Simon McIntosh-Smith, principal investigator for the Isambard project and professor of HPC at the University of Bristol. \u201cThe Arm-based NVIDIA Grace CPU enables the breakthrough energy efficiency required to push the boundaries of scientific discovery and solve some of humanity\u2019s most difficult challenges.\u201d\nOnce the system goes into production in spring 2024, Bristol expects the number of registered users to increase significantly beyond the current 800.\nAccelerating Scientific Discovery\r\nNVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing platform comprises NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs, NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchips, NVIDIA Grace Hopper\u2122 Superchips, NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking and a full suite of NVIDIA AI and HPC software.\nLearn more about NVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing platform for HPC at ISC.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

https://investor.nvidia.com/.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\r\nNVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its first quarter fiscal 2024 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA\u2019s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA\u2019s conference call to discuss its financial results for its second quarter of fiscal 2024.\nNon-GAAP Measures\r\nTo supplement NVIDIA\u2019s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA\u2019s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude acquisition termination costs, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, IP-related costs, legal settlement costs, other, losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user\u2019s overall understanding of the company\u2019s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company\u2019s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company\u2019s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nNVIDIA CORPORATION\n\n\n\u00a0CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

As a machine-learning scientist, he has a prescription for it.\n\u201cI worked at one of West Africa\u2019s largest hospitals, where I would routinely see more than 30 patients a day \u2014\u00a0 it\u2019s a very hard job,\u201d said Olatunji.\nThe need to write detailed patient notes and fill out forms makes it even harder. Paper records slowed the pace of medical research, too.\nIn his first years of practice, Olatunji imagined a program to plow through the mounds of paperwork, freeing doctors to help more patients.\nIt\u2019s been a journey, but that software is available today from his company, Intron Health, a member of the NVIDIA Inception program, which nurtures cutting-edge startups.\nA Side Trip in Tech\nWith encouragement from med school mentors, Olatunji got a master\u2019s degree in medical informatics from the University of San Francisco and another in computer science at Georgia Tech. He started working as a machine-learning scientist in the U.S. by day and writing code on nights and weekends to help digitize Africa\u2019s hospitals.\nA pilot test during the pandemic hit a snag.\nThe first few doctors to use the code took 45 minutes to finish their patient notes. Feeling awkward in front of a keyboard, some health workers said they prefer pen and paper.\n\u201cWe made a hard decision to invest in natural language processing and speech recognition,\u201d he said. It\u2019s technology he was already familiar with in his day job.\nBuilding AI Models\n\u201cThe combination of medical terminology and thick African accents produced horrible results with most existing speech-to-text software, so we knew there would be no shortcut to training our own models,\u201d he said.\nTobi Olatunji\nThe Intron team evaluated several commercial and open-source speech recognition frameworks and large language models before choosing to build with NVIDIA NeMo, a software framework for text-based generative AI. In addition, the resulting models were trained on NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud.\n\u201cWe initially tried to train with CPUs as the cheapest option, but it took forever, so we started with a single GPU and eventually grew to using several of them in the cloud,\u201d he said.\nThe resulting Transcribe app captures doctors\u2019 dictated messages with more than 92% accuracy across more than 200 African accents. It slashes the time they spend on paperwork by 6x on average, according to an ongoing study Intron is conducting across hospitals in four African countries.\n\u201cEven the doctor with the fastest typing skills in the study got a 40% speedup,\u201d he said of the software now in use at several hospitals across Africa.\nListening to Africa\u2019s Voices\nOlatunji knew his models needed high quality audio data. So, the company created an app to capture sound bites of medical terms spoken in different accents.\nTo date, the app\u2019s gathered more than a million clips from more than 7,000 people across 24 countries, including 13 African nations. It\u2019s one of the largest datasets of its type, parts of which have been released as open source to support African speech research.\nToday, Intron refreshes its models every other month as more data comes in.\nNurturing Diversity in Medtech\nVery little research exists on speech recognition for African accents in a clinical setting. So, working with Africa\u2019s tech communities like DSN, Masakhane and Zindi, Intron launched AfriSpeech-200, a developer challenge to kickstart research using its data.\nSimilarly, for all its sophistication, medtech lags in diversity and inclusion, so Olatunji recently launched an effort that addresses that issue, too.\nBio-RAMP Lab is a global community of minority researchers working on problems they care about at the intersection of AI and healthcare. The group already has a half dozen papers under review at major conferences.\nOlatunji presents his ideas at NVIDIA\u2019s Santa Clara campus in a meeting kicking off an initiative to make AI accessible for all.\n\u201cFor seven years, I was the only Black person on every team I worked on,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were no Black scientists or managers, even in my job interviews.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Intron is even helping hospitals in Africa find creative ways to acquire the hardware they need. It\u2019s another challenge on the way to opening up huge opportunities.\n\u201cOnce healthcare data gets digitized, you unlock a whole new world for research into areas like predictive models that can be early warning systems for epidemics \u2014 we can\u2019t do it without data,\u201d Olatunji said.\nWatch a masterclass (starting at 20:30) with Olatunji, HuggingFace and NVIDIA on AI for speech recognition.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Conversational AI | Customer Stories | Hardware | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | Inference | Machine Learning | NVIDIA NeMo \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

By simulating even more robots.\nNVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang today showcased how leading electronics manufacturer Quanta is using AI-enabled robots to inspect the quality of its products.\nIn his keynote speech at this week\u2019s COMPUTEX trade show in Taipei, Huang presented on how electronics manufacturers are digitalizing their state-of-the art factories.\nFor example, robots from Quanta subsidiary Techman Robot tapped NVIDIA Isaac Sim \u2014 a robotics simulation application built on NVIDIA Omniverse \u2014 to develop a custom digital twin application to improve inspection on the Taiwan-based electronics provider\u2019s manufacturing line.\nThe below demo shows how Techman uses Isaac Sim to optimize the inspection of robots by robots on the manufacturing line. In effect, it\u2019s robots building robots.\n\nAutomated optical inspection, or AOI, helps manufacturers more quickly identify defects and deliver high-quality products to their customers around the globe. The NVIDIA Metropolis vision AI framework, now enabled for AOI, is also used to optimize inspection workflows for products ranging from automobiles to circuit boards.\nTechman developed AOI with its factory-floor robots by using Isaac Sim to simulate, test and optimize its state-of-the-art collaborative robots, or cobots, while using NVIDIA AI and GPUs for training in the cloud and inference on the robots themselves.\nIsaac Sim is built on NVIDIA Omniverse \u2014 an open development platform for building and operating industrial metaverse applications.\nUnique features of Techman\u2019s robotic AOI solutions include their placement of the inspection camera directly on articulated robotic arms and GPUs integrated in the robot controller.\nThis allows the bots to inspect areas of products that fixed cameras simply can\u2019t access, as well as use AI at the edge to instantly detect defects.\n\u201cThe distinctive features of Techman\u2019s robots \u2014 compared to other robot brands \u2014 lie in their built-in vision system and AI inference engine,\u201d said Scott Huang, chief operations officer at Techman. \u201cNVIDIA RTX GPUs power up their AI performance.\u201d\nBut programming the movement of these robots can be time consuming.\nA developer has to determine the precise arm positions, as well as the most efficient sequence, to capture potentially hundreds of images as quickly as possible.\nThis can involve several days of effort, exploring tens of thousands of possibilities to determine an optimal solution.\nThe solution: robot simulation.\nUsing Omniverse, Techman built a digital twin of the inspection robot \u2014 as well as the product to be inspected \u2014 in Isaac Sim.\nProgramming the robot in simulation reduced time spent on the task by over 70%, compared to programming manually on the real robot. Using an accurate 3D model of the product, the application can be developed in the digital twin even before the real product is manufactured, saving valuable time on the production line.\nThen, with powerful optimization tools in Isaac Sim, Techman explored a massive number of program options in parallel on NVIDIA GPUs.\nThe end result was an efficient solution that reduced the cycle time of each inspection by 20%, according to Huang.\nEvery second saved in inspection time will drop down to the bottom line of Techman\u2019s manufacturing customers.\nGathering and labeling real-world images of defects is costly and time consuming, so Techman turned to synthetic data to improve the quality of inspections. It used the Omniverse Replicator framework to quickly generate high-quality synthetic datasets.\nThese perfectly labeled images are used to train the AI models in the cloud and dramatically enhance their performance.\nAnd dozens of AI models can be run at the edge \u2014 efficiently and with low latency thanks to NVIDIA technology \u2014 while inspecting particularly complicated products, some of which take more than 40 models to scrutinize their different aspects.\nLearn more about how Isaac Sim on Omniverse, Metropolis and AI are streamlining the optical inspection process across products and industries by joining NVIDIA at COMPUTEX, where the Techman cobots will be on display.\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: COMPUTEX 2023 | Digital Twin | Metropolis | NVIDIA Isaac Sim | Omniverse | Smart Spaces | Synthetic Data Generation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It includes edge-to-cloud software services, computing and a set of reference sensors and robot hardware to accelerate development and deployment of AMRs, reducing costs and time to market.\nMobile robot shipments are expected to climb from 251,000 units in 2023 to 1.6 million by 2028, with revenue forecast to jump from $12.6 billion to $64.5 billion in the period, according to ABI Research.\nSimplifying the Path to Autonomy\nDespite the explosive adoption of robots, the intralogistics industry faces challenges.\nTraditionally, software applications for autonomous navigation are often coded from scratch for each robot, making rolling out autonomy across different robots complex. Also, warehouses, factories and fulfillment centers are enormous, frequently running a million square feet or more, making them hard to map for robots and keep updated. And integrating AMRs into existing workflows, fleet management and warehouse management systems can be complicated.\nFor those working in advanced robotics and seeking to migrate traditional forklifts or automated guided vehicles to fully autonomous mobile robots, Isaac AMR provides the blueprint to accelerate the migration to full autonomy, reducing costs and speeding deployment of state-of-the-art AMRs.\nOrin-Based Reference Architecture\u00a0\nIsaac AMR is built on the foundations of the\u00a0 NVIDIA Nova Orin reference architecture.\nNova Orin is the brains and eyes of Isaac AMR. It integrates multiple sensors including stereo cameras, fisheye cameras, 2D and 3D lidars with the powerful NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin system-on-module. The reference robot hardware comes with Nova Orin pre-integrated, making it easy for developers to evaluate Isaac AMR in their own environments.\n\nThe compute engine of Nova is Orin, which delivers access to some of the most advanced AI and hardware-accelerated algorithms that can be run using 275 tera operations per second (TOPS) of edge computing in real time.\nThe synchronized and calibrated sensor suite offers sensor diversity and redundancy for real-time 3D perception and mapping. Cloud-native tools for record, upload and replay enable easy debugging, map creation, training and analytics.\nIsaac AMR: Mapping, Autonomy, Simulation\nIsaac AMR offers a foundation for mapping, autonomy and simulation.\n\nIsaac AMR accelerates mapping and semantic understanding of large environments by tying into DeepMap\u2019s cloud-based service to help accelerate robot mapping of large facilities from weeks to days, offering centimeter-level accuracy without the need for a highly skilled team of technicians. It can generate rich 3D voxel maps, which can be used to create occupancy maps and semantic maps for multiple types of AMRs.\n\nAdditionally, Isaac AMR shortens the time to develop and deploy robots in large, highly dynamic and unstructured environments with autonomy that\u2019s enabled by multimodal navigation with cloud-based fleet optimization using NVIDIA cuOpt software.\nAn accelerated and modular framework enables real-time camera and lidar perception. Planning and control using advanced path planners, behavior planners and use of semantic information make the robot operate autonomously in complex environments. A low-code, no-code interface makes it easy to rapidly develop and customize applications for different scenarios and use cases.\n\nFinally, Isaac AMR simplifies robot operations by tapping into physics-based simulation from Isaac Sim, powered by NVIDIA Omniverse, an open development platform for industrial digitalization. This can bring digital twins to life, so the robot application can be developed, tested and customized for each customer before deploying in the physical world. This significantly reduces the operational cost and complexity of deploying AMRs.\n\n\nSign up for early access to Isaac AMR.\n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: COMPUTEX 2023 | NVIDIA Isaac Sim | Omniverse Enterprise \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

To drive product excellence, leading electronics manufacturers are adopting NVIDIA Metropolis for Factories.\nMore than 50 manufacturing giants and industrial automation providers \u2014 including Foxconn Industrial Internet, Pegatron, Quanta, Siemens and Wistron \u2014 are implementing Metropolis for Factories, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang announced during his keynote address at the COMPUTEX technology conference in Taipei.\nNVIDIA Metropolis for Factories is a collection of factory automation workflows that enables industrial technology companies and manufacturers to develop, deploy and manage customized quality-control systems that offer a competitive advantage.\nManufacturers globally spend more than $6 trillion a year in pursuit of quality control, and they apply defect detection on nearly every product line. But manual inspections can\u2019t keep up with the demands.\nMany manufacturers have automated optical inspection (AOI) systems that can help, but often these have high false detection rates, requiring labor-intensive and costly secondary manual inspections in an already challenging labor market, reducing their value.\nNVIDIA Metropolis for Factories now offers a state-of-the-art AI platform and workflows for the development of incredibly accurate inspection applications such as AOI.\nPegatron Drives AOI With Metropolis for Factories\u00a0\nLeading manufacturer Pegatron, based in Taipei\u2019s Beitou district, is using NVIDIA Metropolis for Factories on its production lines.\n\nPegatron manufactures everything from motherboards to smartphones, laptops and game consoles. With a dozen manufacturing facilities handling more than 300 products and more than 5,000 parts per day, Pegatron has a lot of quality control to manage across its product portfolio. Further, frequent product updates require ongoing revisions to its AOI systems.\nPegatron is using the entire Metropolis for Factories workflow to support its printed circuit board (PCB) factories with simulation, robotics and automated production inspection. Metropolis for Factories enables the electronics manufacturing giant to quickly update its defect detection models and achieve 99.8% accuracy on its AOI systems, starting with small datasets.\n\n\u00a0\nPegatron uses NVIDIA Isaac Sim, a robotic simulator, to program robotic arms in simulation and to model the performance of its fleets of mobile robots.\nTapping into NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator provides synthetic data generation to simulate defects, helping build massive training datasets with domain randomization and other techniques.\nIn Metropolis, NVIDIA TAO Toolkit allows Pegatron to access pretrained models and transfer learning to build its highly accurate defect detection models from its enhanced datasets.\nThe NVIDIA DeepStream software development kit can be used to develop optimized intelligent video applications that handle multiple video, image and audio streams. Using DeepStream, Pegatron was able to achieve a 10x improvement in throughput.\nMoreover, Omniverse enables Pegatron to run digital twins of its inspection equipment, so it can simulate future inspection processes, promising increased efficiencies to its production workflow.\nIt\u2019s also used by Quanta subsidiary Techman Robot, which taps Isaac Sim to optimize the inspection of robots by robots on their manufacturing line.\nMetropolis for Factories is helping manufacturers like Pegatron to increase production line throughput, reduce costs and improve production quality.\nGrowing Partner Ecosystem Supports Metropolis\u00a0\nMetropolis for Factories can be deployed from the enterprise industrial edge to the cloud, and a large and growing ecosystem of partners is helping bring it to market.\nA host of specialists are joining forces on this effort including sensor makers, application partners, inspection equipment makers and integration partners.\n\nBasler, a leading maker of imaging sensors and systems, has partnered with NVIDIA to help developers build AI-enabled inspection systems faster through tighter integration with the NVIDIA DeepStream SDK.\nQuantiphi, a Metropolis partner, is working with one of the world\u2019s largest beverage producers to automate inspections of fully packed pallets with GPU-powered vision AI.\n\nOverview and Advantech \u2014 both NVIDIA Metropolis partners \u2014 are collaborating to build a real-time AI-based inspection system to support industrial inspection, product counting and assembly verification.\nMetropolis partners Siemens and Data Monsters are working together to build industrial inspection systems, bringing together Omniverse Replicator synthetic data generation, NVIDIA TAO training, DeepStream runtime and Siemens\u2019 NVIDIA Jetson-powered industrial personal computers.\n\nLearn more about NVIDIA Metropolis for Factories. \n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: COMPUTEX 2023 | Embedded Computing | Industrial and Manufacturing | Metropolis | NVIDIA Isaac Sim | Smart Spaces \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Through this technology, enterprises can now access a comprehensive solution to create, implement, and fully customize real-time artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\n\n\n\n\nAI and data have become crucial components for companies to gain a competitive advantage. The emergence of generative AI marks the start of a new era where businesses can reimagine their operations by utilizing advanced language models capable of performing complex tasks. As enterprises increasingly implement generative AI solutions to transform their businesses, products and services, the need for accuracy and performance has never been greater. Despite the impressive general capabilities of foundation models, enterprises face unique challenges in adapting AI to their specific use cases. Therefore, companies are training models on their own data and workloads to develop customized AI solutions that meet their needs and end customers. \nAppen offers in-depth expertise to enterprises seeking to both structure and leverage their own data sources and to supplement internal data, ensuring their AI systems meet the specific and diverse needs of their end customers. This enables companies to maintain brand integrity and amplify their brand voice. In today's market, the first critical step in the AI lifecycle is data; however, finding a cost-effective approach that delivers reliable, safe, and trustworthy AI capabilities remains a challenge. To address this issue, enterprises need to operate within an ecosystem committed to providing end-to-end customizable solutions. \n\u201cOur collaboration with NVIDIA allows enterprise clients in different industries to transform customer interactions, from traditional transactions to new AI-enabled experiences, using the full architecture stack \u2013 data, models, and compute,\u201d said Armughan Ahmad, CEO of Appen. \u201cAppen and NVIDIA have been collaborating since 2020 on developing speech AI and language models, and we're now expanding our work to provide a complete range of capabilities to enterprise customers.\u201d \nThe NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform features a cloud-native suite of AI and data analytics software, accompanied by a vast library of frameworks and pre-trained models such as NVIDIA Riva for speech and translation AI, NVIDIA Merlin for recommendation engines, and the NVIDIA NeMo framework for generative AI deployment. The NVIDIA AI platform enables enterprises to create and deploy fully customizable and production-ready AI capabilities tailored to their specific data, demographics, and brand standards. Appen enhances this offering with data sourcing, annotation and labeling, and a comprehensive suite of Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) services. Notable success stories include NVIDIA Riva services fine-tuned to T-Mobile data, enabling T-Mobile to resolve customer issues in real time. \n\u201cBuilding high-performing and cost-efficient AI applications requires enterprise customers to overcome multiple layers of technical and operational challenges,\u201d said Hemant Dhulla, Global Head of NVIDIA AI Software. \u201cNVIDIA AI Enterprise simplifies the process and equips companies like Appen to offer customers an accessible, streamlined data path to building and deploying fully customized real-time AI capabilities for their customers.\u201d \nAbout Appen Limited \nAppen is the global leader in data for the AI Lifecycle.

The DoE program, called COOLERCHIPS, received more than 100 applications from a who\u2019s who list of computer architects and researchers.\n\u201cThis is another example of how we\u2019re rearchitecting the data center,\u201d said Ali Heydari, a distinguished engineer at NVIDIA who leads the project and helped deploy more than a million servers in previous roles at Baidu, Twitter and Facebook.\n\u201cWe celebrated on Slack because the team is all over the U.S.,\u201d said Jeremy Rodriguez, who once built hyperscale liquid-cooling systems and now manages NVIDIA\u2019s data center engineering team.\nA Historic Shift\nThe project is ambitious and comes at a critical moment in the history of computing.\nProcessors are expected to generate up to an order of magnitude more heat as Moore\u2019s law hits the limits of physics, but the demands on data centers continue to soar.\nSoon, today\u2019s air-cooled systems won\u2019t be able to keep up. Current liquid-cooling techniques won\u2019t be able to handle the more than 40 watts per square centimeter researchers expect future silicon in data centers will need to dissipate.\nSo, Heydari\u2019s group defined an advanced liquid-cooling system.\nTheir approach promises to cool a data center packed into a mobile container, even when it\u2019s placed in an environment up to 40 degrees Celsius and is drawing 200kW \u2014 25x the power of today\u2019s server racks.\nIt will cost at least 5% less and run 20% more efficiently than today\u2019s air-cooled approaches. It\u2019s much quieter and has a smaller carbon footprint, too.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a great achievement for our engineers who are very smart folks,\u201d he said, noting part of their mission is to make people aware of the changes ahead.\nA Radical Proposal\nThe team\u2019s solution combines two technologies never before deployed in tandem.\nFirst, chips will be cooled with cold plates whose coolant evaporates like sweat on the foreheads of hard-working processors, then cools to condense and re-form as liquid. Second, entire servers, with their lower power components, will be encased in hermetically sealed containers and immersed in coolant.\nNovel solution: Servers will be bathed in coolants as part of the project.\nThey will use a liquid common in refrigerators and car air conditioners, but not yet used in data centers.\nThree Giant Steps\nThe three-year project sets annual milestones \u2014 component tests next year, a partial rack test a year later, and a full system tested and delivered at the end.\nIcing the cake, the team will create a full digital twin of the system using NVIDIA Omniverse, an open development platform for building and operating metaverse applications.\nThe NVIDIA team consists of about a dozen thermal, power, mechanical and systems engineers, some dedicated to creating the digital twin. They have help from seven partners:\n\nBinghamton and Villanova universities in analysis, testing and simulation\nBOYD Corp.\u00a0for the cold plates\nDurbin Group for the pumping system\nHoneywell to help select the refrigerant\nSandia National Laboratory in reliability assessment, and\nVertiv Corp. in heat rejection\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re extending relationships we\u2019ve built for years, and each group brings an array of engineers,\u201d said Heydari.\nOf course, it\u2019s hard work, too.\nFor instance, Mohammed Tradat, a former Binghamton researcher who now heads an NVIDIA data center mechanical engineering group, \u201chad a sleepless night working on the grant application, but it\u2019s a labor of love for all of us,\u201d he said.\nHeydari said he never imagined the team would be bringing its ideas to life when he delivered a talk on them in late 2021.\n\u201cNo other company would allow us to build an organization that could do this kind of work \u2014 we\u2019re making history and that\u2019s amazing,\u201d said Rodriguez.\nSee how digital twins, built in Omniverse, help optimize the design of a data center in the video below.\n\nPicture at top: Gathered recently at NVIDIA headquarters are (from left) Scott Wallace (NVIDIA), Greg Strover (Vertiv), Vivien Lecoustre (DoE), Vladimir Troy (NVIDIA), Peter Debock (COOLERCHIPS program director), Rakesh Radhakrishnan (DoE), Joseph Marsala (Durbin Group), Nigel Gore (Vertiv), and Jeremy Rodriguez, Bahareh Eslami, Manthos Economou, Harold Miyamura and Ali Heydari (all of NVIDIA).\n\n\nCategories: Data CenterTags: GPU | GPU Computing | Hardware | High-Performance Computing | NVIDIA Research | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

These include: NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122, which connects top computer-aided design apps, as well as APIs and cutting-edge frameworks for generative AI; the NVIDIA Isaac Sim\u2122 application for simulating and testing robots; and the NVIDIA Metropolis vision AI framework, now enabled for automated optical inspection.\nIn his keynote address at COMPUTEX, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang showcased a demo of an entirely digitalized smart factory\u00a0\u2014 an industry first for electronics makers.\n\u201cThe world\u2019s largest industries make physical things. Building them digitally first can save enormous costs,\u201d said Huang. \u201cNVIDIA makes it easy for electronics makers to build and operate virtual factories, digitalize their manufacturing and inspection workflows, and greatly improve quality and safety while reducing costly last-minute surprises and delays.\u201d\nWorld\u2019s Leading Electronics Makers Embrace Digitalization With NVIDIA\r\nThe new reference workflow is being used by Foxconn Industrial Internet, Innodisk, Pegatron, Quanta and Wistron as they work to optimize their workcell and assembly line operations while lowering production costs.\nFoxconn Industrial Internet, a service arm of the world\u2019s largest technology manufacturer, is working with NVIDIA Metropolis ecosystem partners to automate significant portions of its circuit-board quality-assurance inspection points.\n\u201cNVIDIA\u2019s strength in AI and its strong ecosystem of application partners are providing Foxconn Industrial Internet with a path to significant operational efficiency gains,\u201d said Tai-Yu Chou, CTO at Foxconn Industrial Internet. \u201cThe combination of NVIDIA Metropolis for factories and Isaac Sim for robotics is helping us realize industrial automation goals faster than ever imagined.\u201d\nInnodisk is deploying NVIDIA Metropolis to automate optical inspection processes on its production lines, saving cost and improving production efficiency.\nPegatron, a leading electronics manufacturer and service provider, is using the reference workflow to digitalize its circuit-board factories with simulation, robotics and automated production inspection.\n\u201cNVIDIA Omniverse, Isaac Sim and Metropolis give us the ability to accomplish AI training, enhance factory workflows and run numerous simulations in the virtual world before we commit to an idea in the physical world,\u201d said Andrew Hsiao, associate vice president of the software R&D division at Pegatron. \u201cDigitalizing our entire factory enables us to simulate the robotics and automation pipeline from end to end, and lets us try things out in a simulated environment, which saves time and greatly reduces costs.\u201d\nQuanta, a major manufacturer of laptops and other electronic hardware, is using AI robots from its subsidiary Techman Robot to inspect the quality of manufactured products. Techman is leveraging Isaac Sim to simulate, test and optimize its state-of-the-art collaborative robots while using NVIDIA AI and GPUs for inference on the robots themselves.\nWistron, one of the world\u2019s largest suppliers of information and communications products, is tapping NVIDIA Omniverse to build digital twins of its automated receiving lines and operations buildings using inputs from Autodesk AutoCAD, Autodesk Revit and FlexSim. Wistron also uses NVIDIA Metropolis to automate portions of its circuit-board optical inspection using AI-enabled computer vision.\nIndustrial Ecosystem Swarms NVIDIA Technologies\r\nNVIDIA is working with several leading manufacturing-tools and service providers to build a full-stack, single architecture with each at every workflow level.\nAt the systems level, NVIDIA IGX Orin\u2122 provides an all-in-one edge AI platform, combining industrial-grade hardware with enterprise-level software and support. IGX meets the unique durability and low-power-consumption requirements of edge computing, while delivering the high performance needed for developing and running AI applications.\nManufacturer partners ADLINK, Advantech, Aetina, Dedicated Computing, Onyx, Prodrive Technologies and Yuan are developing IGX-powered systems to serve the industrial and medical markets. These systems allow the benefits of digitalization to be realized during physical production.\nAt the platform level, Omniverse connects the world\u2019s leading 3D, simulation and generative AI providers. The open development platform, for example, lets teams build interoperability between their favorite applications \u2014 such as those from Adobe, Autodesk and Siemens.\nA demo in the COMPUTEX keynote showcased Omniverse connected to various AI assistants, such as ChatGPT and Blender GPT, to simplify 3D workflows and Python-application development. NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud, a platform-as-a-service now available on Microsoft Azure, gives enterprise customers access to the full-stack suite of Omniverse software applications, and NVIDIA OVX infrastructure, with the scale and security of Azure cloud services.\nAnd at the application level, Isaac Sim allows companies to build and optimally deploy AI-based robots. Manufacturers can work with industrial automation company READY Robotics to program their robot tasks in simulation before deploying in the real world. Simulation technology partners like SoftServe and FS Studio shorten development timelines for customers by building digital twin-based simulations.\nAlso at the application level, NVIDIA Metropolis includes a collection of factory-automation AI workflows that enable industrial solution providers and manufacturers to develop, deploy and manage customized quality-control solutions that save cost and improve production throughput. A large partner ecosystem \u2014 including ADLINK, Aetina, Deloitte, Quantiphi and Siemens \u2014 is helping to bring these solutions to market.\nLearn more about Omniverse, Isaac Sim and Metropolis at COMPUTEX.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

It\u2019s one component of a larger memory subsystem that helps make sure your GPU has access to the data it needs to smoothly process and display images.\nIn this article, we\u2019ll describe memory subsystem innovations in our latest generation Ada Lovelace GPU architecture, as well as how the speed and size of GPU cache and VRAM impacts performance and the gameplay experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 40 Series Graphics Cards Memory Subsystem: Improving Performance & Efficiency\nModern games are graphical showcases, and their install sizes can now exceed 100GB. Accessing this massive amount of data happens at different speeds, determined by the specifications of the GPU, and to some extent your system\u2019s other components.\nOn GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards, new innovations accelerate the process for smooth gaming and faster frame rates, helping you avoid texture stream-in or other hiccups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Importance Of Cache\nGPUs include high-speed memory caches that are close to the GPU\u2019s processing cores, which store data that is likely to be needed. If the GPU can recall the data from the caches, rather than requesting it from the VRAM (further away) or system RAM (even further away), the data will be accessed and processed faster, increasing performance and gameplay fluidity, and reducing power consumption.\nGeForce GPUs feature a Level 1 (L1) cache (the closest and fastest cache) in each Streaming Multiprocessor (SM), up to twelve of which can be found in each GeForce RTX 40 Series Graphics Processing Cluster (GPC). This is followed by a fast, larger, shared Level 2 (L2) cache that can be accessed quickly with minimal latency.\nAccessing each cache level incurs a latency hit, with the tradeoff being greater capacity. When designing our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, we found a singular, large L2 cache to be faster and more efficient than other alternatives, such as those featuring a small L2 cache, and a large, slower to access L3 cache.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior generation GeForce GPUs had much smaller L2 Caches, resulting in lower performance and efficiency compared to today\u2019s GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring use, the GPU first searches for data in the L1 data cache within the SM, and if the data is found in L1 there\u2019s no need to access the L2 data cache. If data is not found in L1, it\u2019s called a \u201ccache miss\u201d, and the search continues into the L2 cache. If data is found in L2, that\u2019s called an L2 \u201ccache hit\u201d (see the \u201cH\u201d indicators in the above diagram), and data is provided to the L1 and then to the processing cores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf data is not found in the L2 cache, an L2 \u201ccache miss\u201d, the GPU now tries to obtain the data from the VRAM. You can see a number of L2 cache misses in the above diagram that depicts our prior architecture memory subsystem, which causes a number of VRAM accesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the data\u2019s missing from the VRAM, the GPU requests it from your system\u2019s memory. If the data is not in system memory, it can typically be loaded into system memory from a storage device like an SSD or hard drive. The data is then copied into VRAM, L2, L1, and ultimately fed to the processing cores. Note that different hardware -and software- based strategies exist to keep the most useful, and most reused data present in caches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach additional data read or write operation through the memory hierarchy slows performance and uses more power, so by increasing our cache hit rate we increase frame rates and efficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to prior generation GPUs with a 128-bit memory interface, the memory subsystem of the new NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture increases the size of the L2 cache by 16X, greatly increasing the cache hit rate. In the examples above, representing 128-bit GPUs from Ada and prior generation architectures, the hit rate is much higher with Ada. In addition, the L2 cache bandwidth in Ada GPUs has been significantly increased versus prior GPUs. This allows more data to be transferred between the cores and the L2 cache as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShown in the diagram below, NVIDIA engineers tested the RTX 4060 Ti with its 32 MB L2 cache against a special test version of RTX 4060 Ti using only a 2 MB L2, which represents the L2 cache size of previous generation 128-bit GPUs (where 512 KB of L2 cache was tied to each 32-bit memory controller).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn testing with a variety of games and synthetic benchmarks, the 32 MB L2 cache reduced memory bus traffic by just over 50% on average compared to the performance of a 2 MB L2 cache. See the reduced VRAM accesses in the Ada Memory Subsystem diagram above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis 50% traffic reduction allows the GPU to use its memory bandwidth 2X more efficiently. As a result, in this scenario, isolating for memory performance, an Ada GPU with 288 GB/sec of peak memory bandwidth would perform similarly to an Ampere GPU with 554 GB/sec of peak memory bandwidth. Across an array of games and synthetic tests, the greatly increased hit rates improve frame rates by up to 34%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemory Bus Width Is One Aspect Of A Memory Subsystem\nHistorically, memory bus width has been used as an important metric for determining the speed and performance class of a new GPU. However, the bus width by itself is not a sufficient indicator of memory subsystem performance. Instead, it\u2019s helpful to understand the broader memory subsystem design and its overall impact on gaming performance.\nDue to the advances in the Ada architecture, including new RT and Tensor Cores, higher clock speeds, the new OFA Engine, and Ada\u2019s DLSS 3 capabilities, the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti is faster than the previous-generations, 256-bit GeForce RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 2060 SUPER graphics cards, all while using less power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAltogether, the tech specs deliver a great 60-class GPU with high performance for 1080p gamers, who account for the majority of Steam users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Amount of VRAM Is Dependent On GPU Architecture\nGamers often wonder why a graphics card has a certain amount of VRAM.\nCurrent-generation GDDR6X and GDDR6 memory is supplied in densities of 8Gb (1GB of data) and 16Gb (2GB of data) per chip. Each memory chip can use either two separate 16-bit channels to connect to a single 32-bit memory controller, or two 8-bit channels, so two memory chips can connect to a single 32-bit memory controller. This allows a 128-bit GPU to support either 4 memory chips or 8 memory chips.\nHigher capacity chips cost more to make, so a balance is required to optimize prices.\nOn our new 128-bit memory bus GeForce RTX 4060 Ti GPUs, the 8GB model uses four 16Gb GDDR6 memory chips, and the 16GB model uses eight 16Gb chips. Mixing densities isn\u2019t possible, preventing the creation of a 12GB model, for example. That\u2019s also why the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti has an option with more memory (16GB) than the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti and 4070, which have 192-bit memory interfaces and therefore 12GB of VRAM.\nOur 60-class GPUs have been carefully crafted to deliver the optimum combination of performance, price, and power efficiency, which is why we chose a 128-bit memory interface.\nIn short, higher capacity GPUs of the same bus width always have double the memory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo On Screen Display (OSD) Tools Report VRAM Usage Accurately?\nGamers often cite the \u201cVRAM usage\u201d metric in On Screen Display performance measurement tools. But this number isn\u2019t entirely accurate, as all games and game engines work differently.\nIn the majority of cases, a game will allocate VRAM for itself, saying to your system, \u2018I want it in case I need it\u2019. But just because it\u2019s holding the VRAM, doesn\u2019t mean it actually needs all of it. In fact, games will often request more memory if it\u2019s available.\nDue to the way memory works, it\u2019s impossible to know precisely what\u2019s being actively used unless you\u2019re the game\u2019s developer with access to development tools. Some games offer a guide in the options menu, but even that isn\u2019t always accurate.\nThe amount of VRAM that is actually needed will vary in real time depending on the scene and what the player is seeing.\nFurthermore, the behavior of games can vary when VRAM is genuinely used to its max. In some, memory is purged causing a noticeable performance hitch while the current scene is reloaded into memory. In others, only select data will be loaded and unloaded, with no visible impact. And in some cases, new assets may load in slower as they\u2019re now being brought in from system RAM.\nFor gamers, playing is the only way to truly ascertain a game\u2019s behavior. In addition, gamers can look at \"1% low\u201d framerate measurements, which can help analyze the actual gaming experience. The 1% Low metric \u2014found in the performance overlay and logs of the free NVIDIA FrameView app, as well as other popular measurement tools\u2014 measures the average of the slowest 1% of frames over a certain time period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomate Setting Selection With GeForce Experience & Download The Latest Patches\nRecently, some new games have released patches to better manage memory usage, without hampering the visual quality. Make sure to get the latest patches for new launches, as they commonly fix bugs and optimize performance shortly after launch.\nAdditionally, GeForce Experience supports most new games, offering optimized settings for each supported GeForce GPU and VRAM configuration, giving gamers the best possible experience by balancing performance and image quality.\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with game option lingo and just want to enjoy your games from the second you load them, GeForce Experience can automatically tune game settings for a great experience each time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Technologies Can Help Developers Reduce VRAM Usage\nGames are richer and more detailed than ever before, necessitating those 100GB+ installs. To help developers optimize memory usage, NVIDIA has several free developer tools and SDKs, including:\n\nNVIDIA RTX Memory Utility (RTXMU): Ray tracing requires additional VRAM. RTXMU can reduce this usage by up to 50%\nNVIDIA Micro-Mesh SDK: Reduces the memory usage of complex geometry while also increasing performance\nNVIDIA Texture Tools Exporter: Creates highly compressed texture files to reduce memory usage and the file size of games\n\nThese are just a few of the tools and technologies that NVIDIA freely provides to help developers optimize their games for all GPUs, platforms, and memory configurations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Applications Can Use More VRAM \nBeyond gaming, GeForce RTX graphics cards are used around the world for 3D animation, video editing, motion graphics, photography, graphic design, architectural visualization, STEM, broadcasting, and AI. Some of the applications used in these industries may benefit from additional VRAM. For example, when editing 4K or 8K timelines in Premiere, or crafting a massive architectural scene in D5 Render.\nOn the gaming side, high resolutions also generally require an increase in VRAM. Occasionally, a game may launch with an optional extra large texture pack and allocate more VRAM. And there are a handful of games which run best at the \u201cHigh\u201d preset on the 4060 Ti (8GB), and maxed-out \"Ultra\" settings on the 4060 Ti (16GB). In most games, both versions of the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti (8GB and 16GB) can play at max settings and will deliver the same performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe benefit of the PC platform is its openness, configurability and upgradability, which is why we\u2019re offering the two memory configurations for the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti; if you want that extra VRAM, it will be available in July.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA GPU For Every Gamer\nFollowing the launch of the GeForce RTX 4060 Family, there\u2019ll be optimized graphics cards for each of the three major game resolutions. However you play, all GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs will deliver a best-in-class experience, with leading power efficiency, supported by a massive range of game-enhancing technologies, including NVIDIA DLSS 3, NVIDIA Reflex, NVIDIA G-SYNC, NVIDIA Broadcast, and RTX Remix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest news about all the new games and apps that leverage the full capabilities of GeForce RTX graphics cards, stay tuned to GeForce.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  NVIDIA today introduced a wave of cutting-edge AI research that will enable developers and artists to bring their ideas to life \u2014 whether still or moving, in 2D or 3D, hyperrealistic or fantastical.\nAround 20 NVIDIA Research papers advancing generative AI and neural graphics \u2014 including collaborations with over a dozen universities in the U.S., Europe and Israel \u2014 are headed to SIGGRAPH 2023, the premier computer graphics conference, taking place Aug. 6-10 in Los Angeles.\nThe papers include generative AI models that turn text into personalized images; inverse rendering tools that transform still images into 3D objects; neural physics models that use AI to simulate complex 3D elements with stunning realism; and neural rendering models that unlock new capabilities for generating real-time, AI-powered visual details.\nInnovations by NVIDIA researchers are regularly shared with developers on GitHub and incorporated into products, including the NVIDIA Omniverse platform for building and operating metaverse applications and NVIDIA Picasso, a recently announced foundry for custom generative AI models for visual design. Years of NVIDIA graphics research helped bring film-style rendering to games, like the recently released Cyberpunk 2077 Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, the world\u2019s first path-traced AAA title.\nThe research advancements presented this year at SIGGRAPH will help developers and enterprises rapidly generate synthetic data to populate virtual worlds for robotics and autonomous vehicle training. They\u2019ll also enable creators in art, architecture, graphic design, game development and film to more quickly produce high-quality visuals for storyboarding, previsualization and even production.\nAI With a Personal Touch: Customized Text-to-Image Models\nGenerative AI models that transform text into images are powerful tools to create concept art or storyboards for films, video games and 3D virtual worlds. Text-to-image AI tools can turn a prompt like \u201cchildren\u2019s toys\u201d into nearly infinite visuals a creator can use for inspiration \u2014 generating images of stuffed animals, blocks or puzzles.\nHowever, artists may have a particular subject in mind. A creative director for a toy brand, for example, could be planning an ad campaign around a new teddy bear and want to visualize the toy in different situations, such as a teddy bear tea party. To enable this level of specificity in the output of a generative AI model, researchers from Tel Aviv University and NVIDIA have two SIGGRAPH papers that enable users to provide image examples that the model quickly learns from.\nOne paper describes a technique that needs a single example image to customize its output, accelerating the personalization process from minutes to roughly 11 seconds on a single NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU, more than 60x faster than previous personalization approaches.\nA second paper introduces a highly compact model called Perfusion, which takes a handful of concept images to allow users to combine multiple personalized elements \u2014 such as a specific teddy bear and teapot \u2014 into a single AI-generated visual:\n\nServing in 3D: Advances in Inverse Rendering and Character Creation\u00a0\nOnce a creator comes up with concept art for a virtual world, the next step is to render the environment and populate it with 3D objects and characters. NVIDIA Research is inventing AI techniques to accelerate this time-consuming process by automatically transforming 2D images and videos into 3D representations that creators can import into graphics applications for further editing.\nA third paper created with researchers at the University of California, San Diego, discusses tech that can generate and render a photorealistic 3D head-and-shoulders model based on a single 2D portrait \u2014 a major breakthrough that makes 3D avatar creation and 3D video conferencing accessible with AI. The method runs in real time on a consumer desktop, and can generate a photorealistic or stylized 3D telepresence using only conventional webcams or smartphone cameras.\nA fourth project, a collaboration with Stanford University, brings lifelike motion to 3D characters. The researchers created an AI system that can learn a range of tennis skills from 2D video recordings of real tennis matches and apply this motion to 3D characters. The simulated tennis players can accurately hit the ball to target positions on a virtual court, and even play extended rallies with other characters.\nBeyond the test case of tennis, this SIGGRAPH paper addresses the difficult challenge of producing 3D characters that can perform diverse skills with realistic movement \u2014 without the use of expensive motion-capture data.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tennis.mp4\n\u00a0\nNot a Hair Out of Place: Neural Physics Enables Realistic Simulations\nOnce a 3D character is generated, artists can layer in realistic details such as hair \u2014 a complex, computationally expensive challenge for animators.\nHumans have an average of 100,000 hairs on their heads, with each reacting dynamically to an individual\u2019s motion and the surrounding environment. Traditionally, creators have used physics formulas to calculate hair movement, simplifying or approximating its motion based on the resources available. That\u2019s why virtual characters in a big-budget film sport much more detailed heads of hair than real-time video game avatars.\nA fifth paper showcases a method that can simulate tens of thousands of hairs in high resolution and in real time using neural physics, an AI technique that teaches a neural network to predict how an object would move in the real world.\n\nThe team\u2019s novel approach for accurate simulation of full-scale hair is specifically optimized for modern GPUs. It offers significant performance leaps compared to state-of-the-art, CPU-based solvers, reducing simulation times from multiple days to merely hours \u2014 while also boosting the quality of hair simulations possible in real time. This technique finally enables both accurate and interactive physically based hair grooming.\nNeural Rendering Brings Film-Quality Detail to Real-Time Graphics\u00a0\nAfter an environment is filled with animated 3D objects and characters, real-time rendering simulates the physics of light reflecting through the virtual scene. Recent NVIDIA research shows how AI models for textures, materials and volumes can deliver film-quality, photorealistic visuals in real time for video games and digital twins.\nNVIDIA invented programmable shading over two decades ago, enabling developers to customize the graphics pipeline. In these latest neural rendering inventions, researchers extend programmable shading code with AI models that run deep inside NVIDIA\u2019s real-time graphics pipelines.\nIn a sixth SIGGRAPH paper, NVIDIA will present neural texture compression that delivers up to 16x more texture detail without taking additional GPU memory. Neural texture compression can substantially increase the realism of 3D scenes, as seen in the image below, which demonstrates how neural-compressed textures (right) capture sharper detail than previous formats, where the text remains blurry (center).\nNeural texture compression (right) provides up to 16x more texture detail than previous texture formats without using additional GPU memory.\nA related paper announced last year is now available in early access as NeuralVDB, an AI-enabled data compression technique that decreases by 100x the memory needed to represent volumetric data \u2014 like smoke, fire, clouds and water.\nNVIDIA also released today more details about neural materials research that was shown in the most recent NVIDIA GTC keynote. The paper describes an AI system that learns how light reflects from photoreal, many-layered materials, reducing the complexity of these assets down to small neural networks that run in real time, enabling up to 10x faster shading.\nThe level of realism can be seen in this neural-rendered teapot, which accurately represents the ceramic, the imperfect clear-coat glaze, fingerprints, smudges and even dust.\nThe neural material model learns how light reflects from the many-layered, photoreal reference materials.\nMore Generative AI and Graphics Research\nThese are just the highlights \u2014 read more about all the NVIDIA research presentations at SIGGRAPH.

With DLSS 3, AI-powered frame generation creates new, high-quality frames for smoother gameplay. Combined with our Super Resolution technology, DLSS 3 can render seven out of every eight pixels in a scene with AI. Adoption continues to accelerate and NVIDIA DLSS is now delivering AI-accelerated performance in over 300 games and applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week, D5 Render, the real-time ray tracing renderer for architects, landscape, interior designers, engineers and other 3D professionals, introduces support for DLSS 3, multiplying performance. DLSS 3 significantly enhances the real-time rendering experience of D5, allowing creators to work with larger scenes and higher-quality models and textures, without sacrificing speed or interactivity.\nFor gamers, The Outlast Trials launches today with DLSS 2, and Bus Simulator 21 has been updated with support for DLSS 2.\nLooking to the future, we can reveal that Ashfall, NetEase\u2019s post-apocalyptic MMORPG, will launch with DLSS 3\u00a0 - check out a new, exclusive gameplay trailer below, and get further details on all of our announcements.\nTo discover which games and apps are adding DLSS next, return to GeForce.com each week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 3 Multiplies Frame Rates\nPowered by new hardware capabilities of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture, DLSS 3 generates entirely new high quality frames, rather than just pixels.\nThrough a process detailed in full in our NVIDIA DLSS 3 article, DLSS 3 combines DLSS Super Resolution technology and DLSS Frame Generation to reconstruct 7 out of every 8 of the displayed pixels, multiplying performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn GPU-limited games, DLSS 2 Super Resolution technology can increase your frame rates by up to 2X. With DLSS 3, we can increase performance even further with new frames - in the technology preview of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, 4K performance on a GeForce RTX 4090 is boosted by up to 4.6X.\nOther games make extensive use of the CPU, which can limit performance. DLSS 3 operates on the GPU, bypassing CPU bottlenecks and boosting frame rates. In Microsoft Flight Simulator, DLSS 3 boosts frame rates by up to 2X.\nDLSS 3 games are backwards compatible with DLSS 2 technology - developers simply integrate DLSS 3, and DLSS 2, also known as DLSS Super Resolution, is supported by default. Additionally, integrations of DLSS 3 also include NVIDIA Reflex, reducing system latency for all GeForce RTX users, making games more responsive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD5 Render Multiplies Performance With NVIDIA DLSS 3 Update\nThe latest update to D5 Render multiplies performance with the addition of DLSS 3 support. The industry-leading software enables users to see every modification to a scene in real-time, and is compatible with popular modeling software like SketchUp, 3ds Max, Revit, Archicad, Rhino, C4D, and Blender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD5 Render, one of the RTX-accelerated apps in the NVIDIA Studio platform for creators, previously integrated DLSS 2, our AI feature that allows apps to render a smaller version of the image and super res it with AI, providing virtually the same level of quality at significantly higher performance.\nNow, support for DLSS 3 on GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs has been added to D5, boosting real-time viewport frame rates even further. DLSS 3 uses AI to interpolate frames - boosting framerates and enabling a smoother experience when editing on the viewport or presenting work to clients. For users dealing with large, photorealistic archviz projects, this makes a massive difference, turning a lagging viewport into a smooth, responsive one.\n\"We are excited to integrate DLSS 3 into D5, which will greatly enhance the real-time performance for our users,\" said Jessie Huang, VP of Marketing & Operations, D5. \"With this integration, we believe that D5 will continue to lead the way in real-time rendering and provide our users with an unparalleled creative experience.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAshfall Will Launch With NVIDIA DLSS 3\nNetEase and Legendary Star Studio\u2019s Ashfall is a post-apocalyptic MMORPG shooter set far in the future.

We\u2019re also deep diving on new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.\nThe GeForce RTX 4060 family will be available starting next week, bringing massive creator benefits to the popular 60-class GPUs.\nThe latest GPUs in the 40 Series come backed by NVIDIA Studio technologies, including hardware acceleration for 3D, video and AI workflows; optimizations for RTX hardware in over 110 of the most popular creative apps; and exclusive Studio apps like Omniverse, Broadcast and Canvas.\nReal-time ray-tracing renderer D5 Render introduced support for NVIDIA DLSS 3 technology, enabling super smooth real-time rendering experiences, so creators can work with larger scenes without sacrificing speed or interactivity.\n\nPlus, the new Into the Omniverse series highlights the latest advancements to NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform furthering the evolution of the metaverse with the OpenUSD framework. The series showcases how artists, developers and enterprises can use the open development platform to transform their 3D workflows. The first installment highlights an update coming soon to the Adobe Substance 3D Painter Connector.\nIn addition, NVIDIA 3D artist Daniel Barnes returns this week In the NVIDIA Studio to share his mesmerizing, whimsical animation, Wormhole 00527.\nBeyond Fast\nThe GeForce RTX 4060 family is powered by the ultra-efficient NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture with fourth-generation Tensor Cores for AI content creation, third-generation RT Cores and compatibility with DLSS 3 for ultra-fast 3D rendering, as well as the eighth-generation NVIDIA encoder (NVENC), now with support for AV1.\nThe GeForce RTX 4060 Ti GPU.\n3D modelers can build and edit realistic 3D models in real time, up to 45% faster than the previous generation, thanks to third-generation RT Cores, DLSS 3 and the NVIDIA Omniverse platform.\nTested on GeForce RTX 4060 and 3060 GPUs. Maya with Arnold 2022 (7.1.1) measures render time of NVIDIA SOL 3D model. DaVinci Resolve measures FPS applying Magic Mask effect \u201cFaster\u201d quality setting to 4K resolution. ON1 Resize AI measures time required to apply effect to batch of 10 photos. Time measurement is normalized for easier comparison across tests.\nVideo editors specializing in Adobe Premiere Pro, Blackmagic Design\u2019s DaVinci Resolve and more have at their disposal a variety of AI-powered effects, such as auto-reframe, magic mask and depth estimation. Fourth-generation Tensor Cores seamlessly hyper-accelerate these effects, so creators can stay in their flow states.\nBroadcasters can jump into next-generation livestreaming with the eighth-generation NVENC with support for AV1. The new encoder is 40% more efficient, making livestreams appear as if there were a 40% increase in bitrate \u2014 a big boost in image quality that enables 4K streaming on apps like OBS Studio and platforms such as YouTube and Discord.\n10 Mbps with default OBS streaming settings.\nNVENC boasts the most efficient hardware encoding available, providing significantly better quality than other GPUs. At the same bitrate, images will look better, sharper and have less artifacts, like in the example above.\nEncode quality comparison, measured with BD-BR.\nCreators are embracing AI en masse. DLSS 3 multiplies frame rates in popular 3D apps. ON1 ResizeAI, software that enables high-quality photo enlargement, is sped up 24% compared with last-generation hardware. DaVinci Resolve\u2019s AI Magic Mask feature saves video editors considerable time automating the highly manual process of rotoscoping, carried out 20% faster than the previous generation.\nThe GeForce RTX 4060 Ti (8GB) will be available starting Wednesday, May 24, at $399. The GeForce RTX 4060 Ti (16GB) will be available in July, starting at $499. GeForce RTX 4060 will also be available in July, starting at $299.\nVisit the Studio Shop for GeForce RTX 4060-powered NVIDIA Studio systems when available, and explore the range of high-performance Studio products.\nD5 Render, DLSS 3 Combine to Beautiful Effect\nD5 Render adds support for NVIDIA DLSS 3, bringing a vastly improved real-time experience to architects, designers, interior designers and 3D artists.\nSuch professionals want to navigate scenes smoothly while editing, and demonstrate their creations to clients in the highest quality. Scenes can be incredibly detailed and complex, making it difficult to maintain high real-time viewport frame rates and present in original quality.\nD5 is coveted by many artists for its global illumination technology, called D5 GI, which delivers high-quality lighting and shading effects in real time, without sacrificing workflow efficiency.\nD5 Render and DLSS 3 work brilliantly to create photorealistic imagery.\nBy integrating DLSS 3, which combines AI-powered DLSS Frame Generation and Super Resolution technologies, real-time viewport frame rates increase up to 3x, making creator experiences buttery smooth. This allows designers to deal with larger scenes, higher-quality models and textures \u2014 all in real time \u2014 while maintaining a smooth, interactive viewport.\nLearn more about the update.\nVenture \u2018Into the Omniverse\u2019\nNVIDIA Omniverse is a key component of the NVIDIA Studio platform and the future of collaborative 3D content creation.\nA new monthly blog series, Into the Omniverse, showcases how artists, developers and enterprises can transform their creative workflows using the latest Omniverse advancements.\nThis month, 3D creators across industries are set to benefit from the pairing of Omniverse and the Adobe Substance 3D suite of creative tools.\n\u201cEnd of Summer,\u201d created by the Adobe Substance 3D art and development team, built in Omniverse.\nAn upcoming update to the Omniverse Connector for Adobe Substance 3D Painter will dramatically increase flexibility for users, with new capabilities including an export feature using Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD), an open, extensible file framework enabling non-destructive workflows and collaboration in scene creation.\nFind details in the blog and check in every month for more Omniverse news.\nYour Last Worm-ing\nNVIDIA 3D artist Daniel Barnes has a simple initial approach to his work: sketch until something seems cool enough to act on. While his piece Wormhole 00527 was no exception to this usual process, an emotional component made a significant impact on it.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/nvidia-studio-itns-wk57-daniel-barnes-1280w-clip2.mp4\n\u00a0\n\u201cAfter the pandemic and various global events, I took even more interest in spaceships and escape pods,\u201d said Barnes. \u201cIt was just an abstract form of escapism that really played on the idea of \u2018get me out of here,\u2019 which I think we all experienced at one point, being inside so much.\u201d\nBarnes imagined Wormhole 00527 to comprise each blur one might pass by as an alternate star system \u2014 a place on the other side of the galaxy where things are really similar but more peaceful, he said. \u201cAn alternate Earth of sorts,\u201d the artist added.\nSculpting on his tablet one night in the Nomad app, Barnes imported a primitive model into Autodesk Maya for further refinement. He retopologized the scene, converting high-resolution models into much smaller files that can be used for animation.\nModeling in Autodesk Maya.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been creating in 3D for over a decade now, and GeForce RTX graphics cards have been able to power multiple displays smoothly and run my 3D software viewports at great speeds. Plus, rendering in real time on some projects is great for fast development.\u201d \u2014 Daniel Barnes\n\nBarnes then took a screenshot, further sketched out his modeling edits and made lighting decisions in Adobe Photoshop.\nHis GeForce RTX 4090 GPU gives him access to over 30 GPU-accelerated features for quickly, smoothly modifying and adjusting images. These features include blur gallery, object selection and perspective warp.\nBack in Autodesk Maya, Barnes used the quad-draw tool \u2014 a streamlined, one-tool workflow for retopologizing meshes \u2014 to create geometry, adding break-in panels that would be advantageous for animating.\nSo this is what a wormhole looks like.\nBarnes used Chaos V-Ray with Autodesk Maya\u2019s Z-depth feature, which provides information about each object\u2019s distance from the camera in its current view. Each pixel representing the object is evaluated for distance individually \u2014 meaning different pixels for the same object can have varying grayscale values. This made it far easier for Barnes to tweak depth of field and add motion-blur effects.\nExample of Z-depth. Image courtesy of Chaos V-Ray with Autodesk Maya.\nHe also added a combination of lights and applied materials with ease. Deploying RTX-accelerated ray tracing and AI denoising with the default Autodesk Arnold renderer enabled smooth movement in the viewport, resulting in beautifully photorealistic renders.\nThe Z-depth feature made it easier to apply motion-blur effects.\nHe finished the project by compositing in Adobe After Effects, using GPU-accelerated features for faster rendering with NVIDIA CUDA technology.\n3D artist Daniel Barnes.\nWhen asked what his favorite creative tools are, Barnes didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cDefinitely my RTX cards and nice large displays!\u201d he said.\nCheck out Barnes\u2019 portfolio on Instagram.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

The rip higher comes after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings Wednesday, and pointed to a dramatic acceleration in data center revenue in the current quarter.  Nvidia is the leading AI chip maker thanks to years of investments in AI technologies. And according to Raymond James managing director Srini Pajjuri, the company isn\u2019t going to lose that title anytime soon. \u201cThere\u2019s only one supplier of GPUs, and Nvidia has been investing in this market for the last 10 years. They not only have the chips, they have the systems, the software, it\u2019s a full stack solutions company,\u201d explained Pajjuri. \u201cIn the short term, Nvidia is the only game in town,\u201d he said. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    116.81 -2.72 (-2.27%)  As of 3:18:51 PM EDT. Market Open.     Advanced Chart    Nvidia beat analysts\u2019 expectations on the top and bottom line in Q1 thanks to its data center business, which brought in $4.2 billion in revenue versus the $3.9 billion Wall Street was anticipating. That was better than the same quarter last year when the company reported data center revenue of $3.8 billion. Nvidia\u2019s gaming business, meanwhile, continues to deal with a COVID hangover, as consumers continue to pull back on spending on PCs and graphics cards after buying them up during the pandemic. The segment brought in $2.2 billion, which was better than the $1.9 billion Wall Street expected, but lower than the $3.6 billion the company reported in Q1 last year.   Sign up for the Yahoo Finance newsletter.  \u00b7 Yahoo Finance But it\u2019s Nvidia\u2019s projections for the second quarter that have caught Wall Street\u2019s attention. The company says it expects revenue of $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was looking for $7.2 billion. \u201cWe thought if they beat the guidance by about 5%, that\u2019s good enough for the stock to stay where it is. But they\u2019re beating [the] guidance consensus by 50%,\u201d Pajjuri said. \u201cThere\u2019s a war going on out there in AI, and Nvidia today is the only arms dealer out there. So as a result we\u2019re seeing this huge jump in revenues,\u201d he explained. Baird Equity Research senior research analyst Tristan Gerra echoed those sentiments in an investor note Thursday saying while platforms like Google\u2019s (GOOG, GOOGL) next-generation tensor processing unit could be competitive, it is unlikely to take market share from Nvidia.   Nvidia reported better than expected Q1 earnings on Wednesday. Courtesy NVIDIA/Handout via REUTERS  \u00b7 Handout . / reuters \u201cWe see nobody with a full-stack solution remotely matching Nvidia\u2019s capabilities,\u201d Gerra wrote. But the AI gold rush won\u2019t last forever for Nvidia. According to Pajjuri, long-time Nvidia rival AMD (AMD) could eventually begin to capture market share. Companies designing their own custom chips could also put the kibosh on Nvidia\u2019s party.   Story Continues \u201cNvidia\u2019s chips today sell for $25,000 a piece,\u201d he said. \u201cBy designing the chips in house, you can reduce the cost pretty significantly.\u201dThe current explosion in AI kicked off when OpenAI released its generative AI chatbot ChatGPT last year. Since then Microsoft and Google have jumped into the arena with search engines, bots, and more running powered by generative AI.The category\u2019s unprecedented growth has also drawn the attention of lawmakers who are looking at ways of potentially regulating the technology.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

Generative AI models and applications \u2014 like NVIDIA NeMo and DLSS 3 Frame Generation, Meta LLaMa, ChatGPT, Adobe Firefly and Stable Diffusion \u2014 use neural networks to identify patterns and structures within existing data to generate new and original content.\nWhen optimized for GeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX GPUs, which offer up to 1,400 Tensor TFLOPS for AI inferencing, generative AI models can run up to 5x faster than on competing devices. This is thanks to Tensor Cores \u2014 dedicated hardware in RTX GPUs built to accelerate AI calculations \u2014 and regular software improvements. Enhancements introduced last week at the Microsoft Build conference doubled performance for generative AI models, such as Stable Diffusion, that take advantage of new DirectML optimizations.\n\nAs more AI inferencing happens on local devices, PCs will need powerful yet efficient hardware to support these complex tasks. To meet this need, RTX GPUs will add Max-Q low-power inferencing for AI workloads. The GPU will operate at a fraction of the power for lighter inferencing tasks, while scaling up to unmatched levels of performance for heavy generative AI workloads.\nTo create new AI applications, developers can now access a complete RTX-accelerated AI development stack running on Windows 11, making it easier to develop, train and deploy advanced AI models. This starts with development and fine-tuning of models with optimized deep learning frameworks available via Windows Subsystem for Linux.\nDevelopers can then move seamlessly to the cloud to train on the same NVIDIA AI stack, which is available from every major cloud service provider. Next, developers can optimize the trained models for fast inferencing with tools like the new Microsoft Olive. And finally, they can deploy their AI-enabled applications and features to an install base of over 100 million RTX PCs and workstations\u00a0 that have been optimized for AI.\n\u201cAI will be the single largest driver of innovation for Windows customers in the coming years,\u201d said Pavan Davuluri, corporate vice president of Windows silicon and system integration at Microsoft. \u201cBy working in concert with NVIDIA on hardware and software optimizations, we\u2019re equipping developers with a transformative, high-performance, easy-to-deploy experience.\u201d\nTo date, over 400 RTX AI-accelerated apps and games have been released, with more on the way.\nDuring his keynote address kicking off COMPUTEX 2023, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang introduced a new generative AI to support game development, NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) for Games.\nThis custom AI model foundry service transforms games by bringing intelligence to non-playable characters through AI-powered natural language interactions. Developers of middleware, tools and games can use ACE for Games to build and deploy customized speech, conversation and animation AI models in their software and games.\nGenerative AI on RTX, Anywhere\nFrom servers to the cloud to devices, generative AI running on RTX GPUs is everywhere. NVIDIA\u2019s accelerated AI computing is a low-latency, full-stack endeavor. We\u2019ve been optimizing every part of our hardware and software architecture for many years for AI, including fourth-generation Tensor Cores \u2014 dedicated AI hardware on RTX GPUs.\nRegular driver optimizations ensure peak performance. The most recent NVIDIA driver, combined with Olive-optimized models and updates to DirectML, delivers significant speedups for developers on Windows 11. For example, Stable Diffusion performance is improved by 2x compared to the previous interference times for developers taking advantage of DirectML optimized paths.\nAnd with the latest generation of RTX laptops and mobile workstations built on the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture, users can take generative AI anywhere. Our next-gen mobile platform brings new levels of performance and portability \u2014 in form factors as small as 14 inches and as lightweight as about three pounds. Makers like Dell, HP, Lenovo and ASUS are pushing the generative AI era forward, backed by RTX GPUs and Tensor Cores.\n\u201cAs AI continues to get deployed across industries at an expected annual growth rate of over 37% now through 2030, businesses and consumers will increasingly need the right technology to develop and implement AI, including generative AI. Lenovo is uniquely positioned to empower generative AI spanning from devices to servers to the cloud, having developed products and solutions for AI workloads for years. Our NVIDIA RTX GPU-powered PCs, such as select Lenovo ThinkPad, ThinkStation, ThinkBook, Yoga, Legion and LOQ devices, are enabling the transformative wave of generative AI for better everyday user experiences in saving time, creating content, getting work done, gaming and more.\u201d \u2014 Daryl Cromer, vice president and chief technology officer of PCs and Smart Devices at Lenovo\n\u201cGenerative AI is transformative and a catalyst for future innovation across industries. Together, HP and NVIDIA equip developers with incredible performance, mobility and the reliability needed to run accelerated AI models today, while powering a new era of generative AI.\u201d \u2014\u00a0 Jim Nottingham, senior vice president and general manager of Z by HP\n\u201cOur recent work with NVIDIA on Project Helix centers on making it easier for enterprises to build and deploy trustworthy generative AI on premises. Another step in this historic moment is bringing generative AI to PCs. Think of app developers looking to perfect neural network algorithms while keeping training data and IP under local control. This is what our powerful and scalable Precision workstations with NVIDIA RTX GPUs are designed to do. And as the global leader in workstations, Dell is uniquely positioned to help users securely accelerate AI applications from the edge to the datacenter.\u201d \u2014 Ed Ward, president of the client product group at Dell Technologies\n\u201cThe generative AI era is upon us, requiring immense processing and fully optimized hardware and software. With the NVIDIA AI platform, including NVIDIA Omniverse, which is now preinstalled on many of our products, we are excited to see the AI revolution continue to take shape on ASUS and ROG laptops.\u201d \u2014 Galip Fu, director of global consumer marketing at ASUS\nSoon, laptops and mobile workstations with RTX GPUs will get the best of both worlds. AI inference-only workloads will be optimized for Tensor Core performance while keeping power consumption of the GPU as low as possible, extending battery life and maintaining a cool, quiet system. The GPU can then dynamically scale up for maximum AI performance when the workload demands it.\nDevelopers can also learn how to optimize their applications end-to-end to take full advantage of GPU-acceleration via the NVIDIA AI for accelerating applications developer site.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AI | Pro GraphicsTags: Artificial Intelligence | COMPUTEX 2023 | GeForce | Inference | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA RTX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Spectrum-X is supercharged by NVIDIA acceleration software and software development kits (SDKs), allowing developers to build software-defined, cloud-native AI applications.\nThe delivery of end-to-end capabilities reduces run-times of massive transformer-based generative AI models. This allows network engineers, AI data scientists and cloud service providers to improve results and make informed decisions faster.\nThe world\u2019s top hyperscalers are adopting NVIDIA Spectrum-X, including industry-leading cloud innovators.\nAs a blueprint and testbed for NVIDIA Spectrum-X reference designs, NVIDIA is building Israel-1, a hyperscale generative AI supercomputer to be deployed in its Israeli data center on Dell PowerEdge XE9680 servers based on the NVIDIA HGX\u2122 H100 eight-GPU platform, BlueField-3 DPUs and Spectrum-4 switches.\n\u201cTransformative technologies such as generative AI are forcing every enterprise to push the boundaries of data center performance in pursuit of competitive advantage,\u201d said Gilad Shainer, senior vice president of networking at NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA Spectrum-X is a new class of Ethernet networking that removes barriers for next-generation AI workloads that have the potential to transform entire industries.\u201d\nThe NVIDIA Spectrum-X networking platform is highly versatile and can be used in various AI applications. It uses fully standards-based Ethernet and is interoperable with Ethernet-based stacks.\nThe platform starts with Spectrum-4, the world\u2019s first 51Tb/sec Ethernet switch built specifically for AI networks. Advanced RoCE extensions work in concert across the Spectrum-4 switches, BlueField-3 DPUs and NVIDIA LinkX optics to create an end-to-end 400GbE network that is optimized for AI clouds.\nNVIDIA Spectrum-X enhances multi-tenancy with performance isolation to ensure tenants\u2019 AI workloads perform optimally and consistently. It also offers better AI performance visibility, as it can identify performance bottlenecks and it features completely automated fabric validation.\nAcceleration software driving Spectrum-X includes powerful NVIDIA SDKs such as Cumulus Linux, pure SONiC and NetQ \u2014 which together enable the networking platform\u2019s extreme performance. It also includes the NVIDIA DOCA\u2122 software framework, which is at the heart of BlueField DPUs.\nNVIDIA Spectrum-X enables unprecedented scale of 256 200Gb/s ports connected by a single switch, or 16,000 ports in a two-tier leaf-spine topology to support the growth and expansion of AI clouds while maintaining high levels of performance and minimizing network latency.\nImmediate Ecosystem Adoption\r\nCompanies offering NVIDIA Spectrum-X include Dell Technologies, Lenovo and Supermicro.\nAvailability \r\nNVIDIA Spectrum-X, Spectrum-4 switches, BlueField-3 DPUs and 400G LinkX optics are available now.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Spectrum-X at COMPUTEX.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

By using GPUs, Rolls-Royce is preparing for a quantum future despite the limitations of today\u2019s quantum computers, which only support circuits a few layers deep.\nRolls-Royce plans to use the new circuit on its journey to quantum advantage in CFD for modeling the performance of jet engine designs in simulations that use both classical and quantum computing methods.\nSuch breakthroughs are important to Rolls-Royce, a world leader in the aviation industry, in its work to build state-of-the-art jet engines that support the energy transition with more sustainable aviation.\n\u201cDesigning jet engines, which are one of the most complicated devices on earth, is expensive and computationally challenging,\u201d said Ian Buck, vice president of hyperscale and HPC at NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s quantum computing platform gives Rolls-Royce a potential path to tackle these problems head-on while accelerating its research and future development of more efficient jet engines.\u201d\n\u201cApplying both classical and quantum computing methods directly to the challenge of designing jet engines will help us accelerate our processes and perform more sophisticated calculations,\u201d said Leigh Lapworth, computational science fellow at Rolls-Royce.\nRolls-Royce and its partner, Israel-based Classiq, designed the circuit using Classiq\u2019s synthesis engine and then simulated it using NVIDIA\u00ae A100 Tensor Core GPUs. The speed and scale of the process was made possible by NVIDIA cuQuantum, a software development kit that includes optimized libraries and tools to speed up quantum computing workflows.\nNVIDIA Grace Hopper Accelerates Quantum Computing\r\nNVIDIA offers a unified computing platform for speeding breakthroughs in quantum research and development across disciplines. The NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip, which combines the groundbreaking performance of NVIDIA Hopper\u2122 architecture GPUs with the versatility of the NVIDIA Grace CPUs, is ideally designed for giant-scale quantum simulation workloads.\nAdditionally, its high-speed, low-latency NVIDIA NVLink\u00ae-C2C interconnect makes classical systems built with the superchip optimally suited to link to quantum processors, or QPUs. With a total 600GB of fast-accessible memory per node, Grace Hopper enables the quantum ecosystem to push these simulations to an even larger scale.\nA strategic bridge to the quantum future, Grace Hopper powers DGX\u2122 Quantum, the world\u2019s first GPU-accelerated quantum computing system combining quantum computing with state-of-the-art classical computing. NVIDIA also provides developers with NVIDIA CUDA\u00ae Quantum, a robust open-source programming model that links GPUs and QPUs.\nNVIDIA\u2019s Quantum Ecosystem Expands\r\nA vast array of the world\u2019s quantum computing research now runs on NVIDIA GPUs.\nThe J\u00fclich Supercomputer Centre, one of Europe\u2019s largest facilities for quantum computing, also announced at ISC plans to build a quantum computing lab with NVIDIA, highlighting the growing importance of hybrid quantum-classical computing systems. The lab will also help developers advance the field of quantum computing with tools like CUDA Quantum.\nAdditionally, ORCA Computing is the latest QPU builder to integrate CUDA Quantum, combining its photonic quantum computer with GPUs for machine learning. TensorFlow Quantum and TorchQuantum \u2014 two popular quantum machine learning frameworks \u2014 now also integrate cuQuantum. The majority of the world\u2019s quantum computing software today supports GPU acceleration with the NVIDIA quantum platform.\nLearn more about the NVIDIA quantum computing platform at ISC.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company\u2019s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling the creation of the industrial metaverse.

Availability begins May 24th with the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti (8GB), a 1080p performance champ that starts at $399. For gamers playing on previous-gen GPUs, the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture graphics card offers a substantial upgrade, enabling you to supercharge your performance in top games and creative apps.\nIn July, the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti (16GB) arrives in stores, starting at $499, featuring additional graphics memory but otherwise identical specifications. And rounding out the family is the GeForce RTX 4060, a high-performing 1080p card also available in July that starts at just $299.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll three cards get even faster when activating NVIDIA DLSS in over 300 supported games and apps, and with support for DLSS 3, performance is multiplied in an increasing number of titles thanks to rapid adoption of its incredible frame generation technology. Read on for a deep dive into the new GeForce RTX 4060 Family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture at the heart of every GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU is our best yet, delivering unprecedented leaps in power efficiency, performance, and technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, the critically acclaimed Ada architecture comes to the popular GeForce 60-class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new GeForce RTX 4060 Ti (8GB) starts at the same $399 price point as the GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER and GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, but is up to 2.6X faster thanks to the Ada architecture, NVIDIA DLSS 3, and new technologies like Shader Execution Reordering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-game, that translates to over 100 frames per second at 1080p in many of today\u2019s graphically advanced titles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn most games, both versions of the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti (8GB and 16GB) will deliver the same level of performance, because the specs are otherwise identical. There are a handful of games which play best at \u201cHigh\u201d settings presets on the RTX 4060 Ti (8GB), and \u201cUltra\u201d settings on the RTX 4060 Ti (16GB).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have more questions about the two versions of the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, we have a deep dive explaining VRAM, how memory subsystems\u2019 bus width and L2 cache are designed, and how they relate to performance. Head here to check it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the most popular competitive games, including Counter-Strike 2, Overwatch 2, and Valorant, both GeForce RTX 4060 Ti configurations deliver hundreds of frames per second. And in each title, NVIDIA Reflex reduces system latency, making your mouse clicks and other actions occur faster, giving you a competitive edge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile outpacing previous-generation GPUs, GeForce RTX 4060 Ti graphics cards use less power, and also reduce your power consumption while chatting on Discord or watching Twitch streams, all thanks to the innovations of the Ada architecture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the power efficiency of GeForce RTX 4060 Ti graphics cards for yourself in videos captured during gameplay in Dying Light 2 Stay Human, Returnal, and Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, where performance per Watt is improved over the previous-generation GeForce RTX 3060 Ti:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly also sees the launch of the GeForce RTX 4060, which starts at $299. This DLSS 3-capable card offers performance improvements of up to 2.3X over previous-gen GeForce RTX cards, enabling you to increase graphical fidelity in games without sacrificing performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GeForce RTX 4060 Family, and every other GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics card, amplifies frame rates with DLSS 3, which generates entirely new high quality frames, rather than just pixels. Through a process detailed in full in our NVIDIA DLSS 3 article, DLSS 3 combines DLSS Super Resolution technology, DLSS Frame Generation and NVIDIA Reflex to multiply performance while maintaining great responsiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers have adopted DLSS 3 seven times faster than DLSS 2, meaning more games boast support each month; next to launch with DLSS 3 are Diablo IV and The Lord of the Rings: Gollum\u2122. DLSS 3 is available or coming to over 50 games and apps, and in over 300 games and apps you can accelerate frame rates with DLSS 2 - keep informed about all the new DLSS games here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll GeForce RTX GPU owners can tap into an ecosystem of apps and technologies to further enhance gaming, work and creativity. Get the fastest ray tracing performance with GeForce RTX 40 Series and its dedicated 3rd gen Ray Tracing Cores. Make gameplay in over 70 titles more responsive with Reflex.

Today, we\u2019re launching G-SYNC Ultra Low Motion Blur 2 (ULMB 2), with over 1000 Hz of effective motion clarity for the best motion blur reduction for competitive gamers. Compared to the original, ULMB 2 delivers full refresh rate backlight strobing, nearly 2x higher brightness, and has practically zero crosstalk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nULMB 2 is available now, for free, for capable 1440p 360 Hz G-SYNC monitors through a single-click firmware updater!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltra Low Motion Blur Explained\nWhen NVIDIA launched the original ULMB technology in 2015, monitor response times (the time it takes for a pixel to transition colors) were relatively slow, causing substantial ghosting and blurry images, resulting in poor motion clarity. Motion clarity is best described as the ability to clearly see and comprehend objects in motion. Sharp edges and non-blurry details are hallmarks of good motion clarity. To improve motion clarity, ULMB enabled a technique called backlight strobing (more on that in a moment).\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo achieve backlight strobing, ULMB disables the backlight 75% of the time. This 25% duty cycle on a max 300 nit panel meant that the images would be clear, but less bright. With the original ULMB, we would need to wait longer for the pixels to transition to the right place before turning on the backlight due to the slower pixel response times in 2015. To compensate, ULMB would reduce the refresh rate to give the pixels more time to transition. Because of these drawbacks, competitive gamers often chose not to use the feature as the full refresh rate and bright image were more desirable. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter G-SYNC Ultra Low Motion Blur 2 (ULMB 2)\nULMB 2 provides full refresh rate backlight strobing and significantly brighter images, all while maintaining pristine image quality. With the panel response time improvements from our partners at AUO, ULMB 2 gives competitive gamers the motion clarity needed to perform at peak levels by keeping them in the game when moments get chaotic. \nWith ULMB 2, gamers get an effective motion clarity of over 1000 Hz with these improvements, calculated as the refresh rate of the monitor multiplied by one over the duty cycle [Effective Motion Clarity = Refresh rate * (1 / Duty Cycle)].\nFor a 360 Hz monitor with ULMB 2, the effective motion clarity is actually 1440 Hz. That means in order to obtain the same level of motion clarity without ULMB 2, gamers would need a classic panel capable of 1440 Hz. \nTo show this in action, we set up a test panel in our lab. Below is an example of a 120 Hz monitor with backlight strobing compared to a 480 Hz monitor without backlight strobing: Effective Motion Clarity = 480 Hz = 120*(1/0.25).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, they look almost identical in terms of motion clarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Does ULMB 2 Work?\nFirst, let\u2019s explain how LCD panels work. LCD panels consist of two main layers:\n\nThe liquid crystal pixels, which chemically change to adjust the color of light shining through them\nThe backlight, which produces the light that shines through the pixels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a new frame needs to be displayed on the monitor, a new color value is sent to each pixel. At this point, the pixel will start to transition to its new color over time. During this process, the backlight is on the entire time so the gamer visually sees the full transition.\nIn addition, the image is \u201cheld\u201d before and after transition which causes the human visual system to blur the two images together. The combination of the \u201cmotion hold\u201d and visible transition is what causes display-based motion blur (not to be confused with an in-game motion blur setting).\nWith ULMB 2, the backlight is only turned on when each pixel is at its correct color value. The idea is to not show the pixels transitioning, and only show them when their color is accurate.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this technique creates a challenge: backlights generally light up all pixels at the same time where pixels are changed on a rolling scanout. At any given point in time, a portion of the screen will have double images (as known as crosstalk).\nThe solution to this problem is what sets G-SYNC\u2019s ULMB 2 apart from other backlight strobing techniques: with G-SYNC, we\u2019re able to control the response time depending on where the vertical scan is, such that the pixels throughout the panel are at the right level at precisely the right time for the backlight to be flashed. We call this \u201cVertical Dependent Overdrive\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Vertical Dependent Overdrive, ULMB 2 delivers great image quality even at high refresh rates where the optimal window for backlight strobing is small.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nULMB 2 Is Available Now\nFor ULMB 2 capability, monitors must meet the following requirements:\n\nDeliver over 1000 Hz of effective motion clarity\nDrive ULMB 2 at the monitor\u2019s full refresh rate\nDeliver over 250 nits of brightness with minimal crosstalk or double images\n\nAlready, two ULMB 2 capable monitors are on the market, and another two are launching in the near future:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailable Today:\n  \nAcer Predator XB273U F - 27\u201d 1440p 360 Hz\u00a0\nASUS ROG Swift 360Hz PG27AQN - 27\u201d 1440p 360 Hz\u00a0\n \nAvailable Soon:\n  \nASUS ROG Swift Pro PG248QP - 25\u201d 1080p 540 Hz\nAOC AGON AG276QSG G-SYNC Monitor - 27\u201d 1440p 360 Hz\n \n\nSimply go to the links above to download the one-click firmware updater, to add G-SYNC ULMB 2 to a capable monitor. Please pay close attention to the directions in the update.\nHow To Enable ULMB 2\nEnabling ULMB 2 on capable 1440p 360 Hz monitors updated with the new firmware is easy:\n\nDisable NVIDIA G-SYNC Variable Refresh Rate in the NVIDIA Control Panel. This will allow the backlight to enter backlight strobing mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Enable G-SYNC ULMB 2 in your monitor\u2019s on screen display\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have done these two steps, you\u2019re ready to go!.\nFor more updates on ULMB 2, and news about the release of additional ULMB 2-capable monitors, stay tuned to GeForce.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

NVIDIA ACE for Games is a custom AI model foundry service that aims to transform games by bringing intelligence to non-playable characters (NPCs) through AI-powered natural language interactions.\n\u201cGenerative AI has the potential to revolutionize the interactivity players can have with game characters and dramatically increase immersion in games,\u201d said John Spitzer, vice president of developer and performance technology at NVIDIA. \u201cBuilding on our expertise in AI and decades of experience working with game developers, NVIDIA is spearheading the use of generative AI in games.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA ACE For Games\u2019 AI Foundation Models\nDevelopers of middleware, tools and games can use NVIDIA ACE for Games to build and deploy customized speech, conversation, and animation AI models in their software and games across the cloud and PC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimized AI foundation models include:\n\nNVIDIA NeMo, which provides foundation language models and model customization tools so developers can further tune the models for game characters. This customizable large language model (LLM) enables specific character backstories and personalities that fit a developer\u2019s game world. Developers can better align player interactions within the context of a scene through programmable rules for NPCs with NeMo Guardrails.\nNVIDIA Riva, which provides automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities to enable live speech conversation with NVIDIA NeMo.\nNVIDIA Omniverse Audio2Face, which instantly creates expressive facial animation for game characters from just an audio source. Audio2Face features Omniverse connectors for Unreal Engine 5, so developers can add facial animation directly to MetaHuman characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow NVIDIA ACE For Games Works\nTo showcase the power of NVIDIA ACE for Games, and preview how developers will build NPCs in the near future, we partnered with Convai, an NVIDIA Inception startup building a platform for creating and deploying AI characters in games and virtual worlds, to help optimize and integrate ACE modules into their platform.\nTake a first look in the NVIDIA Kairos demo:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWith NVIDIA ACE for Games, Convai\u2019s tools can achieve the latency and quality needed to make AI non-playable characters available to nearly every developer in a cost efficient way,\u201d said Purnendu Mukherjee, founder and CEO at Convai.\nThe Kairos demo leveraged NVIDIA Riva for speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities, NVIDIA NeMo to power the conversational AI, and Audio2Face for AI-powered facial animation from voice inputs. These modules were integrated seamlessly into the Convai services platform and fed into Unreal Engine 5 and MetaHuman to bring Jin to life.\nJin and his Ramen Shop scene were created by the NVIDIA Lightspeed Studios art team and rendered entirely in Unreal Engine 5, using NVIDIA RTX Direct Illumination (RTXDI) for ray traced lighting and shadows, and DLSS for the highest possible frame rates and image quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis real-time demonstration reveals what is possible using GeForce RTX graphics cards, NVIDIA RTX technologies, and NVIDIA ACE for Games. And exemplifies the possibilities for upcoming games that leverage this game-changing technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA ACE: Bringing Life To NPCs\nGame developers and startups are already using NVIDIA generative AI technologies. For instance, GSC Game World is using Audio2Face in the much-anticipated S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Heart of Chornobyl. And indie developer Fallen Leaf is using Audio2Face for character facial animation in Fort Solis, their third-person sci-fi thriller set on Mars. Additionally, Charisma.ai, a company enabling virtual characters through AI, is leveraging Audio2Face to power the animation in their conversation engine.\nIf you\u2019d like additional information about the generative AI technologies, head over to our NVIDIA Developer blog.

For gamers playing on previous-gen GPUs, the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture graphics card offers a substantial upgrade, enabling you to supercharge your performance in top games and creative apps.\nIn July, the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti (16GB) arrives in stores, starting at $499, featuring additional graphics memory but otherwise identical specifications. And rounding out the family is the GeForce RTX 4060, a high-performing 1080p card also available in July that starts at just $299.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll three cards get even faster when activating NVIDIA DLSS in over 300 supported games and apps, and with support for DLSS 3, performance is multiplied in an increasing number of titles thanks to rapid adoption of its incredible frame generation technology. Read on for a deep dive into the new GeForce RTX 4060 Family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture at the heart of every GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU is our best yet, delivering unprecedented leaps in power efficiency, performance, and technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, the critically acclaimed Ada architecture comes to the popular GeForce 60-class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new GeForce RTX 4060 Ti (8GB) starts at the same $399 price point as the GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER and GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, but is up to 2.6X faster thanks to the Ada architecture, NVIDIA DLSS 3, and new technologies like Shader Execution Reordering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-game, that translates to over 100 frames per second at 1080p in many of today\u2019s graphically advanced titles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn most games, both versions of the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti (8GB and 16GB) will deliver the same level of performance, because the specs are otherwise identical. There are a handful of games which play best at \u201cHigh\u201d settings presets on the RTX 4060 Ti (8GB), and \u201cUltra\u201d settings on the RTX 4060 Ti (16GB).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have more questions about the two versions of the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, we have a deep dive explaining VRAM, how memory subsystems\u2019 bus width and L2 cache are designed, and how they relate to performance. Head here to check it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the most popular competitive games, including Counter-Strike 2, Overwatch 2, and Valorant, both GeForce RTX 4060 Ti configurations deliver hundreds of frames per second. And in each title, NVIDIA Reflex reduces system latency, making your mouse clicks and other actions occur faster, giving you a competitive edge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile outpacing previous-generation GPUs, GeForce RTX 4060 Ti graphics cards use less power, and also reduce your power consumption while chatting on Discord or watching Twitch streams, all thanks to the innovations of the Ada architecture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the power efficiency of GeForce RTX 4060 Ti graphics cards for yourself in videos captured during gameplay in Dying Light 2 Stay Human, Returnal, and Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, where performance per Watt is improved over the previous-generation GeForce RTX 3060 Ti:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly also sees the launch of the GeForce RTX 4060, which starts at $299. This DLSS 3-capable card offers performance improvements of up to 2.3X over previous-gen GeForce RTX cards, enabling you to increase graphical fidelity in games without sacrificing performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GeForce RTX 4060 Family, and every other GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics card, amplifies frame rates with DLSS 3, which generates entirely new high quality frames, rather than just pixels. Through a process detailed in full in our NVIDIA DLSS 3 article, DLSS 3 combines DLSS Super Resolution technology, DLSS Frame Generation and NVIDIA Reflex to multiply performance while maintaining great responsiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers have adopted DLSS 3 seven times faster than DLSS 2, meaning more games boast support each month; next to launch with DLSS 3 are Diablo IV and The Lord of the Rings: Gollum\u2122. DLSS 3 is available or coming to over 50 games and apps, and in over 300 games and apps you can accelerate frame rates with DLSS 2 - keep informed about all the new DLSS games here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll GeForce RTX GPU owners can tap into an ecosystem of apps and technologies to further enhance gaming, work and creativity.

But now, decades after the events of Diablo\u00ae III: Reaper of Souls\u00ae, they are bitter enemies who have resorted to war against each other with their respective followers. The lands of Sanctuary have become plagued with ceaseless demons, and only the most steadfast of heroes will be able to hold strong in the face of darkness in Diablo\u00ae IV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiablo IV officially launches June 6th, though Digital Deluxe and Ultimate Edition buyers can begin playing up to four days early*. To give GeForce gamers the definitive PC experience, Blizzard and NVIDIA have partnered to bring our game-changing technologies to Diablo IV.\nGeForce RTX 40 Series gamers can max out frame rates with NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation, and other GeForce RTX users can accelerate performance with DLSS 2\u2019s critically acclaimed Super Resolution technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Diablo IV, DLSS 3 helps GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers multiply performance at 4K by an average of 2.5X. In our action-filled benchmark, performance on the GeForce RTX 4090 increased by 2.4X, enabling us to play at 229 frames per second with every single setting maxed out. The GeForce RTX 4080 hit 177 FPS, the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti ran Diablo IV at 139 FPS, and the GeForce RTX 4070 113 FPS.\nAt 2560x1440, DLSS 3 enables the GeForce RTX 4070 to play Diablo IV at over 170 frames per second, with frame rates hitting 335 FPS on the GeForce RTX 4090. And at 1920x1080 all GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards can play at over 200 FPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn GeForce RTX 40 Series laptops, DLSS 3 improves performance by an average of 1.8X at 2560x1440, enabling all laptop GPUs to play Diablo IV at over 80 FPS with max settings enabled. At 1080p, DLSS 3 helps all laptop GPUs to run at over 120 FPS, with the power house GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU topping 280 FPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce gamers can improve responsiveness in Diablo IV by enabling NVIDIA Reflex. NVIDIA Reflex is a must-have in games, reducing system latency so your actions occur quicker, giving you a competitive edge. Reflex is available in many single-player games and 9 out of 10 of top competitive shooters, is used by over 50 million players each month, and is activated by 90% of GeForce gamers in the 70+ supported titles.\nUsing Reflex, system latency is reduced by up to 67% in Diablo IV, helping you vanquish the forces of evil, delivering responsiveness in intense battles, helping you stay alive in Hardcore mode, and providing you the ultimate experience against human foes in PvP.\nAdditionally, we can confirm that ray tracing will come to Diablo IV at a later date, enhancing Sanctuary\u2019s detailed world, and making battles even more spectacular.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you intend to upgrade your system for Diablo IV, act fast: the Diablo IV GeForce RTX 40 Series Bundle is only available until June 13th.

Today\u2019s announcements, which include tools to develop AI on Windows PCs, frameworks to optimize and deploy AI, and driver performance and efficiency improvements, will empower developers to build the next generation of Windows apps with generative AI at their core.\n\u201cAI will be the single largest driver of innovation for Windows customers in the coming years,\u201d said Pavan Davuluri, corporate vice president of Windows silicon and system integration at Microsoft. \u201cBy working in concert with NVIDIA on hardware and software optimizations, we\u2019re equipping developers with a transformative, high-performance, easy-to-deploy experience.\u201d\nDevelop Models With Windows Subsystem for Linux\nAI development has traditionally taken place on Linux, requiring developers to either dual-boot their systems or use multiple PCs to work in their AI development OS while still accessing the breadth and depth of the Windows ecosystem.\nOver the past few years, Microsoft has been building a powerful capability to run Linux directly within the Windows OS, called Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). NVIDIA has been working closely with Microsoft to deliver GPU acceleration and support for the entire NVIDIA AI software stack inside WSL. Now developers can use Windows PC for all their local AI development needs with support for GPU-accelerated deep learning frameworks on WSL.\nWith NVIDIA RTX GPUs delivering up to 48GB of RAM in desktop workstations, developers can now work with models on Windows that were previously only available on servers. The large memory also improves the performance and quality for local fine-tuning of AI models, enabling designers to customize them to their own style or content. And because the same NVIDIA AI software stack runs on NVIDIA data center GPUs, it\u2019s easy for developers to push their models to Microsoft Azure Cloud for large training runs.\nRapidly Optimize and Deploy Models\nWith trained models in hand, developers need to optimize and deploy AI for target devices.\nMicrosoft released the Microsoft Olive toolchain for optimization and conversion of PyTorch models to ONNX, enabling developers to automatically tap into GPU hardware acceleration such as RTX Tensor Cores. Developers can optimize models via Olive and ONNX, and deploy Tensor Core-accelerated models to PC or cloud. Microsoft continues to invest in making PyTorch and related tools and frameworks work seamlessly with WSL to provide the best AI model development experience.\nImproved AI Performance, Power Efficiency\nOnce deployed, generative AI models demand incredible inference performance. RTX Tensor Cores deliver up to 1,400 Tensor TFLOPS for AI inferencing. Over the last year, NVIDIA has worked to improve DirectML performance to take full advantage of RTX hardware.\nOn May 24, we\u2019ll release our latest optimizations in Release 532.03 drivers that combine with Olive-optimized models to deliver big boosts in AI performance. Using an Olive-optimized version of the Stable Diffusion text-to-image generator with the popular Automatic1111 distribution, performance is improved over 2x with the new driver.\nStable Diffusion performance tested on GeForce RTX 4090 using Automatic1111 and Text-to-Image function.\nWith AI coming to nearly every Windows application, efficiently delivering inference performance is critical \u2014 especially for laptops. Coming soon, NVIDIA will introduce new Max-Q low-power inferencing for AI-only workloads on RTX GPUs. It optimizes Tensor Core performance while keeping power consumption of the GPU as low as possible, extending battery life and maintaining a cool, quiet system.\u00a0 The GPU can then dynamically scale up for maximum AI performance when the workload demands it.\nJoin the PC AI Revolution Now\nTop software developers \u2014 like Adobe, DxO, ON1 and Topaz \u2014 have already incorporated NVIDIA AI technology with more than 400 Windows applications and games optimized for RTX Tensor Cores.\n\u201cAI, machine learning and deep learning power all Adobe applications and drive the future of creativity. Working with NVIDIA we continuously optimize AI model performance to deliver the best possible experience for our Windows users on RTX GPUs.\u201d \u2014 Ely Greenfield, CTO of digital media at Adobe\n\u201cNVIDIA is helping to optimize our WinML model performance on RTX GPUs, which is accelerating the AI in DxO DeepPRIME, as well as providing better denoising and demosaicing, faster.\u201d \u2014 Renaud Capolunghi, senior vice president of engineering at DxO\n\u201cWorking with NVIDIA and Microsoft to accelerate our AI models running in Windows on RTX GPUs is providing a huge benefit to our audience. We\u2019re already seeing 1.5x performance gains in our suite of AI-powered photography editing software.\u201d \u2014 Dan Harlacher, vice president of products at ON1\n\u201cOur extensive work with NVIDIA has led to improvements across our suite of photo- and video-editing applications. With RTX GPUs, AI performance has improved drastically, enhancing the experience for users on Windows PCs.\u201d \u2014 Suraj Raghuraman, head of AI engine development at Topaz Labs\nNVIDIA and Microsoft are making several resources available for developers to test drive top generative AI models on Windows PCs. An Olive-optimized version of the Dolly 2.0 large language model is available on Hugging Face. And a PC-optimized version of NVIDIA NeMo large language model for conversational AI is coming soon to Hugging Face.\nDevelopers can also learn how to optimize their applications end-to-end to take full advantage of GPU-acceleration via the NVIDIA AI for accelerating applications developer site.\nThe complementary technologies behind Microsoft\u2019s Windows platform and NVIDIA\u2019s dynamic AI hardware and software stack will help developers quickly and easily develop and deploy generative AI on Windows 11.\nMicrosoft Build runs through Thursday, May 25. Tune into to learn more on shaping the future of work with AI.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AI | Pro GraphicsTags: Artificial Intelligence | GeForce | Inference | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA RTX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This delivers up to 900GB/s total bandwidth \u2014 7x higher bandwidth than the standard PCIe Gen5 lanes found in traditional accelerated systems, providing incredible compute capability to address the most demanding generative AI and HPC applications.\n\u201cGenerative AI is rapidly transforming businesses, unlocking new opportunities and accelerating discovery in healthcare, finance, business services and many more industries,\u201d said Ian Buck, vice president of accelerated computing at NVIDIA. \u201cWith Grace Hopper Superchips in full production, manufacturers worldwide will soon provide the accelerated infrastructure enterprises need to build and deploy generative AI applications that leverage their unique proprietary data.\u201d\nGlobal hyperscalers and supercomputing centers in Europe and the U.S. are among several customers that will have access to GH200-powered systems.\nHundreds of Accelerated Systems and Cloud Instances \r\nTaiwan manufacturers are among the many system manufacturers worldwide bringing to market a wide variety of systems powered by different combinations of NVIDIA accelerators and processors. These include AAEON, Advantech, Aetina, ASRock Rack, ASUS, GIGABYTE, Ingrasys, Inventec, Pegatron, QCT, Tyan, Wistron and Wiwynn \u2014 all featured in Huang\u2019s COMPUTEX keynote address today as key partners.\nAdditionally, global server manufacturers Cisco, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, Supermicro and Eviden, an Atos company, offer a broad array of NVIDIA-accelerated systems.\nCloud partners for NVIDIA H100 include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cirrascale, CoreWeave, Google Cloud, Lambda, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Paperspace and Vultr.\nNVIDIA L4 GPUs are generally available on Google Cloud.\nFull-Stack Computing Across Accelerated Systems\r\nThe coming portfolio of systems accelerated by the NVIDIA Grace, Hopper and Ada Lovelace architectures provides broad support for the NVIDIA software stack, which includes NVIDIA AI, the NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122 platform and NVIDIA RTX\u2122 technology.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise, the software layer of the NVIDIA AI platform, offers over 100 frameworks, pretrained models and development tools to streamline development and deployment of production AI, including generative AI, computer vision and speech AI.\nThe NVIDIA Omniverse development platform for building and operating metaverse applications enables individuals and teams to work across multiple software suites and collaborate in real time in a shared environment. The platform is based on the Universal Scene Description framework, an open, extensible 3D language for virtual worlds.\nThe NVIDIA RTX platform fuses ray tracing, deep learning and rasterization to fundamentally transform the creative process for content creators and developers with support for industry-leading tools and APIs. Applications built on the RTX platform bring the power of real-time photorealistic rendering and AI-enhanced graphics, video and image processing to enable millions of designers and artists to create their best work.\nAvailability\r\nSystems with GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips are expected to be available beginning later this year.\nLearn more about the latest in AI, graphics and NVIDIA-powered systems at COMPUTEX.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company\u2019s invention of the\u00a0GPU\u00a0in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling the creation of the industrial\u00a0metaverse.

Huang, who occasionally bantered with the crowd in his native Taiwanese, briefly led the audience in singing the new anthem.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now at the tipping point of a new computing era with accelerated computing and AI that\u2019s been embraced by almost every computing and cloud company in the world,\u201d he said, noting 40,000 large companies and 15,000 startups now use NVIDIA technologies with 25 million downloads of CUDA software last year alone.\n\nTop News Announcements From the Keynote\n\n\n\n\n\nGrace Hopper powers big-memory supercomputers for gen AI.\nModular reference architecture enables 100+ accelerated server variations.\nWPP, NVIDIA create digital ad content engine in Omniverse.\nSoftBank, NVIDIA build 5G, gen AI data centers in Japan.\nNetworking technology accelerates Ethernet-based AI clouds.\nNVIDIA ACE for Games breathes life into characters with gen AI.\nElectronics manufacturers worldwide embrace NVIDIA AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA New Engine for Enterprise AI\nFor enterprises that need the ultimate in AI performance, he unveiled DGX GH200, a large-memory AI supercomputer. It uses NVIDIA NVLink to combine up to 256 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips into a single data-center-sized GPU.\nThe GH200 Superchip, which Huang said is now in full production, combines an energy-efficient NVIDIA Grace CPU with a high-performance NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU in one superchip.\nThe DGX GH200 packs an exaflop of performance and 144 terabytes of shared memory, nearly 500x more than in a single NVIDIA DGX A100 320GB system. That lets developers build large language models for generative AI chatbots, complex algorithms for recommender systems, and graph neural networks used for fraud detection and data analytics.\nGoogle Cloud, Meta and Microsoft are among the first expected to gain access to the DGX GH200, which can be used as a blueprint for future hyperscale generative AI infrastructure.\nNVIDIA\u2019s DGX GH200 AI supercomputer delivers 1 exaflop of performance for generative AI.\n\u201cDGX GH200 AI supercomputers integrate NVIDIA\u2019s most advanced accelerated computing and networking technologies to expand the frontier of AI,\u201d Huang told the audience in Taipei, many of whom had lined up outside the hall for hours before the doors opened.\nNVIDIA is building its own massive AI supercomputer, NVIDIA Helios, coming online this year. It will use four DGX GH200 systems linked with NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking to supercharge data throughput for training large AI models.\nThe DGX GH200 forms the pinnacle of hundreds of systems announced at the event. Together, they\u2019re bringing generative AI and accelerated computing to millions of users.\nZooming out to the big picture, Huang announced more than 400 system configurations are coming to market powered by NVIDIA\u2019s latest Hopper, Grace, Ada Lovelace and BlueField architectures. They aim to tackle the most complex challenges in AI, data science and high performance computing.\nAcceleration in Every Size\nTo fit the needs of data centers of every size, Huang announced NVIDIA MGX, a modular reference architecture for creating accelerated servers. System makers will use it to quickly and cost-effectively build more than a hundred different server configurations to suit a wide range of AI, HPC and NVIDIA Omniverse applications.\nMGX lets manufacturers build CPU and accelerated servers using a common architecture and modular components. It supports NVIDIA\u2019s full line of GPUs, CPUs, data processing units (DPUs) and network adapters as well as x86 and Arm processors across a variety of air- and liquid-cooled chassis.\nQCT and Supermicro will be the first to market with MGX designs appearing in August. Supermicro\u2019s ARS-221GL-NR system announced at COMPUTEX will use the Grace CPU, while QCT\u2019s S74G-2U system, also announced at the event, uses Grace Hopper.\nASRock Rack, ASUS, GIGABYTE and Pegatron will also use MGX to create next-generation accelerated computers.\n5G/6G Calls for Grace Hopper\nSeparately, Huang said NVIDIA is helping shape future 5G and 6G wireless and video communications. A demo showed how AI running on Grace Hopper will transform today\u2019s 2D video calls into more lifelike 3D experiences, providing an amazing sense of presence.\nLaying the groundwork for new kinds of services, Huang announced NVIDIA is working with telecom giant SoftBank to build a distributed network of data centers in Japan. It will deliver 5G services and generative AI applications on a common cloud platform.\nThe data centers will use NVIDIA GH200 Superchips and NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs in modular MGX systems as well as NVIDIA Spectrum Ethernet switches to deliver the highly precise timing the 5G protocol requires. The platform will reduce cost by increasing spectral efficiency while reducing energy consumption.\nThe systems will help SoftBank explore 5G applications in autonomous driving, AI factories, augmented and virtual reality, computer vision and digital twins. Future uses could even include 3D video conferencing and holographic communications.\nTurbocharging Cloud Networks\nSeparately, Huang unveiled NVIDIA Spectrum-X, a networking platform purpose-built to improve the performance and efficiency of Ethernet-based AI clouds. It combines Spectrum-4 Ethernet switches with BlueField-3 DPUs and software to deliver 1.7x gains in AI performance and power efficiency over traditional Ethernet fabrics.\nNVIDIA Spectrum-X, Spectrum-4 switches and BlueField-3 DPUs are available now from system makers including Dell Technologies, Lenovo and Supermicro.\nNVIDIA Spectrum-X accelerates AI workflows that can experience performance losses on traditional Ethernet networks.\nBringing Game Characters to Life\nGenerative AI impacts how people play, too.\nHuang announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) for Games, a foundry service developers can use to build and deploy custom AI models for speech, conversation and animation. It will give non-playable characters conversational skills so they can respond to questions with lifelike personalities that evolve.\nNVIDIA ACE for Games includes AI foundation models such as NVIDIA Riva to detect and transcribe the player\u2019s speech. The text prompts NVIDIA NeMo to generate customized responses animated with NVIDIA Omniverse Audio2Face.\nNVIDIA ACE for Games provides a tool chain for bringing characters to life with generative AI.\nAccelerating Gen AI on Windows\nHuang described how NVIDIA and Microsoft are collaborating to drive innovation for Windows PCs in the generative AI era.\nNew and enhanced tools, frameworks and drivers are making it easier for PC developers to develop and deploy AI. For example, the Microsoft Olive toolchain for optimizing and deploying GPU-accelerated AI models and new graphics drivers will boost DirectML performance on Windows PCs with NVIDIA GPUs.\nThe collaboration will enhance and extend an installed base of 100 million PCs sporting RTX GPUs with Tensor Cores that boost performance of more than 400 AI-accelerated Windows apps and games.\nDigitizing the World\u2019s Largest Industries\nGenerative AI is also spawning new opportunities in the $700 billion digital advertising industry.\nFor example, WPP, the world\u2019s largest marketing services organization, is working with NVIDIA to build a first-of-its kind generative AI-enabled content engine on Omniverse Cloud.\nIn a demo, Huang showed how creative teams will connect their 3D design tools such as Adobe Substance 3D, to build digital twins of client products in NVIDIA Omniverse. Then, content from generative AI tools trained on responsibly sourced data and built with NVIDIA Picasso will let them quickly produce virtual sets. WPP clients can then use the complete scene to generate a host of ads, videos and 3D experiences for global markets and users to experience on any web device.\n\u201cToday ads are retrieved, but in the future when you engage information much of it will be generated \u2014 the computing model has changed,\u201d Huang said.\nFactories Forge an AI Future\nWith an estimated 10 million factories, the $46 trillion manufacturing sector is a rich field for industrial digitalization.\n\u201cThe world\u2019s largest industries make physical things. Building them digitally first can save billions,\u201d said Huang.\nThe keynote showed how electronics makers including Foxconn Industrial Internet, Innodisk, Pegatron, Quanta and Wistron are forging digital workflows with NVIDIA technologies to realize the vision of an entirely digital smart factory.\nThey\u2019re using Omniverse and generative AI APIs to connect their design and manufacturing tools so they can build digital twins of factories. In addition, they use NVIDIA Isaac Sim for simulating and testing robots and NVIDIA Metropolis, a vision AI framework, for automated optical inspection.\nThe latest component, NVIDIA Metropolis for Factories, can create custom quality-control systems, giving manufacturers a competitive advantage. It\u2019s helping companies develop state-of-the-art AI applications.\nAI Speeds Assembly Lines\nFor example, Pegatron \u2014 which makes 300 products worldwide, including laptops and smartphones \u2014 is creating virtual factories with Omniverse, Isaac Sim and Metropolis. That lets it try out processes in a simulated environment, saving time and cost.\nPegatron also used the NVIDIA DeepStream software development kit to develop intelligent video applications that led to a 10x improvement in throughput.\nFoxconn Industrial Internet, a service arm of the world\u2019s largest technology manufacturer, is working with NVIDIA Metropolis partners to automate significant portions of its circuit-board quality-assurance inspection points.\nCrowds lined up for the keynote hours before doors opened.\nIn a video, Huang showed how Techman Robot, a subsidiary of Quanta, tapped NVIDIA Isaac Sim to optimize inspection on the Taiwan-based giant\u2019s manufacturing lines. It\u2019s essentially using simulated robots to train robots how to make better robots.\nIn addition, Huang announced a new platform to enable the next generation of autonomous mobile robot (AMR) fleets. Isaac AMR helps simulate, deploy and manage fleets of autonomous mobile robots.\nA large partner ecosystem \u2014 including ADLINK, Aetina, Deloitte, Quantiphi and Siemens \u2014 is helping bring all these manufacturing solutions to market, Huang said.\nIt\u2019s one more example of how NVIDIA is helping companies feel the benefits of generative AI with accelerated computing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen you, so I had a lot to tell you,\u201d he said after the two-hour talk to enthusiastic applause.\nTo learn more, check out the highlights of NVIDIA\u2019s week at Computex 2023 in a four-minute video here.\u00a0 And watch the full keynote below\n\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AI | RoboticsTags: 3D | 5G | Artificial Intelligence | Cloud Services | Computex | COMPUTEX 2023 | Conversational AI | Creators | DeepStream | Digital Twin | Game Development | GeForce | GPU | Hardware | High-Performance Computing | Industrial and Manufacturing | Inference | Machine Learning | Metropolis | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA BlueField | NVIDIA DGX | NVIDIA DLSS | NVIDIA Foundation | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | NVIDIA Isaac Sim | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA RTX | NVLink | Omniverse | Ray Tracing | Smart Spaces | Supercomputing | Telecommunications \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This provides 1 exaflop of performance and 144 terabytes of shared memory \u2014 nearly 500x more memory than the previous generation NVIDIA DGX A100, which was introduced in 2020.\n\u201cGenerative AI, large language models and recommender systems are the digital engines of the modern economy,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cDGX GH200 AI supercomputers integrate NVIDIA\u2019s most advanced accelerated computing and networking technologies to expand the frontier of AI.\u201d\nNVIDIA NVLink Technology Expands AI at Scale\r\nGH200 superchips eliminate the need for a traditional CPU-to-GPU PCIe connection by combining an Arm-based NVIDIA Grace\u2122 CPU with an NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU in the same package, using NVIDIA NVLink-C2C chip interconnects. This increases the bandwidth between GPU and CPU by 7x compared with the latest PCIe technology, slashes interconnect power consumption by more than 5x, and provides a 600GB Hopper architecture GPU building block for DGX GH200 supercomputers.\nDGX GH200 is the first supercomputer to pair Grace Hopper Superchips with the NVIDIA NVLink Switch System, a new interconnect that enables all GPUs in a DGX GH200 system to work together as one. The previous-generation system only provided for eight GPUs to be combined with NVLink as one GPU without compromising performance.\nThe DGX GH200 architecture provides 48x more NVLink bandwidth than the previous generation, delivering the power of a massive AI supercomputer with the simplicity of programming a single GPU.\nA New Research Tool for AI Pioneers\r\nGoogle Cloud, Meta and Microsoft are among the first expected to gain access to the DGX GH200 to explore its capabilities for generative AI workloads. NVIDIA also intends to provide the DGX GH200 design as a blueprint to cloud service providers and other hyperscalers so they can further customize it for their infrastructure.\n\u201cBuilding advanced generative models requires innovative approaches to AI infrastructure,\u201d said Mark Lohmeyer, vice president of Compute at Google Cloud. \u201cThe new NVLink scale and shared memory of Grace Hopper Superchips address key bottlenecks in large-scale AI and we look forward to exploring its capabilities for Google Cloud and our generative AI initiatives.\u201d\n\u201cAs AI models grow larger, they need powerful infrastructure that can scale to meet increasing demands,\u201d said Alexis Bj\u00f6rlin, vice president of Infrastructure, AI Systems and Accelerated Platforms at Meta. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s Grace Hopper design looks to provide researchers with the ability to explore new approaches to solve their greatest challenges.\u201d\n\u201cTraining large AI models is traditionally a resource- and time-intensive task,\u201d said Girish Bablani, corporate vice president of Azure Infrastructure at Microsoft. \u201cThe potential for DGX GH200 to work with terabyte-sized datasets would allow developers to conduct advanced research at a larger scale and accelerated speeds.\u201d\nNew NVIDIA Helios Supercomputer to Advance Research and Development \r\nNVIDIA is building its own DGX GH200-based AI supercomputer to power the work of its researchers and development teams.\nNamed NVIDIA Helios, the supercomputer will feature four DGX GH200 systems. Each will be interconnected with NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking to supercharge data throughput for training large AI models. Helios will include 1,024 Grace Hopper Superchips and is expected to come online by the end of the year.\nFully Integrated and Purpose-Built for Giant Models\r\nDGX GH200 supercomputers include NVIDIA software to provide a turnkey, full-stack solution for the largest AI and data analytics workloads. NVIDIA Base Command\u2122 software provides AI workflow management, enterprise-grade cluster management, libraries that accelerate compute, storage and network infrastructure, and system software optimized for running AI workloads.\nAlso included is NVIDIA AI Enterprise, the software layer of the NVIDIA AI platform. It provides over 100 frameworks, pretrained models and development tools to streamline development and deployment of production AI including generative AI, computer vision, speech AI and more.\nAvailability\r\nNVIDIA DGX GH200 supercomputers are expected to be available by the end of the year.\nWatch Huang discuss NVIDIA DGX GH200 supercomputers during his keynote address at COMPUTEX.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

The large language models can be customized with lore and character backstories, and protected against counterproductive or unsafe conversations via NeMo Guardrails.\nNVIDIA Riva \u2014 for automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech to enable live speech conversation.\nNVIDIA Omniverse Audio2Face\u2122 \u2014 for instantly creating expressive facial animation of a game character to match any speech track. Audio2Face features Omniverse connectors for Unreal Engine 5, so developers can add facial animation directly to MetaHuman characters.\n\nDevelopers can integrate the entire NVIDIA ACE for Games solution or use only the components they need.\n\u2018Kairos\u2019 Offers a Peek at the Future of Games\r\nNVIDIA collaborated with Convai, an NVIDIA Inception startup, to showcase how developers will soon be able to use NVIDIA ACE for Games to build NPCs. Convai, which is focused on developing cutting-edge conversational AI for virtual game worlds, integrated ACE modules into its end-to-end real-time avatar platform.\nIn a demo, called Kairos, players interact with Jin, the purveyor of a ramen shop. Although he is an NPC, Jin replies to natural language queries realistically and consistent with the narrative backstory \u2014 all with the help of generative AI. Watch the demo, which is rendered in Unreal Engine 5 using the latest ray-tracing features and NVIDIA DLSS.\n\u201cWith NVIDIA ACE for Games, Convai\u2019s tools can achieve the latency and quality needed to make AI non-playable characters available to nearly every developer in a cost-efficient way,\u201d said Purnendu Mukherjee, founder and CEO at Convai.\nDeploy NVIDIA ACE for Gaming Models Locally or in the Cloud\r\nThe neural networks enabling NVIDIA ACE for Games are optimized for different capabilities, with various size, performance and quality trade-offs. The ACE for Games foundry service will help developers fine-tune models for their games, then deploy via NVIDIA DGX\u2122 Cloud, GeForce RTX\u2122 PCs or on premises for real-time inferencing.\nThe models are optimized for latency \u2014 a critical requirement for immersive, responsive interactions in games.\nGenerative AI to Transform the Gaming Experience\r\nGame developers and startups are already using NVIDIA generative AI technologies for their workflows.\n\nGSC Game World, one of Europe\u2019s leading game developers, is adopting Audio2Face in its upcoming game, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl.\nFallen Leaf, an indie game developer, is using Audio2Face for character facial animation in Fort Solis, a third-person sci-fi thriller that takes place on Mars.\nCharisma.ai, a company enabling virtual characters through AI, is leveraging Audio2Face to power the animation in its conversation engine.\n\nLearn more about building on NVIDIA Omniverse using NVIDIA ACE and other technology advancements at COMPUTEX.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

Well, perhaps not quite, but it\u2019s kind of fun. My views of course remain my own. I happen to own the RTX 4080 (which I\u2019ve reviewed here), but I was happy to run the Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti through the same paces.\nThere are three new cards from Nvidia and unlike the higher end cards, there are plenty of third party cards from the likes of Asus and Gigabyte at MRSP:\n\nRTX 4060 $299 / \u00a3289 (July)\nRTX 4060 Ti (8GB) $399 / \u00a3389 (out now)\nRTX 4060 Ti (16GB) $499 / \u00a3479 (July)\n\nLet me give you a TL:DR summary of the RTX 4060 Ti (8GB) version I am reviewing here. This is a great upgrade for you if:\n\nYou have an older card like a 1060 or 960 or older AMD card\nYou don\u2019t need more than 8GB VRAM\nYou don\u2019t need the extra speed/power of a more expensive card\nYou need AV1 encoding\n\nThe rather nice looking Geforce RTX 4060 Ti Founders Edition\nA week of editing\nSwapping the 4060 Ti in for my 4080, the first thing I noticed was that the 4060 Ti is much smaller. This is quite welcome, as I can barely shut the case with the 4080 in it. Plus the power usage/cost is much lower too and it means you don\u2019t need as powerful a PSU.\nThe 4060 Ti is a dual slot card, much smaller in every direction compared to the triple slot 4080\nYou can read all about the specs if you want, like the increased L2 cache or the reduced memory bus (compared to the 3060 Ti), but the only thing I\u2019m interested in is how it performs in day to day editing tasks.\nI used the 4060 Ti for a week of editing in Adobe Premiere Pro. I noticed no difference whatsoever in downgrading from the much more expensive 4080. This is to be expected \u2013 these cards are much more powerful than NLEs need in the day to day. In the last few years I\u2019ve used the 2060 Super, the 4060 Ti and the 4080 \u2013 all of them gave me the same experience in day to day editing.\nFor example, this is Premiere\u2019s usage of the 4060 Ti\u2019s decoder (NVDEC) during playback of supported H.264 (8bit 4:2:0) \u2013 it\u2019s far from using it at capacity\nThe RTX 4060 Ti is more than powerful enough for most editors. As you can see below, unless doing more intensive tasks, it has most of the performance of the much more expensive 4080. It\u2019s a great card, though if your budget is smaller, you could also consider waiting for the 4060 at $100 less or getting a 20 or 30 series card \u2013 I see that in Puget\u2019s tests the 3060 Ti outperformed the 4060 Ti in some tests. I don\u2019t recommend going back further than the 20 series because they brought a significant increase in H.264 encoding quality & since then I\u2019ve never bothered with software compression. And I do recommend sticking with Nvidia, they just work that bit better than AMD for editing tasks.\nTest 1: Decoding H.264\nThese tests are slightly different from my last review and the software versions and drivers have advanced, so I tested all three cards again. This test is decoding H.264 (8bit 4:2:0) at 1080p to DNx (could also be ProRes) \u2013 which you would do when transcoding or making proxies at the start of a project.\n\n\nSpecs: Windows 10 Pro, AMD Threadripper 3960X (24 core), 128GB RAM (CL-16 3200MHz), Multiple NVMe SSDs. Avid Media Composer v2023.03, Adobe Premiere Pro v23.4, Davinci Resolve v18.1.2, Topaz Video AI v3.2.7.\nI did the test at 1080p this time as opposed to UHD in my previous article, which is why all the scores are higher, though the patterns are the same.\nAvid continues to rock every thread of my Threadripper, whilst not using the GPU\u2019s decoder at all, which shows that an Avid transcoding machine wants a nice big HEDT processor.\nPremiere continues to not access Nvidia\u2019s hardware decoder (NVDEC) for export (it does use it for playback at least) \u2013 this has been true for many months across different versions and drivers. If you have an Intel CPU with Quick Sync you should be fine as Premiere can decode with that.\nThere are decent gains to be had in the 40 series over the 20 series, though not much between the 4060 Ti and the 4080.\nDavinci Resolve is able to make the most use of hardware & in a UHD test pulls ahead of Avid by a greater margin.\n\n\n\nThis is Premiere while playing back the H.264, but the Video Decode window is blank for export\nTest 2: Encoding H.265\nThis is the opposite test \u2013 encoding H.265 from a mezzanine codec. For example you have exported a ProRes master and need to send it for review. This test is at UHD and makes use of what I learned about presets\u00a0to get the most speed.\n\n\nAvid is terrible at encoding \u2013 it doesn\u2019t use the GPU, nor use the CPU well. Best to export same as source and then use Shutter Encoder or Resolve.\nPremiere is better, but isn\u2019t making the most of the hardware so gets no gain from the better cards.\nResolve is able to access the dual encoders in the 4070 Ti, 4080 & 4090 for remarkable speeds, you just have to be using H.265 or AV1, the \u201cFaster\u201d or \u201cVery Fast\u201d preset & be at UHD or above.\n\nChange the Preset to \u201cFaster\u201d on the Resolve Delivery page\nFor interest I did an H.265 export test for Resolve at 1080p which doesn\u2019t access the dual encoders of the 4080. It still beats the 4060 Ti, but by a lot less. The 2060 Super falls further behind though.\n\nTest 3: Decoding and Encoding H.264 to H.264\nThis test is for when you have H.264 media on your timeline and export to the same for review. Again I did this one at 1080p so all the figures are higher than last time, though Resolve pulls ahead remarkablty at this resolution.\n\n\nAvid\u2019s bad encode is more powerful than its good decode here\nPremiere falls behind Resolve by a much greater margin at 1080p compared to my previous UHD test. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s Nvidia or Adobe who need to sort this out, but I hope they do. Again, if using an Intel chip with Quick Sync, you\u2019ll probably be getting much better speeds than this.\nAside from Resolve being impressive, when doing both encoding and decoding, the more expensive cards aren\u2019t really bringing that much. Though at UHD and above the difference is greater.\n\nPremiere only uses the Nvidia encoder\n\u00a0\nDavinci Resolve uses both\nTest 4: Topaz Video AI\nStrangely, with the latest version of Topaz, the card didn\u2019t make any difference at all, though it was much faster across the board since my last test. Realistically this will probably change again with future versions and I expect if you do use Topaz a lot, a 4080 or 4090 will be great to have.\n\n\u00a0\nTest 5: Intensive or AI tasks in Davinci Resolve\nThis is the kind of work where it really pays to have a 4080 or 4090 \u2013 things like noise reduction in Resolve or even more an AI based tool like the remarkable Magic Mask.\n\u00a0\n\nOther considerations: 8K and VRAM\nA good rule of thumb for VRAM is: Resolution +2 is safe, Resolution x2 is better. So for 1080p/2K you are fine with 4GB VRAM. With UHD/4K, 6GB VRAM is usually fine and 8GB is better. If you do use 6K or 8K you might want to wait for and pay the extra $100 for the 4060 Ti (16GB) version that\u2019s coming out in July.\nConclusion\nGraphics cards get more and more powerful each year and while the gaming community seem to complain for each and every release, I think for the post production professional, you get a lot of value out of cards such as the 4060 Ti.\nHowever, if you\u2019re a colourist or do graphically intensive tasks or are a Davinci Resolve power user, you can get quite a bit more out of the more expensive cards and probably want more than the 8GB VRAM on offer here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSupport ProVideo Coalition\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShop with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilmtools\nFilmmakers go-to destination for pre-production, production & post production equipment!\nShop Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4060\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4060 Ti\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGeForce RTX\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnvidia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treview\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReviews\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nWhat Do You Think?

NVIDIA got off to a good start at the end of Q1 2024, putting up beats on revenue and earnings-per-share (EPS) expectations versus analyst estimates. However, arguably the biggest news could be found in NVIDIA\u2019s guidance for Q2 2024. The company forecasted revenue for Q2 2024 well above analyst expectations and the stock jumped heavily in value on the forecast in after-hours trading.\nNVIDIA put out its Q1 2024 earnings results on its investor relations website on May 24, 2023. According to the results, NVIDIA posted beats on both revenue and EPS. Previously, however, NVDIA had not provided guidance on its upcoming quarters or fiscal year. That changed with today\u2019s reporting, and where analysts estimated a revenue outlook for NVIDIA\u2019s Q2 2024 of around $7.2 billion USD, NVIDIA instead forecasted a revenue of $11 billion, more than 50 percent over expectations.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) stock value rose sharply following a strong outlook for revenue in Q2 2024.\n\nThis optimistic outlook had NVIDIA\u2019s stock raising sharply in after-hours trading. Where the market closed with NVIDIA shares at a value of $305.38 per share, the stock reached highs of over $390 after the news dropped.\nNVIDIA seems more than confident in the future of its technology and products despite the slowing of hardware sales following the pandemic. The company has gone whole hog on investment and development in AI technologies with this year\u2019s NVIDIA GTC presentation almost entirely focused on AI tech and partnerships.\nIt was a winning day for NVIDIA shareholders. As we watch for what comes next from the tech company, stay tuned for further updates here at Shacknews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTJ Denzer\nSenior News Editor\n\n\n\nTJ Denzer is a player and writer with a passion for games that has dominated a lifetime.

The company has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the bubbling Artificial Intelligence [AI] hype. Nvidia recently shared a better-than-anticipated quarterly sales outlook. In fact, as reported by Watcher Guru, the company is nearing a trillion-dollar valuation.On May 24, the shares of Nvidia were trading under $300. However it went on to almost claim $400 a day back. In effect, the world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker is now Wall Street\u2019s fifth largest company. It is only preceded by Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon.Nvidia, specifically, forecasted its July-quarter revenue more than 50% above Wall Street estimate, driven by the AI frenzy. The company revealed that its sales in the three months ending in July will be around $11 billion, in contrast to the average analyst estimate of $7.18 billion. In fact, the company is also boosting its supply to cater to the rising demand of its AI chips that are used to power ChatGPT and other such similar services.On one hand, NVDA investor bags have ballooned over the last couple of days. On the other, crypto investors have hardly fetched anything. Bitcoin\u2019s price has mostly been consolidating around $26k-$27k of late.NVDA Stock Price, BTC/USDT by TradingViewZooming outIt\u2019s a known fact that the crypto market is currently in the midst of winter\u2019s aftermath. Asset prices have still not been able to find their feet, leading to a short-term choppy outlook. However, per most analysts, BTC is currently trading significantly below its fair price.Drawing parallels with gold\u2019s valuation, JPMorgan strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou recently wrote in a note,\u201cWith the gold price rising above $2,000, the value of gold held for investment purposes outside central banks is currently valued at around [$3 trillion]. In turn, this implies a $45,000 price for Bitcoin under the assumption that Bitcoin equalizes gold in private investors\u2019 portfolios in risk capital or [volume]-adjusted terms.\u201dEven though the odds are currently not in Bitcoin\u2019s favor, it should be noted that when zoomed-out, the king coin is the top performing asset. In the 10-year timeframe BTC, has fetched its investors 19,968% returns. In the same time period, NVDA is up by only 11,145%. Gold, on the other hand, has merely appreciated by 34%.Last 10 YearsBitcoin $BTC: +19,968%NVIDIA $NVDA: +11,145%AMD $AMD: +2,896%Tesla $TSLA: +2,884%Apple $AAPL: +1,168%Microsoft $MSFT: +1,047%Netflix $NFLX: +1,013%Facebook $META: 908%Amazon $AMZN: +780%Google $GOOGL: +459%S&P 500 $SPY: +202%Gold $GLD: +34%US CPI: +31%\u2014 Charlie Bilello (@charliebilello) May 25, 2023Also Read: CBDC: Brazil\u2019s Central Bank Picks Visa, Microsoft & 12 Others for Pilot\nTweet\nShare\nShare\nShareFeatured ArticlesShiba InuInvest $1,000 in SHIB Now: Potential Returns if Market Cap Hits $100BStocksWhat Will Amazon Stock\u2019s Price Be 1 Year From Now?BitcoinPolicyTrump Administration Discusses Acquiring Bitcoin \u201cWe Want as Much as We Can Get\u201dGeneral CryptoCryptocurrency: 3 Tokens That May Rally Under Trump-Musk RegimeStocksApple, Nvidia, & Tesla Stocks: Best Time to Buy Is NowDisclaimer: Our articles are NOT financial advice, we are not financial advisors.

Source: Finbold\nNvidia gained roughly $200 billion during the last 90 minutes of after-hours trading due to the surge in share price. \nNvidia shares surge on Q2 2024 guidance\nNvidia\u2019s most recent share price leap, one of many this year, came after the chipmaker reported earnings for its fiscal Q1 2024, which topped analyst consensus estimates.\u00a0\nThe company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.09, compared to analysts\u2019 expectations of 92 cents.\u00a0\nRevenue came in at $7.19 billion, while analysts were looking for $6.52 billion.\u00a0\nBut most notably, Nvidia issued a much stronger-than-expected forecast for the current quarter, saying it expects sales of around $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. The figure was over 50% higher than Wall Street\u2019s projection of $7.15 billion.\u00a0\nThe huge guidance beat comes amid \u201csurging demand\u201d for Nvidia\u2019s data center products, the company\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang said. Before the after-hours stock jump, Nvidia\u2019s shares were already up 109% year-to-date, fueled by robust interest in its artificial intelligence (AI) chips.\u00a0\nAnalysts\u2019 reaction\nNvidia\u2019s sales guidance took analysts from prominent Wall Street finance firms aback, with many of them significantly raising their price targets on NVDA.\u00a0\n\u201cIn the 15+ years we have been doing this job, we have never seen a guide like the one NVDA just put up with FQ2 outlook that was by all accounts cosmological, and which annihilated expectations,\u201d said analysts at Bernstein.\nSimilarly, financial experts at Rosenblatt almost doubled the price objective on Nvidia shares to a fresh Wall Street high of $600 per share, citing an \u201cepic print and guide.\u201d\nFinally, it\u2019s worth mentioning that earlier this week, Finbold highlighted NVDA stock as one of the three chipmaker stocks to keep an eye on in the wake of recent China\u2019s crackdown on Micron, marking the latest escalation in the tech dispute between Beijing and Washington.\u00a0\nBuy stocks now with Interactive Brokers \u2013 the most advanced investment platform\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

This graphics company gets most of its revenue from selling these specialized chips, which serve many industries, including the gaming, robotics, automotive, and professional visualization industries. According to Statista, Nvidia\u2019s revenue from the sale of its GPUs amounted to $11.9 billion in 2023.Another source estimates that revenue from its graphics segment accounts for approximately 87% of the company\u2019s total revenue. However impressive these numbers may be, they are not Nvidia\u2019s only source of income.Traded as Nvidia Corporation(NVDA), this tech company also generates revenue from other endeavors, including professional visualization, data centers, and automotive solutions. More recently, it has moved to the mobile smartphone market, as it has developed technologies and products that apply to this field.\u00a0In this article, we\u2019ll discuss everything you need to know about Nvidia\u2019s business model, including how this tech giant makes money, its competition, and opportunities, among other things.\u00a0\nContents\nToggleA brief history of NvidiaWho Owns NvidiaNvidia Mission StatementHow Nvidia WorksHow Nvidia Makes MoneySelling GPUs for the Gaming MarketOEM and IPData CentersAutoProfessional VisualizationNvidia Business Model CanvasDownload FREE!Nvidia Customer SegmentsNvidia Value PropositionsNvidia ChannelsNvidia Customer RelationshipsNvidia Revenue StreamsNvidia Key ResourcesNvidia Key ActivitiesNvidia Key PartnersNvidia Cost StructureNvidia CompetitorsNvidia SWOT AnalysisNvidia StrengthsNvidia WeaknessesNvidia OpportunitiesNvidia ThreatsConclusion\nA brief history of NvidiaNvidia is an American company based in Santa Clara, California. This publicly traded company designs GPUs for the gaming and professional markets and chips for the smartphone and automotive industries.\u00a0Nvidia Corporation was founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem. Their innovative products and solutions have transformed various industries, including gaming, data center, automotive, healthcare, and more.However, Nvidia\u2019s early focus was on providing the gaming industry with advanced graphics and video solutions. The company\u2019s first product, the NV1, was a multimedia accelerator that offered superior graphics performance for personal computers (PCs) and gaming consoles. They later introduced the GeForce 256 GPU in 1999, which put Nvidia on the map as a pioneer in the graphics industry.\u00a0In the mid-2000s, Nvidia turned its attention to the lucrative field of AI and deep learning. The company developed CUDA, a parallel computing platform and programming model that enables developers to use Nvidia GPUs for general-purpose computing, including AI and machine learning tasks.\u00a0This move proved to be a pivotal moment for NVIDIA, as the demand for GPUs in data centers and cloud computing skyrocketed, propelling the company to the forefront of the AI revolution.Today, Nvidia has expanded its business model even further by entering the gaming console market with its Tegra processors. There are also companies such as Mellanox Technologies and ARM Holdings. Mellanox is a leading provider of high-performance networking solutions, while ARM is a semiconductor and software design company.Such moves have seen the company rise to a market cap valuation of approximately $673 billion at the time of writing.\u00a0Although the company started to provide solutions to the computational issues relating to games, it has since evolved to offer a wide range of tech solutions in autonomous vehicles, data centers, AI, deep learning, and professional visualization spaces.\u00a0Who Owns NvidiaNvidia is a publicly traded company, which means various institutional and individual shareholders own it. At the time of writing, CNN Business estimated that institutional ownership made up 67.17% of the total ownership, while individual ownership accounted for a mere 4.10% ownership of the Nvidia stock.\u00a0The Vanguard Group Inc, Fidelity Management and Research, BlackRock Fund Advisors, SSgA Funds Management, and T. Rowe Price Associates make up the largest institutional owners of Nvidia.\u00a0Huang Jen Hsun, who is the president and CEO of Nvidia, owns the most shares of any individual investor, with approximately 85 million shares of the common stock, which equate to a 3.45% stake. He holds the majority of his shares through indirect trusts.\u00a0Nvidia also has one of the best Employee Stock Purchase Plans, which allows their staff to buy Nvidia\u2019s shares at a discounted price. The company employs over 26,000 people globally who help them achieve their organizational goals.Nvidia Mission StatementThe Nvidia mission statement is \u201cto transform how the world experiences computing.\u201dHow Nvidia WorksNvidia is a tech company specializing in designing and manufacturing graphic processing cards (GPUs) for various applications in different sectors, including gaming and professional visualization. According to Nasdaq Insights, the company generates approximately 87% of its revenue from this segment.\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s GPUs are based on parallel processing architecture, which allows them to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, making them highly efficient for computationally-intensive tasks. Nvidia\u2019s platform also builds the most advanced chips, systems, and software for the AI factories of the future.This includes the NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC), which provides a comprehensive set of software tools, containers, and SDKs for developing and deploying AI applications in the cloud.How Nvidia Makes MoneyNvidia\u2019s primary source of revenue comes from the sale of GPUs, which generate the company about 87% of its revenue. However, this is not the only revenue stream that this tech giant boasts. Here\u2019s how Nvidia makes money.\u00a0Selling GPUs for the Gaming MarketIt\u2019s no secret that Nvidia leads the market in the best gaming GPUs. Gamers around the world rely on Nvidia GPUs to power their gaming experiences. Nvidia sells its high-end GPUs to its consumers directly, thanks to the help of retailers.OEM and IPOne of the other ways that Nvidia makes money is through licensing its intellectual property (IP) to other companies. Although this is not a mainstream revenue stream for the tech giant, it still\u00a0 represents a significant portion of the company\u2019s earnings.Remember that Nvidia is a top tech company. This means that its IP is highly sought after by companies in various industries, including gaming, data centers, automotive, and more. By licensing its IP, Nvidia generates revenue without manufacturing and selling its own products.Royalty payments and cross-licensing agreements bring the tech giant an estimated $66 million per quarter. PC and notebook OEMs such as Dell and Toshiba pay Nvidia for the company\u2019s GPUs.\u00a0\u00a0Data CentersNvidia also generates revenue through its data center business. Nvidia supplies the hardware that runs most of the major cloud providers, including Amazon, Alibaba, and Microsoft. Many large companies and organizations use Nvidia\u2019s GPUs for artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) applications.\u00a0In 2021, Nvidia\u2019s data center revenue surpassed the company\u2019s gaming revenue for the first time in its history. As AI and HPC continue to grow in demand across various industries, Nvidia\u2019s data center business will continue growing, representing a significant source of revenue for the company.AutoOne of the primary ways Nvidia makes money in the automotive industry is by providing its advanced AI and GPU technologies for autonomous vehicles.

High employee turnover can result in a loss of institutional knowledge and experience, decreased morale, and increased recruiting and training costs. This can have a significant impact on a company\u2019s bottom line, as well as its ability to innovate and grow.Nvidia OpportunitiesRise of the gaming sector: Recently, the gaming sector has experienced significant growth, and this presents a tremendous opportunity for Nvidia. One of the key factors driving the growth of the gaming industry is the increasing accessibility of gaming technology.The company\u2019s powerful graphics cards and other gaming hardware are among the best in the industry.This makes them a popular choice among gamers and esports professionals alike.

The chip giant reported non-GAAP EPS of $1.09/share above consensus expectations of $0.92/share. Revenue of $7.2 billion also came in above estimates. NVIDIA also provided a very rosy Q2 2024 outlook, with the company now expecting $11 billion in sales. That's way above analyst Q2 2024 revenue expectations of $7.2 billion. Shares of NVIDIA are up 15% on the news.\n\nNVDA shares jumped 15% on the company's Q1 2024 earnings release and rosy Q2 2024 outlook.\n\n\nHere are some highlights from the NVIDA Q1 2024 earnings release:\n\nQuarterly revenue of $7.19 billion, up 19% from previous quarter\nRecord Data Center revenue of $4.28 billion\r\n\nFirst-quarter Data Center revenue was a record $4.28 billion, up 14% from a year ago and up 18% from the previous quarter.\n\n\nSecond quarter fiscal 2024 revenue outlook of $11.00 billion\nFirst-quarter Gaming revenue was $2.24 billion, down 38% from a year ago and up 22% from the previous quarter.\nFirst-quarter Professional Vision revenue was $295 million, down 53% from a year ago and up 31% from the previous quarter.\nFirst-quarter Automotive revenue was a record $296 million, up 114% from a year ago and up 1% from the previous quarter.\n\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang added some additional commentary:\n\n\n\u201cThe computer industry is going through two simultaneous transitions \u2014 accelerated computing and generative AI,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA.\n\u201cA trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure will transition from general purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service and business process.\n\u201cOur entire data center family of products \u2014 H100, Grace CPU, Grace Hopper Superchip, NVLink, Quantum 400 InfiniBand and BlueField-3 DPU \u2014 is in production. We are significantly increasing our supply to meet surging demand for them,\u201d he said.\n\n\nOutlook\nNVIDIA\u2019s outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 is as follows:\n\nRevenue is expected to be $11.00 billion, plus or minus 2%.\nGAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 68.6% and 70.0%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.\nGAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.71 billion and $1.90 billion, respectively.\nGAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $90 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments.\nGAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 14.0%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items.\n\n\n\nNVDA) Q1 2024 revenues of $7.19 billion are still down 13% from Q1 2023, the company saw sequential growth from Q4 2023, and the Q2 2024 outlook is undeniably good news for shareholders. With Q2 2024 gross margins expected to near 70%, maybe the company could lower the prices of some of those high-end GPUs.\n\nKeep it locked on Shacknews for all the technology and gaming financial news as it breaks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsif Khan\nCEO/EIC/EIEIO\n\n\n\nAsif Khan is the CEO, EIC, and majority shareholder of\u00a0Shacknews.

Even the youngest among these companies have existed for 20 years. The point is that companies valued in the hundreds of billions and trillions take a long time to build: They, therefore, have the best chance of reaching the unthinkable $10 trillion mark first.\u00a0\nTo provide further context, no firm is currently valued at $5 trillion. Expectations are that the threshold will be reached in 2028. It seems that it could take decades for a company to reach a valuation twice that level. In truth, it could be a company that bursts onto the scene from relative obscurity. Some now-unknown AI companies could certainly fit the mold. But no one knows.\n\n\n\nMSFT\nMicrosoft\n$313.85\n\n\nGOOG GOOGL\nAlphabet\n$121.64\n\n\nAAPL\nApple\n$171.84\n\n\nMETA\nMeta Platforms\n$249.21\n\n\nNVDA\nNvidia\n$305.38\n\n\nAMZN\nAmazon\n$116.75\n\n\nTSLA\nTesla\n$182.90\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\u00a0\nSource: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is the second highest-valued equity globally, at $2.35 trillion. It was actually worth $230 billion more at the height of the pandemic tech bubble before losing ground as rate hikes did their work. It\u2019s another one of the future $10 trillion companies.\u00a0One thing that is noteworthy about Microsoft\u2019s market cap is just how rapidly it has grown of late. Just before the onset of the pandemic, the total value of all outstanding MSFT stock was approximately $1.3 trillion. So it has gained about $1 trillion in value since.\u00a0\nThat is primarily attributable to the fact that the pandemic put tech on steroids. Money was flowing into these companies at an extraordinary pace that no one could have anticipated. While the pandemic was a massive disaster, it was a boon for tech as everyone was forced inside. Companies like Microsoft were gifted accelerated sales and quantities of data that they couldn\u2019t have otherwise. That acceleration of everything explains how Microsoft has grown so quickly. And now it has AI setting it up for its next growth phase.\u00a0\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL)\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\nThe story of Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) stock and its valuation follows a very similar arc to Microsoft\u2019s. The same overarching catalysts apply to Alphabet and the benefits are similar too. Both companies have become much stronger as a result of the pandemic. It\u2019s another one of the future $10 trillion companies.\u00a0The difference is basically scale. Alphabet gained roughly $500 billion in value and is now valued near $1.6 trillion. The company has suffered in different ways over the past year. Mainly, Google has seen a massive slide as search revenues have declined on persistent economic fears. Companies are spending less on advertising.\u00a0\nYet it\u2019s very much worth noting that Google must have collected a massively higher amount of data throughout the pandemic due to the search spike. That will be a huge tailwind for a long time to come. Consider also that the company recently released its AI offerings. It is just getting started on its march to $5 trillion and AI could conceivably accelerate that goal much like the pandemic accelerated Alphabet recently.\u00a0\n\nApple (AAPL)\u00a0\nSource: askarim / Shutterstock\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to be the first stock to reach $5 trillion in value. It briefly touched the $3 trillion mark at the apex of the tech boom during the pandemic and was the first to reach that threshold.\u00a0Now it is worth around $2.75 trillion, roughly doubling since the beginning of the pandemic. Again, the same story: People stuck at home in front of screens was a shot in the arm for Apple.\u00a0\nCurrent expectations are that Apple will again double in value by 2028 when it is anticipated to cross $5 trillion. Apple reach $1 trillion in 2018 by the way. So if those predictions are accurate it will have multiplied by 10X in value over 10 years. Not too bad. Down the road, it could be one of the future $10 trillion companies.\nWe know that Apple relies on iPhone sales for the majority of its revenues. Those sales remained somewhat threatened by an economic slowdown in the short term. But Apple\u2019s long-rumored iCar, or Project Titan, could accelerate its growth beyond current expectations.\u00a0\n\nMeta Platforms (META)\u00a0\nSource: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.com\nSome of the shine may have rubbed off of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock over the pandemic, sure. The Metaverse-focused rebrand has not been a success. In fact, it seems pretty crazy in hindsight. How could a company with access to resources and some of the brightest minds there are, have missed the mark so badly?\u00a0\nI don\u2019t have the answer but I\u2019m still astounded that as inflation rapidly increased to historic levels during the summer of 2021 that the Meta rebrand plowed forward.\u00a0\nSurely the company has a team of economic advisors watching the market as it relates to its prospects. Surely, too, they could see rate hikes coming. That would have meant speculative growth businesses like the metaverse would dry up as credit tightened and speculative lending slowed. Anyway, I digress. It happened and Meta Platforms fell much faster than the other tech giants as a result.\u00a0Yet, it remains an advertising giant that reached $1 trillion in the pandemic. It can certainly rebound and become better than it ever was.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the gaming and computer graphics giant that seems to be unstoppable. NVDA stock has been going through a growth spurt since 2016 that is matched by few firms ever.\u00a0It has only had two down years during that span and has more than doubled in five of six of those positive years. During the sole year it didn\u2019t double, it appreciated by 77%.\u00a0\nNvidia has become one of the clearest companies benefiting from the emergence of AI. Now that AI has become available through OpenAI and Google there\u2019s been an upsurge in interest. The markets realize how great the opportunity is.\u00a0\nNvidia has been dominating the AI chip market for several years. So it makes sense then that investor capital is again flowing into NVDA shares. The cynic will say that Nvidia\u2019s AI opportunity simply leads to better graphics. The reality is much greater and Nvidia has pricing power on its side.\u00a0\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) remains the largest eCommerce and retail stock by a wide margin. At $1.2 trillion, it\u2019s worth more than double the next retailer, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (OTCMKTS:LVMUY).\u00a0\nIt\u2019s also the 5th most valuable company globally which is why it\u2019s likely to someday reach $10 trillion. Yet, the E-commerce world is much bigger than the U.S. market Amazon dominates with 40% of the market. Annual online sales in the U.S. are valued at $843 billion annually. In China, the world\u2019s largest eCommerce market, that number stands at $2.78 trillion annually.\u00a0\nThe greater differentiator is that in China eCommerce accounts for 52% of retail sales. In the U.S. that number is 19%. That suggests that for Amazon to continue to grow it has to increase digital penetration. That and expand internationally. There\u2019s no reason to believe it\u2019s impossible and Amazon is far more valuable than Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) which is the largest Chinese eCommerce firm.\u00a0\n\nTesla (TSLA)\nSource: Khairil Azhar Junos/Shutterstock.com\nTesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has some really amazing growth history backing its shares. Since going public in 2010 it suffered its first down year in 2022. It is up in 2023. 2020 saw its value increase by nearly 800%. In 2013 it increased by nearly 400%.\u00a0It has ballooned from $2.5 billion in value to $570 billion in that period. That\u2019s 235X growth. It\u2019ll need to roughly 20X if it\u2019s ever to reach $10 trillion.\u00a0\nCurrent estimates as to when Tesla could cross the $5 trillion mark vary wildly. One expects that could realistically happen in 2066 while Cathie Wood predicted Tesla will be there 40 years earlier, in 2026.\u00a0The truth is more likely somewhere in between. Wood is a known tech bull who has been very incorrect recently in judging the market\u2019s direction. Tesla has already eclipsed the $1 trillion mark back in 2021 when shares peaked above $400. If Tesla can ramp up volume production and gain significant market share in the near future, $2 trillion might not be that far away.\u00a0\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

While ordering to stop the salary of the executive engineer, the court remarked that the salary of the officers who do not see the pain of the poor employees should be withheld.Daily wagers of NVDA were not given the benefits of fifth and sixth pay scales despite the High Court's order. When the employees filed a contempt petition, the government did not even consider it necessary to reply to it.To this, the HC ordered NVDA vice-chairman and deputy secretary Varsha Solanki to appear in person before the court. \n\nFPJ Shorts\n\n\n\n\n\nThane Congress Warns Of Protest Over 10-Day Garbage Pile-Up; Demands Civic Action\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMumbai News: Body Of Unidentified Man Found At Marine Drive Shore; Probe Underway (Video)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u20b9122 Crore New India Co-op Bank Scam: EOW Seizes \u20b928 Crore Properties Of Bhanu Couple\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctaFX Money Laundering Case: OctaFX\u2019s Use Data Visualisation And Business Intelligence (BI) Software To Mask \u20b9800-Crore Forex Scam, ED Probe Reveals\n\n\n\n\nIt is noteworthy that Omprakash and Babusingh, class IV daily wage employees of NVDA, had filed a contempt petition against NVDA in the High Court through Advocate Manish Yadav. \n\n\n\n\nYadav said that in 2019-10, the court had ordered to give the benefit of fifth and sixth pay scales to daily wage employees of NVDA.

Photo: screengrab, YouTube, Unique Satellite TV\n\n\n\nNvidia, a California-based graphic processing unit maker, is going to build a world-class artificial intelligence research center in Taiwan to accelerate its Omniverse project, a computing platform that supports 3D applications.The announcement was made after the United States firm\u2019s share price surged 24.6% to US$380.6 in a single day on May 24. On Tuesday, the valuation of Nvidia hit $1 trillion, making it the first US chipmaker to join the trillion-dollar club.Because of this, Nvidia\u2019s founder and chief executive Jensen Huang quickly gained the nickname \u201cOne-trillion man\u201d in Taiwan, on top of his reputed status as the \u201cgodfather of AI.\u201dNvidia\u2019s shares had dropped by 50.3% to $146.14 at the end of last year from $291.11 a year earlier as the US kept tightening the export of high-end chips to China. Last August, the US government banned Nvidia from selling its A100 and H100 chips to China and Russia.The shares have rebounded by 166% so far this year as the company vowed to invest in AI technology.Nvidia will hire 1,000 people and invest up to TWD24.3 billion (US$790 million) in its new AI research center, or AI University, which will be jointly managed by the National Taiwan University. It has secured a subsidy of TWD6.7 billion from the Taiwanese government for this project.Chip war takes a tollMeanwhile, Huang told the Financial Times that further escalation of the chip war between China and the US would cause enormous damage to US companies .\u00a0He said China will make more semiconductors itself if it can\u2019t buy them from US companies. He said US lawmakers should be thoughtful while regulating or they will hurt the technology sector. \n\n\n\n\nLatest stories\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn Syria, Sunni Muslim militias are killing Alawites and Christians \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nA South Korean conservative identity crisis as political tides shift \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBlood on the trading floor in Indonesia \n\n\n \nHuang also told a global media roundtable at the Computex Taipei industry expo on Tuesday that existing chip makers should continue to work hard to stay competitive and not underrate China\u2019s ability to catch up in the industry.He said China will cultivate its own chip companies amid the US sanctions, and that is why many GPU startups have been created in the country.Currently, key Chinese GPU and AI chip makers include MetaX, Birentech, Enflame and Horizon. Many of these companies outsource their chip production to overseas foundries such as Taiwan\u2019s TSMC.Last October, media reports said Washington asked TSMC not to produce high-end chips for Birentech after the Shanghai-based firm claimed that its BR100, a 7 nanometer GPU chip, is faster than the A100 in AI processing.China\u2019s marketsIn August 2022, Nvidia\u2019s A100 and H100 chips were added to a US export control list as the government said the products could be routed to or utilized by a \u201cmilitary end use\u201d or \u201cmilitary end user\u201d in China and Russia. Nvidia was also barred from shipping its DGX, an AI server, to China if a unit contained one of the two chips.Nvidia\u2019s DGX system. Photo: NvidiaAt the same time, the US government also restricted sales of AMD\u2019s MI250 Accelerator AI chip to China.Last November, Nvidia said it would relocated its regional warehouse from Hong Kong to Taipei. It also introduced to the Chinese markets the A800, which is similar to the A100 but works at 400 gigabytes per second while the A100 operates at 600 gigabytes per second. Due to this difference, the A800 satisfies the US government\u2019s export requirements.Nvidia has a 60\u201370% share in the global GPU market while some cloud service providers, which develop application-specific integrated circuit chips, seize over 20% of the market, according to TrendForce, a Taiwan-based industry data provider.Nvidia will be able to maintain its market dominance with a strong demand of its A100 in the US and A800 in China, as well as the growing demand arising from the development of chatbots and AI computations, said TrendForce analysts. Globally, GPU chip shipments will grow 46% year-on-year in 2023, they added.Currently, Nvidia can still sell or ship high-performance computing hardware to China by obtaining a special export license. However, it remains possible that Nvidia will be banned from selling its A800 to the country one day.Anton Shilov, a columnist at Tom\u2019s Hardware, wrote in March that Nvidia will lose hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue if it cannot get licenses to sell the A800 and other products to Huawei and Inspur. He said it will not be easy for the company to replace these two Chinese customers with others. \nSign up for one of our free newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Daily Report\nStart your day right with Asia Times' top stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAT Weekly Report\nA weekly roundup of Asia Times' most-read stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHis comments came after Inspur, the world\u2019s third largest server maker, was added to the US Department of Commerce\u2019s \u201centity list\u201d in early March this year. Huawei has been on the list since 2019.Two-year preparationNvidia has spent two years preparing for the launch of its Taiwanese AI project, which will help Taiwan nurture AI talents and offer a platform for academic use, said the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The project will be implemented within the five years ending March 2027, it said.Separately, the company said Monday that it will build an AI cloud supercomputer in Israel for several hundred million dollars. The facility, supported by 800 technology startups and tens of thousands of software engineers, is expected to commence operation by the end of this year.In a two-hour speech at 2023 Computex Taipei on Monday, Huang told an audience of 3,500 people about Nvidia\u2019s AI development plan.He said Taiwanese electronic makers can use Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse, Isaac Sim and Metropolis to build virtual factories, simulate robots and conduct automated inspections, respectively. He also displayed how AI technology can be applied in online games, content generation and music production.Read: China leads US in tech that matters most: reportFollow Jeff Pao on Twitter at\u00a0@jeffpao3 \n\n\n\nSign up here to comment on Asia Times stories\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSign in with Google\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tOr\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSign in to an existing account\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for registering!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn account was already registered with this email.

These require massive datacentres full of semiconductor chips to operate.The hype was kicked off late last year after the startup OpenAI revealed ChatGPT, a chatbot capable of producing extraordinarily human-like answers to users\u2019 queries \u2013 albeit with problems around accuracy.So rapid has the development of similar technology been in recent months \u2013 including realistic pictures, audio and video \u2013 that even AI experts are unclear about the potential capabilities and dangers of the technology.Nvidia had struggled in 2022 with a slowdown in demand for its graphics chips. It also failed to buy UK-headquartered chip designer Arm from Japan\u2019s Softbank, after competition regulators blocked the deal. However, its share price easily surpassed its previous all-time high of $333.76 from late 2021 when US markets opened on Thursday. In early trading it reached $385.84 a share.Companies across the economy are racing to show how they will incorporate AI into their existing businesses. Some analysts warn that an AI tech bubble may be forming, while chip companies are also increasingly caught up in the geopolitics of the US and China amid tit-for-tat restrictions on semiconductor exports.Jensen Huang, the co-founder and chief executive of Nvidia, said this week that the US risks causing \u201cenormous damage\u201d by restricting trade. Last October, the Biden administration introduced export controls that cut China off from certain semiconductor chips made anywhere in the world with US tools. On Sunday, Beijing responded by telling operators of important infrastructure in China to stop buying products from the US chipmaker Micron Technology.Nevertheless, the rush for AI has provided a huge boost to businesses such as Nvidia which provide the hardware needed to run complex models with billions of inputs.On Wednesday, the company reported revenue of $7.2bn for the three months to the end of April, 10% above predictions from analysts. Yet it was the forecasts of huge future sales that fixated investors. Nvidia forecasted revenues of $11bn for the three months to the end of July \u2013 more than 50% higher than the $7.2bn predicted by Wall Street.Nvidia \u201cabsolutely blew away prior expectations\u201d, wrote Matt Bryson, an analyst at the investment bank Wedbush Securities, in a note to clients. \u201cOff the top of my head, I can\u2019t remember a semiconductor/hardware company as big as Nvidia (multiple billions in sales) ever surprising with a guide this much higher versus expectations in my 20 years covering technology stocks.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Register for this free strategy session today.\r\nWell-known television host Jim Cramer often sees his stock picks criticized when they\u2019re wrong.\nOne stock he has been bullish on for years had a blowout quarter and has rewarded investors who listened to Cramer after he pulled the ultimate conviction on the name.\nWhat Happened: Tech giant Nvidia Corporation NVDA reported first-quarter financial results that beat consensus estimates from analysts. The company\u2019s guidance also came in significantly ahead of estimates, leading to many price target increases from analysts.\nOne person who was not surprised by the success of Nvidia was CNBC host\u00a0Cramer.\nCramer has been outspoken on Nvidia for years often praising the company and its co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang.\n\u201cI am in awe of this man,\u201d Cramer said on CNBC Thursday. \u201cHe\u2019s so compelling, because, again he\u2019s a teacher.\u201d\n\nI didn't name my dog Nvidia for nothing\r\n\u2014 Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) May 24, 2023\n\nCramer showed off an Nvidia lanyard with a picture of his dog Nvidia Ragu Cramer, who was renamed in 2017 as the CNBC host showed the ultimate conviction in his stock pick by naming his rescue dog after the company.\nOne June 20, 2017, Cramer shared a picture of his dog Everest and said he had been given the second name \u201cNvidia.\u201d\n\nMr. Everest Nvidia meet the world! pic.twitter.com/5GvTecuNyz\r\n\u2014 Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) June 20, 2017\n\nCramer said dogs should not have only one name and should be given two names to make it more formal.\n\u201cHe has a last name and his name is Nvidia,\u201d Cramer said at the time. \u201cI think every dog deserves a last name.\u201d\nCramer recommends naming dogs after \u201ca stock that\u2019s been good to you.\u201d\nWhile he has often been bullish on Nvidia, Cramer shocked some viewers in September 2022 when he said he was concerned with the tech stock and was now short.\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about Nvidia,\u201d Cramer said at the time.\nCramer called the Ethereum Merge a negative catalyst for the company as people who mined crypto would need less graphics cards. The TV host also said the company was struggling to transition to new sectors like artificial intelligence and virtual reality.\n\u201cWe\u2019re short Nvidia. It\u2019s a loser.\u201d\nCramer is well-known for taking heat on his stock recommendations and his changing of opinion. The Inverse Cramer Tracker ETF SJIM launched this year,\u00a0offering investors a way to bet against the stock picks of Cramer.\nRelated Link: Trading Strategies For Nvidia Stock AFter Q1 Earnings\u00a0\nInvesting $1,000 in NVDA: Investors who invested in Nvidia shares after Cramer\u2019s canine announcement have been pleasantly rewarded.\nA $1,000 investment in NVDA shares at the high price on June 20, 2017, could have bought 24.73 shares, based on a split-adjusted price of $40.44.\nThe $1,000 investment would be worth $9,518.33 today based on a price of $384.89 for Nvidia shares. This represents a return of 851.8% over the last six years.\nHow does Cramer\u2019s conviction play and pick based on his dog\u2019s name compare to the overall market?\nA $1,000 investment in the SPDR S&P 500 Global ETF Trust SPY, which tracks the S&P 500 Index, would be up 69.1% over the same time period.\nIn this case, it paid to listen to Cramer and invest in Nvidia after his dog got a new name.\nRead Next: Betting Against Jim Cramer Now A Reality, What Investors Should Know About The Inverse Cramer ETF\u00a0\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\u00a0\nNVDANVIDIA Corp$119.51-1.78%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock \u2013 anytime.Reveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum85.55Growth88.64Quality97.50Value6.95Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewSPYSPDR S&P 500$567.150.77%Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Many of the trades made by Pelosi and her husband Paul Pelosi are closely monitored, as they often come with accusations of trading on insider information.\nHere\u2019s a look back on a controversial trade from 2022 and how Pelosi may have lost big.\n\nPelosi and her husband announced in a filing that they sold 25,000 shares of Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) July 26, 2022. The filing showed the couple took a loss on the trade.\nThe Pelosis sold 25,000 shares of the semiconductor stock at an average price of $165.05. The couple took a loss of $341,365 on the trade, which was valued between $1 million and $5 million.\n\n\n\nLive from D.C.'s alphabet soup, see the newest insanity.

Pelosi and her husband announced in a filing that they sold 25,000 shares of Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) July 26, 2022.\u00a0 BY CHIP SOMODEVILLA/GETTY IMAGES\nThe trade was controversial at the time, as Pelosi faced public scrutiny over exercising calls of the semiconductor company ahead of a vote on the CHIPS Act by Congress, which Pelosi publicly supported.\nThe CHIPS Act was seen as something that could directly benefit Nvidia.\nExperts also questioned the way the Pelosis disclosed the trade.\n\u201cIt is surprising to see the sale. Also, what\u2019s surprising here is that she sold and reported one day later. Usually she takes a couple of weeks. She wanted the public to know she cleared the books of this conflict of interest immediately,\u201d the founder of Congresstrading.com, who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of his site, previously told Zenger News.\n\n\n\n\nThe transaction came before Congress voted on the CHIPS Act. Nvidia shares had risen heading into the vote.\u00a0\nThe sale by the Pelosis could have been done for numerous reasons, including public pressure over a potential conflict of interest. Others questioned the timing of the sale due to semiconductor companies later facing pressure on exports to China and Russia.\nNvidia shares dropped 18% in the three months after the congresswoman sold the position, which saved a potential additional loss of $753,250 at the time.\nAdditionally, 50\u00a0options on Nvidia with a strike price of $100 and expiration of Sept. 16, 2022 were sold on Sept. 16, 2022 for a loss of $361,476 by the Pelosis.\n\n\n\n\nThe sale of Nvidia by Pelosi may have been done to help save face and give in to public pressure, it also came with a six-figure loss, something that could have been avoided if the couple still held their position today.\nNvidia reported first-quarter financial results and guidance this week that each came in significantly ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations. Many analysts said they had never seen a guidance raise that was as high as the company announced thanks to its lead in the artificial intelligence space.\nNvidia shares hit an all-time high of $394.80 on Thursday and are trading at $378.24 at the time of writing.\nBased on a price of $378.24, the 25,000 shares of Nvidia would be worth $9,456,000 today. The original sale price by the Pelosis based on the\u00a0$165.05-per-share average was $4,126,250.\n\n\n\n\nThis means Pelosi and her husband missed out on potential profits of $5,329,750.\nPelosi was one of the top 10\u00a0traders among Congress members in 2021, but saw a loss of 19.8% in 2022, according to data from UnusualWhales.\nPelosi has often been asked if her husband, who is a venture capitalist, gets any information based on her activity in Congress.\nThere have been growing calls to ban members of Congress and their spouses from trading, with many pointing to the success of the Pelosis in the market over the years. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) has introduced the PELOSI Act, also known as the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments Act.\n\n\n\n\nWhile the Pelosis sold their NVDA shares, Congresstrading shared the names of several members of Congress who bought the stock in April.Produced in association with Benzinga\nEdited by Saba Fatima and Newsdesk Manager\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the latest with Florida Man?\u201dGet news, handpicked just for you, in your box.Check out our free email newsletters \n\n\n\nWhat to read next...\n\n\n\n\n\t\tWhy Market-Driven Adoption is Crucial for Sustainable Technology\t\t\n \n\nNovember 5, 2024 - 4:53 PM \n\nZenger.news \n\n\t\tLessons from Canada\u2019s Solar Energy Failure: By Brendan Blowers As global efforts to transition to sustainable technologies ramp up, the debate over whether governments or markets should drive this change continues to intensify.

Nvidia is the powerhouse behind semiconductors that power AI programmes like ChatGPT, and saw an uptick in demand and revenues in the latest quarter.\u00a0Will the chip behemoth maintain the momentum and what\u2019s NVIDIA\u2019s 5-year stock forecast amid the AI-driven exuberance?

This key development in computational technology revolutionised the way we interact with graphics and images, from gaming and entertainment to professional design and visualisation.Over the years, Nvidia product line has grown to include not just GPUs for gaming and professional use, but also system-on-a-chip units (SoCs) for mobile computing and automotive markets. The company's latest venture, data centre GPUs, are designed to accelerate AI, data science, and high-performance computing (HPC).Today, Nvidia stands as a leading force in the technology sector, not just for its hardware but also for its software and services. Their full range of products now extends into AI computing platforms, deep learning software, autonomous driving technology, and much more. In essence, Nvidia innovations continue to redefine the boundaries of what's possible in visual and computational technology.Why is Nvidia\u2019s stock rising?The robust growth of Nvidia share value, which has soared by 188% year-to-date (as of 30 May), is largely attributed to the burgeoning interest in generative AI, sparked by the remarkable success of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The stock reached the record high of $419 on 30 May, making it the first semiconductor company to hit the $1tn market cap mark.\u00a0Nvidia recently announced the development of a new AI supercomputer platform DGX GH200, strengthening its position at the forefront of the AI revolution. This announcement came shortly after NVIDIA revealed a promising second-quarter revenue outlook of $11bn.\u00a0       COIN   181.89 Price   -3.350% 1D Chg, %    Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n                   Swap short:    Swap long:       Long position overnight fee -0.0234%   Short position overnight fee 0.0012%   Overnight fee time 21:00 (UTC)   Spread 0.21     Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n           TSLA   226.51 Price   -4.230% 1D Chg, %    Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n                   Swap short:    Swap long:       Long position overnight fee -0.0234%   Short position overnight fee 0.0012%   Overnight fee time 21:00 (UTC)   Spread 0.15     Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n           NVDA   116.54 Price   -2.040% 1D Chg, %    Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n                   Swap short:    Swap long:       Long position overnight fee -0.0234%   Short position overnight fee 0.0012%   Overnight fee time 21:00 (UTC)   Spread 0.11     Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n           PLTR   84.38 Price   -3.190% 1D Chg, %    Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n                   Swap short:    Swap long:       Long position overnight fee -0.0234%   Short position overnight fee 0.0012%   Overnight fee time 21:00 (UTC)   Spread 0.12     Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n       Meanwhile, Nvidia first-quarter results revealed revenue of $7.19bn, 19% up from the previous quarter. The Record Data Center revenue amounted to $4.28bn in the quarter. The firm\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang commented:\u201cThe computer industry is going through two simultaneous transitions \u2014 accelerated computing and generative AI. A trillion dollars of installed global data centre infrastructure will transition from general purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service and business process.\u201dThe tech giant returned $99m to shareholders in cash dividends, and will pay the next quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share on 30 June to all shareholders of record on 8 June.The primary driver of this growth is the rising demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips, specifically designed for AI applications. This escalating demand signifies the potential for Nvidia\u2019s revenue to continue its upward trajectory, and hence the developments in the AI sector will be key in determining the stock projections.\u00a0Nvidia stock forecast boosted by AI boomThe stock was rated as a \u201cModerate Buy\u201d according to MarketBeat, based on 37 analyst ratings the website compiled as of 30 May. The average Nvidia stock forecast for the next 12 months as of 30 May was $379.73, ranging from the high of $500 to the low of $133.Following the first-quarter results, 22 analysts boosted their Nvidia stock price targets, or upgraded their ratings, for the stock. This included Nvidia stock predictions from Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and Barclays.None of the analysts have provided a Nvidia stock 5-year forecast due to the high number of uncertainties. Yet it\u2019s likely that the revolution in the AI sector and its projected growth will be the key factor shaping the chip giant\u2019s future. As noted by Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, the AI demand is so high that Nvidia is having to strain to keep up. He added:\u201cThese supply constraints allied to a customer base with deep pockets and big ambitions in the AI space is likely to convey considerable pricing power on Nvidia, notwithstanding competition from rivals like Micron and Intel. Nvidia is finding a bit of an edge thanks to its ability to build world-leading AI supercomputing systems rather than just chips. It\u2019s increasingly clear that in the AI arms race Nvidia has a key part to play.\u201dYet according to Sophie Lundt-Yates, the exuberance experienced by the market players about the AI boom is not without risks, as it may distort Nvidia\u2019s long-term forecasts. She explained:\u201cNvidia is the main source of chips behind chatbots like ChatGPT and has positioned itself at the eye of the AI storm. This is proving highly lucrative, but isn\u2019t without risk. Investors are clearly very excited and much of this may be warranted, but over-excitement can lead to oversight of fundamentals becoming blurry and increasing the risk of volatility down the road.\u201dFinal thoughtsRemember that analyst views and predictions can be wrong, and it\u2019s impossible to accurately estimate the value of Nvidia stock in 5 years as there are many uncertainties at play. Always conduct your own due diligence before trading, looking at the latest technical and fundamental analysis, and never trade more money than you can afford to lose.FAQs Where will Nvidia stock be in 5 years?None of the analysts have provided a Nvidia stock 5-year forecast due to the high number of uncertainties.

However, with traditional trading you enter a contract to exchange the legal ownership of the individual shares or the commodities for money, and you own this until you sell it again.CFDs are leveraged products, which means that you only need to deposit a percentage of the full value of the CFD trade in order to open a position. But with traditional trading, you buy the assets for the full amount. In the UK, there is no stamp duty on CFD trading, but there is when you buy stocks, for example.CFDs attract overnight costs to hold the trades (unless you use 1-1 leverage), which makes them more suited to short-term trading opportunities. Stocks and commodities are more normally bought and held for longer. You might also pay a broker commission or fees when buying and selling assets direct and you\u2019d need somewhere to store them safely.\r\n \n Capital Com is an execution-only service provider.

See today's pick now.\nNvidia Corp. NVDA stock skyrocketed immediately after the company reported a first-quarter beat and forecast strong revenue growth for the second quarter.\nNvidia Price Action: The stock, which ended Wednesday's regular session down 0.49% at $305.38, took off vertically in the after-hours session. The stock went as high as $386 and last traded at $380.65, up 24.63%, according to Benzinga Pro data.\nThe $75.22 the stock gained in the after-hours session translates to a market cap of roughly $186 billion, based on the 2.47 billion shares that are outstanding.\nMarket watchers were quick to point out that the incremental valuation Nvidia added in the after-hours session was more than the valuation of either of its peers Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD and Intel Corp. INTC. The market cap of the latter two stood at $174.35 billion and $121 billion, respectively, at the close of trading.\nSee Also: How To Buy Nvidia (NVDA) Stock\n$1T In Sight: Nvidia's market cap based on its after-hours price is about $940 billion, while at the regular session's closing price, its valuation was about $755 billion.\nFor Nvidia to hit the $1 trillion market cap, the stock has to rally to $405.\u00a0\n\nSource: Chart Courtesy of Y Charts\nNvidia is currently the sixth most-valued company after Amazon, Inc. AMZN, which has a valuation of $1.198 trillion.\nSell-side is likely to go gaga over the company's quarterly results and a positive rerating from the analysts covering the stock is likely. KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh hiked the price target for the stock from $375 to $500 in one of the earliest upward revisions.\nBefore the stock took a tumble in 2022, the company had hit a market cap of over $834 billion in late 2022.\nHow Valuation Swelled Over Years: Nvidia's market cap hit $100 billion for the first time in July 2017. \n\nIt took 18 years from the company's IPO for the stock to attain the $100-billion market cap mark and 24 years from the company\u2019s\u00a0inception.\nThe company doubled the market cap to $200 billion by May 2020, in about three years\nThe $500 billion mark was hit in June 2021, in just a little over a year.\n\nIf the $1 trillion mark is hit on Thursday, the company would have yet again doubled its valuation in a year.\nRead Next: Cramer Gushes Over Nvidia\u2019s Q1 Print, CEO Jensen Huang: \u2018Loved It, Love Him And His Team\u2019AMDAdvanced Micro Devices Inc$103.96-0.60%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock \u2013 anytime.Reveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum11.93Growth82.27Quality87.35Value13.53Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewAMZNAmazon.com Inc$193.62-1.08%INTCIntel Corp$26.121.67%NVDANVIDIA Corp$117.09-2.04%Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

While chatter abounds about the significance of the NASDAQ 100 (QQQ) retaining its Golden Cross that formed on March 13 and even bouncing off the 50-day moving average in late April, this week, the market's rally has been spurred largely by smaller AI stocks.\nBoth Microsoft (MSFT), which owns a chunk of ChatGPT maker OpenAI and\u00a0Alphabet (GOOGL), which has put forth its own AI chatbot called Bard this spring, made single-digit gains so far this week. Their price performance, however, is, of course, no match for the likes of smaller stocks like Upstart (UPST), Palantir (PLTR), C3.ai (AI). Nvidia (NVDA), viewed as offering the best chips in the AI space, has seen elevated price action for months now.\nWith Morgan Stanley announcing their belief that the so-called\u00a0AI revolution will be worth $6 trillion in the future, even skeptical investors are beginning to dip their toes into the space.\u00a0\"We see AI accelerating digital transformation and tech diffusion across the economy,\" said analyst Brian Nowak. The Morgan Stanley internet analyst said advertising, public cloud, e-commerce and travel would all be greatly affected by the AI revolution this decade.\nArtificial intelligence stock performance: Upstart, C3.ai, Palantir and Nvidia\nFirst up is Upstart, the \"artificial intelligence\u00a0lending platform\" that has been hurt enormously over the past year and a half by higher interest rates. The stock fell as much as 97% from its pandemic high, but now UPST exploded by 50% in just the past four days. This was greatly helped by Thursday's 15% gain. Upstart is very much a retail trader's play, and the upside this week was helped by the fact that institutional investors have been shorting the stock into oblivion. S3 Partner's list this week of the 12 stocks with the highest Squeeze Scores \u2013 those most likely to achieve short squeezes \u2013 included Upstart.\nC3.ai stock has performed the second best of this lot thus far in the week. Its AI ticker may have helped it achieve a 38.1% gain from Monday through Thursday, but Monday's preliminary announcement on the recently finished quarter improved the market's overall outlook on the stock as well. On Monday, C3.ai management said that the quarter that just ended in April produced between\u00a0$72.1 million and $72.4 million in revenue. This was above the previous midpoint of $71 million.\nPalantir, the big data software maker used by governments and corporations alike, has long been eyed by folks in the AI space. PLTR stock jumped more than 23% this week after last week's 28% surge. On May 8, the firm backed\u00a0by Peter Thiel reported first-quarter revenue that was about 4% ahead of Wall Street consensus.\u00a0Additionally, management said it would be profitable every quarter this year. Its customer base grew 41% YoY, and many observers now think the company is poised to benefit greatly from the turn toward AI.\nLastly, we have Nvidia and its 11.8% rise this week. This week's performance is all the more impressive by the fact that NVDA stock has risen 121% year to date. With the release of 13F filings on Monday, the market discovered that family offices linked to Stanley Druckenmiller, David Tepper and Steven Cohen all started large positions or added to existing positions in Nvidia stock. Druckenmiller increased his stake in NVDA by 35% in the first quarter, adding more than 208,000 shares, which made it his second-largest holding. Tepper purchased 150,000 new shares, and\u00a0Cohen's Point72 family office bought over 980,000 shares of Nvidia stock during the first quarter. The thesis comes from Nvidia's $40,000 H100 GPU chip, which has become the primary tool for crunching the large datasets required to run AI chatbots and other products.\n\n5-minute chart for NVDA, PLTR, AI, UPST, MSFT, GOOGL\n\nShare:\n\n  Feed news\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Now things are getting more concrete. During a question-and-answer session at the Computex tradeshow in Taipei, Taiwan, Huang said he had recently received good results for an Intel test chip based on the company\u2019s next-generation process node.\n\u201cYou know that we also manufacture with Samsung, and we\u2019re open to manufacturing with Intel. [Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger] has said in the past that we\u2019re evaluating the process, and we recently received the test chip results of their next-generation process, and the results look good,\u201d Huang said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fact that they are now at the point of test chips indicates Nvidia is further along the process than expected and could be getting close to a final product. But there still are a lot of unanswered questions.\n\n\n\nHuang didn\u2019t specify which of Nvidia\u2019s architectural designs the test chips were built on, or which process node was tested. Intel is currently manufacturing chips on what it calls Intel 4 (4nm transistors), with Intel 3 (3nm transistors) due later this year. Intel 20A (2.0nm) and Intel 18A (1.8nm) are due next year.\nHuang also said that Nvidia\u2019s supply chain is designed for \u201cmaximum diversity and redundancy so that we can have resilience,\u201d and \u201cwe manufacture in as many places as we can.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the fact is, Nvidia is extremely dependent on manufacturing by TSMC, which is based in Taiwan. With the Chinese government making no secret of its ambition to take control of the island and repeated threats of war, finding a chip supplier outside of Taiwan has become a priority not only for Nvidia but also for other TSMC customers.\nEven if TSMC wasn\u2019t worried about a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan, it is still massively overstretched and at capacity. Not only that, but chip manufacturing requires an immense amount of fresh water, and Taiwan has been through a brutal drought in recent years, making manufacturing that much harder.\nSo it is as essential for TSMC to diversify as it is for its customers, for different reasons. It is building new factories in Japan and in Phoenix, Arizona, but those won\u2019t come online until late next year at the earliest. Working with Intel would give Nvidia a manufacturing partner with the capacity it needs and fabs that are not in potential war zones.\nIn the end, having Intel as its manufacturer could ensure a healthy supply chain for Nvidia and reduce its exposure to supply chain issues and problems. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRelated content\n\n \n\n\nNews\n\nTop network and data center events 2025\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Denise Dubie \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n4 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCloud Computing\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Center\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetwork Security\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\n\nEnterprises reevaluate virtualization strategies amid Broadcom uncertainty\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Neal Weinberg \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n11 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetwork Management Software\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetworking Devices\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVirtualization\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\n\n5 alternatives to VMware vSphere virtualization platform\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Neal Weinberg \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n4 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetworking Devices\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tServer Virtualization\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVirtualization\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nVergeIO enhances VergeFabric network virtualization offering\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Sean Michael Kerner \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 13, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n5 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Center\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSDN\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVirtualization\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Sections\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPODCASTS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVIDEOS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRESOURCES\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEVENTS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpotlight: Managing modern risks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom our editors straight to your inbox\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tGet started by entering your email address below.\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email address\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                        by                                                             \n                                                                Andy Patrizio                                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Andy Patrizio on X\n\n\nFollow Andy Patrizio on LinkedIn\n \n\n\n\nAndy Patrizio is a freelance journalist based in southern California who has covered the computer industry for 20 years and has built every x86 PC he\u2019s ever owned, laptops not included.\nThe opinions expressed in this blog are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of ITworld, Network World, its parent, subsidiary or affiliated companies.\n\n\n\n\nMore from this author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnewsIntel taps semiconductor veteran Lip-Bu Tan as new CEO Mar 12, 2025 4 minsnewsAltera targets low-latency AI edge applications with new FPGA products Mar 11, 2025 3 minsnewsLenovo introduces compact, liquid-cooled AI edge server Mar 07, 2025 3 minsfeatureSeven important trends in the server sphere Mar 06, 2025 4 minsfeatureData center vacancies hit historic lows despite record construction Mar 06, 2025 4 minsnewsAI driving a 165% rise in data center power demand by 2030 Mar 05, 2025 3 minsnewsTariffs for now won\u2019t impact IT organizations Mar 04, 2025 3 minsnewsLenovo renews ThinkSystem lineup for AI workloads and more Feb 26, 2025 2 mins \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow me morePopularArticlesPodcastsVideos\n\n\nopinion  Jio teams with AMD, Cisco and Nokia to build AI-enabled telecom platform  By Zeus Kerravala\nMar 18, 20254 mins\nNetworkingTelecommunications\n\n\n\n\nnews  2025 network outage report and internet health check By Ann Bednarz\nMar 18, 202528 mins\nInternet Service ProvidersNetwork Management SoftwareNetworking\n\n\n\n\nnews  Cloudflare unveils network-powered posture management By Sean Michael Kerner\nMar 18, 20255 mins\nCloud ComputingNetwork Security\n\n\n\n\npodcast  Has the hype around \u2018Internet of Things\u2019 paid off?

[+] Santa Clara, California, August 17, 2017. (Photo via Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images).Getty Images\nNvidia\nNVDA\n traded to its all-time intraday high of $346.47 on November 22, 2021. From this high the stock experienced a 68.7% bear market decline to a low of $108.13 set on October 13, 2022. NVDA is just 10% below its all-time high.\n\n\nNvidia designs graphics processing systems for gaming, automobiles, architecture, engineering, and construction for data centers and software applications. NVDA is one of the most popular momentum stocks among traders and investors.\n\nThe stock has an elevated p/e ratio of 125.56% and offers a dividend yield of just 0.05%. Nvidia beat its earnings-per-share estimate on February 22, 2023, missed estimates in November and August 2022 after beating estimates in 14 consecutive quarters between February 14, 2019 and May 25, 2022.\n\n\nThe Daily Chart for Nvidia\nDaily Chart for NVIDIACourtesy of Refinitiv Xenith.\n\nThe daily chart for Nvidia clearly shows the 68.7% bear market for the stock from $346.47 set on November 22, 2021, down to $108.13 tested on October 13, 2022. The downside accelerated on April 20, 2022 when a death cross formed. This sell signal occurred when the 50-day simple moving average fell below the 200-day simple moving average.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nThe 2023 bull market for NVDA was confirmed on January 25, 2023 after the formation of a golden cross with the stock trading at $193.23 versus its annual pivot at $193.31. In a golden cross buy signal, the 50-day simple moving average rises above the 200-day simple moving average.\n\nThe horizontal lines on the chart from bottom to top are now the annual value level at $193.31, the monthly pivot at $256.17, the semiannual pivot at $296.26, and the quarterly pivot at $299.59. If there is a negative reaction to earnings, the downside is to $299.59 to $296.26.\n\n\nThe Weekly Chart for NvidiaWeekly Chart for NVIDIACourtesy of Refinitiv Xenith.\nThe weekly chart for Nvidia is extremely overbought with the stock above its five-week modified moving average at $284.20. The stock is well above its 200-week simple moving average or \u2018reversion to the mean\u2019 at $156.10.\nThe 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading is at 92.77 which is well above the 90.00 level. This is a reason to reduce holdings pre-earnings. Keep in mind that the stochastic reading scales between 00.00 and 100.00 with readings below 20.00 oversold and above 80.00 overbought. A reading above 90.00 is a signal to reduce holdings.\nTrading Strategy: Reduce holdings with the stock above $299.59 and $296.26, or on strength to the all-time high of $346.47.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

It's safe to assume that management's super-rosy outlook is the biggest catalyst for the tech stock's huge rise.\n\nNvidia's key numbers\n\n\n\nMetric\nFiscal Q1 2023\nFiscal Q1 2024\nChange\u00a0\n\n\nRevenue\n$8.29 billion\u00a0\n$7.19 billion\n(13%)\n\n\nGAAP operating income\n$1.87 billion\n$2.14 billion\n15%\n\n\nGAAP net income\n$1.62 billion\n$2.04 billion\n26%\n\n\nAdjusted net income\n$3.44 billion\n$2.71 billion\n(21%)\n\n\nGAAP earnings per share (EPS)\n$0.64\n$0.82\n28%\n\n\nAdjusted EPS\n$1.36\n$1.09\n(20%)\n\n\n\nData source: Nvidia. GAAP = generally accepted accounting principles. Fiscal Q3 2023 ended on Oct. 30, 2022.\nInvestors should focus on the adjusted numbers, as they exclude one-time items.\nWall Street was looking for adjusted EPS of $0.92 on revenue of $6.52 billion, so Nvidia raced by both expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform performance\n\n\n\nPlatform\nFiscal Q1 2024 Revenue\nChange YOY\nChange QOQ\n\n\n\n\nData center\n$4.28 billion\n14%\n18%\n\n\nGaming\n$2.24 billion\n(38%)\n22%\n\n\nProfessional visualization\n$295 million\n(53%)\n31%\n\n\nAutomotive\n$296 million\n114%\n1%\n\n\nOEM and other\n$77 million\n(51%)\n(8%)\n\n\nTotal\n$7.19 billion\n(13%)\n19%\n\n\n\nData source: Nvidia. OEM = original equipment manufacturers; OEM and other is not a target market platform. YOY = year over year. QOQ = quarter over quarter.\nThe data center platform's revenue was a record high. In her commentary, CFO Colette Kress said this platform's solid year-over-year and sequential growth was led by \"growing demand for generative AI [artificial intelligence] and large language models using GPUs [graphics processing units] based on our Nvidia Hopper and Ampere architectures.\" Demand for data center products was strong among large consumer internet companies, cloud service providers, and enterprise customers.\n\"Generative AI enables users to quickly generate new content based on a variety of inputs. Inputs and outputs to these models can include text, images, sounds, animation, 3D models, or other types of data,\" according to Nvidia.\u00a0\u00a0\nKress attributed the gaming platform's continued year-over-year decline to the challenging macroeconomic environment and lower shipments into its sales channel. On the positive side, gaming revenue jumped 22% from the prior quarter, driven by the company's ramp of its new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs for desktops and laptops based on its Ada Lovelace architecture.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the CEO had to say\nIn the earnings release, CEO Jensen Huang commented on the \"surging demand\" for the company's products that enable entities to incorporate generative AI into their products and services and internal processes:\u00a0\n\nA trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure will transition from general purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process. Our entire data center family of products -- H100, Grace CPU, Grace Hopper Superchip, NVLink, Quantum 400 InfiniBand, and BlueField-3 DPU -- is in production. We are significantly increasing our supply to meet surging demand for them.\n\nPowerful second-quarter guidance\u00a0\nFor the fiscal second quarter, management expects revenue of $11 billion, which equates to growth of 64% year over year. It also guided (albeit indirectly, by providing a bunch of inputs) for adjusted EPS of $1.97, a surge of 286%.\u00a0 \nGoing into the report, Wall Street had been modeling for Q2 adjusted EPS of $1.06 on revenue of $7.15 billion, so the company's outlook absolutely crushed both estimates.\nPoised for an amazing year\nNvidia's fiscal Q1 results were very good, given the challenging macro environment. The best thing about this quarterly report is the amazingly powerful Q2 guidance, which leaves Wall Street's analysts looking like a bunch of amateurs.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia already had many long-term avenues for growth (such as cloud computing, non-generative AI, gaming, autonomous vehicles, and the metaverse) before generative AI arrived recently on the scene. Generative AI should significantly rev up Nvidia's long-term growth potential.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBeth McKenna has positions in Nvidia. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Nvidia.

That's where you'll also see Nvidia over the coming years.\n\nArtificial intelligence could be the most significant technological leap forward since the internet more than 20 years ago. But for many, it's still an ambiguous term lacking real-world specifics.\nAt the same time, semiconductor company Nvidia (NVDA -2.53%) has become one of the hottest AI stocks, nearly doubling in price since January as AI picks up momentum in the market.\nWhy? Nvidia is the world's leading company in discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) -- chips specializing in heavy computing workloads. AI requires immense computing power to process billions of data points, making the two a natural fit.\n\nWhat does AI mean for the world around us? Here are five industries that could impact everyday human life and drive demand for Nvidia's products for years to come.\n#1: Automotive\nNvidia's DRIVE platform offers hardware and software development tools for automotive companies to develop self-driving technology. The company's business pipeline is worth $14 billion, spanning six years, and features some of the industry's most prominent brands like Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, and Jaguar. It also has growth exposure from emerging upstarts like Nio, Xpeng, Lucid, and Cruise.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Mordor Intelligence, the autonomous car market could grow by an average of 22% annually through 2027, hitting roughly $80 billion. That number could grow much larger in the years beyond if self-driving technology becomes a staple in transportation.\n#2: Healthcare\nScientists have only begun to make real inroads into genetic data in recent decades. Human DNA is like a roadmap of how life is built, and understanding it could help treat and cure the world's diseases. But DNA is amazingly complex; take the DNA in one human cell and lay it out, and it'll stretch two miles. Lay out all of the DNA in one person and it would stretch across the solar system twice over.\nYou can think of DNA as data, which positions Nvidia to play a big role in crunching DNA information to aid drug discovery, genomic mapping, and more. The company has created Nvidia Clara, a computing platform tailored to the healthcare sector to capture this opportunity.\n#3: Services\nThe old Hollywood stereotype of machines taking over has a kernel of truth in the corporate world. Companies, especially in service industries like fast food, are starting to implement AI to reduce their need for human labor and cut costs. For example, McDonald's recently experimented with a fully automated restaurant in Texas. Additionally, Wendy's recently began implementing ChatGPT-powered screens to take drive-through orders.\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology like this runs on cloud platforms that Nvidia is partnered with, such as Alphabet's Google Cloud and Microsoft's Azure. IBM's CEO recently discussed his belief that AI would replace thousands of jobs inside the company. This trend could continue growing as AI becomes increasingly advanced, and it's something investors should keep an eye on.\n#4: Generative AI\nLanguage models like ChatGPT have made the most immediate impact on technology. AI technology like this can generate responses for queries in a conversation-like manner, as well as create images based on user input. You're already seeing this with Microsoft's revival of the Bing search engine. You could soon see more generative AI integrated into Google search as Alphabet protects its golden goose, its search engine business.\nThere's a good chance you'll see generative AI work into many existing products and services. Learning company Chegg is introducing CheggMate, an AI tool to complement its current service. And companies like Adobe can utilize AI as part of their creative tools to help users generate content.\n#5: Data centers\nAI requires vast computing power, which will likely consolidate in data centers. Nvidia has a platform that it can rent to enterprises that will pay for a portion of its computing power. One could imagine it as computing-as-a-service. Additionally, deep-pocketed companies are using Nvidia's chips to build their own computing resources, including OpenAI (the creator of ChatGPT), which has trained its products on Nvidia GPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's market leadership makes it a likely choice for companies building these supercomputers, which will continually demand newer and better chips as AI advances and demands more computing power.\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. Justin Pope has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Adobe, Alphabet, Microsoft, Nio, and Nvidia. The Motley Fool recommends Chegg and recommends the following options: long January 2024 $420 calls on Adobe and short January 2024 $430 calls on Adobe.

As of 10:30 a.m. ET, the stock was still up 25.2%.\nThe catalyst that sent the semiconductor giant higher was earnings results that were far better than expected and a forecast for a record-breaking quarter on the horizon.\n\nSo what\nFor its fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended April 30), Nvidia generated revenue of $7.2 billion, down 13% year over year. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.09, which declined 20%.\u00a0\nWhile this might not seem like cause for celebration, the numbers soared past even Wall Street's most bullish projections. Analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $6.5 billion and EPS of $0.92, so Nvidia left those expectations in the dust.\nThe results were driven by surging demand for the processors that power artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Nvidia's data center revenue (which includes AI chips), climbed 14% year over year to a new record, while increasing 18% since last quarter. The recovery of the gaming segment also gained ground and while revenue was down 38% year over year, it was up 22% sequentially.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow what\nPerhaps the biggest boost to the stock price this morning came from Nvidia's blockbuster forecast. For the fiscal second quarter, management is calling for revenue of $11 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 33% and Nvidia's best quarter ever. Not only would the results surpass Nvidia's best-ever quarter by 33%, but they would also beat Wall Street's consensus forecast for the quarter by 51%.\u00a0\nEagle-eyed investors will note that Nvidia's already lofty valuation has gone through the roof with this morning's stock price move. The stock is currently selling for 36 times trailing-12-month sales, and an only slightly more palatable 25 times forward sales, when a reasonable price-to-sales ratio is between 1 and 2.\nThere's no doubt the stock is currently pricey, but Nvidia is chasing a vast opportunity, and AI is just getting started. That said, investors might want to look at better value points at which to buy or hold -- or both -- for at least five years.\n\n\n\nDanny Vena has positions in Nvidia.

It includes a complete blueprint to help enterprises use their proprietary data and more easily deploy generative AI responsibly and accurately.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cProject Helix gives enterprises purpose-built AI models to more quickly and securely gain value from the immense amounts of data underused today,\u201d said Jeff Clarke, vice chairman and co-chief operating officer, Dell Technologies. \u201cWith highly scalable and efficient infrastructure, enterprises can create a new wave of generative AI solutions that can reinvent their industries.\u201d\n\u201cWe are at a historic moment, when incredible advances in generative AI are intersecting with enterprise demand to do more with less,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO, NVIDIA. \u201cWith Dell Technologies, we\u2019ve designed extremely scalable, highly efficient infrastructure that enables enterprises to transform their business by securely using their own data to build and operate generative AI applications.\u201d\nProject Helix simplifies enterprise generative AI deployments with a tested combination of optimized hardware and software, all available from Dell. This delivers the power to convert enterprise data into smarter, higher value outcomes, while maintaining data privacy. These solutions will help companies quickly deploy customized AI applications that drive trusted decisions from their own data to grow and scale their businesses.\nBlueprint for On-Premises Generative AI\u00a0\nProject Helix will support the complete generative AI lifecycle \u2013 from infrastructure provisioning, modeling, training, fine-tuning, application development and deployment, to deploying inference and streamlining results. The validated designs help enterprises quickly build on-premises generative AI infrastructure at scale.\nDell PowerEdge servers, such as the PowerEdge XE9680 and PowerEdge R760xa, are optimized to deliver performance for generative AI training and AI inferencing. The combination of Dell servers with NVIDIA\u00ae H100 Tensor Core GPUs and NVIDIA Networking form the infrastructure backbone for these workloads. Customers can pair this infrastructure with resilient and scalable unstructured data storage, including Dell PowerScale and Dell ECS Enterprise Object Storage.\u00a0\nWith all Dell Validated Designs, customers can use the enterprise features of Dell server and storage software, with observability through Dell CloudIQ software. Project Helix also includes NVIDIA AI Enterprise software to provide tools for customers as they move through the AI lifecycle. NVIDIA AI Enterprise includes more than 100 frameworks, pretrained models and development tools such as the NVIDIA NeMo\u2122 large language model framework and NeMo Guardrails software for building topical, safe and secure generative AI chatbots.\nProject Helix includes security and privacy built into foundational components, such as Secured Component Verification. Protecting data on-premises reduces inherent risk and helps companies meet regulatory requirements.\u00a0\n\u201cCompanies are eager to explore the opportunities that generative AI tools enable for their organizations, but many aren\u2019t sure how to get started,\u201d said Bob O\u2019Donnell, president and chief analyst, TECHnalysis Research. \u201cBy putting together a complete hardware and software solution from trusted brands, Dell Technologies and NVIDIA are offering enterprises a head start to building and refining AI-powered models that can leverage\u00a0their own company\u2019s unique assets and create powerful, customized tools.\u201d\nAvailability\nDell Validated Designs based on the Project Helix initiative will be available through traditional channels and APEX flexible consumption options, beginning in July 2023.\u00a0\nAdditional Resources\nLearn more about AI at Dell Technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Dell Technologies\u202f\r\nDell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) helps organizations and individuals build their digital future and transform how they work, live and play.

Nvidia is the world's largest producer of discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) for video games, graphical applications, and artificial intelligence (AI) tasks. ASML is the top producer of lithography systems used to etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers and the only supplier of top-tier extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems required to produce the world's smallest and densest chips.\nNvidia is a fabless chipmaker, outsourcing its production to third-party contract chipmakers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u00a0(TSM -1.19%) (TSMC) and Samsung. Those leading foundries use ASML's lithography systems to manufacture their chips, so we can safely say that Nvidia and other fabless chipmakers couldn't survive without the company.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nI compared these two companies last April and concluded that ASML's broader diversification, unrivaled pricing power, and long-term growth potential made it a better buy than Nvidia. But since I made that call, ASML's stock only advanced about 20% as Nvidia's nearly doubled. Let's see why Nvidia outperformed ASML by such a wide margin -- and whether it will remain the better play in the semiconductor sector for the foreseeable future.\nNvidia's cyclical downturn might have already ended\nNvidia's revenue soared 53% in fiscal 2021\u00a0(which ended in Jan. 2021) and grew 61% in fiscal 2022. Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) surged 73% in fiscal 2021 and climbed another 78% in fiscal 2022.\nThree catalysts drove that massive growth spurt. First, the pandemic sparked a buying frenzy for new PCs for online classes, remote work, and high-end gaming. Second, the soaring usage of cloud-based services prompted many data centers to upgrade their servers and install more high-end GPUs to process AI tasks. Lastly, its acquisition of the data center networking\u00a0company Mellanox in April 2020 inorganically boosted its sales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in fiscal 2023, Nvidia's revenue stayed nearly flat as its adjusted EPS dropped 25%. That slowdown was largely caused by declining sales of new PCs in a post-pandemic market, macro headwinds for data centers, and declining cryptocurrency prices, prompting many miners to flood the secondhand market with used GPUs. U.S. regulators also abruptly barred Nvidia from selling its top-tier data center GPUs to Chinese customers.\nFaced with those challenges, many analysts expected Nvidia to suffer a long and painful cyclical slowdown. But after enduring three consecutive quarters of year-over-year revenue declines, Nvidia expects its revenue to surge 64%\u00a0year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 -- blowing past the consensus forecast for 6% growth -- as the expansion of the red-hot generative AI market sparks a buying frenzy in its high-end data center GPUs. It also expects its gaming business to recover.\nAfter hastily revising their forecasts, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and adjusted EPS to rise 48% and 115%,\u00a0respectively, this year. Nvidia's stock isn't cheap at 84 times forward earnings, but it might deserve that premium valuation.\nASML continues to generate stable double-digit growth\nASML's revenues and profits ebb and flow with the broader semiconductor sector. In 2020, its revenue and EPS grew 18% and 38%,\u00a0respectively, as the global chip shortage drove foundries to rapidly expand their manufacturing capabilities. In 2021, its revenue and earnings surged 33% and 69%, respectively, as TSMC, Samsung, and Intel (INTC 1.25%) installed more EUV systems to gain an edge in the ongoing \"process race\" to produce smaller, denser chips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, that acceleration abruptly ended in 2022 as sales of new PCs declined, the smartphone market stalled out after the 5G upgrade cycle, and macro headwinds forced the top foundries to rein in their ambitious expansion plans. New restrictions on sales of lithography systems to Chinese chipmakers further throttled ASML's sales.\nAs a result, its revenue only rose 14% in 2022 as its EPS dipped 2%. But like Nvidia, ASML expects its cyclical slowdown\u00a0to be brief. It expects its revenue to rise at least 25% with expanding margins this year as TSMC, Samsung, and Intel all ramp up their purchases of new EUV systems in preparation for the semiconductor sector's recovery.\nASML also reiterated its long-term target of generating 44 billion euros ($47.2 billion) to 60 billion euros ($64.4 billion) in revenues in 2030. The midpoint of that forecast implies its revenue will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% from 2022 to 2030. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow 26% and 34%, respectively, this year. Those are rock-solid growth rates for a stock trading at 29 times forward earnings.\nThe winner: ASML\nNvidia and ASML are both solid long-term plays in the semiconductor market. However, ASML's\u00a0monopolization of the high-end lithography market, stable growth rates, and lower valuation still make it a more attractive investment than Nvidia.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's stock isn't irrationally valued relative to its growth yet, but its valuations seem to have been inflated by the market hype regarding generative AI technologies. Therefore, investors can consider buying ASML's stock now -- but they might want to wait for Nvidia's valuations to cool off a bit before jumping in.\n\n\n\nLeo Sun has positions in ASML.

We\u2019re also deep diving on new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.\nNew 14-inch NVIDIA Studio laptops, equipped with GeForce RTX 40 Series Laptop GPUs, give creators peak portability with a significant increase in performance over the last generation. AI-dedicated hardware called Tensor Cores power time-saving tasks in popular apps like Davinci Resolve. Ray Tracing Cores together with our neural rendering technology, DLSS 3, boost performance in real-time 3D rendering applications like D5 Render and NVIDIA Omniverse.\nNVIDIA also introduced a new method for accelerating video encoding. Simultaneous Scene Encoding sends independent groups of frames, or scenes, to each NVIDIA Encoder (NVENC). With multiple NVENCs fully utilized, video export times can be reduced significantly, without affecting image quality. The first software to integrate the technology is the popular video editing app CapCut.\nThe May Studio Driver is ready for download now. This month\u2019s release includes support for updates to MAGIX VEGAS Pro, D5 Render and VLC Media Player \u2014 in addition to CapCut \u2014 plus AI model optimizations for popular apps.\nCOMPUTEX, Asia\u2019s biggest annual tech trade show, kicks off a flurry of updates, bringing creators new tools and performance from the NVIDIA Studio platform \u2014 and plenty of AI power.\nDuring his keynote address at COMPUTEX, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang introduced a new generative AI to support game development, NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) for Games. The platform adds intelligence to non-playable characters (NPCs) in gaming, with AI-powered natural language interactions.\n\nThe Kairos demo \u2014 a joint venture with Convai led by NVIDIA Creative Director Gabriele Leone \u2014 demonstrates how a single model can transform into a living, breathing, lifelike character this week In the NVIDIA Studio.\nUltraportable, Ultimate Performance\nNVIDIA Studio laptops, powered by the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture, are the world\u2019s fastest laptops for creating and gaming.\nFor the first time, GeForce RTX performance comes to 14-inch devices. In the process, it\u2019s transforming the ultraportable market, delivering the ultimate combination of performance and portability.\nASUS Zenbook Pro 14 comes with up to a GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU.\nThese purpose-built creative powerhouses do it all. Backed by NVIDIA Studio, the platform supercharges over 110 creative apps, provides lasting stability with NVIDIA Studio Drivers and includes a powerful suite of AI-powered Studio software, such as NVIDIA Omniverse, Canvas and Broadcast.\nFifth-generation Max-Q technologies bring an advanced suite of AI-powered technologies that optimize laptop performance, power and acoustics for peak efficiency. Battery life improves by up to 70%. And DLSS is now optimized for laptops, giving creators incredible 3D rendering performance with DLSS 3 optical multi-frame generation and super resolution in Omniverse and D5 Render, and in hit games like Cyberpunk 2077.\nAs the ultraportable market heats up, PC laptop makers are giving creators more options than ever. Recently announced models, with more on the way, include the Acer Swift X 14, ASUS Zenbook Pro 14, GIGABYTE Aero 14, Lenovo\u2019s Slim Pro 9i 14 and MSI Stealth 14.\nVisit the Studio Shop for the latest GeForce RTX-powered NVIDIA Studio systems and explore the range of high-performance Studio products.\nSimultaneous Scene Encoding\nThe recent release of Video Codec SDK 12.1 added support for multi-encoder support, which can cut export times in half. Our previously announced split encoding method \u2014 which splits a frame and sends each section to an encoder \u2014 now has an API that app developers can expose to their end users. Previously, split encoding would be engaged automatically for 4K or higher video and the faster export presets. With this update, developers can simply allow users to toggle on this option.\nVideo Codec SDK 12.1 also introduces a new encoding method: simultaneous scene encoding. Video apps can split groups of pictures or scenes as they\u2019re sent into the rendering pipeline. Each group can then be rendered independently and ordered properly on the final output.\nThe result is a significant increase in encoding speed \u2014 approximately 80% for dual encoders, and further increases when more than two NVENCs are present, like in the NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Generation professional GPU. Image quality is also improved compared to current split encoding methods, where individual frames are sent to each encoder and then stitched back together in the final output.\n\nCapCut users will be the first to experience this benefit on RTX GPUs with two or more encoders, starting with the software\u2019s current release, available today.\nMassive May Studio Driver Drops\nThe May Studio Driver features significant upgrades and optimizations.\nMAGIX partnered with NVIDIA to move its line of VEGAS Pro AI models on WinML, enabling video editors to apply AI effects much faster.\nThe driver also optimizes AI features for applications running on WinML, including Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, MAGIX Vegas Pro, ON1 and DxO, among many others.\nThe real-time ray tracing renderer D5 Render also added NVIDIA DLSS 3, delivering a smoother viewport experience to navigate scenes with super fluid motion, massively benefiting architects, designers, interior designers and all professional 3D artists.\nD5 Render and DLSS 3 work brilliantly to create photorealistic imagery.\nNVIDIA RTX Video Super Resolution \u2014 video upscaling technology that uses AI and RTX Tensor Cores to upscale video quality \u2014 is now fully integrated into VLC Media Player, no longer requiring a separate download. Learn more.\nDownload GeForce Experience or NVIDIA RTX Experience for the easiest way to upgrade and to be notified of the latest driver releases.\nGaming\u2019s ACE in the Hole\nDuring NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s keynote address at COMPUTEX, he introduced NVIDIA ACE for Games, a new foundry that adds intelligence to NPCs in gaming with AI-powered natural language interactions.\nGame developers and studios can use ACE for Games to build and deploy customized speech, conversation and animation AI models in their software and games. The AI technology can transform entire worlds, breathing new life into individuals, groups or an entire town\u2019s worth of characters \u2014 the sky\u2019s the limit.\nACE for Games builds on technology inside NVIDIA Omniverse, an open development platform for building and operating metaverse applications, including optimized AI foundation models for speech, conversation and character animation.\nThis includes the NVIDIA NeMo for conversational AI fine-tuned for game characters, NVIDIA Riva for automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech, and Omniverse Audio2Face for instantly creating expressive facial animation of game characters to match any speech tracks. Audio2Face features Omniverse connectors for Unreal Engine 5, so developers can add facial animation directly to MetaHuman characters.\nSeeing Is Believing: Kairos Demo\nHuang debuted for COMPUTEX attendees ACE for Games \u2014 and provided a sneak-peek of the future of gaming \u2014 in a demo dubbed Kairos.\nConvai, an NVIDIA Inception startup, specializes in cutting-edge conversational AI for virtual game worlds. NVIDIA Lightspeed Studios, led by Creative Director and 3D artist Gabriele Leone, built the remarkably realistic scene and demo. Together, they\u2019ve showcased the opportunity developers have to use NVIDIA ACE for Games to build NPCs.\nIn the demo, players interact with Jin, owner and proprietor of a ramen shop. The photorealistic shop was modeled after the virtual ramen shop built in NVIDIA Omniverse.\nFor this, an NVIDIA artist traveled to a real ramen restaurant in Tokyo and collected over 2,000 high-resolution reference images and videos. Each captured aspects from the kitchen\u2019s distinct areas for cooking, cleaning, food preparation and storage. \u201cWe probably used 70% of the existing models, 30% new and 80% retextures,\u201d said Leone.\nKairos: Beautifully rendered in Autodesk Maya, Blender, Unreal Engine 5 and NVIDIA Omniverse.\nIn the digital ramen shop, objects were modeled in Autodesk 3ds Max with RTX-accelerated AI denoising, and Blender benefiting from RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing for smooth, interactive movement in the viewport \u2014 all powered by the team\u2019s arsenal of GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that without GeForce RTX GPUs and Omniverse, this project would\u2019ve been impossible to complete without adding considerable time\u201d \u2014 Gabriele Leone\n\nThe texture phase in Adobe Substance 3D Painter used NVIDIA Iray rendering technology with RTX-accelerated light and ambient occlusion, baking large assets in mere moments.\nNext, Omniverse and the Audio2Face app, via the Unreal Engine 5 Connector, allowed the team to add facial animation and audio directly to the ramen shop NPC.\nAlthough he is an NPC, Jin replies to natural language realistically and consistent with the narrative backstory \u2014 all with the help of generative AI.\nLighting and animation work was done in Unreal Engine 5 aided by NVIDIA DLSS using AI to upscale frames rendered at lower resolution while still retaining high-fidelity detail, again increasing interactivity in the viewport for the team.\nDirect your ramen order to the NPC, ahem, interactive, conversational character.\nSuddenly, NPCs just got a whole lot more engaging. And they\u2019ve never looked this good.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

Wall Street analysts rushed to boost their price targets on Nvidia throughout the year, with the consensus price target more than doubling from about $300 at the start of the year to nearly $650 today, according to data from Bloomberg. The stock closed at $492.98 on Friday.\u00a0\n\n\nThe company has gone from its founding 30 years ago with a focus on video games, to selling \"picks and shovels\" in the AI gold rush.\u00a0\nHere's why the Santa Clara, California-based firm is pulling ahead of the pack in the AI arms race.\u00a0\n\"A true visionary\"\n\"Over a decade ago, [CEO] Jensen Huang understood where the market was going to go, so [Nvidia] invested billions of dollars in not only silicon, but software,\" Ted Mortonson, tech strategist at Baird, told Business Insider earlier this year. \"And Jensen understood where the market was going before the market even materialized, so he is a true visionary.\"\n\n\nMortonson highlighted the success of Nvidia's H-100 graphic processor unit, which was released last year.\nAccording to Mortonson, the H-100 has enabled \"a leapfrog in training, inference, basically generative AI,\" and it's this specific chip that allowed ChatGPT to make its big debut last November. Nvidia recently followed up its H-100 chip with the H-200 AI chip, which is even more powerful than the H-100.\u00a0\nWhile Nvidia has the best chip on hand to power AI capabilities, it also has the right software and silicon stack to keep a competitive moat around its business.\n\n\n\"They have the entire AI silicon stack. And those are basically three components. They have the most advanced GPU, they have advanced networking embedded in the silicon, advanced memory embedded, and they're now developing a new CPU,\" Mortonson explained.\nIn other words, Nvidia is a one-stop shop for what companies need to drive their AI ambitions. They control their entire ecosystem, on both the hardware and software side, similar to Apple with its iPhone and iOS system, Mortonson said.\n\"When you cobble all these things together, it is an integrated immensely powerful AI engine. And they are years ahead of anyone else,\" Mortonson said, highlighting Nvidia's software development of CUDA, which is far ahead of its closest competition.\n\n\nMorton was adamant that the success of the company is the result of Huang's foresight, comparing him to other tech icons like Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\u00a0\n\"Their expertise in GPUs through their vision got them to the level of basically enabling AI broadly across every single industry. So this is truly through Jensen's leadership, and I think he'll go down as one of the great technologists of our age, along with Elon,\" Mortonson said.\n\"Nvidia is clearly going to be the biggest winner\"\nEquity analyst Angelo Zino at CFRA told Business Insider that Nvidia deep history of GPU expertise and its current control of the GPU data center market means it will continue to lead the pack in the AI space.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Nvidia is clearly going to be the biggest winner in our view. They are the inventor of GPUs, invented back in 1999. They own over 95% of market share of the GPU market within the data center space,\" Zino said.\u00a0\nWhile CPUs, developed mostly by Intel and to some extent AMD, are unable to handle the large processing power necessary to run AI, Nvidia's GPUs can.\u00a0\n\"Over the years, people have realized that these GPUs have the ability to solve some of the most difficult kind of computing problems out there...and Huang had a vision of this eventually taking place,\" Zino said.\n\n\nHe added that demand for GPUs will make for an enormous market for Nvidia to address, and not just for its core business in gaming and data centers, but for autonomous vehicles and a host of other technologies.\u00a0\n\"How they work with these enterprise companies is invaluable and a big reason why we do think that they're likely going to sustain a market share position north of 90% in the foreseeable future,\" Zino concluded.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Market\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\nMarkets\n \nMore \n\n\n\n\nWall Street\n\n\nTrading\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\nYour Market View\n\n\nNAME / PRICE\n+ / -\n%\nDATE\n\n\n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n                          Disclaimer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n                See also:\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                    - Explore more categories\n                \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

Combined with the cutting-edge streaming capabilities of CloudXR, Workspace ONE XR Hub enables more professionals, design teams and developers to quickly and securely access complex immersive environments using all-in-one headsets.\nMany organizations across industries use XR technologies to boost productivity and enhance creativity. However, teams often come across challenges when it comes to integrating XR into their workflows. That\u2019s why NVIDIA and VMware are working together to make it easier for enterprises to adopt augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\nWhether it\u2019s running immersive training sessions or conducting virtual design reviews, professionals can achieve the highest fidelity experience with greater mobility through Workspace ONE XR Hub and CloudXR.\nDelivering High-Fidelity XR Experiences to Enterprises\nCloudXR is NVIDIA\u2019s advanced solution for remotely streaming XR content from any OpenVR application. To access the highest quality immersive environments, teams typically need to be physically tethered to a powerful computing system. But with CloudXR, users can move to wireless headsets without limiting the quality of the XR experience.\nVMware\u2019s Workspace ONE XR Hub acts as a client application on an all-in-one headset, enabling users to securely connect to remote VR and AR content running on virtual machines and providing a one-click launch of CloudXR-enabled applications. Using VMware vSphere and VMware Horizon, teams can quickly and easily deploy XR-capable virtual machines accelerated by NVIDIA RTX and virtual workstation (vWS) software.\nThe combination of Workspace ONE XR Hub and CloudXR will allow enterprises and professionals to stream rich XR applications and content. By improving the user experience for XR, more teams can easily boost productivity and integrate realistic, virtual experiences into their workflows.\nSee VMware\u2019s latest announcement on VMware Workspace ONE XR Hub.\u00a0\nLearn more about NVIDIA CloudXR and how to integrate the solution into your products.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: CloudXR | Virtual Reality \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Get the scoop on their transformative journey.\n\nThis ain't your grandpa's Nvidia (NVDA -2.53%) anymore. And the new version is a monster.\nNvidia isn't playing games anymore\nTen years ago, Nvidia was all about gaming. Sure, the Nvidia Tesla high-performance computing card had been available since May 2012 and the third-generation model was just around the corner. But that was just a sideshow in 2013, and management didn't even bother to break out the financial results for data center products in its earnings reports back then. Nvidia had one operating segment, and it was almost exclusively about graphics processing units (GPUs) for desktops and laptops.\nFast-forward to the spring of 2018, and the seeds of a new strategy were starting to bloom. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, which Nvidia reported in May 2018, the gaming segment accounted for 54% of total revenues but the data center segment was already the second-largest contributor with a 22% revenue share.\nAnd you could smell the bright future of artificial intelligence (AI) processors in the air.\nHere's how Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang presented the results of Q1 2019, five years ago:\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the heart of our opportunity is the incredible growth of computing demand of AI, just as traditional computing has slowed. The GPU computing approach we have pioneered is ideal for filling this vacuum. And our invention of the Tensor Core GPU has further enhanced our strong position to power the AI era.\nFive years later: An AI-powered transformation\nHere we are in the spring of 2023. The AI boom is catching fire and Nvidia turns out to be one of the biggest winners in that revolution.\nThe company saw total revenues fall 13% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, due to a cyclical slowdown in the gaming department. But data center sales surged 14% higher over the same period and that segment stood for 60% of Nvidia's total revenues this time:\n\n\n\nNvidia's former AI side gig has become its main driver of new business. That enterprise-class opportunity should be a far more stable revenue stream than the fading focus on consumer-grade gaming chips.\nAs you can see from the long-term trends and Jensen Huang's seemingly prescient comments a decade ago, this shift has been in the works for ages. And if you kept a close eye on this development over the years, you should have seen Nvidia playing a consistent part in the game-changing process.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, let's look at the third version of OpenAI's generative pre-trained transformer, or GPT-3. This system ran its training phase on a supercomputer with more than 10,000 Nvidia Tesla V100 processors, working together in a deep learning system built by Microsoft (MSFT -1.46%).\n\nHow Nvidia holds an AI advantage in the years ahead\nGPT-3 was the basis of the ChatGPT chatbot that took the computing world by storm in recent months. But it was one of those overnight sensations that are years in the making. Nvidia shipped those 10,000 processors in time to train the early incarnations of GPT-3 in 2020. In other words, the hatGPT uproar you see today would not have been possible without Nvidia's help. So you can't call Nvidia an opportunistic newcomer to this market surge. Instead, the company stands ready to continue fueling the AI revolution.\nThe OpenAI partnership continues and should give Nvidia plenty of AI-based GPU sales in future financial reports. GPT-4 reportedly relies on 100 trillion deep learning parameters, compared to 175 billion in GPT-3. The fifth generation and beyond will almost certainly grow even larger and demand much better data-crunching processors. Nvidia is ready to deliver improved solutions to meet the rising requirements. The venerable V100 chip is still powerful but the more recent H100 model can crunch AI data nearly 10 times faster and also supports superior interconnection features for much larger multi-processor setups.\nNvidia won't be the only supplier in town, but the company has built a comfortable lead and patent-protected technology moat in this early stage. Nvidia's journey from gaming graphics specialist to AI titan illustrates the power of foresight and strategic evolution.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the company stands on the brink of becoming a trillion-dollar entity, investors should consider how Nvidia's innovative journey may continue to create value in the years ahead. I can't call it a no-brainer buy at this lofty valuation, but Nvidia most certainly deserves a second look if you're on the hunt for high-growth opportunities.\n\n\n\nAnders Bylund has positions in Nvidia.

Now She Wants Nvidia\u2019s AI CrownAMD CEO Lisa Su ranks No. 34 on Forbes' annual ranking of America's richest self-made women.Photograph by Jamel Toppin for Forbes; Makeup by Alicia Beller; Wardrobe by Caroline KareemByIain Martin, Forbes Staff andRichard Nieva, Forbes Staff. Follow AuthorsMay 31, 2023, 06:30am EDTUpdated Feb 21, 2024, 06:37pm ESTShareSaveAMD's CEO orchestrated one of the great turnarounds in Silicon Valley history, driving the dying semiconductor maker's stock price up nearly 30-fold in less than a decade. Next, she's preparing for battle in the coming AI revolution\u2014and she expects to keep winning.\n\nFrom a conference room atop AMD\u2019s headquarters in Santa Clara, California, a stretch of highway 101 running outside, Lisa Su presides over a company older than the term \"Silicon Valley.\" Down the road is a link to the company\u2019s past, an old foundry in Sunnyvale where AMD used to press its chips. But from her window she can see a recent milestone in the company\u2019s fast-evolving present: the offices of arch-nemesis Intel, whose market capitalization ($120.3 billion) AMD\u2019s now eclipses ($153.5 billion).\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always this way. In 2014, when Su, now 53, took up the CEO reins at AMD (Advanced Micro Devices), the chipmaker was foundering. The company had laid off around a quarter of its staff and its share price hovered around $2. Patrick Moorhead, a former AMD exec, remembers it as \u201cdeader than dead.\u201d Then Intel began to stumble, dragged down by manufacturing delays and Apple\u2019s decision not to use its chips in iPhones. Nimble, with a tactician\u2019s eye, Su was able to capitalize on her rival\u2019s missteps, inking deals with laptop makers such as Lenovo and gaming giant Sony, plus Google and Amazon, whose massive data centers generated $6 billion of the chipmaker\u2019s sales last year.\n\u201cIf you look out five years, you will see AI in every single product at AMD, and it will be the largest growth driver.\u201d\u00a0\nLisa Su, CEO, AMD\n\nAt $63 billion, Intel\u2019s annual revenue still dwarfs AMD\u2019s $23.6 billion. But wresting away coveted server chip market share from its Silicon Valley neighbor, as well as scooping up the semiconductor company Xilinx, has spiked AMD\u2019s stock nearly 30-fold in the nine years since Su took over. Now, with the mainstreaming of artificial intelligence stoking demand for the silicon brains behind machine learning, she\u2019s facing a legacy-defining opportunity and a daunting challenge: Can AMD produce a chip powerful enough to break Nvidia\u2019s near-monopoly on the processors that undergird the coming wave of generative AI technology? \u201cIf you look out five years,\u201d she says, \u201cyou will see AI in every single product at AMD, and it will be the largest growth driver.\u201d\n\nSu has been overclocking AMD for the last nine years, much like a gamer who pushes a processor to perform beyond its manufacturer-specified limits. Unlike many tech executives, she\u2019s a world-class researcher, with a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from MIT. Her unique combination of technical genius, people skills and business savvy has made her among the highest-paid S&P 500 CEOs for the last several years (total 2022 compensation: $30.2 million). Overall, she has amassed a $740 million fortune (largely in AMD stock), landing her in 34th place on our annual ranking of America\u2019s richest businesswomen. \u201cTalk about leaning in and just killing it,\u201d marvels Panos Panay, Microsoft\u2019s chief product officer, who first met Su in 2014 as she began AMD\u2019s turnaround.\nJamel Toppin for forbes\nUnlike Intel, though, whose revenue has seen a 12% decrease to $63.1 billion over three years, Nvidia appears at the top of its game. Beyond rendering stunning imagery in games like Cyberpunk 2077, its GPUs (graphics processing units) have become the engine of choice for artificial intelligence companies such as OpenAI, whose ChatGPT chatbot has delighted and disturbed the public by answering questions and commands with surprisingly detailed human-sounding responses.\nThese so-called large language models are really just stunning parlor tricks, but they\u2019re the opening act for an AI transformation that big shots like Bill Gates say will be as significant as the dawn of the internet. Already there is huge demand for the GPUs that power them, and at least one research firm foresees a $400 billion bonanza within the next decade for the companies that make them. But right now there\u2019s really just one. \u201cAI equals Nvidia,\u201d says Glenn O\u2019Donnell, a Forrester analyst. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty well-entrenched, and AMD has to really step up its game to overcome that.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the specter of Intel still looms across Highway 101, even as the O.G. of PCs has faced further manufacturing delays, chip defects and leadership changes. \u201cThere are many great things about AMD, but the bad thing is that we have two world-class competitors,\u201d says AMD exec Forrest Norrod, who helped Dell build its approximately $10 billion (2014 revenue) data center business in part on AMD chips and adds that the company never assumes its main rival will let problems linger. \u201cWe will always assume that Intel will fix it.\u201dSu is taking on Nvidia in the AI wars. Her secret weapon: the Instinct MI300 (shown here), a chip that melds traditional CPUs with GPU processors that are often used in gaming.Jamel Toppin for Forbes\nWHEN SU WAS promoted into AMD\u2019s top job in 2014, analysts were calling the company \u201cuninvestable,\u201d with $2.2 billion in debt. Some of its prized assets were already being sold for parts. Its fabrication plant where chips are baked (\u201cfabs,\u201d in industry-speak) was spun off in 2009\u2014a blow to AMD cofounder Jerry San\u00adders\u2019 infamous boast that \u201creal men have fabs.\u201d It even had to sell and lease back its corporate campus, in Austin, Texas\u2014Su\u2019s current base\u2014in 2013.\nMore troubling, AMD was struggling to execute. It couldn\u2019t hit product deadlines, and Intel dominated all but the bargain end of the laptop market with Nvi\u00addia, Qualcomm and Samsung carving up the new smartphone business. \u201cOur technology wasn\u2019t competitive at the time,\u201d Su admits.\nAMD hadn\u2019t always been such a headache for investors. Sanders broke into the microprocessor business making chips for IBM in the early 1980s, but things started to change in the late \u201990s and early 2000s. AMD, which had been a perennial second-rater, began generating record profits by building its own processors that beat Intel\u2019s on speed.\nBy 2014, those glory days were long gone. As were about a quarter of AMD\u2019s staff, sacked by Su\u2019s predecessor, Rory Read (Sanders stepped down as CEO in 2002). AMD had once commanded about a quarter of the now $24 billion server chip market, but its share dwindled to 2% in 2014. On her second day as CEO, Su stepped up to the microphone during an all-hands call with a message for AMD\u2019s demoralized employees: \u201cI believe that we can build the best,\u201d she remembers telling her staff. \u201cYou might think that was obvious, but it wasn\u2019t to the company at the time.\u201d\nThat rallying cry was also an edict and step one in her three-pronged plan to fix AMD: Create great products, deepen customer trust and simplify the company. \u201cThree things, just to keep it simple,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause if it\u2019s five or ten, it\u2019s hard.\u201d\nSu refocused her engineers on building Intel-beating chips, but it can take chip designers years to draw up a viable final blueprint. AMD\u2019s share of the server market fell even further, to half a percent, while researchers toiled in the lab. \u201cAt the time, the company wasn\u2019t doing well, but holy cow, they were working on the most exciting design in the industry,\u201d she says. \u201cEngineers are motivated by products, and I like to keep that front and center.\u201d\nHer decision to prioritize a new chip architecture called Zen paid off when it finally launched in 2017. \u201cIt was really good,\u201d she says with palpable pride, adding that Zen could compute more than 50% faster than the company\u2019s previous designs. More importantly, it signaled to the industry that AMD had turned a corner. By Zen\u2019s third generation, released in 2020, it was the market leader in terms of speed. Zen architecture now underpins all of AMD\u2019s processors.\nWith her team shepherding a new generation of chips, Su hit the road to hard-sell them to jaded data center clients. She had already spent years building relationships even when AMD had no chips to sell, once driving more than four hours through a Texas ice storm to charm Antonio Neri, now CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. \u201cI was, let\u2019s say, disenchanted by AMD\u2019s prior generation,\u201d Neri says. \u201cShe showed me she had the conviction of what needed to be done.\u201d\nA big part of Su\u2019s strategy was inking new deals with the tech giants, which needed oodles of CPUs to power their exploding cloud businesses. \u201cFor us, there are really three microprocessor partners. We have Nvidia, Intel, AMD,\u201d says Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud. \u201cAMD, when I joined, was not really a significant part of our ecosystem\u2014at all. And it is a credit to Lisa that they are a very important partner for us now.\u201d\nLast February, when AMD\u2019s market cap first surpassed Intel\u2019s, company cofounder Sanders, now 86, was ecstatic. \u201cI called everybody I know!\u201d he says. \u201cI was delirious. I\u2019m only sorry that Andy Grove isn\u2019t around so I could say \u2018gotcha!\u2019\u2009\u201d (Grove, Intel\u2019s legendary former CEO, died in 2016.)\nSU\n, THE DAUGHTER of a mathematician and a bookkeeper turned entrepreneur, was born in Tainan, Taiwan, in 1969, the same year Sanders founded AMD. Her family immigrated to New York City when she was 3. She chose electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology because it seemed to be the most difficult major. For someone so technically talented, she was also good with people, playing peacekeeper when disagreements flared between fellow students, says Hank Smith, who ran MIT\u2019s nanostructures lab at the time.AMD cofounder Jerry Sanders (shown here in 1979) was an early Silicon Valley swashbuckling salesman. \u201cPeople thought I was all hat and no cattle,\u201d he tells Forbes now. But he argues AMD wouldn\u2019t have lasted so long if that were true. \u201cWe were just trying to get attention. We were in the shadow of Intel.\u201d Martyn Goddard/Alamy\nSu laughs upon hearing herself described as a people person. \u201cWell, that\u2019s compared to other MIT people,\u201d she jokes. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would say I\u2019m an extrovert, but communication is a huge part of my job.\u201d\nAfter a brief stint at Texas Instruments, in 1995 she was hired as a staff researcher at IBM, where she helped design chips that run 20% faster by using semiconductors with copper circuitry instead of the traditional aluminum. Higher-ups quickly spotted her talent: In 1999, a year after the launch of the copper technology, IBM\u2019s then-CEO, Lou Gerstner, tapped her to be his technical assistant. In his first interview in 20 years, Gerstner tells Forbes he initially worried Su was too junior for the job, but his doubts were quickly quelled. \u201cShe proved to be one of the most outstanding employees who worked in my office. Lisa doesn\u2019t follow normal patterns\u2014she\u2019s been blowing them up her entire career.\u201d\nThat appointment gave Su a front-row seat for a corporate turnaround that is now a classic business school case study\u2014a rejuvenation ignited, in part, by leaning on the company\u2019s scale and creating a culture devoted to customers. Gerstner grew the stalled IBM\u2019s market cap nearly sixfold in his almost nine-year run. Su also got a taste for dealmaking, helping IBM sign a joint deal with Sony and Toshiba in 2001 to put its chips in Sony\u2019s PlayStation 3.\nEarly on, she sometimes worried she wasn\u2019t qualified to sit at tables packed with business heavyweights, but Su soon realized that her hard-learned technical acumen gave her an edge over executive-track types. \u201cI saw that MIT Ph.D.\u2019s worked for Harvard MBAs, and the truth is that made absolutely no sense to me,\u201d she said in a 2017 graduation speech at her alma mater, whose new nanotech laboratory now carries her name.\nIn late 2011, Nick Donofrio, at the time an AMD board member whom Su had met at IBM, called up his old prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, who by then was a senior vice president of Free-scale, the Austin-based chipmaker that is now part of NXP Semiconductors. The two met for dinner, and over a bottle of Brunello, he made his pitch: an opportunity not just to chase incremental improvements, but to reinvent and innovate\u2014with the ground cover to actually do it.\nA few days later, Su accepted a role as senior vice president of AMD\u2019s global business units. Two years after she started, she was running the entire company\u2014making her the first female CEO of a major semiconductor company.\n\u201cI would walk into rooms where there were, like, 25 people, and I might have been the only woman,\u201d she recalls of her early engineering days. \u201cWhere I have a lot of passion is young women engineers\u2014keeping them in engineering.\u201d\u201cAMD, when I joined, was not really a significant part of our ecosystem\u2014at all. And it is a credit to Lisa that they are a very important partner for us now.\u201d\u00a0\nThomas Kurian, CEO, Google Cloud\nWhen Su first took over, she flew to Beverly Hills and personally asked AMD\u2019s Sanders to speak to her team. Sanders says he was touched by Su\u2019s offer but declined. \u201cIt\u2019s not my team now. It\u2019s your team,\u201d he recalls telling her. Ever the salesman, though, he also made a counteroffer: He\u2019d make the visit once the company had hit two years of profitability. In 2019, coinciding with the company\u2019s 50th anniversary, Sanders made good on that promise.\nSemiconductor hotshot Mark Papermaster, who led the iPhone and iPod engineering teams at Apple and who had joined AMD around the same time as Su, has been a keen observer of the company\u2019s remarkable comeback under her leadership. At Apple, Papermaster had worked for another skilled turnaround artist: cofounder Steve Jobs, who saved the company from catastrophe and set it on the path that would make it the world\u2019s most valuable company. \u201cWhat Lisa had, in a number of ways, was an even more difficult task,\u201d Papermaster says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re not a founder, you have to establish your own credibility and your own vision, and bring the entire company, your customers and your investors with you.\u201d\nSu\u2019s success at AMD has made her an inspiration for young engineers and a hero to investors. It has also made her into a meme: A few years ago, 8-bit animations in which Su uses AMD\u2019s Ryzen chips to morph into a superhero or shoot lasers from her eyes went viral on Twitter. A figurine of her clad in orange-and-red armor, helmet at her side, features prominently on her office shelf, a gift from a fan at the E3 gaming conference. \u201cThat\u2019s probably one of the funnier moments in my career,\u201d says Su, who, while a keen Twitter and Reddit user, isn\u2019t \u201cbig on memes. It\u2019s not my thing.\u201d\nNOW THAT SU has renewed and energized AMD, she\u2019s focused on ensuring its future in a highly competitive market. While she diligently rebuilt its business, Nvidia cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang was hard at work making his company the go-to vendor for artificial intelligence computing power.\nHuang, who is a distant relative of Su\u2019s, sees a gold mine in selling the chips to buttress AI tools like Chat\u00adGPT. Demand has already catapulted Nvidia\u2019s share price to near all-time highs with a forward P/E of around 64x\u2014nearly double AMD\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s why investors are looking at AMD: because they want the poor man\u2019s Nvidia,\u201d says Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein. \u201cMaybe the market is so big they don\u2019t need to be competitive.\u201dSu is in a good position to take a run at the AI chip market. But she knows well how quickly turnarounds can become downfalls.\n\nBut Su intends it to be. And she hopes to take on Nvidia\u2019s AI-centric H100 GPUs by betting on annual chip upgrades meant to burnish AMD\u2019s position. Under her leadership, R&D spending has risen nearly fourfold, to $5 billion\u2014almost as much as AMD\u2019s entire revenue when she took over.\nA new supercomputer at Tennessee\u2019s Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u2014the fastest in the world when completed in 2022\u2014is Su\u2019s passion project. The groundbreaking machine was built to have the processing power of at least a quintillion calculations per second and is a showcase for AMD\u2019s AI chips. She\u2019s throwing a curveball as well: The MI300 chip, which fuses CPUs with GPUs in a bid to counter Nvidia\u2019s new superchip, will ship later this year.\nShe has also been maneuvering against Nvidia with acquisitions, such as her $48.8 billion takeover in 2022 of Xilinx, a company that makes programmable processors that help speed up tasks like video compression. As part of the deal, Victor Peng, Xilinx\u2019s former CEO, became AMD\u2019s president and leader of AI strategy.\nBeyond Nvidia lurk other emerging threats: Some of AMD\u2019s customers have begun doing chip development of their own\u2014a move designed to mitigate their dependence on the semiconductor giants. Amazon, for example, designed a server chip in 2018 for its AWS business. Google has spent nearly a decade developing its own AI chips, dubbed Tensor Processing Units, to help \u201cread\u201d the names of the signs captured by its roving Street View cameras and provide the horsepower behind the company\u2019s Bard chatbot. Even Meta has plans to build its own AI hardware.\nSu shrugs off concerns that her customers could someday be competitors. \u201cIt\u2019s natural,\u201d she says, for companies to want to build their own components as they look for efficiencies in their operations. But she thinks they can do only so much without the technical expertise AMD has built over the decades. \u201cI think it\u2019s unlikely that any of our customers are going to replicate that entire ecosystem.\u201d\nSu is in a good position to take a run at the AI chip market. But she knows well how quickly turnarounds can become downfalls. There\u2019s more work to be done to ensure AMD endures: \u201cI think there\u2019s another phase for AMD. We had to prove that we were a good company. I think we\u2019ve done that. Proving, again, that you\u2019re great, and that you have a lasting legacy of what you\u2019re contributing to the world, those are interesting problems for me.\u201d\n\nMORE FROM FORBESForbesTikTok Creators' Financial Info, Social Security Numbers Have Been Stored In ChinaBy Alexandra S.

That is how much Nvidia\u2019s gaming revenue was down in the first quarter of 2023, compared to the same time last year. The company blamed this on \u201cmacroeconomic slowdown\u201d and \u201clower shipment\u201d of gaming products to \u201cnormalize\u2026inventory levels.\u201d\n\nNews Peg\nDespite facing backlash from reviewers and the online gaming community, Nvidia remains the most dominant player in the space. According to the most recent monthly hardware survey conducted by Steam, the biggest digital storefront for PC gaming, more than 76% of users own an Nvidia GPU. Competitor AMD is a distant second with nearly 15%, followed by Intel at 8.6%. Despite backlash and criticism from gamers, Nvidia\u2019s dominance has hardly seen a dent compared to the same survey from last year.\nKey Background\nNvidia\u2019s market cap is approaching $1 trillion as the value of the company\u2019s shares has surged 170% since the start of this year and more than 25% since its first-quarter earnings report last week. The enthusiasm surrounding Nvidia stems from the excitement around generative AI, which was mentioned 43 times in its earnings call last week. Nvidia\u2019s GPUs were used by OpenAI to develop the language learning model GPT, which powers ChatGPT. Earlier this year, Midjourney\u2014whose generative AI tool creates images based on text prompts\u2014also announced it\u2019s service will be powered by servers running Nvidia\u2019s GPUs. Aside from gaming and graphics, the company\u2019s advanced chips also happen to be AI powerhouses. At the COMPUTEX trade show in Taiwan on Tuesday, Nvidia unveiled its new DGX GH200 AI supercomputer, which Google, Meta and Microsoft are \u201cevaluating\u201d according to the company. This has prompted both Nvidia and analysts to project that it could emerge as one of the big winners in the ongoing race to build more sophisticated generative AI tools, similar to ChatGPT and Midjourney.\n\nFurther Reading\nBigger Than Amazon?

To help customers easily build, deploy, and scale workloads, Amazon Omics now supports pre-built Ready2Run workflows from third-party software companies and open-source pipelines. Read more about the launch here.\nAs the cost of sequencing a human genome continues to decrease, the volume of sequencing data is exponentially increasing. Sequencing an individual\u2019s whole genome generates roughly 100 gigabytes of raw data directly off a genome sequencing instrument. Many genome analysis pipelines are struggling to keep up with the expansive levels of raw data being generated at high speed and in high volumes, leading to a growing need for low-cost, accelerated analysis pipelines. Whether used for sequencing critical-care patients with rare diseases or in population-scale genetics research, whole genome sequencing is becoming a fundamental step in clinical workflows and drug discovery.\nNVIDIA Parabricks is a suite of accelerated genomic analysis applications that contains optimized and AI-based industry-standard genomic tools such as GPU-accelerated GATK and DeepVariant. Parabricks can deliver accelerated analysis over CPU-based tools and reduce compute costs by utilizing NVIDIA GPUs. Thirteen Parabricks germline and somatic workflows are now available on Amazon Omics as Ready2Run workflows. Ready2Run workflows are a set of pre-built workflows from third-party software companies and open-source pipelines. With just a few clicks or a single API call, customers can run pre-built pipelines. Ready2Run workflows are priced-per-run to give customers predictable pricing.\nNVIDIA has collaborated with various teams including the GATK team at the Broad Institute, to validate accuracy, producing results that are functionally equivalent to the CPU-native GATK versions.\nParabricks Workflows on Amazon Omics:\nFigure 1: NVIDIA Ready2Run workflows on Amazon Omics displaying list price per run and estimated run time.\nThere is no license requirement to run the Parabricks workflows. This open-access policy aligns with NVIDIA\u2019s goal to democratize accelerated genomics analysis and enable researchers around the world to replicate results achieved using Parabricks analysis workflows. For users who would like to have enterprise-level support, NVIDIA offers NVIDIA AI Enterprise.\nWith NVIDIA AI Enterprise, organizations receive full access to enterprise support that provides guaranteed response times, priority security notification, and access to Parabricks experts to trouble-shoot and optimize genomics workflows. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is designed to accelerate and streamline development and deployment.\nSupported Pipelines:\nThe Parabricks Ready2Run workflows provide solutions for alignment, germline variant calling, somatic variant calling, and re-alignment to new reference genomes. Runtimes and costs for each workflow are transparent and predictable. Additionally, every workflow is pre-configured and tested, so no additional setup is needed to get started.\nFigure 2: The 13 NVIDIA Parabricks Ready2Run workflows available on Amazon Omics span 5x, 30x, and 50x germline workflows for DeepVariant and HaplotypeCaller as well as a 50x somatic workflow.\nAlignment\nThe FQ2BAM workflow generates BAM/CRAM output given one or more pairs of FASTQ files, providing an accelerated version of BWA-MEM and pre-processing tools used in GATK4 best practices. This workflow provides functionally equivalent results to the CPU-native versions, but can align a 30X genome in one hour on Amazon Omics.\nGermline\nThere are germline workflows for HaplotypeCaller and DeepVariant in Parabricks which generate VCFs as output. The germline (HaplotypeCaller) for WGS uses HaplotypeCaller and replicates GATK4 best practices, providing functionally equivalent results for a 30X whole genome on Amazon Omics.\nThe germline DeepVariant workflow for WGS utilizes an accelerated version of DeepVariant, a deep learning-based variant caller which provides increased accuracy of calls. DeepVariant is an AI-based model that is based on a CNN architecture and can be retrained on data for enhanced accuracy with each genomic platform or sequencing lab\u2019s outputs. There are DeepVariant models available to choose from for multiple sequencing instruments, and this workflow can analyze a 30X whole genome on Amazon Omics.\nSomatic\nThe Parabricks WGS 50x somatic workflow processes the tumor FASTQ files, and optionally normal FASTQ files and knownSites files, and generates tumor or tumor/normal analysis. The output is in VCF format. This workflow utilizes mutect2 and replicates GATK4 best practices for somatic analysis, and can align and variant call from a pair of deeper sequenced (50X) whole genomes on Amazon Omics.\nRe-Alignment\nThe BAM2FQ2BAM workflow can be used to extract reads and realign to new reference genomes (such as the T2T completed human genome). This process of re-aligning has typically been very slow and computationally expensive, but with the Parabricks accelerated workflow, speedups of 10X are achieved.\nThis workflow un-aligns a BAM file, reversing it from BAM to FASTQ format, and realigns the FASTQ to produce a new BAM file on a different reference.\nConclusion\nNVIDIA Parabricks Ready2Run workflows give customers the ability to easily run accelerated and AI-driven pipelines in the cloud.\nTo get started with NVIDIA Parabricks Ready2Run workflows, visit the Amazon Omics console.\nTo learn more about the price for each workflow, visit Amazon Omics Ready2Run pricing.\nTo learn more about enterprise support for NVIDIA Parabricks through NVIDIA AI Enteprise, contact NVIDIA.\nAuthors\nHarry Clifford is the NVIDIA genomics product lead, leveraging NVIDIA\u2019s expertise in AI, high performance computing (HPC), and data analytics stacks to address genomics workflows with accelerated high-accuracy solutions.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Analyzing tech stocks through the prism of cultural change.Follow AuthorMay 25, 2023, 03:56pm EDTShareSaveCommentShares of Nvidia jumped after the company reported strong first-quarter earnings. getty\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) hype is real, and it\u2019s going to have a lasting impact on the entire technology sector.\n\nExecutives at Nvidia (NVDA) on Tuesday reported strong first-quarter financial results as data center customers clamored to buy its high-end AI chips. Shares jumped 27% this morning, and haven\u2019t looked back.\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s brilliant early bet on AI a decade ago has made it the leader in this extremely important new niche, but there are several other ways to play this game. For one, investors should buy Oracle\nORCL\n. Let me explain.\n\nAt this stage investors understand most of the Nvidia AI story. The Santa Clara, California-based company builds the world's most advanced AI chips. More importantly, the company governs CUDA, a platform used by academics and software developers alike to build complex AI models. The last bit is often overlooked.\n\n\nThe power of Nvidia\u2019s hold on state of the art AI development is CUDA. The brightest minds in AI are developing on the CUDA. That platform depends on Nvidia smart silicon.\nThe Nvidia second-quarter guidance reflects this reality.\nExecutives said in a statement Wednesday that sales for the upcoming quarter are expected to reach about $11 billion. This astonishing number, beyond its massive scale, is 50% higher than expectations. The guidance is an outright blowout, higher than even the most bullish Wall Street outlook.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nThe key is data center customers can\u2019t get enough of the Nvidia H100, a high end AI chip. Better still, there is no current competitor due to CUDA. There is an AI gold rush and Nvidia is selling the only pickaxes and shovels in town. The company has a virtual monopoly.\n\nThis is great for Nvidia and it\u2019s being reflected in the aggressive bump in shares after the close on Wednesday. The stock traded at $394, its highest level ever and a 164% jump from January 1 this year.\n\n\nThe Oracle investment thesis is about its hold-over customers, the emergence of AI, and its new relationship with Nvidia.\nOracle is best known for its large legacy database business. This software is foundational to information technology at the bulk of the world\u2019s largest enterprises, from Fortune 500 companies to governments and private foundations.\nA large ecosystem of enterprise and third-party software development has evolved during the past five decades. The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure allows these developers to build powerful software as a service applications that run on the Oracle Cloud, customer hybrid clouds, or on-premise IT environments.\nThis ecosystem is the glue that binds legacy customers to Oracle.\nOracle executives in March announced a masterstroke. The Austin, Texas-based company partnered with Nvidia on next generation AI clouds. In addition to bringing state of the art Nvidia silicon to OCI, the deal will allow Oracle to resell Nvidia-backed services, including high performance storage to enterprises for their on-premises needs.\nKeep in mind that Oracle has a sizable enterprise stranglehold and an aggressive sales force. The company should be able to leverage these relationships into significant new AI sales.Oracle YCharts\nAt a share price of $98.32 Oracle trades at 17.6x forward earnings. The price to sales ratio is 5.5x, well within the historical range. The stock is up 20.2% in 2023.\nBased on a new AI sales cycle, shares could trade to $122.50 during the next six months, a gain of 24% from current levels.\nDiscover high-growth, underappreciated transformational tech stocks in Jon Markman\u2019s Fast Forward Investing.\n\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

The rise of AI, led by generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion, has not only aided the tech sector's recovery but has also driven it towards unprecedented growth. As we look into the future, one thing is clear: AI is not just a part of the tech industry; it is becoming the tech industry.  Markets, in general, are rebounding post-pandemic. However, the advent of AI has been a particular windfall for tech stocks, especially hardware manufacturers. The most evident recent example, of course, is NVIDIA, the company behind the leading industrial-grade graphic processing hardware and the creators of CUDA technology, without which contemporary AI developments would not be feasible. In a mere five months, NVIDIA has experienced the most significant surge to its stock price in its history. It has now recorded a 166% spike after enduring a 50% drop due to a rough combination of political conflicts between the U.S. and China, the 2022 chip crisis, and a market standstill caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In less than half a year, the company has recuperated from these losses, and there's no sign of it slowing down in the near term.   Nvidia stock. Image: TradingView   AI hardware manufacturers are on fire However, NVIDIA is not the only company reaping the benefits of the AI surge. Other competing and related companies are also profiting significantly from this new trend. Here are some of the winners. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) AMD manufactures high-performance computing and graphics solutions that are utilized in AI applications. They have developed specific GPUs and CPUs that are optimized for machine learning and AI workloads, and they are the second-most popular choice of GPUs for domestic users. So far this year, the company's shares have ascended 94% from $65 to their current price of $125. If the share price hits\u00a0$145, it would compensate for all of last year's losses.   AMD stock. Image: TradingView   Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSM is the world's largest dedicated independent (pure-play) semiconductor foundry. As a foundry, they produce chips for various companies, many of which are involved in AI. The company is up 39% since the start of the year. With another 20% rise, it would recover the losses from 2022. Chip crisis? Where?   TSM stock. Image: TradingView   Micron Technology (MU) Micron Technology is a global leader in the semiconductor industry. They manufacture a broad range of memory and storage products, which are crucial components for AI and machine learning systems that require quick and efficient data processing.   Story Continues MU shares have increased 47% so far in 2023, and they have growth potential of another 27% before encountering resistance marked by their own all-time high.  MU stock. Image: TradingView  Three AI-related software stocks to watchBeyond the hardware realm, software companies are also experiencing a spectacular year, particularly due to the explosion of generative AI, with ChatGPT leading the hype.Meta (META)Previously known as Facebook, Meta is one of the favorites among investors. Shifting focus from the metaverse to AI is yielding results for Mark Zuckerberg's company, which, in addition to implementing solutions in its traditional business model, has also published significant open-source contributions, including the Large Language Model LLaMa.A Large Language Model (or LLM) is an AI model trained on a large amount of text data and is able to generate human-like responces to different text prompts. (This simulates a conversation using natural language.) LLaMA is a highly popular LLM among AI users and developers.Meta has had its best half-year performance in history, rising 116% so far in 2023.  META stock. Image: TradingView  Microsoft (MSFT)Bill Gates' company is renowned for being the creators of Windows and the Xbox gaming console. But now it is gaining ground for being the \"godfather\" of OpenAI, the company that developed LLM GPT-4 and ChatGPT, the chatbot that brought AI into the media spotlight.OpenAI is valued at $29 billion, and Microsoft alone has invested $13 billion. The decision to incorporate GPT-4 into their Edge browser and Bing search engine, as well as using Bing as the default search engine for ChatGPT, has been a catalyst for the tech giant's stock price. So far in 2023, Microsoft has risen nearly 40%, offsetting the losses from the previous year,  Microsoft stock. Image: TradingView  Alphabet Inc (GOOGL)Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is heavily invested in AI. They have developed Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which are custom-developed application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) used to accelerate machine learning workloads. They are also the developers of TensorFlow, an open-source AI library, and offer cloud-based AI services. In the realm of software, the company has been much more active.The launch of Bard with its improved PaLM2 has been a success, positioning it as a direct competitor to ChatGPT. The release of LLM models tailored to customers' needs has generated a positive response among its investors (unlike what happened when the company presented its first chatbot and it started hallucinating). GOOGL shares have risen 40% so far this year and are 20% away from growth until they challenge the resistance of their all-time high again.  Google stock.

Following a flurry of activity among the best graphics cards, the industry\u2019s biggest names are now turning attention to affordable products where the majority of gamers ply their trade.\nCards able to shift in volume are vital to success, as evidenced by the top 10 most popular GPUs on Steam \u2013 a list comprised entirely of products fetching less than \u00a3500 at launch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti Founders Edition\n\u00a3379 / $399\n\n\n\nPros\n\nTop-notch 1080p gaming\nBeautiful Founders Edition\nDLSS 3 goes mainstream\nIncredible efficiency\nAlways cool and quiet\n\n\n\nCons\n\nLacks VRAM staying power\nMild upgrade over last gen\nNo bundled game\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy at Amazon\n\n\n\nClub386 may earn an affiliate commission when you purchase products through links on our site.How we test and review products.\n\n\nThough RTX 4090 is without doubt an aspirational halo product, it captures a mere 0.42 per cent market share among Steam users, putting it behind even lowly Intel UHD Graphics 620. GTX 1650, a \u00a3149 product from 2020, continues to rule the roost, and both AMD and Nvidia are desperate to break that stranglehold with a compelling reason to upgrade.\nOmens are good, as prices are coming down, the mining boom is nothing more than a bad memory, stock shortages have ceased, and for those PC gamers who\u2019ve been sat on the fence, opportunity beckons.\nAdding extra spice to proceedings, the two driving forces in PC graphics are tackling the mainstream quandary almost simultaneously. AMD\u2019s budget Radeon RX 7600 arrives tomorrow, but Nvidia fires the first shot with GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, officially available today at $399 / \u00a3379 in Founders Edition guise.\n\n\nThe promise is \u201cunparalleled performance at fantastic value,\u201d yet in the hope of finding a winning formula that sticks, Nvidia\u2019s foray into mainstream RTX 40 Series products takes a three-pronged approach. RTX 4060 Ti will be followed swiftly by a 16GB variant and a regular RTX 4060 as soon as July. We\u2019ll evaluate said cards in due course, but first thing\u2019s first, let\u2019s break out the trusty Club386 Table of DoomTM to see exactly how RTX 4060 Ti stacks up.\nGeForceRTX 4090RTX 4080RTX 4070 TIRTX 4070RTX 4060 TiLaunch dateOct 2022Nov 2022Jan 2023Apr 2023May 2023CodenameAD102AD103AD104AD104AD106ArchitectureAdaAdaAdaAdaAdaProcess (nm)44444Transistors (bn)76.345.935.835.822.9Die size (mm2)608.5378.6294.5294.5187.8SMs128 of 14476 of 8060 of 6046 of 6034 of 36CUDA cores16,3849,7287,6805,8884,352Boost clock (MHz)2,5202,5052,6102,4752,535Peak FP32 TFLOPS82.648.740.129.122.1RT cores12876604634RT TFLOPS191.0112.792.767.451.0Tensor cores512304240184136ROPs176112806448Texture units512304240184136Memory size (GB)241612128Memory typeGDDR6XGDDR6XGDDR6XGDDR6XGDDR6Memory bus (bits)384256192192128Memory clock (Gbps)2122.4212118Bandwidth (GB/s)1,008717504504288L1 cache (MB)169.57.55.84.4L2 cache (MB)7264483632PCIe interface4.0 x164.0 x164.0 x164.0 x164.0 x8Power (watts)450320285200160Launch MSRP ($)1,5991,199799599399\nYou\u2019ve seen this sort of progression before, and it\u2019s an art Nvidia has mastered over the years. Introduce a new architecture as part of an all-singing, all-dancing product, and then chip away, if you\u2019ll excuse the pun, over the ensuing months to fashion leaner GPUs at more affordable price points.\nLean, Mean RTX Gaming Machine\nRTX 4060 Ti\u2019s provenance is fascinating insofar as Nvidia has adopted a mobile-first strategy. AD106 has already featured in laptop devices earlier this year, which goes some way toward explaining the lean overall design. Arriving on desktop while ensuring a wide berth between itself and RTX 4070 further up the stack, the new entry point employs an extremely efficient AD106 die whose 187.8mm2 makes it extremely efficient to produce. This is, by some distance, the smallest x60-class chip we can recall, and testament to a maturing 4nm process.\nA size reduction of over 70 per cent compared to top-dog RTX 4090 highlights how far RTX 40 Series is being asked to scale, yet such a shrink does result in some of the most significant cuts to date. Core count drops a further 26 per cent over RTX 4070, from 5,888 down to 4,352, and as you might have heard, the back-end is controversially curtailed to 8GB of GDDR6 memory via a narrow 128-bit bus.\nPower consumption dropping to 160 watts is an obvious attraction in today\u2019s age of steep electricity, yet in truth, RTX 4060 Ti specifications serve up no major surprises. It is roughly what we expected from a mainstream RTX 40 Series GPU, and as predicted, a $399 price tag remains consistent with prior generations.\nThe question is whether or not RTX 4060 Ti is well suited to carry the baton from hugely popular GPUs that came before. For that, we\u2019ll need to compare the newcomer to the best x60 iteration from generations past. Here\u2019s a table that\u2019ll bring back memories.\nGeForceGTX 960GTX 1060GTX 1660 TiRTX 2060 SuperRTX 3060 TiRTX 4060 TiLaunch dateJan 2015Jul 2016Feb 2019Jul 2019Dec 2020May 2023CodenameGM206GP106TU116TU106GA106AD106ArchitectureMaxwellPascalTuringTuringAmpereAdaProcess (nm)2814121284Transistors (bn)2.94.46.610.817.422.9Die size (mm2)227200284445393187.8CUDA cores1,0241,2801,5362,1764,8644,352Boost clock1,1781,7081,7701,6501,6652,535Peak TFLOPS2.44.35.47.216.222.1RT cores\u2013\u2013\u2013343834Tensor cores\u2013\u2013\u2013272152136Memory (GB)2 / 466888Mem bus (bits)128192192256256128Bandwidth (GB)112192288448448288L2 cache (MB)11.51.54432PCIe interface3.0 x163.0 x163.0 x163.0 x164.0 x164.0 x8Power (watts)120120120175200160SLIYes\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013Display outputsDVIHDMI 2.0DisplayPort 1.2DVIHDMI 2.0DisplayPort 1.4DVIHDMI 2.0DisplayPort 1.4DVIHDMI 2.0DisplayPort 1.4HDMI 2.1DisplayPort 1.4HDMI 2.1DisplayPort 1.4Resizable bar\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013YesYesNVENC3rd Gen4th Gen6th Gen6th Gen7th Gen8th GenDX12 Ultimate\u2013\u2013\u2013YesYesYesRaytracing1st Gen2nd Gen3rd GenAI acceleration\u2013\u2013\u2013DLSSDLSS 2DLSS 3MSRP ($)199249279399399399 \nAn overview of half-a-dozen generations spanning the best part of a decade provides insight into where we\u2019ve been, where we are, and importantly, where we\u2019re headed.\nPeruse the top half of the table and you can rightly marvel at the wonder of modern technology. We\u2019ve gone from 28nm to 4nm in no time at all, helping pave the way to some astonishing metrics. The RTX 4060 Ti die is 17 per cent smaller than GTX 960 yet carries more than seven times the number of transistors. Add to that a staggering 115 per cent increase in boost clock and progress is clear to see; the march from 2.4 teraflops to 22.1 has been swift.\n\nTemper that excitement in the knowledge that manufacturing challenges are now a pressing concern. Understanding the need to innovate in other areas rather than rely solely on ballooning transistor count, Nvidia switched gears in 2018 with wholesale changes culminating in a rebrand from GTX to RTX. New technologies such as hardware ray tracing and AI-acceleration are brought into the fold, and the importance of feature-level firepower is such that traditional specifications are in fact receding; RTX 4060 Ti is unusual insofar as it features fewer rasterisation cores than its immediate predecessor. That\u2019s never happened before, and on paper, memory bandwidth has regressed, too.\nWe say on paper as, once again, Nvidia is attempting to balance performance using novel means. The time-honoured method of wider and faster is being set aside for smarter design; in this case a larger 32MB pool of L2 cache. An 8x increase over the previous generation is significant, and using in-house testing of cache hits and misses across a variety of titles, Nvidia reckons RTX 4060 Ti\u2019s real-world bandwidth can be rated as an effective 554GB/s. That\u2019s a fanciful metric certain to ruffle a few feathers among those who favour the old-fashioned way.\nThe VRAM Conundrum\nThe more pressing issue, we feel, is why VRAM has become a perceived bottleneck for graphics cards ostensibly intended for 1080p gaming. It is no coincidence PC games have begun to suffer in the aftermath of latest-generation game consoles. PlayStation 5 touts memory bandwidth of 448GB/s courtesy of 16GB of GDDR6 via a 256-bit bus, while Xbox Series X delivers 560GB/s through 10GB of GDDR6 attached to a 320-bit bus. Both systems target high resolution, and as is increasingly the case, resulting PC ports lack the desired optimisation to function optimally across a broad array of hardware configurations. Wait for the patch, as they say.\n\n\nAside from the odd, poorly-optimised title, 8GB ought to be sufficient for 1080p gaming in 2023, and in an unexpected admission, Nvidia\u2019s own benchmarks suggest RTX 4060 Ti 16GB \u2013 coming in July starting at $499 from AIB partners \u2013 holds barely any perceptible performance advantage at the target resolution. Said card has the feel of a token gesture, intended merely to quell growing dissent of another generation of 8GB cards, and we\u2019d liked to have seen RTX 4060 Ti feature a full implementation of 4,608 cores as another point of differentiation. Make no mistake, if it\u2019s 1440p gaming you\u2019re after, Nvidia wants RTX 4070 to serve as the preferred destination.\nGoing solely by specification, it is clear RTX 4060 Ti is not a momentous upgrade over existing RTX equivalents. Rather, it is intended to put GTX to bed and convince users still clinging to 16-, 10-, or 9-Series hardware to make the switch. There are good reasons to do so \u2013 support for resizeable bar, DX12 Ultimate, AV1 decoding and, of course, DLSS 3 frame generation all form part of the equation \u2013 however a $399 price tag remains a hurdle for what it is ultimately a 1080p card.\n\nIn an alternate universe, Nvidia may have foreseen a monumental fall in DRAM pricing and equipped cards accordingly. RTX 4060 Ti 12GB and RTX 4070 16GB would be a better fit for this generation, but we are where we are, and 8GB models may yet benefit consumers inadvertently. Word on the grapevine is that AMD has scrambled to cut Radeon RX 7600 pricing in the hours leading up to launch, and the overriding feeling at Club386 HQ is that GeForce RTX 4060 Ti would benefit from a more aggressive MSRP. At the very least, said card ought to include a free game; as things stand, the Diablo IV bundle offer applies only to RTX 4070 Series and above.\nNearly time for the benchmarks, but for those who are new to RTX 40 Series, a brief recap on the goodness of Nvidia\u2019s latest-generation architecture.\nAda Lovelace\nWhile a shift to a smaller node affords more transistor firepower, such a move typically precludes sweeping changes to architecture. Optimisations and resourcefulness are order of the day, and the huge computational demands of raytracing are such that raw horsepower derived from a 3x increase in transistor budget isn\u2019t enough; something else is needed, and Ada Lovelace brings a few neat tricks to the table.\nNvidia often refers to raytracing as a relatively new technology, stressing that good ol\u2019 fashioned rasterisation has been through wave after wave of optimisation, and such refinement is actively being engineered for RT and Tensor cores. There\u2019s plenty of opportunity where low-hanging fruit is yet to be picked.\nShader Execution Reordering\nShaders have been running efficiently for years, whereby one instruction is executed in parallel across multiple threads. You may know it as SIMT.\nRaytracing, however, throws a spanner in those smooth works, as while pixels in a rasterised triangle lend themselves to running concurrently, keeping all lanes occupied, secondary rays are divergent by nature and the scattergun approach of hitting different areas of a scene leads to massive inefficiency through idle lanes.\n\nAda\u2019s fix, dubbed Shader Execution Reordering (SER), is a new stage in the raytracing pipeline tasked with scanning individual rays on the fly and grouping them together. The result, going by Nvidia\u2019s internal numbers, is a 2x improvement in raytracing performance in scenes with high levels of divergence.\nNvidia portentously claims SER is \u201cas big an innovation as out-of-order execution was for CPUs.\u201d A bold statement and there is a proviso in that Shader Execution Reordering is an extension of Microsoft\u2019s DXR APIs, meaning it us up to developers to implement and optimise SER in games.\nThere\u2019s no harm in having the tools, mind, and Nvidia is quickly discovering that what works for rasterisation can evidently be made to work for RT.\nUpgraded RT Cores\nIn the rasterisation world, geometry bottlenecks are alleviated through mesh shaders. In a similar vein, displaced micro-meshes aim to echo such improvements in raytracing.\n\n\u201cThe era of brute-force graphics rendering is over\u201d\nBryan Catanzaro, Nvidia VP of applied deep learning research\nWith Ampere, the Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) was forced to contain every single triangle in the scene, ready for the RT core to sample. Ada, in contrast, can evaluate meshes within the RT core, identifying a base triangle prior to tessellation in an effort to drastically reduce storage requirements.\nA smaller, compressed BVH has the potential to enable greater detail in raytraced scenes with less impact on memory. Having to insert only the base triangles, BVH build times are improved by an order of magnitude and data sizes shrink significantly, helping reduce CPU overhead.\nThe sheer complexity of raytracing is such that eliminating unnecessary shader work has never been more important. To that end, an Opacity Micromap Engine has also been added to Ada\u2019s RT core to reduce the amount of information going back and forth to shaders.\n\nIn the common leaf example, developers place the texture of foliage within a rectangle and use opaque polygons to determine the leaf\u2019s position. A way to construct entire trees efficiently, yet with Ampere the RT core lacked this basic ability, with all rays passed back to the shader to determine which areas are opaque, transparent, or unknown. Ada\u2019s Opacity Micromap Engine can identify all the opaque and transparent polygons without invoking any shader code, resulting in 2x faster alpha traversal performance in certain applications.\nThese two new hardware units make the third-generation RT core more capable than ever before \u2013 TFLOPS per RT core has risen by ~65 per cent between generations \u2013 yet all this isn\u2019t enough to back up Nvidia\u2019s claims of Ada Lovelace delivering up to 4x the performance of the previous generation. For that, Team Green continues to rely on AI.\nDLSS 3\nSince 2019, Deep Learning Super Sampling has played a vital role in GeForce GPU development. Nvidia\u2019s commitment to the tech is best expressed by Bryan Catanzaro, VP of applied deep learning research, who states with no uncertainty that \u201cthe era of brute-force graphics rendering is over.\u201d\nThird-generation DLSS, deemed a \u201ctotal revolution in neural graphics,\u201d expands upon DLSS Super Resolution\u2019s AI-trained upscaling by employing optical flow estimation to generate entire frames. Through a combination of DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Frame Generation, Nvidia reckons DLSS 3 can now reconstruct seven-eighths of a game\u2019s total displayed pixels, to dramatically increase performance and smoothness.\nGenerating so much on-screen content without invoking the shader pipeline would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. It is a remarkable change of direction, but those magic extra frames aren\u2019t conjured from thin air. DLSS 3 takes four inputs \u2013 two sequential in-game frames, an optical flow field and engine data such as motion vectors and depth buffers \u2013 to create and insert synthesised frames between working frames.\nIn order to capture the required information, Ada\u2019s Optical Flow Accelerator is capable of up to 300 TeraOPS (TOPS) of optical-flow work, and that 2x speed increase over Ampere is viewed as vital in generating accurate frames without artifacts.\n\nThe real-world benefit of AI-generated frames is most keenly felt in games that are CPU bound, where DLSS Super Resolution can typically do little to help. Nvidia\u2019s preferred example is Microsoft Flight Simulator, whose vast draw distances inevitably force a CPU bottleneck. Internal data suggests DLSS 3 Frame Generation can boost Flight Sim performance by as much as 2x.\nDo note, also, that Frame Generation and Super Resolution can be implemented independently by developers. In an ideal world, gamers will have the choice of turning the former on/off, while being able to adjust the latter via a choice of quality settings.\nMore demanding AI workloads naturally warrant faster Tensor Cores, and Ada obliges by imbuing the FP8 Transformer Engine from HPC-optimised Hopper. Peak FP16 Tensor teraflops performance is already doubled from 320 on Ampere to 661 on Ada, but with added support for FP8, RTX 4090 can deliver a theoretical 1.3 petaflops of Tensor processing.\nPlenty of bombast, yet won\u2019t such processing result in an unwanted hike in latency? Such concerns are genuine; Nvidia has taken the decision to make Reflex a mandatory requirement for DLSS 3 implementation.\nDesigned to bypass the traditional render queue, Reflex synchronises CPU and GPU workloads for optimal responsiveness and up to a 2x reduction in latency. Ada optimisations and in particular Reflex are key in keeping DLSS 3 latency down to DLSS 2 levels, but as with so much that is DLSS related, success is predicated on the assumption developers will jump through the relevant hoops. In this case, Reflex markers must be added to code, allowing the game engine to feed back the data required to coordinate both CPU and GPU.\nGiven the often-sketchy state of PC game development, gamers are right to be cautious when the onus is placed in the hands of devs, and there is another caveat in that DLSS tech is becoming increasingly fragmented between generations. \nDLSS 3 now represents a superset of three core technologies: Frame Generation (exclusive to RTX 40 Series), Super Resolution (RTX 20/30/40 Series), and Reflex (any GeForce GPU since the 900 Series). Nvidia has no immediate plans to backport Frame Generation to slower Ampere cards.\n8th Generation NVENC\nLast but not least, Ada Lovelace is wise not to overlook the soaring popularity of game streaming, both during and after the pandemic.\nBuilding upon Ampere\u2019s support for AV1 decoding, Ada adds hardware encoding, improving H.264 efficiency to the tune of 40 per cent. This, says Nvidia, allows streamers to bump their stream resolution to 1440p while maintaining the same bitrate.\nAV1 support also bodes well for professional apps \u2013 DaVinci Resolve is among the first to announce compatibility \u2013 and Nvidia extends this potential on high-end RTX 40 Series GPUs by including up to two 8th Gen NVENC encoders (enabling 8K60 capture and 2x quicker exports) as well as a 5th Gen NVDEC decoder as standard.\nPerformance\n\nOur 5950X Test PCs\nClub386 carefully chooses each component in a test bench to best suit the review at hand.

Readers wanting to see how RTX 4060 Ti compares to high-end products can cross-reference earlier Club386 reviews, but for the purpose of this editorial, we\u2019re focussing exclusively on mainstream GPUs slotting in below RTX 4070.\nSome of the world\u2019s most popular cards \u2013 GTX 1660 Ti, GTX 1060 and RTX 3060 \u2013 have been tested from scratch using the latest drivers, and just to make things interesting, we\u2019ve also included a couple of outliers in the form of Intel Arc A770 16GB and AMD Radeon RX 6750 XT 12GB, both of which serve as direct competitors having fallen as low as \u00a3359 and \u00a3349, respectively.\n\n\n3DMark remains a good indicator of a GPU\u2019s rasterisation credentials and RTX 4060 Ti is deemed to be roughly 10 per cent quicker than RTX 3060 Ti across both resolutions. A modest bump given the latter is approaching its third birthday.\nAppreciating users of much older GPUs may consider RTX 4060 Ti as a useful upgrade, migrating from GTX 1660 Ti nets a doubling of performance, while those still rocking a GTX 1060 will see a 3x increase. That\u2019s the audience Nvidia craves most.\n\n\n\nHardware ray tracing and a forward-looking architecture continue to act as hallmarks of the Ada Lovelace architecture. Nvidia continues to hold an advantage in such tests, but shout out to Intel Arc, an oft-forgotten GPU that has become increasingly competitive over time.\nAssassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla\n\n\nOwners of RTX 3060 Ti will be in no hurry to rush out and buy. An ~80 per cent performance uplift from RTX 2060 to RTX 4060 Ti is more promising, but you\u2019ll need to upgrade from older GTX x60 cards in order to witness a doubling of framerate.\nCyberpunk 2077\n\n\nModern-day Crysis. Cyberpunk 2077, with ultra raytracing enabled, puts the pain on all GPUs in this bracket.\nFar Cry 6\n\n\nPrice drops on existing cards are a thorn in RTX 4060 Ti\u2019s side. Nvidia\u2019s newcomer succeeds as a high-framerate 1080p GPU, yet do be aware Radeon RX 6750 XT offers better non-RT performance in some games, packs more memory, and is available for \u00a3349 if you shop around.\nFinal Fantasy XIV: Endwalker\n\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, a game relying heavily on rasterisation, also takes a liking to traditional memory bandwidth. An increase of L2 cache doesn\u2019t appear to be helping here, as RTX 4060 Ti and RTX 3060 Ti are virtually indistinguishable.\nForza Horizon 5\n\n\nFour times faster than GTX 1060 offers good incentive to finally make that upgrade. The performance advantage over RTX 3060 Ti, however, represents arguably the smallest generational bump in recent times.\nTom Clancy\u2019s Rainbow Six Extraction\n\n\nWhen testing such a broad array of GPUs, the overall experience is brought into focus. Every 6GB card in our charts would flash up warnings across different titles at maximum quality settings. 8GB models don\u2019t yet fall into that trap, though there are now a couple of games questioning the long-term credentials of such a configuration. Are the likes of Hogwarts Legacy and The Last of Us a sign of things to come, or merely poorly optimised titles? Only time will tell.\nPower, Temps and Noise\n\nWant to upgrade while keeping energy costs down to a respectable level? The Ada Lovelace architecture excels with regards to efficiency, and as is to be expected given the performance on offer, RTX 4060 Ti is easily the most frugal 40 Series GPU to date, coming bundled with a single eight-pin-to-12VHPWR adapter for use with older PSUs.\nSide note: Intel\u2019s day-one driver updates are all well and good, however a fix for Arc\u2019s irresponsible idle power consumption is long overdue.\n\nThrifty design translates to ultra-low temps and outstanding consistency. RTX 4060 Ti remained glued to 2,760MHz throughout testing and never looked likely to breach 60\u00b0C, even on a warm summer\u2019s day.\n\nLike RTX 4070 before it, fan speed tops out a mere 30 per cent (~1,400RPM) inside our real-world test system. The card is quiet when gaming and practically silent when the fans switch off at low load.\nIt is a beautiful piece of kit, echoing dual-slot RTX 4070 form factor, albeit with a lighter shade of silver trim, and as is now customary, the exquisitely crafted Founders Edition sets a high bar for add-in-card partners to try and match.\nRelative Performance, Efficiency and Value\n\nEvaluating relative performance across all benchmarked games reveals RTX 4060 Ti offers roughly four fifths of RTX 4070 performance. The increase over RTX 3060 Ti is down to single digits.\n\nDividing average framerate by system-wide power consumption validates Ada Lovelace\u2019s outstanding efficiency. Note the chart-topping score only takes into account \u2018real\u2019 frames; Nvidia\u2019s lead would extend further with AI-generated frames added to the equation.\n\nDividing average framerate by each GPU\u2019s dollar MSRP always leads to fascinating discussion. At $399, RTX 4060 Ti tops the chart without breaking a sweat.\n\nLaunch MSRP provides one view, another is to examine the best offers available at the time of writing. Club386 has scouted all the popular UK stores to find the lowest GBP price on each listed GPU. You may notice a few cards have fallen off the chart completely; they\u2019re simply no longer available to buy.\nIn this scenario, Nvidia\u2019s \u00a3379 Founders Edition doesn\u2019t enjoy such an easy ride. Price cuts on rival AMD and Intel cards offer much-needed competition, and RTX 4060 Ti would need to drop closer to \u00a3320 in order to reclaim top spot.\nOverclocking\n\nPushing graphics cards to the limit through heightened power and frequency may be an increasingly niche past time, yet it\u2019s always nice to see a GPU that responds well. Using the automated scanner built into MSI\u2019s Afterburner utility, in-game RTX 4060 Ti boost clock climbs from 2,760MHz to 2,910MHz without problem. We expect enthusiasts to approach the 3GHz mark, while memory has no trouble scaling from 18Gbps to 19Gbps, helping alleviate some of those bandwidth concerns.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a reasonable amount of headroom to play with, resulting in a five per cent in-game performance uplift at 1080p.\nDLSS 3\nRejogging the memory banks after all those benchmarks, remember developers now have the option to enable individual controls for Super Resolution and / or Frame Generation. The former, as you\u2019re no doubt aware, upscales image quality based on setting; Ultra Performance works its magic on a 1280\u00d7720 render, Performance on 1920\u00d71080, Balanced works at 2227\u00d71253, and Quality upscales from 2560\u00d71440.\nOn top of that, Frame Generation inserts a synthesised frame between two rendered, resulting in multiple configuration options. Want the absolute maximum framerate? Switch Super Resolution to Ultra Performance and Frame Generation On, leading to a 720p upscale from which whole frames are also synthesised.\nWant to avoid any upscaling but willing to live with frames generated from full-resolution renders? Then turn Super Resolution off and Frame Generation On. Note that enabling the latter automatically invokes Reflex; the latency-reducing tech is mandatory, once again reaffirming the fact that additional processing risks performance in other areas.\n\n\nDLSS 3\u2019s initial success is reflected in industry adoption. Rival GPU manufacturers are scrambling to introduce their own variants, while triple-A games such as Forza Horizon 5 (pictured above) and Diablo IV are choosing to add full support for AI-powered frame generation. It is quickly becoming a sought-after feature with good reason, as results have been impressive thus far.\n\nForza Horizon 5 is one of the better implementations to date. While super resolution results in only evolutionary performance gains, frame generation is revolutionary by comparison. Flick a switch and performance is instantly bolstered to the tune of 38 per cent.\nGetting performance purists on board with AI-enhanced gameplay is proving a tough task \u2013 it\u2019s akin to convincing a petrolhead to go electric \u2013 yet the future of gaming is intrinsically linked to resourceful design. Right now, DLSS is the best example of how to multiply performance through AI.\nConclusion\nNvidia has extended the reach of its ultra-efficient Ada Lovelace architecture to $399 / \u00a3379 with the introduction of GeForce RTX 4060 Ti.\nTasked with being the first RTX 40 Series card to break into Steam\u2019s top 10 most popular GPUs, the newcomer aims squarely at 1080p gamers still rocking cards from a few generations ago. The upgrade argument is bolstered through high-framerate gameplay, best-in-class ray tracing, excellent efficiency and AI-based performance enhancements no competitor can match.\nSuch credentials ought to make RTX 4060 Ti an obvious choice for millions of gamers looking to belatedly changeover from ever-popular GTX, yet there\u2019s pause for thought. Whether or not an 8GB memory configuration will stand the test of time is up for debate, and in 2023, the best part of four hundred pounds for a card geared explicitly for 1080p feels steep in the current climate.\nVerdict: Intended to be many gamers\u2019 first RTX, 4060 Ti is a worthwhile upgrade over much older cards.\n\n\nParm MannClub386 founder and editor-in-chief, his journey with hardware pre-dates Google. To this day, nothing beats the nostalgic nineties, piecing together a Pentium CPU and 3DFX graphics card from a Wolverhampton computer market.

Since then, I\u2019ve covered the AI microtrend for this specific stock 27 times on my research site, which is the equivalent of a novel.\n\nI\u2019ve also gone on record to say that Nvidia will surpass the valuation of Apple. That particular analysis compared the impact that AI will have to mobile, with AI adding $15 trillion to GDP compared to mobile\u2019s $4.4 trillion. Mobile brought us three FAANGs: Apple, Google and Facebook. It has been my stance for years that AI will bring us a new set of FAANGs, one of which will be Nvidia. \n\nJen-Hsun Huang, president and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., speaks during the company's ...

Rather than flatly tell you that while offering no way forward, I want to continue providing value to my readers by discussing when my firm plans to buy the stock again.\n\n\nBut also, we should discuss why the market is rallying on this company specifically. Good investors must do both \u2013 understand what makes a company stand out while being patient on price.\n\nAI is Not a Buzzword for Nvidia\nShort sellers mistakenly believe that AI is a buzzword for Nvidia. This is true for many stocks, but not for the leader in parallel processing.\nHere is what I wrote five years ago on the topic:\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\n\u201cNvidia is already the universal platform for development, but this won\u2019t become obvious until innovation in artificial intelligence matures. Developers are programming the future of artificial intelligence applications on Nvidia because GPUs are easier and more flexible than customized TPU chips from Google or FPGA chips used by Microsoft [from Xilinx]. Meanwhile, Intel\u2019s CPU chips will struggle to compete as artificial intelligence applications and machine learning inferencing move to the cloud. Intel is trying to catch-up but Nvidia continues to release more powerful GPUs \u2013 and cloud providers such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google cannot risk losing the competitive advantage that comes with Nvidia\u2019s technology.\n\nThe Turing T4 GPU from Nvidia should start to show up in earnings soon, and the real-time ray-tracing RTX chips will keep gaming revenue strong when there is more adoption in 6-12 months. Nvidia is a company that has reported big earnings beats, with average upside potential of 33.35 percent to estimates in the last four quarters. Data center revenue stands at 24% and is rapidly growing. When artificial intelligence matures, you can expect data center revenue to be Nvidia\u2019s top revenue segment. Despite the corrections we\u2019ve seen in the technology sector, and with Nvidia stock specifically, investors who remain patient will have a sizeable return in the future.\u201d\n\n\n-Free Newsletter and Seeking Alpha, November 2018 with AI Thesis repeated again in April of 2019\nWhen I wrote that, Nvidia was considered a gaming stock with high-risk exposure to crypto. What is astonishing is that the company was still considered a gaming stock with high-risk exposure to crypto a mere seven months ago.\nYou may recall, the stock was down 60% last year after a $2.5 billion miss on gaming, and the market was pricing in a long recovery due to Ethereum\u2019s merge to Proof of Stake (PoS). The bears believed the Merge would flood the market with mining GPUs and Nvidia would be unable to overcome this setback.\nAt the time, there was no mention of Nvidia\u2019s AI lead despite the H100 GPU being released the very next month! Instead, the market had investors believing that Ethereum, with only 200 million users, which is a smaller user base than Snap or Pinterest, could tank the GPU-juggernaut on the eve of the company\u2019s largest release to-date: the H100 GPU.\nThe reason I\u2019m emphasizing this is because my firm has worked hard to be a quality resource on tech stocks. Often times there is a major disconnect between the market\u2019s pricing and a tech company\u2019s positioning. There is no greater evidence of this than when Nvidia was down 60% seven months ago yet is the top performing stock in the S&P 500 today.\nWhy the Market is Bulled Up on Nvidia\nI want to take the opportunity to explain why Nvidia has the ability to arrive at a valuation that is 3X higher than its peers and in some cases 12X higher.Why Nvidia has the ability to arrive at a valuation that is 3X higher than its peers and in some ... [+] cases 12X higher.YCharts\nI\u2019m not defending this valuation, rather I want to explain how it\u2019s possible that smart money continues to buy up here.\nThe H100 is a Turning Point from Hardware to Software\n\u201cThe Hopper architecture is ramping and it\u2019s yet again going to disrupt the GPU and AI accelerator market. I\u2019ve written quite a bit about Nvidia [\u2026] however, I will keep it simple by saying the A100 GPU is what led the company\u2019s gains since Q2 2020 and the Hopper H100 GPU is what will lead the company\u2019s gains for the next two years.\u201d -Premium Site August 2022, following Nvidia\u2019s $2.5 billion revenue miss.\nNote: the information below is a bit technical, so I\u2019ve bolded the key points for a quick read.\nFor context, the A100 GPU was a monumental release for Nvidia as the Ampere architecture unified training and inference onto a single chip, whereas in the past Nvidia\u2019s GPUs were mainly used for training.\nThe result is a 20x performance boost from a multi-instance GPU that allows many GPUs to look like one GPU. The A100 offered the largest leap in performance to date over the past 8 generations. One year later, the Ampere architecture had become the best-selling GPU architecture in the company\u2019s history.\nThe A100 was special but it\u2019s the H100 that is Nvidia\u2019s iPhone moment. The reason is quite simple \u2013 it\u2019s the release that will help Nvidia breakout from hardware and put the company firmly on the map for AI software.\nHardware has allowed Nvidia to become a $700B market cap company, but it is the recurring revenue from AI software that will propel Nvidia into a market cap worth trillions.\nYou know this story well: the relationship between a hardware company leveraging their position to capture the lion\u2019s share of software \u2014- because that\u2019s exactly what Apple did. My contention is that the iPhone was successful because of the moat iOS developers created, and the additional flywheel from the App Store. I discussed this more in a webinar \u201cThe New Kings of Tech\u201d\nThe H100 delivers 9X more throughput in AI training, and 16X to 30X more inference performance. The company also states in HPC application-specific workloads, the H100 is 7X faster. The goal of the H100 was not only to add more transistors and make the H100 faster, but to also offer function-specific optimizations. This is achieved through the transformer engine.\nThe transformer engine is one of the key aspects of the H100. Transformers are becoming one of the most popular neural-network models by applying self-attention to detect how data elements in a series influence and depend on one another.\nPrior to transformer models, labeled datasets had to be used to train neural networks. Transformer models eliminate this need by finding patterns between elements mathematically, which substantially opens up what datasets can be used and how quickly. Transformers are partial to the parallel processing that GPUs offer.\nThe Hopper architecture aims to answer one of the bigger challenges facing superfast compute, which is that moving data into traditional servers overloads the CPU and system memory and becomes bottlenecked by PCI-Express.\nBy improving the bandwidth issue, Nvidia\u2019s goal is to create more demand for their DGX Pod and SuperPod Systems, which in turn, will create more demand for their software.\nThe DGX SuperPods scale into a super-GPU capable of 768 terabytes per second. To compare, the entire internet requires 100 terabytes per second. This results in 1 exaflop of FP8 AI performance that runs trillions of parameters. FP8 is most commonly used for inference yet may be used for training in the future due to boosting throughput.\nWhereas traditional workloads required many connections exchanging small amounts of data, the workloads of the future will require data to be shared quickly between GPUs and storage. This is accomplished by bypassing the CPU and sending data directly to the GPU while using the network hardware to move the data.\nThis is ideal for enterprise use cases where people are more likely to use Ethernet while AI and HPC workloads continue to use the Quantum-2 based off Mellanox\u2019s InfiniBand.\nNot only will Nvidia begin to monetize through software on the DGX systems but accessibility will improve through CSPs, or cloud service providers. This is an attempt to democratize AI development while driving software sales. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, cloud service providers drove 40% of data center revenue. This is important as cloud service providers will help move DGX Cloud along and AI-as-a-service.\nNvidia\u2019s TAM of $600 Billion is Easily and Quickly Achievable\n\u201cThe conclusion to my analysis is the same as the introduction, which is that I believe Nvidia is capable of out-performing all five FAAMG stocks and will surpass even Apple\u2019s valuation in the next five years.\u201d \u2013 Forbes and Free Newsletter, August 2021\nLast year, CEO Jensen Huang provided a total addressable market of $300 billion in hardware and $300 billion in software. Meanwhile, Elon Musk is deploying 10,000 GPUs in the cloud and there will likely be tens of thousands more to inference a widely deployed model for a social media generative AI project.\nPer the analyst on the call: \u201cSo it seems like the incremental TAM is easily in the several hundred thousands of GPUs and easily in the tens of billions of dollars. But I'm kind of wondering what this does to the TAM numbers you gave last year. I think you said $300 billion hardware TAM and $300 billion software TAM. So how do you kind of think about what the new TAM would be?\u201d\nHuang aptly answered: \u201cI think those numbers are really a good anchor still. The difference is because of the, if you will, incredible capabilities and versatility of generative AI and all of the converging breakthroughs that happened towards the middle and the end of last year, we're probably going to arrive at that TAM sooner than later.\u201d\nToday, Nvidia trades at 1.5X this TAM at $773 billion compared to an achievable TAM of $600 billion. This would suggest the stock price does not yet fully reflect the future market opportunity. Also, compare this TAM of $600 billion to Apple\u2019s revenue of $394 billion, which helps illustrate why I said in the past that Nvidia Will Surpass Apple\u2019s Valuation.\nWhat to Expect in the Upcoming Earnings:\nIf we set aside the AI thesis for a moment, you can see below why Nvidia has rallied as the revenue is expected to rebound from (-21.4%) for the upcoming quarter to as much as +32% growth by fiscal Q3 ending in September. The popularity of the H100 could lead to a beat somewhere across these next few quarters. In addition, the RTX40 Series lower-end model will be released today for $299 and up, and this may further help the gaming revenue for Q2 and beyond.\nNvidia is unique in that the healthy growth is expected to continue into the foreseeable future \u2014 long after the company laps the quarters of the crazy gaming miss. What we don\u2019t want is to invest in companies propped up temporarily by low comps. This is not the case with Nvidia.\nHere is Nvidia\u2019s revenue growth over the past five quarters, which shows the effects of the gaming segment:Here is Nvidia\u2019s revenue growth over the past five quarters, which shows the effects of the gaming ... [+] segment.I/O Fund\nAs stated in our previous earnings coverage on Nvidia, all segments are expected to grow sequentially.  I believe this is a major contributor for the rally we are seeing.

Here is what was said on the call:\n\u201cThanks for the question. First, talking about our data center guidance that we provided for Q1. We do expect a sequential growth in terms of our data center, strong sequential growth. And we are also expecting a growth year-over-year for our data center. We actually expect a great year with our year-over-year growth in data center probably accelerating past Q1.\u201dSo, what we don\u2019t see in the graph above is what the \u201caccelerating past Q1\u201d will be and this is the ...

The below is a real-time trade notification we sent to our members on the October 13th.The above is a real-time trade notification we sent to our members on the October 13th.I/O Fund\nSince February of 2022, we have been systematically taking gains at key levels. Even with logging sizable wins in this position in 2023, it remains our top position while still having enough cash to buy at lower levels.\nIt is our belief that NVDA is setting up for a sizable pullback, which we believe will open the door for better long-term entries. The reasons for this are below:\nThe structure/pattern of NVDA\u2019s bounce signals caution. If we look at the pattern off the October low, it may feel like a straight line up; however, you can clearly see 3 swings (marked a, b, c). The first swing up off the low (a), a bearish retrace that makes a higher low (b), and the current swing that we are still in (c).The structure/pattern of NVDA\u2019s bounce signals caution. If we look at the pattern off the October ... [+] low, it may feel like a straight line up; however, you can clearly see 3 swings (marked a, b, c). The first swing up off the low (a), a bearish retrace that makes a higher low (b), and the current swing that we are still in (c).I/O Fund\nWhen we see a 3 wave pattern off of a major low, more times than not, it is a corrective bounce in a larger downtrend. While it may feel impossible at such heights, please keep in mind how sentiment can and does work against us as investors. It felt like tech could never go down in late 2020, and then it felt like it would never go up in Q4 of 2022.\nNvidia is no different, and what we have is a pattern that suggests a larger pullback than most expect is likely, at minimum. So, until this 3 wave pattern can morph into a 5 wave pattern, the odds favor a sizable pullback soon.\nFurther evidence of this can be seen in how NVDA is now at a significant supply region that marked the top in late 2023. We are now in the region that would constitute a double top playing, and note how price keeps trending higher with less momentum.\nWe are approaching a double top in conjunction with one of my favorite \u201csell signals\u201d - when you have price making 3 higher highs, while the momentum indicator being used is making 3 lower highs. This is clearly happening on multiple time frames, which we believe warrants caution.\nSimilar patterns can be seen on the weekly chart of NVDA below. As price pushes higher, it is doing so on less momentum and less volume. When we see the same pattern on multiple time frames, it further builds the case for caution.Regarding the targets we are tracking for entries, there are two general paths I see playing out ... [+] from the price data in the above charts.I/O Fund\nRegarding the targets we are tracking for entries, there are two general paths I see playing out from the price data in the above charts.\nThe Blue Count suggests that we completed the large degree uptrend that started in 2018. This would put is in a very large corrective rally with the final leg lower coming later this year/early next year. This would have us retest the October lows, and possibly slightly lower. The big tell for this count playing out will be if the coming pullback is a 5 wave pattern pointing down. If we see a large 5 wave drop from the highs, it is signaling that NVDA will likely go lower than most are anticipating.\nThe Red Count suggests that the October low was THE low. This will still set us up for a sizable pullback into the $220 - $167 region before setting up to make a run to new highs. This count implies that the large uptrend that started in 2018 is not complete and will be targeting fresh highs in the coming year. The tell for this scenario will be if the coming pullback is a 3 wave pattern. If we see a 3 wave pullback, we will look to be heavy buyers in the general target box just outlined.\nConclusion:\nMy firm tracks Nvidia very closely due to its leading allocation in our portfolio. We saw evidence of a gaming bottom in November, which we published about here. We also felt Nvidia had masterfully timed it\u2019s RTX40 Series with the Ada Lovelace architecture plus the H100 release to drop exactly when the crypto mining selloff would be most felt. We discussed this here in September. These points were entirely overlooked by Nvidia critics.\nYes, a $2.5 billion revenue miss is crazy \u2013 but what was lying beneath the surface for chances of a quick recovery? The devil is in the details and not a lot of investors or analysts care to look into Nvidia\u2019s complex hardware products.\nFor my readers, it has worked out in their favor that talking heads prefer to discuss stocks after they are up triple digits in price, and that the masses are collected around hindsight narratives. My firm is carefully and patiently building an AI portfolio that we believe will outperform institutions and hedge funds. Taking our sweet time to enter Nvidia at the lows \u2013 as we have done for the past five years and will continue to do so for the next five years \u2014 is part of that strategy.\nOur firm issues real-time trade alerts when we buy, sell or trim stocks.

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  For about six years, AI has been an integral part of the artwork of Dominic Harris, a London-based digital artist who\u2019s about to launch his biggest exhibition to date.\n\u201cI use it for things like giving butterflies a natural sense of movement,\u201d said Harris, whose typical canvas is an interactive computer display.\nUsing a rack of NVIDIA\u2019s latest GPUs in his studio, Harris works with his team of more than 20 designers, developers and other specialists to create artworks like Unseen. It renders a real-time collage of 13,000 butterflies \u2014 some fanciful, each unique, but none real. Exhibit-goers can make them flutter or change color with a gesture.\nThe Unseen exhibit includes a library of 13,000 digital butterflies.\nThe work attracted experts from natural history museums worldwide. Many were fascinated by the way it helps people appreciate the beauty and fragility of nature by inviting them to interact with creatures not yet discovered or yet to be born.\n\u201cAI is a tool in my palette that supports the ways I try to create a poignant human connection,\u201d he said.\nAn Artist\u2019s View of AI\nHarris welcomes the public fascination with generative AI that sprang up in the past year, though it took him by surprise.\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny that AI in art has become such a huge topic because, even a year ago, if I told someone there\u2019s AI in my art, they would\u2019ve had a blank face,\u201d he said.\nLooking forward, AI will assist, not replace, creative people, Harris said.\n\u201cWith each performance increase from NVIDIA\u2019s products, I\u2019m able to augment what I can express in a way that lets me create increasingly incredible original artworks,\u201d he said.\nA Living Stock Exchange\nCombining touchscreens, cameras and other sensors, he aims to create connections between his artwork and people who view and interact with them.\nFor instance, Limitless creates an eight-foot interactive tower made up of gold blocks animated by a live data feed from the London Stock Exchange. Each block represents a company, shining or tarnished, by its current rising or falling valuation. Touching a tile reveals the face of the company\u2019s CEO, a reminder that human beings drive the economy.\nHarris with \u201cLimitless,\u201d a living artwork animated in part with financial market data.\nIt\u2019s one work in Feeding Consciousness, Harris\u2019 largest exhibition to date, opening Thursday, May 25, at London\u2019s Halcyon Gallery.\nBooting Up Invitations\n\u201cBefore the show even opened, it got extended,\u201d he said, showing invitations that went out on small tablets loaded with video previews.\nThe NVIDIA Jetson platform for edge AI and robotics \u201cfeatures prominently in the event and has become a bit of a workhorse for me in many of my artworks,\u201d he said.\nAn immersive space in the \u201cFeeding Consciousness\u201d exhibit relies on NVIDIA\u2019s state-of-the-art graphics.\nThree years in the making, the new exhibit includes one work that uses 180 displays. It also sports an immersive space created with eight cameras, four laser rangefinders and four 4K video projectors.\n\u201cI like building unique canvases to tell stories,\u201d he said.\nHarris puts the viewer in control of Antarctic landscapes in \u201cEndurance.\u201d\nFor example, Endurance depicts polar scenes Sir Ernest Shackleton\u2019s expedition trekked through when their ship got trapped in the ice pack off Antarctica in 1915. All 28 men survived, and the sunken ship was discovered last year while Harris was working on his piece.\nHarris encounters a baby polar bear from an artwork.\n\u201cI was inspired by men who must have felt miniscule before the forces of nature, and the role reversal, 110 years later, now that we know how fragile these environments really are,\u201d he said.\nWriting Software at Six\nHarris started coding at age six. When his final project in architecture school \u2014 an immersive installation with virtual sound \u2014 won awards at University College London, it set the stage for his career as a digital artist.\nAlong the way, \u201cNVIDIA was a name I grew up with, and graphics cards became a part of my palette that I\u2019ve come to lean on more and more \u2014 I use a phenomenal amount of processing power rendering some of\u00a0 my works,\u201d he said.\nFor example, next month he\u2019ll install Every Wing Has a Silver Lining, a 16-meter-long work that displays 30,000 x 2,000 pixels, created in part with GeForce RTX 4090 GPUs.\n\u201cWe use the highest-end hardware to achieve an unbelievable level of detail,\u201d he said.\nHe shares his passion in school programs, giving children a template which they can use to draw butterflies that he later brings to life on a website.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to get them to see and embrace art in the technology they\u2019re growing up with,\u201d he said, comparing it to NVIDIA Canvas, a digital drawing tool his six- and 12-year-old daughters love to use.\nThe Feeding Consciousness exhibition, previewed in the video below, runs from May 25 to August 13 at London\u2019s Halcyon Gallery.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: 3D | Art | Artificial Intelligence | Creators | Customer Stories | GeForce | GPU | Jetson | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA Jetson | NVIDIA RTX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

No Problem: READY Robotics Simplifies Robot Coding, Rollouts\n\n\n\t\t\t\tStartup\u2019s ForgeOS \u201cno code\u201d software, which features NVIDIA Isaac Sim, enables robot programming for non-coders.\t\t\t\n\n\nMay 23, 2023 by Scott Martin \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Robotics hardware traditionally requires programmers to deploy it. READY Robotics wants to change that with its \u201cno code\u201d software aimed at people working in manufacturing who haven\u2019t got programming skills.\nThe Columbus, Ohio, startup is a spinout of robotics research from Johns Hopkins University. Kel Guerin was a PhD candidate there leading this research when he partnered with Benjamin Gibbs, who was at Johns Hopkins Technology Ventures, to land funding and pursue the company, now led by Gibbs as CEO.\n\u201cThere was this a-ha moment where we figured out that we could take these types of visual languages that are very easy to understand and use them for robotics,\u201d said Guerin, who\u2019s now chief innovation officer at the startup.\nREADY\u2019s\u00a0 \u201cno code\u201d ForgeOS operating system is designed to enable anyone to program any type of robot hardware or automation device. ForgeOS works seamlessly with plug-ins for most major robot hardware, and similar to other operating systems, like Android, it allows running third-party apps and plugins, providing a robust ecosystem of partners and developers working to make robots more capable, says Guerin.\nImplementing apps in robotics allows for new capabilities to be added to a robotic system in a few clicks, improving user experience and usability. Users can install their own apps, such as Task Canvas, which provides an intuitive building block programming interface similar to Scratch, a simple block-based visual language for kids developed at MIT Media Lab, which was influential in its design.\nTask Canvas allows users to show the actions of the robot, as well as all the other devices in an automation cell (such as grippers, programmable logic controllers, and machine tools) as blocks in a flow chart. The user can easily create powerful logic by tying these blocks together \u2014 without writing a single line of code. The interface offers nonprogrammers a more \u201cdrag-and-drop\u201d experience for programming and deploying robots, whether working directly on the factory floor with real robots on a tablet device or with access to simulation from Isaac Sim, powered by NVIDIA Omniverse.\n\u00a0\n\nRobot System Design in Simulation for Real-World Deployments\u00a0\nREADY is making robotics system design easier for nonprogrammers, helping to validate robots and systems for accelerated deployments.\nThe company is developing Omniverse Extensions \u2014 Omniverse kit applications based on Isaac Sim \u2014 and can deploy them on the cloud. It uses Omniverse Nucleus \u2014 the platform\u2019s database and collaboration engine \u2014 in the cloud as well.\nIsaac Sim is an application framework that enables simulation training for testing out robots in virtual manufacturing lines before deployment into the real world.\n\u201cBigger companies are moving to a sim-first approach to automation because these systems cost a lot of money to install. They want to simulate them first to make sure it\u2019s worth the investment,\u201d said Guerin.\nThe startup charges users of its platform licensing per software seat and also offers support services to help roll out and develop systems.\nIt\u2019s a huge opportunity. Roughly 90 percent of the world\u2019s factories haven\u2019t yet embraced automation, which is a trillion-dollar market.\nREADY is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a free program that provides startups with technical training, go-to-market support and AI platform guidance.\nFrom Industrial Automation Giants to Stanley Black & Decker\nThe startup operates in an ecosystem of world-leading industrial automation providers, and these global partners are actively developing integrations with platforms like NVIDIA Omniverse and are investing in READY, said Guerin.\n\u201cRight now we are starting to work with large enterprise customers who want to automate but they can\u2019t find the expertise to do it,\u201d he said.\nStanley Black & Decker, a global supplier of tools, is relying on READY to automate machines, including CNC lathes and mills.\nRobotic automation had been hard to deploy in their factory until Stanley Black & Decker started using READY\u2019s ForgeOS with its Station setup, which makes it possible to deploy robots in a day.\nCreating Drag-and-Drop Robotic Systems in Simulation\u00a0\nREADY is putting simulation capabilities into the hands of nonprogrammers, who can learn its Task Canvas interface for drag-and-drop programming of industrial robots in about an hour, according to the company.\nThe company also runs READY Academy, which offers a catalog of free training for manufacturing professionals to learn the skills to design, deploy, manage and troubleshoot robotic automation systems.\n\u201cFor potential customers interested in our technology, being able to try it out with a robot simulated in Omniverse before they get their hands on the real thing \u2014 that\u2019s something we\u2019re really excited about,\u201d said Guerin.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Jetson Orin, Omniverse Enterprise.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: Inception | NVIDIA Isaac Sim | Omniverse Enterprise \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We\u2019re also deep diving on new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.\nContent creator Grant Abbitt embodies selflessness, one of the best qualities that a creative can possess. Passionate about giving back to the creative community, Abbitt offers inspiration, guidance and free education for others in his field through YouTube tutorials.\nHe designed Dragon, the 3D scene featured this week In the NVIDIA Studio, specifically to help new Blender users easily understand the steps in the creative process of using the software.\n\u201cDragons can be extremely tough to make,\u201d said Abbitt. While he could have spent more time refining the details, he said, \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the point of the project. It\u2019s all about the learning journey for the student.\u201d\nAbbitt understands the importance of early education. Providing actionable, straightforward instructions enables prospective 3D modelers to make gradual progress, he said. When encouraged, 3D artists keep morale high while gaining confidence and learning more advanced skills, Abbitt has noticed over his 30+ years of industry experience.\nHis own early days of learning 3D workflows presented unique obstacles, like software programs costing as much as the hardware, or super-slow internet, which required Abbitt to learn 3D through instructional VHS tapes.\nLearning 3D modeling and animation on VHS tapes.\nUndeterred by such challenges, Abbitt earned a media studies degree and populated films with his own 3D content.\nNow a full-time 3D artist and content creator, Abbitt does what he loves while helping aspiring content creators realize their creative ambitions. In this tutorial, for example, Abbitt teaches viewers how to create a video game character in just 20 minutes.\nDragon Wheel\nAbbitt described a different dynasty in this realm \u2014 how he created his Dragon piece.\n\u201cReference images are a must,\u201d stressed Abbitt. \u201cDeviation from the intended vision is part of the creative process, but without a direction or foundation, things can quickly go off track.\u201d This is especially important with freelance work and creative briefs provided by clients, he added.\nAbbitt looked to Pinterest and ArtStation for creative inspiration and reference material, and sketched in the Krita app on his tablet. The remainder of the project was completed in Blender \u2014 the popular 3D creation suite \u2014 which is free and open source.\nReference imagery set a solid foundation for the project.\nHe began with the initial blockout, a 3D rough-draft level built using simple 3D shapes without details or polished art assets. The goal of the blockout was to prototype, test and adjust the foundational shapes of the dragon. Abbitt then combined block shapes into a single mesh model, the structural build of a 3D model, consisting of polygons.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/clip2.mp4\n\u00a0\nMore sculpting was followed by retopologizing the mesh, the process of simplifying the topology of a mesh to make it cleaner and easier to work with. This is a necessary step for images that will undergo more advanced editing and distortions.\nAdding Blender\u2019s multiresolution modifier enabled Abbitt to subdivide a mesh, especially useful for re-projecting details from another sculpt with a Shrinkwrap modifier, which allows an object to \u201cshrink\u201d to the surface of another object. It can be applied to meshes, lattices, curves, surfaces and texts.\nAt this stage, the power of Abbitt\u2019s GeForce RTX 4090 GPU really started to shine. He sculpted fine details faster with Blender Cycles RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in the viewport for fluid, interactive modeling with photorealistic detail. Baking and applying textures were done with buttery smooth ease.\nAstonishing details for a single 3D model.\nThe RTX 4090 GPU also accelerated the animation phase, where the artist rigged and posed his model. \u201cModern content creators require GPU technology to see their creative visions fully realized at an efficient pace,\u201d Abbitt said.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/clip1.mp4\n\u00a0\nFor the texturing, painting and rendering process, Abbitt said he found it \u201cextremely useful to be able to see the finished results without a huge render time, thanks to NVIDIA OptiX.\u201d\nRendering final files in popular 3D creative apps \u2014 like Blender, Autodesk Maya with Autodesk Arnold, OTOY\u2019s OctaneRender and Maxon\u2019s Redshift \u2014 is made 70-200% faster with an RTX 4090 GPU, compared to previous-generation cards. This results in invaluable time saved for a freelancer with a deadline or a student working on a group project.\n\nAbbitt\u2019s RTX GPU enabled OptiX ray tracing in Blender Cycles for the fastest final frame render.\nThat\u2019s one scary dragon.\n\u201cNVIDIA GeForce RTX graphics cards are really the only choice at the moment for Blender users, because they offer so much more speed during render times,\u201d said Abbitt. \u201cYou can quickly see results and make the necessary changes.\u201d\nContent creator Grant Abbitt.\nCheck out Abbitt\u2019s YouTube channel with livestreams every Friday at 9 a.m. PT.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

Thank the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti for its mercy, then \u2013 assuming you can find one at RRP,  it\u2019s the first of its family not to plonk a price premium over the last-gen equivalent. And even though it\u2019s only moderately faster than the RTX 3060 Ti in most games, its efficiency improvements and DLSS 3 support ensure the RTX 4060 Ti keeps some crowd pleasing potential.\n\nAs, indeed, it should. The RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3060 endured the absolute worst of 2021\u2019s GPU shortages to become the two biggest 30 series hits, so keeping their successors affordable was the right move. To that end, the 8GB RTX 4060 Ti starts from \u00a3389 / $399, more than the \u00a3289 / $299 RTX 4060 (due in July) but less than its planned 16GB version (also in July, for $499). \n\n\n\nHow To Install A Graphics Card\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\nMSI GeForce RTX 4060 Ti Gaming X Trio specs:\n\nCUDA Cores: 4352\nBase clock speed: 2310MHz\nBoost clock: 2670MHz\nVRAM: 8GB GDDR6\nPower: 160W\nRecommended System Power: 550W\nPrice: \u00a3460 / $450 (other RTX 4060 Ti models start at \u00a3389 / $399) \n\nSpend a bit more and you can get a fancy partner card like this, the MSI GeForce RTX 4060 Ti Gaming X Trio. I\u2019ve used this for all the game benchmarks you\u2019ll find further down, and although it\u2019s not as cheap as the RTX 4060 Ti Founders Edition (nor as compact - I had as much trouble fitting this in my mid-tower case as the RTX 4070 Ti Gaming X Trio), it does include a wonderfully quiet triple-fan cooler. And it doesn\u2019t at all compromise one of the RTX 4060 Ti\u2019s less visible strengths: outstanding efficiency.\nThe GPU\u2019s power usage maxes out at just 160W, 40W less than the RTX 3060 Ti despite being a more prolific producer of frames per second. And when playing games, you\u2019re likely to be using even less, so while the RTX 4060 Ti isn\u2019t any cheaper to buy than its processor, it will be more economical in the long run. It should make upgrading from an old system with a small, sub-600W PSU easier as well. Even this customised MSI model needs just a single eight-pin power connector, and as someone that\u2019s spent probably too much of his life down on his knees, painstakingly inserting up to four plugs into the bulky, sometimes melty adapters that higher-end Nvidia cards now use, this was a welcome change.\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti review: 1440p benchmarks\nGranted, the general performance difference between the RTX 4060 Ti and RTX 3060 Ti isn\u2019t as sweeping. It\u2019s a decent upgrade, to be sure, but at native 1440p the new GPU never truly gets out of sight. Outside of Horizon Zero Dawn and Watch Dogs Legion, the RTX 4060 Ti rarely looks like upsetting the pricier RTX 4070 as well.\n(I\u2019ve changed our benchmarking games a bit since the last time we had the 30 series GPUs to hand, so please excuse any absences...)\n\n\n \nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun\n\n\n\n \nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun\n\nThe RPS test PC:\n\nCPU: Intel Core i5-11600K\nRAM: 16GB Corsair Vengeance LPX\nMotherboard: Asus TUF Gaming Z590-Plus WiFi\nPSU: NZXT C1000 Gold\n\nStill, there are good signs here . The RTX 4060 Ti is much better than the RTX 3060 Ti at clearing the 60fps threshold, which makes a difference when you have a high-refresh-rate gaming monitor. And if you like to bring a calculator to your graphics card shopping trips, you\u2019ve probably already clocked that performance-per-watt is going to be drastically superior than on the thirstier RTX 3060 Ti.\nBoth GPUs can use Nvidia DLSS to give themselves a boost in supporting games, but the RTX 4060 Ti also has the advantage of DLSS 3 and its frame generation feature. This lets it ramp up framerates far beyond what you could get with upscaling alone: in F1 22, for example, that 62fps average became 121fps with both Quality-level upscaling and AI frame generation. Simply enabling Upscaling would bump it up to 92fps, while non-upscaled frame generation would get it to 94fps, but the two together can produce framerates even higher above the RTX 3060 Ti's abilities.\n\n\n \nI didn't break out the decibel-o-meter this time, but I'm fairly sure my monitors were louder than this triple-fan cooler.Image credit: Rock Paper Shotgun\n\nDLSS 3 also allows the RTX 4060 Ti to avail itself of some of the most intensive ray tracing features around. Cyberpunk 2077, running at 1440p with Ultra quality and Psycho RT effects, only averaged 24fps at native res \u2013 but with Quality DLSS and frame generation, that becomes 65fps. And while the AI-generated frames don\u2019t make games 'feel' smoother, as true, rendered frames would, these settings still handle well as the upscaling component is raising rendered frame output from 24fps to 46fps on average.\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti review: 1080p benchmarks\nThis upscaling flexibility helps make the RTX 4060 Ti a perfectly capable 1440p card, though if you\u2019re more into speed than pixel density, you could deploy it as a powerful 1080p engine. If your CPU is on a similar level to our test PC\u2019s Intel Core i5-11600K, you might find gaming performance sometimes comes close to that of the high-end RTX 4070 and RTX 4070 Ti, which is about as positive a spin on bottlenecking that I can think up.\n\n\n \nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun\n\n\n\n \nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun\n\nAt the same time, native performance still doesn\u2019t make great strides ahead of the RTX 3060 Ti \u2013 with the exception of a very good Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla result, and perhaps that of Total War: Three Kingdoms as well. Metro Exodus only benefits to the tune of 11fps, and you\u2019d need to invest in a more powerful CPU to separate the two in Final Fantasy XV.\nAgain, it\u2019s up to DLSS 3 to truly make the RTX 4060 Ti feel like a next-gen graphics card. Which, in fairness, it does: Cyberpunk 2077, on Ultra quality with Psycho ray tracing, jumped from 41fps to 65fps with the sole addition of frame generation. That\u2019s impressive as it is, and the same settings can go all the way to 113fps with Quality upscaling as well \u2013 though this is less advisable than at 1440p, as the drop in sharpness becomes more noticeable.\n\n\n \nAt 338mm long, this Gaming X Trio version has an extra 94mm on the Founders Edition. | Image credit: Rock Paper Shotgun\n\nF1 22 ran smoothly without the AI-powered bells and whistles, averaging 92fps with Ultra settings and basic TAA, but this too shot up to 139fps with non-upscaled frame generation. This really is a marvellous feature, and I\u2019m glad that the less costly RTX 40 GPUs are getting it alongside the more premium models. \nThe only problem is that we\u2019re still in the early days of DLSS 3 support. I count 30 currently-available games with a working implementation (31 once The Lord of the Rings: Gollum releases later this week), so as good as it is, the amount of value you\u2019ll extract from frame generation directly correlates with how much of your library overlaps with this very small collection. \n\n\n \nNo surprises on the output panel. | Image credit: Rock Paper Shotgun\n\nYou could think of the RTX 4060 Ti as an investment in the future, when its trump card can be played more readily, but as it stands\u2026 you probably shouldn\u2019t upgrade to it if you already have a decent RTX 30 series card, including the RTX 3060 Ti. In most games, which don\u2019t even have ye olde DLSS 2 support, the performance difference just isn\u2019t going to be what you\u2019d want from a generational replacement.\nOn the other hand, if you\u2019re coming from an older GPU, like the RTX 2060 or even a Radeon RX 5700, the RTX 4060 Ti is easily the better choice for superfast 1080p and 60fps 1440p. It\u2019s not meaningfully more expensive than the RTX 3060 Ti, ultimately still is faster in general, uses much less power, and has a better-equipped toolbox for making extra FPS gains. We can grumble about deltas until the Sun burns out but in this case, an upgrade is an upgrade, especially when it\u2019s being spared from the usual price rise.\n\nThis review is based on a retail unit provided by MSI.\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n          \n\n\n\n            Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n          \n\n\n\n            In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nJames Archer: James had previously hung around beneath the RPS treehouse as a freelancer, before being told to drop the pine cones and climb up to become hardware editor.

Watts Down \u2014 More Science, Less Energy\n\n\n\t\t\t\tApplications on one of the world\u2019s largest supercomputers demonstrate NVIDIA GPUs lead in energy efficiency.\t\t\t\n\n\nMay 21, 2023 by Dion Harris \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  People agree: accelerated computing is energy-efficient computing.\nThe National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s lead facility for open science, measured results across four of its key high performance computing and AI applications.\nThey clocked how fast the applications ran and how much energy they consumed on CPU-only and GPU-accelerated nodes on Perlmutter, one of the world\u2019s largest supercomputers using NVIDIA GPUs.\nThe results were clear. Accelerated with NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, energy efficiency\u00a0rose 5x on average. An application for weather forecasting logged gains of 9.8x.\nGPUs Save Megawatts\nOn a server with four A100 GPUs, NERSC got up to 12x speedups over a dual-socket x86 server.\nThat means, at the same performance level, the GPU-accelerated system would consume 588 megawatt-hours less energy per month than a CPU-only system. Running the same workload on a four-way NVIDIA A100 cloud instance for a month, researchers could save more than $4 million compared to a CPU-only instance.\nMeasuring Real-World Applications\nThe results are significant because they\u2019re based on measurements of real-world applications, not synthetic benchmarks.\nThe gains mean that the 8,000+ scientists using Perlmutter can tackle bigger challenges, opening the door to more breakthroughs.\nAmong the many use cases for the more than 7,100 A100 GPUs on Perlmutter, scientists are probing subatomic interactions to find new green energy sources.\nAdvancing Science at Every Scale\nThe applications NERSC tested span molecular dynamics, material science and weather forecasting.\nFor example, MILC simulates the fundamental forces that hold particles together in an atom. It\u2019s used to advance quantum computing, study dark matter and search for the origins of the universe.\nBerkeleyGW helps simulate and predict optical properties of materials and nanostructures, a key step toward developing more efficient batteries and electronic devices.\nNERSC apps get efficiency gains with accelerated computing.\nEXAALT, which got an 8.5x efficiency gain on A100 GPUs, solves a fundamental challenge in molecular dynamics. It lets researchers simulate the equivalent of short videos of atomic movements rather than the sequences of snapshots other tools provide.\nThe fourth application in the tests, DeepCAM, is used to detect hurricanes and atmospheric rivers in climate data. It got a 9.8x gain in energy efficiency when accelerated with A100 GPUs.\nThe overall 5x speedup is based on a mix of HPC and AI applications.\nSavings With Accelerated Computing\nThe NERSC results echo earlier calculations of the potential savings with accelerated computing. For example, in a separate analysis NVIDIA conducted, GPUs delivered 42x better energy efficiency on AI inference than CPUs.\nThat means switching all the CPU-only servers running AI worldwide to GPU-accelerated systems could save a whopping 10 trillion watt-hours of energy a year. That\u2019s like saving the energy 1.4 million homes consume in a year.\nAccelerating the Enterprise\nYou don\u2019t have to be a scientist to get gains in energy efficiency with accelerated computing.\nPharmaceutical companies are using GPU-accelerated simulation and AI to speed the process of drug discovery. Carmakers like BMW Group are using it to model entire factories.\nThey\u2019re among the growing ranks of enterprises at the forefront of what NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang calls an industrial HPC revolution, fueled by accelerated computing and AI.\nDiscover how AI is powering the future of clean energy.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | Energy | Events | GPU | GPU Computing | Hardware | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | NVIDIA A100 | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture | Science | Social Impact | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

AFP via Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\n\nShares of Nvidia rose 4% in early trading, representing a one-day gain of $40 billion and pushing the chipmaker's market value to a hair over $1 trillion.\n\n\n\nNvidia is now the sixth public company in the world valued at over $1 trillion, joining Apple, Saudi Aramco, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon; the only other companies to ever cross the threshold are Tesla and Meta, which are each valued at less than $700 billion today, and Chinese oil giant PetroChina.\n\n\n\nJoining the $1 trillion club follows a dramatic rise thus far in 2023, with Nvidia's stock up more than 175% as Wall Street analysts say the Palo Alto-based company could be the firm best-positioned to profit off of the AI boom.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Background\nNvidia\u2019s stock surged more than 10% following each of its earnings reports this year as investors\u2019 imaginations for the company ran wild. The firm, which makes the chips powering generative AI computing in addition to a variety of software and hardware products, said last week it anticipates profits to be twice as high as expected during the current quarter thanks to AI-related sales. The stock\u2019s dramatic rally year-to-date headlines a strong return for other mega-cap tech stocks, with each of Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Tesla up 25% or more in 2023.\nCrucial Quote\nGenerative AI marks a \u201ca paradigm shift now translating into material early revenue for the leader in AI compute,\u201d Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay wrote to clients Thursday, referring to Nvidia.\nForbes Valuation\nNvidia\u2019s cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang is worth an estimated $36 billion, making him the 34th-richest person in the world. Huang was the world\u2019s 76th-richest person just two months ago, when he held a $21.1 billion fortune.\n\nWhat To Watch For\nNvidia is now worth just $250 billion less than Amazon, a dramatic swing from last fall, when Nvidia was worth roughly $850 billion less than its fellow tech titan. In a note to clients last week, Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann set a price target for Nvidia\u2019s stock which implied a nearly $1.5 trillion market cap for Nvidia. That would top Amazon and fall just shy of Alphabet.\n\nFurther Reading\nBigger Than Amazon?

[+] Santa Clara, California. Nvidia Corporation will report first quarter earnings today after the closing bell.  (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s earnings report estimated $11 billion in sales for the second quarter, more than 50% higher than analysts\u2019 predictions\u2014it also reported $7.19 billion in revenue in the first quarter, $67 million higher than expected and up 19% from the previous quarter.\n\n\n\nAccording to Reuters, the company\u2019s shares have risen over 160% this year, adding $586 billion in market value and making it the fifth most valuable U.S. company.\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s market capital is closing in on $1 trillion, a feat that only five other companies have accomplished: Apple, Amazon, Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet, Microsoft and Saudi Aramco\n\n\n\nThe company creates graphics processing units (GPU), and it\u2019s estimated Nvidia owns 95% of that market.\n\n\n\n\nKey Background\nNvidia was founded in 1993 and had its start making video game GPUs, which are cards gamers typically plug into computers to help handle graphics-related tasks, like effects and videos. However, it was discovered GPUs can also be used in deep learning AI. Deep learning is a component of AI that teaches computers to process data in a complex way inspired by how the human brain works. This includes recognizing intricate patterns, sounds, pictures, text and other data to create accurate insights and predictions. Soon, tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft began buying Nvidia\u2019s chips for their processing data, and institutions like Massachusetts General Hospital started using Nvidia chips to spot anomalies in medical images like CT scans. Tesla even unveiled its supercomputer that uses Nvidia\u2019s chips to power its autonomous vehicles in 2021. On Wednesday, Nvidia revealed a new class of GPUs that reportedly run at twice the speed of the previous ones. This, along with the company\u2019s impressive market performance, led Bank of America analysts to call Nvidia an \u201cunquestionable AI leader\u201d in a recent report.\nThe Ai Boom\nOpenAI\u2019s launch of its chatbot ChatGPT in November 2022 sparked the recent generative AI boom. Generative AI are algorithms that can be used to create new content, like images, text, videos and audio. Since ChatGPT's launch, many companies have joined the chatbot craze, including Google, Snap and more recently, TikTok with its chatbot Tako. GPUs play an important role in generative AI by helping to accelerate the training of models and enabling them to learn from larger datasets. In March, Google announced the continuation of its partnership with Nvidia to provide GPUs to organizations who don\u2019t have the access to build generative AI models. Elon Musk has even reportedly purchased thousands of GPUs to run a new generative AI project in April, according to Insider, though the source of the GPUs is unknown.\n\nCrucial Quote\nBank of America analyst Vivek Arya says the company\u2019s guidance amounts were clearly \u201cdriven by the start of major data center investments in generative AI and large language models.\u201d\nBig Number\n$34.7 billion. That\u2019s how much Forbes estimates Jensen Huang, co-founder and CEO of Nvidia is worth following Thursday\u2019s rise of the company\u2019s share price. This places Huang as the 36th-wealthiest person in the world, according to Forbes\u2019 data.\n\nFurther Reading\nBigger Than Amazon?

AI tools made up the vast bulk of recent Google I/O and Microsoft Build presentations, and Nvidia\u2019s chips make it a key supplier for companies trying to build something with AI.Its valuation pushed past the trillion-dollar benchmark as trading opened today at just over $405 per share, putting it in the rarified air previously occupied by only a few large companies such as Apple and Microsoft after they surpassed the significant mark in August 2018 and August 2019, respectively. Amazon and Google are the other tech stocks in the club, and Meta is a former member.When the market closed on Monday, the share price had fallen back to $401.11 after peaking at about $419. That gives Nvidia\u2019s stock a value of \u201cjust\u201d $992 billion or so, taking it out of the $1 trillion club, for now.The last quarterly earnings report from Nvidia noted over $2 billion in profit in three months. This latest push comes after Nvidia\u2019s business boomed early in the pandemic during a GPU shortage while they were in demand for PC gaming and cryptocurrency mining before those markets fell back throughout 2022.RelatedNvidia and Microsoft team up to build \u2018massive\u2019 AI supercomputer2016: Nvidia bets big on AI with powerful new chip2017: The demand for AI is helping Nvidia and AMD leapfrog IntelComputex 2023: all the news from Taiwan\u2019s big PC showLast fall, CEO Jensen Huang said it had built too many gaming GPUs and was forced to sell them for less money. However, by the time of Nvidia\u2019s next report in February, with ChatGPT all over the news, the outlook was more promising as Huang hyped the potential of Nvidia\u2019s data center growth, and the most recent report showed a new record in data center revenue.Over the weekend, Nvidia\u2019s Computex 2023 keynote was full of AI announcements, including a demo of games using its Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) for Games to support natural language both for input and responses and a new DGX GH200 supercomputer built around its latest Grace Hopper Superchip that\u2019s collectively capable of an exaflop of AI performance.Nvidia\u2019s stock price shown opening at over $400 per share, bringing the company\u2019s overall valuation beyond $1 trillion for the first time.

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.At Computex 2023 in Taipei, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang just gave the world a glimpse of what it might be like when gaming and AI collide \u2014 with a graphically breathtaking rendering of a cyberpunk ramen shop where you can actually talk to the proprietor.Seriously, instead of clicking on dialogue options, it imagines you could hold down a button, just say something with your own voice, and get an answer from a video game character. Nvidia\u2019s calling it a \u201cpeek at the future of games.\u201dUnfortunately, the actual dialogue leaves a lot to be desired \u2014 maybe try GPT-4 or Sudowrite next time, Nvidia?Here\u2019s the entire conversation I hastily transcribed:Player: Hey Jin, how are you?Jin: Unfortunately not so good.How come?I am worried about the crime around here. It\u2019s gotten bad lately. My ramen shop got caught in the crossfire.Can I help?If you want to do something about this, I have heard rumors that the powerful crime lord Kumon Aoki is causing all kinds of chaos in the city. He may be the root of this violence.I\u2019ll talk to him, where can I find him?I have heard he hangs out in the underground fight clubs on the city\u2019s east side. Try there.OK, I\u2019ll go.Be careful, Kai.Watching a single video of a single conversation, it\u2019s hard to see how this is any better than picking from a NPC dialogue tree \u2014 but the impressive part is that the generative AI is reacting to natural speech. Hopefully Nvidia will release the demo so we can try it ourselves and get some radically different outcomes.Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The VergeThe demo was built by Nvidia and partner Convai to help promote the tools that were used to create it \u2014 specifically a suite of middleware called Nvidia ACE (Avatar Cloud Engine) for Games that can run both locally and in the cloud. The entire ACE suite includes the company\u2019s NeMo tools for deploying large language models (LLMs), Riva speech-to-text and text-to-speech, among other bits.The demo uses more than just those, of course \u2014 it\u2019s built in Unreal Engine 5 with loads of ray-tracing... and it\u2019s visually stunning to the point that the chatbot part feels lackluster to me by comparison. At this point, we\u2019ve simply seen much more compelling dialogue from chatbots, even as trite and derivative as they can sometimes be.Click for larger screenshot. Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The VergeIn a Computex pre-briefing, Nvidia VP of GeForce Platform Jason Paul told me that yes, the tech can scale to more than one character at a time and could theoretically even let NPCs talk to each other \u2014 but admitted that he hadn\u2019t actually seen that tested.It\u2019s not clear if any developer will embrace the entire ACE toolkit the way the demo attempts, but S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Heart of Chernobyl and Fort Solis will use the part Nvidia calls \u201cOmniverse Audio2Face,\u201d which tries to match facial animation of a 3D character to their voice actor\u2019s speech.Correction, 11:25PM ET: It was Nvidia\u2019s Jason Paul, not Rev Lebaredian, who answered my question. I regret the error.

The HUD then presents information including the current temperature, humidity, altitude and GPS location. It can also classify what\u2019s in the user\u2019s view based on deep neural networks for object detection.\nTo let others join in on the fun, Kersey shared his entire workflow on his popular YouTube channel, Kersey Fabrications.\n\nSuperhero films and science fiction remind Kersey that cutting-edge technology requires collaboration across disciplines, he said.\n\u201cOften, as with this project, artists and storytellers use their imaginations to come up with brilliant ideas \u2014 then, it\u2019s up to scientists and engineers to make them real,\u201d the developer said.\n\nAbout the Maker\nKersey, who studied computer science at Southern Polytechnic State University \u2014 now part of Kennesaw State University \u2014 in Georgia, has broad experience working with embedded microprocessors and architectures. He specializes in the Linux operating system, which is compatible with the NVIDIA Jetson platform.\n\u201cWriting software on the Jetson platform didn\u2019t require that I learn a new programming language or operating system, which made it very easy for me,\u201d the maker said.\nBy day, he\u2019s a software engineer at an Atlanta-based startup. By night, he\u2019s working on projects in his personal makerspace.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never used my garage for cars,\u201d he said.\nInstead, it\u2019s full of tools, boards and other equipment that enable his marvelous projects.\nKersey emphasized that what\u2019s important to him most of all, however, is his family, with whom he likes to play board games, watch movies and go on hikes.\nHis Inspiration\nKersey\u2019s fascination with technology stemmed from his childhood. His mother was a teacher focused on computer-aided drafting and mechanical design.\n\u201cFrom a very early age, I could tinker with computers that she had access to, which always fascinated me,\u201d he said. \u201cMy cousin also once gave me an old 8-bit computer, but there wasn\u2019t much I could do with it, so I remember pulling out the manual and reading the whole thing \u2014 that taught me basic programming.\u201d\nMore recently, Kersey got into 3D printing while helping his son with a project for Science Olympiad.\n\u201cFrom that moment on, I got really into 3D printing as a hobby \u2014 my son never really took to it a whole lot,\u201d he mused.\nIn 2018, Kersey created his YouTube channel with a focus on 3D printing as a way to delve deeper into the maker community while teaching others what he\u2019s learned along the way.\nA Jetson-Powered Superhero Project\nKersey\u2019s 3D-printed, fully functional, wireless Iron Man helmet \u2014 which he even sanded and painted himself \u2014 could be straight out of the iconic films.\n\nThe prototype used the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX developer kit as the core powering its HUD.\n\u201cFor this whole experience to feel as awesome as Iron Man\u2019s tech, it has to be real time, low latency, high resolution and high frame rate,\u201d Kersey said. \u201cIt also needs to display a lot of information on screen, which requires a powerful graphics processor \u2014 that\u2019s why I chose the Jetson platform.\u201d\nJetson developer kits are equipped with a powerful, onboard NVIDIA GPU and AI capabilities to supercharge embedded applications.\nKersey also tapped the NVIDIA TensorRT software development kit to enable high-performance deep-learning inference with low latency and high throughput for the project.\nFor the next generation of the helmet\u2019s HUD \u2014 a project that\u2019s \u201cnot finished till it\u2019s finished,\u201d according to the maker \u2014 Kersey used the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano developer kit. Launched in September, the kit has set a new standard for creating entry-level AI-powered robots, intelligent cameras and more.\nIt only took Kersey two hours to get from opening the Orin Nano box to having the software deployed and running, he said.\n\nHe\u2019s now looking to upgrade the project with the Jetson Orin NX 16GB system-on-module, as well as build a full suit beyond the headgear, starting with prototype aluminum repulsors.\nAnd the developer will soon make the project\u2019s code open source, so others can easily turn themselves into superheroes, too.\n\nKersey plans to wear the upgraded superhero gear at Dragon Con \u2014 the world\u2019s largest multimedia, popular culture convention \u2014 taking place in August. Plus, at this month\u2019s MomoCon in Atlanta, he\u2019ll present on a panel titled Making It Real: High Tech in Cosplay.\nAsked if Iron Man is his favorite superhero, Kersey said with a smile: \u201cHe is right now.\u201d\nCheck out Kersey Fabrications on YouTube and learn more about the NVIDIA Jetson platform.\n\n\nCategories: Inner Geek | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | Embedded Computing | Jetson | Machine Learning | Open Source | TensorRT \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They\u2019re focused on developing next-generation, in-vehicle computing systems that will power a wide range of vehicles, including the future models of Mercedes-Benz and Jaguar Land Rover.\n\u201cNVIDIA is developing a unified platform that does it all: We\u2019re specifying the sensors plus creating the hardware and software needed to drive passengers safely from point A to B,\u201d Tariq said. \u201cOur system, referred to as NDAS, is integrating standard features including emergency braking, lane keeping and parking assistance together with higher-level software for autonomously navigating urban traffic, including safely navigating complex intersections and interactions with other road users including pedestrians and bicyclists.\u201d\nTariq (right) and members of her team in NVIDIA\u2019s autonomous vehicle garage in Silicon Valley.\nRamping Up: From Intern to VP\nAfter finishing her undergrad studies back home, Tariq moved to the U.S. for her master\u2019s in computer science. Soon after starting a Ph.D. program in 2005 at Georgia Tech, focused on computer vision and computer graphics, she came to NVIDIA as an engineering intern working on graphics for gaming.\n\u201cI came for a couple months, and ended up staying for nearly a decade,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the time, I felt that whatever I could do in grad school, I could do it better at NVIDIA, where I had access to much more information and resources.\u201d\nOver nine years, Tariq worked as a software engineer on NVIDIA\u2019s developer technology team \u2014 collaborating with external developers to optimize video game performance, implementing real-time rendering of fluid and hair in games, and accelerating molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry algorithms on supercomputers.\nShe then shifted gears to the automotive team and NVIDIA DRIVE, where she was the technical lead on a self-parking project.\nTariq then spent six years at Zoox \u2014 an AV startup later acquired by Amazon \u2014 developing perception for robotaxis and leading the overall improvement of driving quality. She returned to NVIDIA in 2021 to lead autonomous driving software development.\n\u201cThere are so many groundbreaking and meaningful initiatives we\u2019re working on at NVIDIA \u2014 it\u2019s an amazing aspect of the company,\u201d she said. \u201cEngineers can apply the knowledge of accelerated computing to any field they want to make an impact in.\u201d\nBuilding a Fleet of Top Talent\nOne of Tariq\u2019s goals is to build an inclusive team where members feel supported and empowered to do their life\u2019s work. On a trip to Germany last year to support our collaboration with an auto partner, Tariq was heartened to discover that the team of NVIDIANs taking a test drive were all women.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t try to stage that at all \u2014 it just ended up that all these great, capable women were the right people to send on that mission,\u201d Tariq said. \u201cIt was such a contrast to back when I was studying and would be the only woman in a group of 50.\u201d\nNVIDIA team in one of our test autonomous vehicles.\nRacing Toward Autonomy\u00a0\nTariq looks forward to the NVIDIA-powered vehicles that will hit the road in the coming years \u2014 and the significant positive impact the technology could have on people\u2019s lives.\n\u201cAutonomous driving is rapidly evolving and full of interesting technical challenges,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter having worked in and seen the industry from many angles, I believe the best way to make the promise of autonomous driving a reality is the way NVIDIA\u2019s approaching it \u2014 by creating groundbreaking hardware and software for autonomy that can efficiently be deployed on large-scale consumer cars, and software that continues to learn and improve using the data it sees worldwide.\u201d\nLearn more about NVIDIA\u2019s work in autonomous driving through the DRIVE Labs YouTube video series.\n\n\nCategories: Driving | NVIDIA LifeTags: Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The company said it was raising production of chips to meet \"surging demand\".Nvidia has come to dominate the market for chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) systems.Interest in that sector reached frenzied levels after ChatGPT went public last November, which sent a jolt well beyond the technology industry.From helping with speeches, to computer coding and cooking, ChatGPT has proved to be a wildly popular application of AI.What is ChatGPT?What is AI and is it dangerous?But all that would not be possible without powerful computer hardware - in particular computer chips from California-based Nvidia.Originally known for making the type of computer chips that process graphics, particularly for computer games, Nvidia hardware underpins most AI applications today.\"It is the leading technology player enabling this new thing called artificial intelligence,\" says Alan Priestley, a semiconductor industry analyst at Gartner.\"What Nvidia is to AI is almost like what Intel was to PCs,\" adds Dan Hutcheson, an analyst at TechInsights.ChatGPT was trained using 10,000 of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) clustered together in a supercomputer belonging to Microsoft.NvidiaThe widely used A100 GPU costs upwards of $10,000\"It is one of many supercomputers - some known publicly, some not - that have been built with Nvidia GPUs for a variety of scientific as well as AI use cases,\" says Ian Buck, general manager and vice president of accelerated computing at Nvidia.Nvidia has about 95% of the GPU market for machine learning, noted a recent report from CB Insights. Its AI chips, which it also sells in systems designed for data centres, cost roughly $10,000 (\u00a38,000) each, though its latest and most powerful version sells for far more.So how did Nvidia become such a central player in the AI revolution? In short, a bold bet on its own technology plus some good timing.NvidiaIn 2006 Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang made the company's chips programmableJensen Huang, now the chief executive of Nvidia, was one of its founders back in 1993. Then, Nvidia was focused on making graphics better for gaming and other applications.In 1999 it developed GPUs to enhance image display for computers.GPUs excel at processing many small tasks simultaneously (for example handling millions of pixels on a screen) - a procedure known as parallel processing.In 2006, researchers at Stanford University discovered GPUs had another use - they could accelerate maths operations, in a way that regular processing chips could not.It was at that moment that Mr Huang took a decision crucial to the development of AI as we know it.He invested Nvidia's resources in creating a tool to make GPUs programmable, thereby opening up their parallel processing capabilities for uses beyond graphics.That tool was added to Nvida's computer chips. For computer games players it was a capability they didn't need, and probably weren't even aware of, but for researchers it was a new way of doing high performance computing on consumer hardware.It was that capability that helped sparked early breakthroughs in modern AI.In 2012 Alexnet was unveiled - an AI that could classify images. Alexnet was trained using just two of Nvidia's programmable GPUs.The training process took only a few days, rather than the months it could have taken on a much larger number of regular processing chips.The discovery - that GPUs could massively accelerate neural network processing - began to spread among computer scientists, who started buying them to run this new type of workload.\"AI found us,\" says Mr Buck. Nvidia pressed its advantage by investing in developing new kinds of GPUs more suited to AI, as well as more software to make it easy to use the technology.A decade, and billions of dollars later, ChatGPT emerged - an AI that can give eerily human responses to questions. MetaphysicIn 2021 Metaphysic made headlines with its Tom Cruise deep fakesAI start-up Metaphysic creates photorealistic videos of celebrities and others using AI techniques. Its Tom Cruise deep fakes created a stir in 2021.To both train and then run its models it uses hundreds of Nvidia GPUs, some purchased from Nvidia and others accessed through a cloud computing service. \"There are no alternatives to Nvidia for doing what we do,\" says Tom Graham, its co-founder and chief executive. \"It is so far ahead of the curve.\"Yet while Nvidia's dominance looks assured for now, the longer term is harder to predict. \"Nvidia is the one with the target on its back that everybody is trying to take down,\" notes Kevin Krewell, another industry analyst at TIRIAS Research.  Other big semiconductor companies provide some competition. AMD and Intel are both better known for making central processing units (CPUs), but they also make dedicated GPUs for AI applications (Intel only recently joined the fray).Google has its tensor processing units (TPUs), used not only for search results but also for certain machine-learning tasks, while Amazon has a custom-built chip for training AI models.Microsoft is also reportedly developing an AI chip, and Meta has its own AI chip project.More technology of business:Why car parks are the hottest space in solar powerProtein's power is being uncovered and unleashedHow computer games encourage kids to spend cashThe tech entrepreneur betting he can get youngerThe remote Swedish town leading the green steel raceIn addition, for the first time in decades, there are also computer chip start-ups emerging, including Cerebras, SambaNova Systems and Habana (bought by Intel). They are intent on making better alternatives to GPUs for AI by starting from a clean slate. UK-based Graphcore makes general purpose AI chips it calls intelligence processing units (IPUs), which it says have more computational power and are cheaper than GPUs.Founded in 2016, Graphcore has received almost $700m (\u00a3560m) in funding.Its customers include four US Department of Energy national labs and it has been pressing the UK government to use its chips in a new supercomputer project. \"[Graphcore] has built a processor to do AI as it exists today and as it will evolve over time,\" says Nigel Toon, the company's co-founder and chief executive.He acknowledges going up against a giant like Nvidia is challenging. While Graphcore too has software to make its technology accessible, it is hard to orchestrate a switch when the world has built its AI products to run on Nvidia GPUs. Mr Toon hopes that over time, as AI moves away from cutting-edge experimentation to commercial deployment, cost-efficient computation will start to become more important.Back at Nvidia, Ian Buck is not overly concerned about the competition. \"Everyone has the need for AI now,\" he says. \"It is up to others to work out where they are going to make a contribution.\"Artificial intelligenceNvidiaRelatedJazz great Herbie Hancock on playing with Miles Davis, AI, and why the piano makes him cry13 hrs agoCultureMarket alters application rules after AI complaints1 day agoEnglandAI offers 'generational opportunity' for schools2 days agoStoke & StaffordshireMore27 Feb 2025Nvidia says AI chip sales strong despite DeepSeek fearsBoss Jensen Huang responds to concerns about an AI bubble sparked by Chinese firm DeepSeek. 27 Feb 202528 Jan 2025US tech stocks steady after DeepSeek AI app shockDeepSeek's claim that its model was made at a fraction of the cost of its rivals has rocked the AI industry.28 Jan 2025Business7 Jan 2025Nvidia unveils robot ambitions and powerful new gaming chipsThe announcement was part of Mr Huang's address at CES, an annual technology show in Las Vegas.7 Jan 2025Business9 Dec 2024Nvidia targeted by China in new chip war probeThe investigation follows a US decision to further restrict sales to chip equipment makers in China.9 Dec 2024Business29 Aug 2024AI chip giant Nvidia shares fall despite record salesThe California-based technology giant has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom.29 Aug 2024BusinessBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.

And rounding out the family is the GeForce RTX 4060, a high-performing 1080p card also available in July that starts at just $299.\nThe NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture offers a substantial upgrade, enabling you to supercharge your performance in the latest games and creative apps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RTX 4060 Ti is up to 2.6X faster than the RTX 2060 SUPER with Frame Generation, and 1.6X without Frame Generation, thanks to the Ada architecture, Shader Execution Reordering, NVIDIA DLSS 3 and other innovations. Together, they enable the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti to run many of today\u2019s graphically advanced games at over 100 FPS with ray tracing enabled:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GeForce RTX 4060 Ti includes all the same advancements, enhancements, and innovations as other GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards, granting you access to a massive ecosystem of technologies and features that improve your gaming experiences, productivity, and creativity. And like other GeForce RTX 40 Series cards, it\u2019s highly efficient when gaming, and sips power when idling, chatting, or streaming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, 4 out of the 5 most popular GPUs are GeForce 60-class products, and 77% of gamers play at 1080p or lower resolutions. If you\u2019re one of these gamers, the GeForce RTX 4060 Family is a great upgrade, enabling you to enjoy the latest games with fast, fluid frame rates. Reviews agree:\n\n\u201c...we would fully recommend the RTX 4060 Ti for a high-end 1080p gaming PC\u201d - PCMag\n\u201cThis GPU excels at 1080p, attaining triple-digit performance.\u201d - Dexerto\n\u201cIt's a great 1080p performer that punches well above its weight class even before you enable the black magic that is DLSS 3 in games that support the feature.\u201d - MMORPG.com\n\u201c\u2026the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti is remarkably efficient while remaining cool and quiet.\u201d - TweakTown\n\"... for anyone that didn't dip their toes into either the RTX 30 or RX 6000-series, the RTX 4060 Ti is going to represent a great mid-range upgrade. Bringing with it the twin pillars of DLSS 3 and Frame Generation, it has the potential to deliver a gaming experience that feels truly next-gen.\" - PC Gamer\n\nFor a complete rundown of the GeForce RTX 4060 Family\u2019s capabilities and features, please check out our comprehensive announcement article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For The Lord of the Rings: Gollum\u2122\nBased on the books by J. R. R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum\u2122 is a story-driven stealth adventure game from Daedalic Entertainment, creators of Deponia and many other highly regarded titles. Take on a perilous journey as the deformed and twisted Gollum, chasing the only thing that\u2019s precious to him: the One Ring. Available May 25th, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum\u2122 launches with support for DLSS 3, NVIDIA DLAA, NVIDIA Reflex, and ray-traced shadows and reflections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn The Lord of the Rings: Gollum\u2122, GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers can multiply performance with DLSS 3. At 4K, performance on the GeForce RTX 4090 increases by 3.5X, enabling 169 frames per second with every setting maxed out, and all ray tracing options enabled. The GeForce RTX 4080 can hit 123 FPS, a 3.8X increase; the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti sees a 3.9X speedup, for 100 FPS gameplay; the GeForce RTX 4070 receives a 3.8X boost, giving it a 79 FPS result in our benchmark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn GeForce RTX 40 Series laptops, DLSS 3 improves performance by an average of 2.5X at 2560x1440 with max settings and ray tracing enabled. At 1080p, DLSS 3 helps all RTX 40 Series laptop GPUs to run at over 90 FPS, with the flagship GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU topping 200 FPS!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith such fast frame rates on many GPUs, you may want to enhance image quality with NVIDIA DLAA, an AI-based anti-aliasing mode that utilizes the same technology developed for DLSS. DLAA uses a native resolution image to maximize image quality, and in The Lord of the Rings: Gollum\u2122 DLAA can be combined with DLSS Frame Generation for great image quality and excellent performance. \u00a0\nTo make gameplay even more responsive, gamers with GeForce RTX or GeForce GTX 900 Series and newer GPUs can enable NVIDIA Reflex. This reduces system latency so your actions occur quicker, making single-player titles more responsive and enjoyable, and increasing your competitiveness in multiplayer matches. In The Lord of the Rings: Gollum\u2122, with Reflex activated, system latency is reduced by up to 56%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to experience The Lord of the Rings: Gollum\u2122 with all the bells and whistles, or just want to know how it\u2019ll perform on your system, here are the official PC system requirements, featuring resolution, preset and frame rate info:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: Gollum\u2122 launches May 25th.

Researchers imagine dexterous mobile robots helping people in factories, warehouses, disaster sites and eventually homes.\n\u201cOne thing I\u2019ve dreamed about since I was in grad school is a robot valet who can follow me and do useful tasks \u2014 everyone should have one,\u201d said Al Rizzi, CTO of The AI Institute.\nThat will require breakthroughs in AI and robotics, something Rizzi has seen firsthand. As chief scientist at Boston Dynamics, he helped create robots like Spot, a quadruped that can navigate stairs and even open doors for itself.\nInitially, the DGX H100 will tackle tasks in reinforcement learning, a key technique in robotics. Later, it will run AI inference jobs while connected directly to prototype bots in the lab.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extremely high-performance computer in a relatively compact footprint, so it provides an easy way for us to develop and deploy AI models,\u201d said Rizzi.\nBorn to Run Gen AI\nYou don\u2019t have to be a world-class research outfit or Fortune 500 company to use a DGX H100. Startups are unboxing some of the first systems to ride the wave of generative AI.\nFor example, Scissero, with offices in London and New York, employs a GPT-powered chatbot to make legal processes more efficient. Its Scissero GPT can draft legal documents, generate reports and conduct legal research.\nIn Germany, DeepL will use several DGX H100 systems to expand services like translation between dozens of languages it provides for customers, including Nikkei, Japan\u2019s largest publishing company. DeepL recently released an AI writing assistant called DeepL Write.\nHere\u2019s to Your Health\nMany of the DGX H100 systems will advance healthcare and improve patient outcomes.\nIn Tokyo, DGX H100s will run simulations and AI to speed the drug discovery process as part of the Tokyo-1 supercomputer. Xeureka \u2014 a startup launched in November 2021 by Mitsui & Co. Ltd., one of Japan\u2019s largest conglomerates \u2014\u00a0 will manage the system.\nSeparately, hospitals and academic healthcare organizations in Germany, Israel and the U.S. will be among the first users of DGX H100 systems.\nLighting Up Around the Globe\nUniversities from Singapore to Sweden are plugging in DGX H100 systems for research across a range of fields.\nA DGX H100 will train large language models for Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. The KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden will use one to provide state-of-the-art computer science programs for higher education.\nAmong other use cases, Japan\u2019s CyberAgent, an internet services company, is creating smart digital ads and celebrity avatars. Telconet, a leading telecommunications provider in Ecuador, is building intelligent video analytics for safe cities and language services to support customers across Spanish dialects.\nAn Engine of AI Innovation\nEach NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU in a DGX H100 system provides on average about 6x more performance than prior GPUs. A DGX H100 packs eight of them, each with a Transformer Engine designed to accelerate generative AI models.\nThe eight H100 GPUs connect over NVIDIA NVLink to create one giant GPU. Scaling doesn\u2019t stop there: organizations can connect hundreds of DGX H100 nodes into an AI supercomputer using the 400 Gbps ultra-low latency NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand, twice the speed of prior networks.\nFueled by a Full Software Stack\nDGX H100 systems run on NVIDIA Base Command, a suite for accelerating compute, storage, and network infrastructure and optimizing AI workloads.\nThey also include NVIDIA AI Enterprise, software to accelerate data science pipelines and streamline development and deployment of generative AI, computer vision and more.\nThe DGX platform offers both high performance and efficiency. DGX H100 delivers a 2x improvement in kilowatts per petaflop over the DGX A100 generation.\nNVIDIA DGX H100 systems, DGX PODs and DGX SuperPODs are available from NVIDIA\u2019s global partners.\nManuvir Das, NVIDIA\u2019s vice president of enterprise computing, announced DGX H100 systems are shipping in a talk at MIT Technology Review\u2019s Future Compute event today.

The rate at which semiconductors become more powerful and efficient is slowing, even as demand for computing capability soars.\n\u201cAs a result, global demand for cloud computing is causing data center power consumption to skyrocket,\u201d Huang said.\nHuang said that striving for net zero while supporting the \u201cinvaluable benefits\u201d of more computing power requires a new approach.\nThe challenge is a natural fit for NVIDIA, which pioneered accelerated computing, coupling the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs with CPUs.\nThis acceleration, in turn, sparked the AI revolution. A decade ago, deep learning researchers such as Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever and Geoffrey Hinton discovered that GPUs could be cost-effective supercomputers.\nSince then, NVIDIA reinvented its computing stack for deep learning, opening up \u201cmulti trillion-dollar opportunities in robotics, autonomous vehicles and manufacturing,\u201d Huang said.\nBy offloading and accelerating compute-intensive algorithms, NVIDIA routinely speeds up applications by 10-100x while reducing power and cost by an order of magnitude, Huang explained.\nTogether, AI and accelerated computing are transforming the technology industry. \u201cWe are experiencing two simultaneous platform transitions \u2014 accelerated computing and generative AI,\u201d Huang said.\nAI, Accelerated Computing Come to Chip Manufacturing\nHuang explained that advanced chip manufacturing requires over 1,000 steps, producing features the size of a biomolecule. Each step must be nearly perfect to yield functional output.\n\u201cSophisticated computational sciences are performed at every stage to compute the features to be patterned and to do defect detection for in-line process control,\u201d Huang said. \u201cChip manufacturing is an ideal application for NVIDIA accelerated and AI computing.\u201d\nHuang outlined several examples of how NVIDIA GPUs are becoming increasingly integral to chip manufacturing.\nCompanies like IMS Nanofabrication and NuFlare build mask writers \u2014 machines that create photomasks, stencils that transfer patterns onto wafers \u2014 using electron beams. D2S builds multi-rack computing appliances for mask writers. NVIDIA GPUs accelerate the computationally demanding tasks of pattern rendering and mask process correction for these mask writers.\nSemiconductor manufacturer TSMC and equipment providers KLA and Lasertech use extreme ultraviolet light, known as EUV, and deep ultraviolet light, or DUV, for mask inspection. NVIDIA GPUs play a crucial role here, too, in processing classical physics modeling and deep learning to generate synthetic reference images and detect defects.\nKLA, Applied Materials, and Hitachi High-Tech use NVIDIA GPUs in their e-beam and optical wafer inspection and review systems.\nAnd in March, NVIDIA announced that it is working with TSMC, ASML and Synopsys to accelerate computational lithography.\nComputational lithography simulates Maxwell\u2019s equations of light behavior passing through optics and interacting with photoresists, Huang explained.\nComputational lithography is the largest computational workload in chip design and manufacturing, consuming tens of billions of CPU hours annually. Massive data centers run 24/7 to create reticles for new chips.\nIntroduced in March, NVIDIA cuLitho is a software library with optimized tools and algorithms for GPU-accelerated computational lithography.\n\u201cWe have already accelerated the processing by 50 times,\u201d Huang said. \u201cTens of thousands of CPU servers can be replaced by a few hundred NVIDIA DGX systems, reducing power and cost by an order of magnitude.\u201d\nThe savings will reduce carbon emissions or enable new algorithms to push beyond 2 nanometers, Huang said.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nWhat\u2019s the next wave of AI? Huang described a new kind of AI \u2014\u00a0 \u201cembodied AI,\u201d or intelligent systems that can understand, reason about and interact with the physical world.\nHe said examples include robotics, autonomous vehicles and even chatbots that are smarter because they understand the physical world.\nHuang offered his audience a look at NVIDIA VIMA, a multimodal embodied AI. VIMA, Huang said, can perform tasks from visual text prompts, such as \u201crearranging objects to match this scene.\u201d\nIt can learn concepts and act accordingly, such as \u201cThis is a widget,\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a thing\u201d and then \u201cPut this widget in that thing.\u201d It can also learn from demonstrations and stay within specified boundaries, Huang said.\nVIMA runs on NVIDIA AI, and its digital twin runs in NVIDIA Omniverse, a 3D development and simulation platform. Huang said that physics-informed AI could learn to emulate physics and make predictions that obey physical laws.\nResearchers are building systems that mesh information from real and virtual worlds on a vast scale.\nNVIDIA is building a digital twin of our planet, called Earth-2, which will first predict the weather, then long-range weather, and eventually climate. NVIDIA\u2019s Earth-2 team has created FourCastNet, a physics-AI model that emulates global weather patterns 50-100,000x faster.\nFourCastNet runs on NVIDIA AI, and the Earth-2 digital twin is built in NVIDIA Omniverse.\nSuch systems promise to address the greatest challenge of our time, such as the need for cheap, clean energy.\nFor example, researchers at the U.K.\u2019s Atomic Energy Authority and the University of Manchester are creating a digital twin of their fusion reactor, using physics-AI to emulate plasma physics and robotics to control the reactions and sustain the burning plasma.\nHuang said scientists could explore hypotheses by testing them in the digital twin before activating the physical reactor, improving energy yield, predictive maintenance and reducing downtime. \u201cThe reactor plasma physics-AI runs on NVIDIA AI, and its digital twin runs in NVIDIA Omniverse,\u201c Huang said.\nSuch systems hold promise for further advancements in the semiconductor industry. \u201cI look forward to physics-AI, robotics and Omniverse-based digital twins helping to advance the future of chip manufacturing,\u201d Huang said.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And often times, you can\u2019t tell which. Either way, run.\u201d\nNVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang today urged graduates of National Taiwan University to run hard to seize the unprecedented opportunities that AI will present, but embrace the inevitable failures along the way.\nWhatever you pursue, he told the 10,000 graduates of the island\u2019s premier university, do it with passion and conviction \u2014 and stay humble enough to learn the hard lessons that await.\n\u201cWhatever it is, run after it like we did. Run. Don\u2019t walk,\u201d Huang said, having swapped his signature black leather jacket for a black graduation robe, with the school\u2019s plum-blossom emblem highlighting a royal blue, white and aqua collar.\n\u201cRemember, either you are running for food; or you are running from becoming food. And often times, you can\u2019t tell which. Either way, run.\u201d\nHuang, who moved from Taiwan when he was young, recognized his parents in the audience, and shared three stories of initial failures and retreat. He called them instrumental in helping forge NVIDIA\u2019s character during its three-decade journey from a three-person gaming-graphics startup to a global AI leader worth nearly a trillion dollars.\n\u201cI was \u2026 successful \u2014 until I started NVIDIA,\u201d he said. \u201cAt NVIDIA, I experienced failures \u2014 great big ones. All humiliating and embarrassing. Many nearly doomed us.\u201d\nThe first involved a key early contract the company won to help Sega build a gaming console. Rapid changes in the industry forced NVIDIA to give up the contract in a near-death brush with bankruptcy, which Sega\u2019s leadership helped avert.\n\u201cConfronting our mistake and, with humility, asking for help saved NVIDIA,\u201d he said.\nThe second was the decision in 2007 to put CUDA into all the company\u2019s GPUs, enabling them to crunch data in addition to handling 3D graphics. It was an expensive, long-term investment that drew much criticism didn\u2019t pay off for years until the chips started being used for machine learning.\n\u201cOur market cap hovered just above a billion dollars,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe suffered many years of poor performance. Our shareholders were skeptical of CUDA and preferred we improve profitability.\u201d\nThe third was the decision in 2010 to charge into the promising mobile-phone market as graphics-rich capabilities were coming into reach. The market quickly commoditized, though, and NVIDIA retreated just as quickly, taking initial heat but opening the door to investing in promising new markets \u2014 robotics and self-driving cars.\n\u201cOur strategic retreat paid off,\u201d he said. \u201cBy leaving the phone market, we opened our minds to invent a new one.\u201d\nHuang told grads that of the parallels in terms of boundless promise between the world he entered upon graduating four decades ago, on the cusp of the PC revolution, and the brave new age of AI they are entering today.\n\u201cFor your journey, take along some of my learnings,\u201d he said. Admit mistakes and ask for help; endure pain and suffering to realize your dreams; and make sacrifices to dedicate yourself to a life of purpose.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | NVIDIA LifeTags: Education \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"
