Nvidia is a global leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit (GPU). Nvidia\u2019s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI), developing solutions that now support high performance computing, the gaming industry, and virtual reality systems. Nvidia's GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores. Nvidia\u2019s GPUs are integral to developing deep learning algorithms, among other demanding computational applications.  The most cutting-edge consumer technologies, such as robotics and self-driving cars, rely on the processing units that NVDA produces. NVDA is also a dominant name in the Data Center industry, where they compete with companies like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). NVDAs partnership with almost all major cloud service providers (CSPs) and server vendors is a key to maintaining its mote. Fig. 1: Price percent change for NVDA, SPY, GLD, and TLT, since July 1st, 2022. How has NVDA been trading? NVDA is currently trading at $225.12, up 51.59% from its opening price of 2023. Price has shot up in 2023. We\u2019ve only seen 10 red days of trading in 2023 so far. At its current price, NVDA is 35.17% off its all-time high. If you take a step back and look at the last five or ten years of price action for NVDA, you\u2019ll notice the dominating bullish bias. This price action throughout a long period of time indicates that NVDA is an in-demand instrument that investors want to own. Over time, buyers have pushed the price of NVDA higher regardless of time.  As an investor, this tells us that NVDA likely produces a product that is currently in-demand and that the outlook for NVDA is positive. More to the point, investors like what they see, and they expect to continue to like it in the future. As traders, we can use this information to our advantage. The better we understand a market, the better we can draw conclusions. How should I trade NVDA right now? NVDAs financial statements for the last five quarters have been positive. Earnings reports throughout that period have shown us NVDA\u2019s profitability. It seems that NVDA is able to weather negative economic factors better than most. This is likely due to the nature of their industry and the demand for their products. NVDA is scheduled to report earnings next week, February 22nd, after the close. NVDAs options market in March and April contracts are tight and liquid. If you have the buying power, the opportunity to put on almost any type of trade exists.  If you\u2019d like to take advantage of NVDA\u2019s earnings event next week, place a trade using March contracts. By placing an earnings trade using March contracts, you give yourself the opportunity to roll your position out to April contracts if the position goes against you. Selling a naked strangle into earnings is risky, but it gives you the most exposure to any volatility contraction that occurs around an earnings event. Another potential trade is a short jade lizard, which can eliminate upside risk. Again, you have the choice to roll this position to April if price action goes against you after earnings. Fig. 2: Short jade lizard example using NVDA March options contracts.Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors.

As a high-growth company, Nvidia (NVDA -2.56%) has seen its shares skyrocket over the long term, illustrating the importance of holding stocks over many years. Doing so can safeguard your investment against temporary economic headwinds, like the ones that triggered steep declines for many companies in 2022.\nNvidia's stock fell 50% throughout last year. However, its shares have still retained 269% growth over the last five years despite the sell-off. And with that, let's look at how much a $10,000 investment in Nvidia's stock a decade ago, in 2013, would be worth today.\u00a0\nStellar growth\u00a0\nFounded in 1993, Nvidia went public in January 1999, with its stock soaring 55,000% since then. \u00a0While most companies tend to experience the most growth in the beginning, Nvidia has still provided immense gains since 2013, as it almost singlehandedly founded the consumer graphics processing unit (GPU) market.\u00a0\nBefore Nvidia, there was hardly a consumer (aka discrete) GPU market to speak of, with the company cashing in on the rising popularity of people building their own PCs for gaming and other purposes. As a result, Nvidia held an 88% market share in discrete GPUs as of the third quarter of 2022, according to Jon Peddie Research. \nWhile declines in the PC industry in 2022 brought worldwide GPU shipments down 42% over the year, the market's past growth has propelled Nvidia into a dominating position in tech.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2013, Nvidia's stock has soared by 7,050%. The colossal growth is almost unheard of compared to its peers, as seen in the table below.\u00a0\n\nData by YCharts\nTaking into account Nvidia's marginal dividends over the years, an investment of $10,000 in the company's stock in 2013 would be worth $807,205 today. The annual rate of return would be about 54%.\u00a0\nBuilding the future\nWhile Nvidia's stock is unlikely to soar another 7,000% over the next decade, it still has the potential for significant growth well into the future. The consumer GPU market is currently in a slump and will need time to recover. However, Nvidia's success in the space has given it the power and financial resources to find more lucrative applications for its high-powered devices.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince Jan. 1, Nvidia's stock has shot up 55%, as the company's prospects in artificial intelligence (AI) have rallied investors. The tech giant's GPUs have the power to run and develop AI software, a market projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3% through 2030. Since tech start-up OpenAI launched ChatGPT, a chatbot capable of producing human-like dialogue, in November 2022, many companies have shifted focus to the industry.\nMicrosoft's $1 billion investment in OpenAI in 2019 looks like one of the best decisions it has ever made, as the start-up's advanced software has been integrated into Azure and Bing. Meanwhile, Nvidia's recent partnership with Microsoft's Azure to build a massive AI computer is a promising step for its venture into the burgeoning market.\u00a0\n\nAnother fruitful application for Nvidia's GPUs that is already boosting revenue is in data centers, propelled by the swiftly expanding cloud industry. In the company's third quarter of fiscal 2023, ended Oct. 30, 2022, its data center segment reported year-over-year growth of 30.5%, earning the largest portion of revenue at $3.8 billion. As the cloud market still has plenty of room for growth, with a projected CAGR of 15.7% through 2030, according to Grand View Research, Nvidia is well-positioned to continue seeing gains for years.\nNvidia has awarded patient investors with immense stock growth since 2013, achieving success by pushing technology forward in the consumer GPU market. Its crucial role in cloud computing and especially AI could see it do the same. The company may not offer the same growth over the next decade, with increased competition from Intel and AMD, but its dominance in tech and long-term outlook make its stock a screaming buy.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nDani Cook has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Entitled shareholders will receive a new A-Sonic share for each five shares they hold. Nearly 17.8 million new shares will be issued.  Besides boosting the share capital, the proposed bonus issue is to reward and \"give due recognition\" to shareholders for their \"loyalty, and continuing support\". \"The proposed bonus issue, is expected to further increase the accessibility of investing in the company to a wider base of investors, thereby potentially encouraging trading liquidity and greater participation by investors, as well as to broaden the shareholder base of the company,\" the company says on Feb 26. Separately, A-Sonic has announced earnings of $4.88 million for FY2022 ended Dec 2022, down 26.3% over the preceding FY2021. Revenue in the same period was down 17.6% to $344.2 million. For 2HFY2022, earnings dropped 75.9% y-o-y to $753,000, on the back of a 41.2% decline in revenue to $142.9 million. The company attributes the lower numbers to a drop in cargo volumes handled in China, as well as lower rates fetched. In the preceding FY2021, A-Sonic enjoyed a surge in its logistics business in line with the global industry. The company, which is also in aviations, narrowed its losses for this segment to US$0.51 million for FY2022 from US$1.39 million in FY2021.  Going forward, the company expects \"great uncertainty and volatility, leading to a slow down in the global economy.

For FY2021, its total dividend payout was 5.8 cents. A-Sonic shares closed Feb 24 at 73 cents, unchanged for the day. \u00a0 See Also: Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore Supply chains have healed yet their mark on inflation to endure SIA reports 3QFY2023 earnings of $628 million, up 12.7% q-o-q Bumpy recovery ahead for GKE, but \u2018worst likely over\u2019: CGS-CIMB Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

The technology promises to improve safety, reduce traffic congestion, and allow humans to hand over driving responsibilities to robots. As it grows, so too will investor interest in related stocks and companies.\u00a0\nMany of these companies are developing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and other autonomous vehicle technology. These technologies use machine learning and artificial intelligence to make driving decisions from the data they collect. With AI becoming prevalent, investors are increasingly seeking stocks that capitalize on its intersection with automobiles.\u00a0\nTraditional automakers and tech companies are investing heavily in autonomous driving technology. The long-term potential of the field makes these companies an attractive option for investors who believe in these technologies.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLAZR\nLuminar\n$8.95\n\n\nAPTV\nAptiv\n$116.28\n\n\nAMBA\nAmbarella\n$94.31\n\n\nGOOG\nAlphabet\n$90.30\n\n\nBIDU\nBaidu\n$137.69\n\n\nINVZ\nInnoviz Technology\n$4.75\n\n\nNVDA\nNvidia\n$232.16\n\n\n\n\nLuminar (LAZR)\nSource: JHVEPhoto/shutterstock.com\nLuminar (NASDAQ:LAZR) is a company that develops lidar sensors and software for autonomous driving. The company\u2019s technology is used by major automotive manufacturers including Volvo and Audi in their autonomous vehicles. Like many lidar stocks, Luminar shares spiked in late 2020 but then gave up their rapid gains throughout 2021.\u00a0\nDemand is beginning to pick up again as broader market worries have shown some signs of easing. AI is grabbing headlines and that means Luminar will get more press moving forward.\u00a0\nManagement expects Luminar\u2019s lidar technology to support level 3 through level 5 autonomous vehicles. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) defines 5 levels of vehicle autonomy with level 5 meaning zero human interaction is required.\u00a0\nLuminar recently signed a deal to continue its partnership with Mercedes-Benz that will see the company\u2019s lidar featured in next-generation Mercedes-Benz vehicles. Luimnar\u2019s level 3 lidar systems are currently available in top-line models from the company and Luminar counts partners across major vehicle OEMs globally.\u00a0\n\nAptiv (APTV)\nSource: shutterstock.com\nAptiv (NYSE:APTV) is a global technology company that develops advanced electrical systems including autonomous driving software for automobiles. It is also positioning its products and services across smart cities and connectivity in general. The company has a long history in the vehicle parts industry and was formerly known as Delphi.\u00a0\nAptiv invested heavily in an autonomous driving joint venture with Hyundai in 2019. That 50-50 partnership was valued at $4 billion when formed and is focused on level 4 and level 5 autonomous technologies. A year earlier, Aptiv partnered with Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) to launch a fleet of 30 autonomous vehicles in Las Vegas.\u00a0\nThe company has continued to grow since, releasing fourth-quarter earnings at the beginning of February. That release describes a company in which revenues increased by 12%, reaching $4.6 billion with operations generating $933 million in cash flow. For the full year, Aptiv generated $17.5 billion in sales, also a 12% increase on a year-over-year basis.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAmbarella (AMBA)\nSource: Shutterstock\nAmbarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) develops and sells video processing chips for cameras and other devices that are used across the autonomous driving sector. That makes its stock one to watch for investors interested in AI-powered vehicles. Ambarella\u2019s products are used in applications including security cameras and automotive cameras for advanced driver assistance systems. The company has partnerships with major automotive manufacturers including Toyota (NYSE:TM), a major name in the evolving automotive space.\u00a0\nAmbarella also produces systems-on-chip (SOCs) that allow advanced image processing and the extraction of valuable data therefrom. On Feb. 7, Ambarella announced that Shanghai-based Hyperview had selected it to provide those SOCs for its autonomous driving platforms. That means Ambarella will have an opportunity to establish its name across tier-1 manufacturers and OEMs throughout the large, quickly-growing Chinese automotive market.\u00a0\nConsensus analyst target stock prices suggest AMBA stock has reasonably strong upside\u00a0after 2 straight quarters in which it produced better-than-expected earnings per share.\u00a0\n\nAlphabet (GOOG)\nSource: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.com\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock is most closely associated with Google, its primary subsidiary. But Waymo is another subsidiary of Alphabet that is developing self-driving technology for commercial use. The company\u2019s autonomous vehicles can be seen across western states including California and Arizona.\u00a0\nGiven Alphabet\u2019s large footprint across technology, it is perhaps unsurprising that Waymo is the world\u2019s most experienced driver with a history dating to 2009. The company\u2019s Waymo Driver platform has logged millions of miles on real-life roads with billions of miles in simulation.\u00a0\nReaders in Phoenix and San Francisco may be familiar with Waymo through Waymo One, its ride-hailing service. And Waymo is making inroads in the commercial driving space through Waymo Via which delivers goods via tractor-trailer trucks.\u00a0\nCurrently, investing in Waymo via public equity means buying Alphabet stock. That comes with all of the volatility of the current tech space plagued by unpredictable ad revenue. In time, though, Waymo could foreseeably spin Waymo off if it becomes advisable as a business unit.\u00a0\n\nBaidu (BIDU)\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\nBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is China\u2019s answer to Alphabet stock. The company engages in internet search like Google, and has been developing autonomous driving technology, like Waymo, since 2013. Biadu\u2019s self-driving services include Apollo, which allows developers to create their own autonomous vehicles. Apolong is Baidu\u2019s fully autonomous minibus which began mass production in 2017.\u00a0\nOutside of its autonomous driving development, Baidu is arguably a strong buy for the simple reason that China has reopened. The resulting stimulus to the economy should highly benefit advertisers that rely on its search services, spurring growth. BIDU stock currently trades around $137 but bears a consensus $173 target price.\u00a0\nBaidu\u2019s Apollo program consists of two open datasets collected in San Francisco and Beijing. Those respective datasets allow developers to test their algorithms and build autonomous vehicles. The company offers lidar systems and other sensors to capture data as well. It is also one of the few Chinese companies that can produce large-scale HD mapping data through deep learning.\u00a0\n\nInnoviz Technology (INVZ)\nSource: shutterstock.com/temp-64GTX\nIsrael-based Innoviz Technology (NASDAQ:INVZ) develops and sells solid-state lidar sensors for autonomous vehicles. It is another lidar stock in a company that provides 3D-environment perception for autonomous vehicles. Innoviz has partnerships with major automotive manufacturers, such as BMW and Magna (NYSE:MGA) among others. It is one of many publicly traded firms to have come online through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger, back in 2021. And like many other lidar companies, its stock has fallen since then.\u00a0\nInnoviz\u2019s\u00a0programs and lidar target level 2, 3, and 4 autonomous driving. Innoviz Technology is set up to carve out a significant place within the autonomous driving sector. It boasts a forward-looking order book valued at $6.9 billion representing 15% of the global auto market. Further, its current pipeline of RFQs and RFIs spans 11 OEMs that represent 42% of OEMs globally.\u00a0\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\nSource: Shutterstock\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading tech company known for many things tech. Most notable to most investors is the company\u2019s development of advanced hardware and software solutions for the autonomous vehicle industry.\nThe company\u2019s DRIVE platform\u00a0provides a complete solution for autonomous vehicle developers. It includes an in-car solution known as DRIVE Hyperion. It includes a developer kit, DRIVE AGX, and a sensor kit. The platform also includes simulation and training platforms that allow developers to create commercial algorithms for AI-powered vehicles of the present and future.\u00a0\nDRIVE Hyperion supports level 3 autonomous driving. Level 3 autonomy means a vehicle can safely handle all aspects of driving while engaged but still requires the driver to be ready to quickly take control if necessary.\u00a0\nThe company\u2019s vehicle partnerships span cars, trucks, robotaxis and include Polestar (NASDAQ:PSNY), Nio (NYSE:NIO), and Foxconn among others. Foxconn is perhaps best known as a manufacturer for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and could logically manufacture an iCar should it exist in the future. In short, Nvidia has a large network spanning autonomy that should continue to evolve in interesting ways.\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The primary resource of a modern society is knowledge. Data, when contextualized and combined with human insight, can be elevated to highly valuable, actionable information. Information is now the currency of global enterprises. \u00a0 Industry 4.0 promises to transform industrial operations by leveraging the massive amount of data generated in an industrial environment with the industrial internet of things (IIoT). But data in its raw form is not intrinsically useful. It is only when data is shown in both historical and structural contexts that it turns into advantageous information. And when processed into actionable insights and placed in the hands of decision makers, it can spark true insight to improve how industries work.  \u00a0 In this era of remote everything, we have seen multiple years\u2019 worth of digital transformation compressed into a few months. McKinsey & Company estimates that the pandemic has expedited the adoption of digital technologies by several decades. \u00a0 Businesses established in the digital age, often referred to as \u201cborn-digital\u201d\u2014like Airbnb, Netflix, and Wecash\u2014have proven that not only does digital create more profitable customer relationships but it also knocks out analog competition. They understand that today\u2019s now economy (\u201cI want it now\u201d) places high value on convenience and customer experience. \u00a0 Digital transformation, deployed through software applications powered by artificial intelligence (AI), are already driving dramatic gains in customer engagement, productivity, sustainability, and cost savings in asset-intensive industries such as manufacturing, utilities, and logistics. \u00a0 Organizations that share data, applications, and operations with their industry ecosystem will realize a revenue increase three percentage points higher than nonparticipants. -\u00a0IDC  TIP: Software makes the invisible visible. One of the most critical factors that manufacturers need to consider when it comes to competitive success is how fluidly they react to\u2014and even anticipate\u2014dynamic market conditions. The increasing power of industrial software allows us to quickly align products and business practices to ever-changing customer and ecosystem requirements. \u00a0 Empowering the digital workforce Are data analysts and scientists the new Six Sigma Black Belts? \u00a0 Despite the potential of digital tools to improve productivity and efficiency, there are still some key challenges that manufacturers need to consider when it comes to adopting new technology. One of these is the relationship between machines and humans.   Story continues \u00a0Digital transformation is more about people than technology. Technology and software exist to augment and enhance human capabilities and safety. They fundamentally improve the way we work and the kind of work we do.\u00a0As the next-generation workforce brings with it an engrained digital skillset, proprietary expertise is gradually being replaced by open software, artificial intelligence, and autonomous systems that learn and improve over time. The next wave of the workforce will be data engineers responsible for generating positive business outcomes and performance by controlling processes with digital tools. They will also help identify or invent potential new technologies to improve efficiency and create new business opportunities. This kind of industrial ecosystem, with data sharing at its core, is the foundation of the connected industrial economy, and it\u2019s starting to transform how industries work.\u00a0Today\u2019s digital natives bring the technical and advanced skills needed to work seamlessly in connected teams using shared data. And they expect automated processes, workflows, and digital tools. Soon, everyone from the top floor to the shop floor will have the necessary digital fluency to make informed decisions and improve company performance.\u00a0TIP: Industrial automation and software exist to augment and enhance human capabilities and safety. Advanced technologies like augmented reality, virtual reality, or mixed realities allow users to \u201csee\u201d the information needed to optimize the operation and maintenance of a plant\u2014easily and safely.\u00a0A healthy digital backbone  \u00a0\u201c\u2026 end users are moving into the era of the digital enterprise where all product design, manufacturing processes, services and support, and customer experiences are connected by a digital thread that merges the virtual and physical worlds.\u201d -\u00a0ARC In the automation world, information technology (IT), operational technology (OT), and engineering technology (ET) are converging. Soon, almost everything will be connected, enabled by 5G, IIoT, and the cloud. As the number of data points continues to balloon, additional inputs can be fed into high quality analytics to generate even more precise predictions for engineering, operational, maintenance, and strategic planning.\u00a0Modern industrial software gives us access to data from all along the lifecycle, across domains, and even from external sources. This broader, deeper data can be aggregated, consolidated, and fed into analytic applications to provide teams with more complete, accurate, and insightful information so that they can make quicker, data-driven decisions across the full value chain, including procurement, planning, scheduling, production, and distribution.\u00a0A company\u2019s digital backbone establishes data integrity, continuity, and consistency across the full lifecycle and provides a single source of truth\u2014the lifeline for accelerating outcome-driven ways to capture IIoT business value.\u00a0Reliable data is the basis of an organization\u2019s ability to deliver high-quality business outcomes. Since data comes from disparate parts of an organization (e.g., lines of business, customer service, and production assets), clear data governance is necessary to create vibrant, validated, and always reliable analytics.\u00a0So, how do we bring all this data together? Whereas legacy operations have traditionally used data in silos, federated data creates an integrated data thread across all program areas, enabling individual departments, groups, or partners to maintain diversity and uniqueness while also providing interoperability across domains.\u00a0  By 2026, on average, 30% of Global 2000 company revenue will derive from industry ecosystem shared data, applications, and operations initiatives with partners, industry entities, and business networks. -\u00a0 IDC \u00a0TIP: Establishing data continuity, quality, and provenance; validating data reliability; and adopting a secure data management approach for your digital backbone are essential elements for tracking and explaining data. The goal is to know what, when, and why something happens in both real time and future states at any given moment.\u00a0Flexible, scalable cloud and SaaSTraditional OT software is run locally on premises, with limited opportunity for collaboration in a shared environment. This makes it costly and difficult to scale as demand grows or shrinks.\u00a0Many industrial companies have started to leverage the power and scale of the cloud to unlock the next level of efficiency, collaboration, and growth for their businesses. A simple first step is to augment existing on-premises systems with cloud solutions to unlock additional business value through cloud-based analytics and data sharing.\u00a0Industrial cloud platforms are purpose built for industrial use. By removing organizational silos and replacing them with a shared environment for real-time collaboration and transparent information, industrial cloud platforms create unmatched levels of workforce and operational efficiency.\u00a0Using an industrial cloud platform also provides a central location to access software-as-a-service (SaaS). Sometimes called \u201csoftware on demand,\u201d SaaS is quickly becoming the licensing and delivery method of choice around the world. SaaS applications are delivered over the internet via a highly cost-effective subscription model that provides easy and fast updates, scaling as needed, high availability and accessibility, and advanced security. By moving to SaaS, time to value is almost immediate. Companies make a much smaller initial outlay and can immediately access the benefits.\u00a0Software storage and access\u2022 On-premises software is installed on a company\u2019s in-house privately-owned computers and servers.\u2022 Cloud software is hosted on a vendor\u2019s servers and accessed via a web browser.\u2022 Software can also be stored in a hybrid cloud, which may include a combination of public and private clouds, and a mix of in-house resources and cloud services.\u00a0TIP: Perpetual license software often requires a big investment up front and additional budget for maintenance and upgrades. The costs of pay-as-you-go SaaS models are flexible and predictable and provide faster returns on investment.\u00a0Cybersecurity is everyone\u2019s business  Most companies have business continuity plans in place to help them prepare for and overcome a crisis. But with nearly 40 billion devices online globally, almost everyone and everything is connected. Not making cybersecurity a critical, integral part of business planning jeopardizes a company\u2019s ability to respond to rapidly changing business dynamics.\u00a0This is particularly true when a global crisis wreaks havoc on communities, supply chains, and entire industries and economies. Cybercriminals are quick to take advantage of global events, exploiting vulnerabilities and gaps wherever they can be found and leaving companies exposed.\u00a0Our new digital ecosystem empowers us to be more productive and efficient. However, that ecosystem is only effective if we have trust in it. But where to begin?\u00a0The first step is to ensure cybersecurity is at the foundation of your overall risk management and risk assessment strategies and matrix. By understanding your risk threshold, you can develop a holistic strategy that addresses the dynamics of your unique environment.\u00a0Security is everyone\u2019s business, but some companies find they simply do not yet have either the expertise or the resources to fully take on cybersecurity by themselves.\u00a0Because the stakes are so high, it is best to find a partner who has the expertise to help you design and implement a program that works for you. In most cases, you will need monitoring, maintenance, and training services. In addition, you\u2019ll need technical expertise to help integrate your existing technology, especially if it is from multiple vendors.\u00a0The goal is a holistic, dynamic program that will continually identify, assess, and minimize your risks and threats. Then you will have the people, processes, and technology in place to reduce the potential impact that a cyber incident could have on your business performance.\u00a0TIP: Cybersecurity risks related to systemic events are dynamic; they change every day. Therefore, the best approach to reducing and even eliminating current and future risks is to establish a strong cybersecurity foundation that includes your people, processes, and technology.\u00a0\u00a0See Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore Getting smart with advanced technologies - the power of AI Support for carbon taxes, incentives for green buildings among Budget wishlists The green future of industrial sustainability Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

Reuters \u2022 yesterday   State Bank of India shelves $1.7 billion fund raising as yields elevated, sources say MUMBAI (Reuters) -State Bank of India, the country's largest lender by assets, is shelving plans to raise funds this fiscal year, discouraged by elevated bond yields despite a policy rate cut and liquidity boost from the central bank, three sources aware of the matter said on Monday.  The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

The rupee was aided by dollar sales by foreign banks and exporters during the session, a trader at a mid-sized private bank said.   Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

The positive results were well-received by Wall Street analysts who anticipate continued growth for the chipmaker, particularly due to promising opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence.Lucid Group (LCID) \u2013 Following fourth-quarter revenue that failed to meet analysts\u2019 expectations, the electric vehicle maker\u2019s stock plummeted by over 12%. Bank of America downgraded the stock from a buy rating to neutral, citing concerns about near-term demand.Bumble (BMBL) \u2013 Following better than expected fourth-quarter revenue results, shares of Bumble increased by about 7%. Nonetheless, the company also reported a loss of 85 cents per share for the quarter, which included an impairment charge stemming from the closure of its operations in Russia and Belarus.Lordstown Motors (RIDE) \u2013 After announcing a temporary halt in production and delivery to address quality concerns with specific Endurance components, shares of the electric vehicle maker declined by over 11%. Additionally, Lordstown announced a voluntary recall of 19 Endurance pickups due to a particular electrical connection issue that could potentially lead to a loss of propulsion while driving.Domino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ), Papa John\u2019s International (PZZA) \u2013 Following mixed earnings reports from the pizza chains, shares of Domino\u2019s and Papa John\u2019s fell by over 11% and over 6%, respectively. While Domino\u2019s adjusted earnings per share exceeded expectations, its revenue and same-store sales figures failed to meet analyst estimates. Conversely, although Papa John\u2019s beat expectations for both earnings and revenue, it fell short of estimates for North American company-owned restaurant sales.Nikola (NKLA) \u2013 After Nikola reported quarterly revenue figures that fell short of analyst expectations, shares of the electric truck maker dropped by over 5%. Despite producing 133 trucks during the fourth quarter, the company stated that it had only delivered 20 battery-electric trucks to dealers.eBay (EBAY) \u2013 Despite eBay reporting fourth-quarter earnings, shares declined by over 5% due to the company falling short of expectations.

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  The video above represents one of the first times that a pangolin, one of the world\u2019s most critically endangered species, was detected in real time using artificial intelligence.\nA U.K.-based nonprofit called Conservation AI made this possible with the help of NVIDIA technology. Such use of AI can help track even the rarest, most reclusive of species in real time, enabling conservationists to protect them from threats, such as poachers and fires, before it\u2019s too late to intervene.\nThe organization was founded four years ago by researchers at Liverpool John Moores University \u2014 Paul Fergus, Carl Chalmers, Serge Wich and Steven Longmore.\nIn the past year and a half, Conservation AI has deployed 70+ AI-powered cameras across the world. These help conservationists preserve biodiversity through real-time detection of threats using deep learning models trained with transfer learning.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very simple \u2014 if we don\u2019t protect our biodiversity, there won\u2019t be people on this planet,\u201d said Chalmers, who teaches deep learning and applied AI at Liverpool John Moores University. \u201cAnd without AI, we\u2019re never going to achieve our targets for protecting endangered species.\u201d\nThe Conservation AI platform \u2014 built using NVIDIA Jetson modules\u00a0for edge AI and the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server \u2014 in just four seconds analyzes footage, identifies species of interest and alerts conservationists and other users of potential threats via email.\n\nIt can also rapidly model trends in biodiversity and habitat health using a huge database of images and other metadata that would otherwise take years to analyze. The platform now enables conservationists to identify these trends and species activities in real time.\nConservation AI works with 150 organizations across the globe, including conservation societies, safaris and game reserves. To date, the platform has processed over 2 million images, about half of which were from the past three months.\nSaving Time to Save Species\nThreats to biodiversity have long been monitored using camera traps \u2014 networks of cameras equipped with infrared sensors that are placed in the wild. But camera traps can produce data that is hard to manage, as there\u2019s often much variability in images of the animals and their environments.\n\u201cA typical camera trap study can take three years to analyze, so by the time you get the insights, it\u2019s too late to do anything about the threat to those species,\u201d said Fergus, a professor of machine learning at Liverpool John Moores University. \u201cConservation AI can analyze the same amount of data and send results to conservation teams so that interventions can happen in real time, all enabled by NVIDIA technology.\u201d\nMany endangered species occupy remote areas without access to human communication systems. The team uses NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier modules to analyze drone footage from such areas streamed to a smart controller that can count species population or alert conservationists when species of interest are detected.\nEnergy-efficient edge AI provided by the Jetson modules, which are equipped with Triton Inference Server, has sped up deep learning inference by 4x compared to the organization\u2019s previous methods, according to Chalmers.\n\u201cWe chose Triton because of the elasticity of the framework and the many types of models it supports,\u201d he added. \u201cBeing able to train the models on the NVIDIA accelerated computing stack means we can make huge improvements on the models very, very quickly.\u201d\nConservation AI trains and inferences its deep learning models with NVIDIA RTX 8000, T4 and A100 Tensor Core GPUs \u2014 along with the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit. Fergus called NVIDIA GPUs \u201cgame changers in the world of applied AI and conservation, where there are big-data challenges.\u201d\nIn addition, the team\u2019s species-detection pipeline is built on the NVIDIA DeepStream software development kit for vision AI applications, which enables real-time video inference in the field.\n\u201cWithout this technology, helicopters would normally be sent up to observe the animals, which is hugely expensive and bad for the environment as it emits huge amounts of carbon dioxide,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cConservation AI technology helps reduce this problem and detects threats to animals before it\u2019s too late to intervene.\u201d\nDetecting Pangolins, Rhinos and More\nThe Conservation AI platform has been deployed by Chester Zoo, a renowned conservation society based in the U.K., to detect poachers in real time, including those hunting pangolins in Uganda.\nSince many endangered species, like pangolins, are so elusive, obtaining enough imagery of them to train AI models can be difficult. So, the Conservation AI team is working with NVIDIA to explore the use of synthetic data for model training.\nThe platform is also deployed at a game reserve in Limpopo, South Africa, where the AI keeps an eye on wildlife in the region, including black and white rhinos.\n\u201cPound for pound, rhino horn is worth more than diamond,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cWe\u2019ve basically created a geofence around these rhinos, so the reserve can intervene as soon as a poacher or another type of threat is detected.\u201d\nThe organization\u2019s long-term goal, Fergus said, is to create a toolkit that supports conservationists with many types of efforts, including wildlife monitoring through satellite imagery, as well as using deep learning models that analyze audio \u2014 like animal cries or the sounds of a forest fire.\n\u201cThe loss of biodiversity is really a ticking time bomb, and the beauty of NVIDIA AI is that it makes every second count,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cWithout the NVIDIA accelerated computing stack, we just wouldn\u2019t be able to do this \u2014 we wouldn\u2019t be able to tackle climate change and reverse biodiversity loss, which is the ultimate dream.\u201d\nRead more about how NVIDIA technology helps to boost conservation and prevent poaching.\nFeatured imagery courtesy of Chester Zoo.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | CUDA | Customer Stories | Data Science | GPU | Inference | Jetson | Machine Learning | NVIDIA in Europe | Social Impact | Synthetic Data Generation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

For the past three years, we\u2019ve asked them to tell us collectively what\u2019s on the top of their minds.\nSometimes the results are just what we thought they\u2019d be, and other times they\u2019re truly surprising. This year\u2019s survey, conducted in a time of continued macroeconomic uncertainty, the results were a little of both.\nFrom banking and fintech institutions to insurance and asset management firms, the goals remain the same \u2014 find ways to more accurately manage risk, enhance efficiencies to reduce operating costs, and improve experiences for clients and customers. By digging in deeper, we were able to learn which areas of AI are of most interest as well as a bit more.\nBelow are the top four findings we gleaned from our \u201cState of AI in Financial Services: 2023 Trends\u201d survey taken by nearly 500 global financial services professionals.\nHybrid Cloud Is Coming on Strong\nFinancial services firms, like other enterprises, are looking to optimize spending for AI training and inference \u2014 with the knowledge that sensitive data can\u2019t be migrated to the cloud. To do so cost-effectively, they\u2019re moving many of their compute-intensive workloads to the hybrid cloud.\nThis year\u2019s survey found that nearly half of respondents\u2019 firms are moving to the hybrid cloud to optimize AI performance and reduce costs. Recent announcements from leading cloud service providers and platforms, such as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, reinforce this shift and make data portability, MLOps management and software standardization across cloud and on-prem instances a strategic imperative for cost and efficiency.\nLarge Language Models Top the List of AI Use Cases\u00a0\nThe survey results, focused on companies based in the Americas and Europe, with a sample size of over 200, found the top AI use cases to be natural language processing and large language models (26%), recommender systems and next-best action (23%), portfolio optimization (23%) and fraud detection (22%). Emerging workloads for the metaverse, synthetic data generation and virtual worlds were also common.\nBanks, trading firms and hedge funds are adopting these technologies to create personalized customer experiences. For example, Deutsche Bank recently announced a multi-year innovation partnership with NVIDIA to embed AI into financial services across use cases, including intelligent avatars, speech AI, fraud detection and risk management, to slash total cost of ownership by up to 80%. The bank plans to use NVIDIA Omniverse to build a 3D virtual avatar to help employees navigate internal systems and respond to HR-related questions.\nBanks Seeing More Potential for AI to Grow Revenue\nThe survey found that AI is having a quantifiable impact on financial institutions. Nearly half of survey takers said that AI will help increase annual revenue for their organization by at least 10%. More than a third noted that AI will also help decrease annual costs by at least 10%.\nFinancial services professionals highlighted how AI has enhanced business operations \u2014 particularly improving customer experience (46%), creating operational efficiencies (35%) and reducing total cost of ownership (20%).\nFor example, computer vision and natural language processing are helping automate financial document analysis and claims processing, saving companies time, expenses and resources. AI also helps prevent fraud by enhancing anti-money laundering and know-your-customer processes, while recommenders create personalized digital experiences for a firm\u2019s customers or clients.\nThe Biggest Obstacle: Recruiting and Retaining AI Talent\u00a0\nBut there are challenges to achieving AI goals in the enterprise. Recruiting and retaining AI experts is the single biggest obstacle, a problem reported by 36% of survey takers. There is also inadequate technology to enable AI innovation, according to 28% of respondents.\nInsufficient data sizes for model training and accuracy is another pressing issue noted by 26% of financial services professionals. This could be addressed through the use of generative AI to produce accurate synthetic financial data used to train AI models.\nExecutive Support for AI at New High\nDespite the challenges, the future for AI in FSI is getting brighter. Increasing executive buy-in for AI is a new theme in the survey results. Some 64% of those surveyed noted that \u201cmy executive leadership team values and believes in AI,\u201d compared with 36% a year ago. In addition, 58% said that \u201cAI is important to my company\u2019s future success,\u201d up from 39% a year ago.\nFinancial institutions plan to continue building out enterprise AI in the future. This will include scaling up and scaling out AI infrastructure, including hardware, software and services.\nEmpowering data scientists, quants and developers while minimizing bottlenecks requires a sophisticated, full stack AI platform. Executives have seen the ROI of deploying AI-enabled applications. In 2023, these leaders will focus on scaling AI across the enterprise, hiring more data scientists and investing in accelerated computing technology to support training and deployment of AI applications.\nDownload the \u201cState of AI in Financial Services: 2023 Trends\u201d report for in-depth results and insights.\nWatch on-demand sessions from NVIDIA GTC featuring industry leaders from Capital One, Deutsche Bank, U.S. Bank and Ubiquant.

The team publishes its datasets, dozens of models and open-source code to HuggingFace and GitHub.\n\nEach colored dot on the map represents a solar photovoltaic system. Blue dots represent low solar-energy output, yellow dots signify high output and black dots are systems with no data.\nAI to Catch a Cloud and Pin It Down\nBefore the advent of renewable energy, the experts managing the electric grid day-to-day only had to worry about the variability of demand across the network \u2014 making sure there was enough power generated to keep up with air conditioners during a heat wave, or electric stoves and appliances on weekday evenings.\nBy adding renewables such as wind and solar energy to the mix, the energy grid must also account for weather-related variation in the level of supply. Satellite images provide the most up-to-date view to determine when clouds are coming between photovoltaic panels and the sun.\nOpen Climate Fix\u2019s AI models are trained on terabytes of satellite data captured at five-minute intervals over Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. Additional data sources include years\u2019 worth of hourly weather predictions at ten-kilometer resolution, topographic maps, information about the time of day and the sun\u2019s position in the sky, and live readings from around solar panels across the U.K.\nThe team is using some of the most recent deep learning models for weather modeling including MetNet, GraphCast and Deep Generative Model of Radar. They\u2019ve shown that their transformer-based AI models are 3x better at predicting solar energy generation than the forecasts generated by ESO\u2019s traditional methods. The increased precision can help ESO reach its goal of being able to operate a zero-carbon electric grid by 2025.\n\u201cThe physics-based forecasting models are powerful for predicting weather on the scale of days and weeks, but take hours to produce \u2014 making them ill-suited for predictions at the hour or minute level,\u201d said Travers. \u201cBut with satellite images captured at intervals of a few minutes, we can get closer to a live view of cloud cover.\u201d\nAI\u2019s Working on Sunshine\nCloud cover is of particular concern in the U.K., where cities including London, Birmingham and Glasgow receive an average of 1,400 or fewer hours of sunshine each year \u2014 less than half that of Los Angeles. But even in desert climates where cloudy days are rare, Open Climate Fix\u2019s AI models could be repurposed to detect when solar panels would be covered by dust from a sandstorm.\nIn addition to forecasting for the entire U.K., the nonprofit is also developing models that can forecast how much energy individual solar panels will capture. This data could help large solar farm operators understand and maximize their energy output. Smart home companies, too, could use the information to optimize energy use from solar panels on customers\u2019 roofs \u2014 giving homeowners insights about when to run power-hungry devices or schedule electric vehicle charging.\nOpen Climate Fix uses a cluster of NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs granted through an NVIDIA Hardware Grant to power its work. When training multiple models at the same time, the team shifts its overflow workload to NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs available through cloud service providers.\n\u201cThe hardware grants have helped us develop and iterate on our models more easily,\u201d said Jacob Bieker, a machine learning researcher at Open Climate Fix. \u201cWhen our team is first debugging and training a model, it\u2019s two or three times faster to do so locally.\u201d\nRead about NVIDIA\u2019s work in power and utilities and apply to join NVIDIA Inception.\nDiscover how AI is powering the future of clean energy.\nMain image of National Grid ESO Electricity National Control Center, courtesy of ESO Media Center\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Energy | Inception | NVIDIA in Europe | Open Source | Science | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Creating digital twins in a simulated photorealistic environment that obeys the laws of physics and planning factories are just two examples of workflows made possible by NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise, a platform for creating and operating metaverse applications.\nBMW Group, for example, is using NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise to design an end-to-end digital twin of an entire factory. This involves collaboration with thousands of planners, product engineers and facility managers in a single virtual environment to design, plan, simulate and optimize highly complex manufacturing systems before a factory is actually built or a new product is integrated into the real world.\nThe need for accelerated computing power is growing exponentially due to the explosion of AI-augmented workflows, from traditional R&D and data science workloads to edge devices on factory floors or in security offices, to generative AI solutions for text conversations and text-to-image applications.\nExtended reality (XR) solutions for collaborative work also require significant computing resources. Examples of XR applications include design reviews, product design validation, maintenance and support training, rehearsals, interactive digital twins and location-based entertainment. All of these demand high-resolution, photoreal images to create the most intuitive and compelling immersive experiences, whether available locally or streamed to wireless devices.\nNext-Generation Platform Features\u00a0\nWith a breakthrough new compute architecture for faster individual CPU cores and new embedded multi-die interconnect bridge packaging, the Xeon W-3400 and Xeon W-2400 series of processors enable unprecedented scalability for increased workload performance.

And 90% of that content streams at 1080p or lower, including from popular sources like Twitch.tv, YouTube, Netflix, Disney+ and Hulu.\nHowever, when viewers use displays higher than 1080p \u2014 as do many PC users \u2014 the browser must scale the video to match the resolution of the display. Most browsers use basic upscaling techniques, which result in final images that are soft or blurry.\nWith RTX VSR, GeForce RTX 40 and 30 Series GPU users can tap AI to upscale lower-resolution content up to 4K, matching their display resolution. The AI removes blocky compression artifacts and improves the video\u2019s sharpness and clarity.\nJust like putting on a pair of prescription glasses can instantly snap the world into focus, RTX Video Super Resolution gives viewers on GeForce RTX 40 and 30 Series PCs a clear picture into the world of streaming video.\nRTX VSR is available now as part of the latest GeForce Game Ready Driver, which delivers the best experience for new game launches like Atomic Heart and THE FINALS closed beta.\nThe Evolution of AI Upscaling\nAI upscaling is the process of converting lower-resolution media to a higher resolution by putting low-resolution images through a deep learning model to predict the high-resolution versions. To make these predictions with high accuracy, a neural network model must be trained on countless images at different resolutions.\n4K displays can muddy visuals by having to stretch lower-resolution images to fit their screen. Using AI to upscale streamed video makes lower-resolution images fit with unrivaled crispness.\nThe deployed AI model can then take low-resolution video and produce incredible sharpness and enhanced details that no traditional scaler can recreate. Edges look sharper, hair looks scruffier and landscapes pop with striking clarity.\nIn 2019, an early version of this technology was released with SHIELD TV. It was a breakthrough that improved streamed content targeted for TVs, mostly ranging from 480p to 1080p, and optimized for a 10-foot viewing experience.\nPC viewers are typically seated much closer than TV viewers to their displays, requiring a higher level of processing and refinement for upscaling. With GeForce RTX 40 and 30 Series GPUs, users now have extremely powerful AI processors with Tensor Cores, enabling a new generation of AI upscaling through RTX VSR.\nHow RTX Video Super Resolution Works\nRTX VSR is a breakthrough in AI pixel processing that dramatically improves the quality of streamed video content beyond edge detection and feature sharpening.\nBlocky compression artifacts are a persistent issue in streamed video. Whether the fault of the server, the client or the content itself, issues often become amplified with traditional upscaling, leaving a less pleasant visual experience for those watching streamed content.\nClick the image to see the differences between bicubic upscaling (left) and RTX Video Super Resolution.\nRTX VSR reduces or eliminates artifacts caused by compressing video \u2014 such as blockiness, ringing artifacts around edges, washout of high-frequency details and banding on flat areas \u2014 while reducing lost textures. It also sharpens edges and details.\nThe technology uses a deep learning network that performs upscaling and compression artifact reduction in a single pass. The network analyzes the lower-resolution video frame and predicts the residual image at the target resolution. This residual image is then superimposed on top of a traditional upscaled image, correcting artifact errors and sharpening edges to match the output resolution.\nThe deep learning network is trained on a wide range of content with various compression levels. It learns about types of compression artifacts present in low-resolution or low-quality videos that are otherwise absent in uncompressed images as a reference for network training. Extensive visual evaluation is employed to ensure that the generated model is effective on nearly all real-world and gaming content.\n\nGetting Started\nRTX VSR requires a GeForce RTX 40 or 30 Series GPU and works with nearly all content streamed in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.\nThe feature also requires updating to the latest GeForce Game Ready Driver, available today, or the next NVIDIA Studio Driver releasing in March. Both Chrome (version 110.0.5481.105 or higher) and Edge (version 110.0.1587.56) have updated recently to support RTX VSR.\nTo enable it, launch the NVIDIA Control Panel and open \u201cAdjust video image settings.\u201d Check the super resolution box under \u201cRTX video enhancement\u201d and select a quality from one to four \u2014 ranging from the lowest impact on GPU performance to the highest level of upscaling improvement.\nLearn more, including other setup configurations, in this NVIDIA Knowledge Base article.\n\n\nCategories: GamingTags: Artificial Intelligence | GeForce | NVIDIA RTX | NVIDIA Studio Driver \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Basically I was only going to keep this RTX 4080 review as a review-in-progress until I cleared some other important hardware gubbins that was occurring that week, but then the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 XTX showed up and I thought \"Well it\u2019d be good to include benchmarks from those too\", so I pushed it back until those were tested. Then the RTX 4070 Ti got announced and I thought \"Well it\u2019d be good to include benchmarks from that too\", so pushed it back until that was tested. Which it has been, so here they are, a little late but fully formed: opinions on the RTX 4080.\n\n\n\n\nDead Space PC Review - An Excellent Remake Of A Horror Classic\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\nAsus ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4080 OC Edition specs:\n\nCUDA Cores: 9728\nBase Clock Speed: 2210MHz\nBoost Clock Speed: 2655MHz\nVRAM: 16GB GDDR6X\nPower: 320W\nRecommended System Power: 750W\nPrice: \u00a31480 / $1550 (RTX 4080 starts at \u00a31269 / $1199) \n\nIt's not great. Or rather, it is literally great: this vast graphics card wouldn\u2019t fit in my mid-tower case unless I removed the front fans and radiator, and it can sail through 4K like it\u2019s a Venetian high street. But then, so can both of its much cheaper Radeon rivals, while the RTX 4070 Ti is a more accessible route into the best bits of Nvidia\u2019s Ada Lovelace architecture \u2013 including DLSS 3.\nYes, money talk is dull, but most of the RTX 4080\u2019s problems come down to its price. You\u2019re looking at a starting point of \u00a31269 / $1199, should you get your hands on an Nvidia-crafted  Founders Edition model, while the Asus ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4080 OC Edition I tested is nearly RTX 4090 money: \u00a31480 in the UK and $1550 in the States. For that, you get a GPU that consistently outperforms the RTX 3090 Ti, the previous GeForce top dog, but doesn\u2019t pull out the borderline fantastical speeds it would need to make itself a good deal.\nRTX 4080 review: 4K performance\nThe review-in-progress focused on the RTX 4080\u2019s considerable FPS gains on the RTX 3090 Ti and its immediate predecessor, the RTX 3080. These still apply, from the 79% improvement in Shadow of the Tomb Raider to the 48% uplift in Metro Exodus (both on the RTX 3080), but compared more closely to the rest of this current GPU generation, the RTX 4080 lacks much to distinguish it. It only comes close to the RTX 4090\u2019s level in a small handful of games at 4K, its natural home, and the \u00a3999 RX 7900 XTX often manages to either equal or beat it.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nYou could say it\u2019s a sufficient step up from the RTX 4070 Ti. With only one outlier, Forza Horizon 5, the RTX 4080 is usually somewhere between 10-20fps quicker, and never dropped below a 60fps average in any of these test games. That\u2019s at least worth taking into consideration if you\u2019re dead set on a card with DLSS support and are willing to pay top coin for 4K (or ultrawide) capability.\nThe RPS test PC:\n\nCPU: Intel Core i5-11600K\nRAM: 16GB Corsair Vengeance LPX\nMotherboard: Asus TUF Gaming Z590-Plus WiFi\nPSU: Corsair RM850x\n\nAt the same time, it\u2019s not like the RTX 4070 Ti sweats to death at this resolution. That dip below a 60fps average only happened twice, in Total War: Three Kingdoms and F1 22, and in the latter's case that's easily amended with upscaling. And again, with Shadow of the Tomb Raider a sole exception, the RX 7900 XTX manages to either outpace the pricier RTX 4080, or come so close that the framerate difference between them isn\u2019t visibly apparent.\nHowever, the RTX 4080 does have AMD\u2019s efforts beaten on ray tracing. Just like how the Ampere generation \u2013 that\u2019s the RTX 30 series \u2013 licked competing Radeon GPUs whenever ray traced lighting, shadows or reflections were in play, Ada Lovelace makes further RT improvements, cushioning the blow whenever these settings try to take a bite out the RTX 4080\u2019s overall performance. \nMetro Exodus, for instance, dropped from 96fps on the RX 7900 XTX to 45fps once Ultra-quality ray tracing was added to the benchmark. The RTX 4080 had a lower starting point, 91fps, but averaged a significantly higher 62fps with ray tracing. Likewise, Watch Dogs Legion saw the RX 7900 XTX fall from 83fps to a barely lowly 35fps after applying Ultra-quality RT, but the RTX 4080 produced a smooth 46fps with ray tracing despite its 78fps being slower without.\n\n\n \n\nI still don\u2019t think that makes the RTX 4080 \"worth it\", though, not least because ray tracing is ultimately supported in only a small minority of games, and is deserving of the performance hit in fewer still. A more convincing argument in its favour would be DLSS, which doesn\u2019t always produce faster framerates than AMD\u2019s competing FSR, but does usually look better in terms of upscaling quality.\nDLSS 3 is here, too, AI frame generation and all. Don\u2019t worry, this doesn\u2019t send an unsettling AI mimic into your PC to live commentate your mouse clicks: when frame generation is turned on, the card can add in surprisingly accurate, fully self-generated frames between the ones it renders the usual way. Loads more frames, no performance cost, except for a touch of added input lag.\n\n\n \n\nWhat\u2019s more, the RTX 4080 seems to extract more from DLSS 3 than its RTX 40 series brethren. In Cyberpunk 2077, all three of these cards have a tough time with Psycho-level ray tracing at native 4K, but by whacking DLSS 3 to Quality and enabling frame generation, the RTX 4080 leaps from 27fps to 82fps. That\u2019s a 204% boost in a couple of clicks, and represents a starker improvement than the 136% gain I got on the RTX 4070 Ti and the 154% gain I got on the RTX 4090. Set upscaling to Performance mode, and that becomes a 278% improvement on the RTX 4080, versus 232% on the RTX 4070 Ti and 223% on the RTX 4090.\nThat\u2019s pretty compelling, until yet again you remember what you\u2019d be paying for the privilege. And when the RTX 4070 Ti can also leverage DLSS 3 to wrestle control of one of the toughest ray tracing implementations in all of PC gaming, at 4K, for hundreds of pounds/dollars less\u2026 do the percentages actually count for that much?\nRTX 4080 review: 1440p performance\nAs a 100fps+ engine for 2560x1440, the RTX 4080 shimmies itself much closer to the RTX 4090 \u2013 though CPU bottlenecking is going to be more common an issue at this resolution, especially for the higher-end GPU that stands to lose more.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nThen there\u2019s the matter of the RX 7900 XTX. Again. Without ray tracing, the RTX 4080 is only really faster in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and the AMD card ekes out numerous leads in return. Many of these are also minor, though it\u2019s hard to ignore the RX 7900 XTX\u2019s extra 22fps in Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla. Also hard to ignore: the RX 7900 XT, which costs less than the XTX (starting from about \u00a3870 in the UK) yet is able to squeak ahead of the RTX 4080 in Valhalla, Metro Exodus, Watch Dogs Legion and Hitman 3. Or Hitman World of Assassination, as it's now called.\nOnce more, then, it\u2019s up to that ray tracing advantage to mount a rescue. In Metro, this time at 1440p, enabling Ultra ray tracing knocked the RTX 4080 down from 111fps to 100fps: a mere 10% drop. Compare that to a 32% drop on the RX 7900 XTX (120fps to 82fps) and a 42% drop on the RX 7900 XT (116fps to 67fps) and it\u2019s clear that Nvidia are getting the most value out of these enhanced effects. \n\n\n \n\nIt's a similar story in Watch Dogs Legion: average performance on the RTX 4080 fell by 25% after introducing Ultra ray tracing, down to 61fps from 81fps. That\u2019s no small loss but is nonetheless dwarfed by the 34% hit on the RX 7900 XTX (87fps to 57fps) and the 40% hit on the RX 7900 XT (86fps to 52fps). It\u2019s also slightly better than on the RTX 4070 Ti, which dropped from 80fps to 58fps, a 28% reduction.\nTo be a tad kinder to the RTX 4090, it\u2019s inevitable that you\u2019d have to pay more for a graphics card that ably supports top-of-the-line features and settings. Opt for an RX 7900 series model and it might not sit comfortably knowing that your card, possibly bought to get the most out of a 4K gaming monitor, is only third or fourth best on ray tracing and upscaling. If you\u2019re going premium, why not go all the way?\n\n\n \n\nBut then, going all the way in this instance would be buying the RTX 4090, which for all its own issues around its devastating price tag, is at least the superlative performance option. Next to the RX 7900 series, and now the RTX 4070 Ti as well, the RTX 4080 is drastically more expensive, but only rarely reaches a performance level that adequately backs up that price tag.\nThe draw of DLSS 3 remains strong, especially now that the number of games supporting it is rising at a faster pace. But the RTX 4070 Ti also offers this at a much lower price, with a lower PSU requirement, and frankly with a better chance of fitting the damned thing inside your case. That\u2019s the current-gen, 4K-ready GeForce GPU I\u2019d go for right now, even if it too demands a hefty investment.\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n          \n\n\n\n            Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n          \n\n\n\n            In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nJames Archer: James had previously hung around beneath the RPS treehouse as a freelancer, before being told to drop the pine cones and climb up to become hardware editor.

If you installed the original version, you can download the new version, 531.29 WHQL, from the Drivers tab of GeForce Experience and GeForce.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Atomic Heart Available Now With DLSS 3\nIn Mundfish\u2019s Atomic Heart, humans live in a utopia full of wonders, in harmony with their loyal and fervent robots. But with the upcoming launch of a new neural network version allowing them to control robots just mere days away, terrifying machines, superpowered robots and mutated creatures rise up against their creators, and only you can save Atomic Heart\u2019s idealized world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Atomic Heart launched on February 21st, GeForce RTX gamers had class-leading performance, plus support for NVIDIA DLSS 3, NVIDIA DLSS 2 and NVIDIA Reflex.\nWhen DLSS 3 is enabled, 4K performance with a GeForce RTX 4090 is boosted by 90% to 184 FPS, and with a GeForce RTX 4080 it\u2019s increased by 80% to 146 FPS. With a GeForce RTX 4070 Ti at 1440p, DLSS 3 increases performance by 62%, running at max settings at over 160 FPS. DLSS 3 can also help boost performance in CPU-bound scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload and install the new Game Ready Driver now to ensure your system\u2019s primed for the launch of DLSS 3, and to further optimize your experience today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For THE FINALS Closed Beta\nEmbark Studios\u2019 THE FINALS is an upcoming free-to-play shooter set in a highly destructive world, making each match unique. Players form teams of three and enter tournaments with multiple teams duking it out simultaneously to progress to the next round. The goal is to collect, carry, and bank boxes of cash - the team with the most cash at the end of the round wins. But team wipes and steals see the pendulum of success swing widely from moment to moment, putting contestants on the edges of their seats each and every match.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn March 7th, a new two-week closed beta begins, giving gamers a chance to sample THE FINALS before its launch later this year. To participate, simply head to the game\u2019s Steam page, and sign up via the button near the top of the page. Once the beta begins and your participation is confirmed, you\u2019ll be able to download the game client via your Steam Library.\nSelected players will discover support for NVIDIA DLSS, NVIDIA Reflex and hardware-accelerated RTXGI ray tracing, accelerating performance, making gameplay more responsive, and enhancing image quality.\nFor further information, head to GeForce.com\u2019s THE FINALS Closed Beta article, and to ensure your system takes full advantage of our technology, download and install the new Game Ready Driver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Video Super Resolution Now Available!\nAvailable today with the new Game Ready Driver, RTX Video Super Resolution uses AI and RTX Tensor Cores to improve the quality of video watched in a Chrome or Edge browser by removing blocky compression artifacts and upscaling video resolution. This improves video sharpness and clarity, and lets people watch online content \u2013 whether from Twitch, YouTube, Netflix or Hulu \u2013 in its native resolution on high-resolution displays up to 4K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Video Super Resolution sharpens edges and removes artifacts, as you can see in this 1080p to 4K VSR Upscaling game video example, with a 2x zoom highlighting the differences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX VSR models are trained on a wide variety of video genres, from gaming to live video.\nIn this example, we\u2019re upscaling a real-world video from 1080p to 4K with VSR Upscaling on the right, and basic bilinear upscaling on the left, and applying a 2x zoom to highlight the differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore enabling RTX VSR on your PC, your Chrome or Edge browser will need to be updated to the latest version. Chances are, your browser has already been updated. If you would like to manually verify you are on the latest, follow these guides:\n\nUpdating Google Chrome\nUpdating Microsoft Edge\n\nTo enable VSR on your GeForce RTX 30 or 40 series PCs, open the NVIDIA control panel and under \u201cAdjust Video Settings\u201d, enable \u201cSuper resolution\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers can specify quality levels between 1 (lowest) to 4 (highest). Higher quality levels will result in sharper images and improved artifact reduction. Higher quality levels require additional GPU resources, so if users need more horsepower to run creative apps or games while playing video, the quality level can be adjusted. All 30 and 40 series RTX GPUs are able to comfortably upscale using quality level 1, and xx70 class or higher are able to play most content at quality level 4.\nFor more information on laptop setup and troubleshooting, please view our FAQ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Games Supported By GeForce Experience\u2019s Optimal Settings\nGeForce Experience\u2019s one-click optimal settings enable you to instantly configure game options for your system\u2019s hardware, giving you smooth, optimized gameplay. Over 1000 titles are supported, and since our last driver release we\u2019ve added support for 7 more:\n\nAtomic Heart\nCompany of Heroes 3\nHogwarts Legacy\nPERISH\nSons Of The Forest\nThe Settlers: New Allies\nWarlander\n\nGeForce Experience also enables you to capture and stream your gameplay, take screenshots, upload videos to social networks, and more.

NVIDIA and its CEO, Jensen Huang, have long been proponents of artificial intelligence, and the topic came up during the company\u2019s latest round of earnings. In a recent statement, NVIDIA (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang says that \u201cAI is at an inflection point.\u201d\nThe particular quote can be found within NVIDIA\u2019s (NVDA) Q4 2023 earnings report. \"AI is at an inflection point, setting up for broad adoption reaching into every industry,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cFrom startups to major enterprises, we are seeing accelerated interest in the versatility and capabilities of generative AI.\u201d\n\nJensen Huang and NVIDIA\u2019s interest in artificial intelligence is well documented. The CEO recently talked about the potential of ChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s popular chatbot program, going as far as to call it an \u201ciPhone moment of artificial intelligence.\u201d NVIDIA has also used AI to power its own software services. NVIDIA voice, a program exclusive to owners of the manufacturer\u2019s graphics cards, uses AI to eliminate background noises from microphones. During the company's latest earnings call, NVIDIA confirmed that its working on an AI service.\nWith Microsoft making a huge financial investment into OpenAI and Google creating its own competitor, it\u2019s certainly a major turning point for artificial intelligence. As more companies find ways to implement the technology into its products and services, it\u2019ll be interesting to see if NVIDIA looks to further invest in it as well. If you\u2019re interested in the financial news out of NVIDIA\u2019s Q4 2023 earnings report, we have that for you as well.

(PHOTO: Cushman & Wakefield)   By Sandy Pramuji SINGAPORE \u2013 The family of singer-songwriter Dick Lee has put on sale three adjoining freehold bungalows at Chancery Hill Road and Dyson Road. With a net indicative price of S$60 million, all proceedings will go to charity. This translates to S$1,866 per sq ft, based on a total land area of 32,148 sq ft.  Cushman & Wakefield, the marketing agent for the properties, said in its press release on Monday (13 February), that the sale will be on as-is-where-is basis with all three bungalows currently vacant. Interested parties are invited to bid for a single or multiple adjoining bungalows. The Business Times (BT) reported that the properties have been put up for sale by Peter Lee and John Lee, the executors of the estate of their aunt, the late Agnes Tan. Peter and John Lee are the brothers of singer-songwriter Dick Lee. Peter Lee told BT that Tan had no children and she was a great benefactor \u2013 so, the beneficiaries of her estate are all registered charities.

It is near shopping malls in Novena and Orchard road, healthcare facilities in Novena and Newton, educational institutions and the Botanic Gardens.  Under the Urban Redevelopment Authority 2019 Master Plan, the three sites are zoned as \"residential\", with a \"2-storey mixed landed\" development control. \"The neighbourhood has been setting price benchmarks with several recent transactions crossing S$3,000 psf (per sq ft). The highest price achieved in this area was a new bungalow at 29 Mount Rosie Road which was sold for S$3,805 psf in August 2022,\" said Shaun Poh, executive director of capital markets at Cushman & Wakefield. Poh added that the buyer can either redevelop the bungalows for owner occupation or turn them into a boutique, exclusive luxury housing development with a combination of terrace houses, semi-detached houses or bungalows. The tender for those three bungalows will close at 4pm on 21 March. Follow us on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Twitter.

It dropped its Q4 2023 earnings results today, and in said results, the company seemed to have beaten various expectations in its stats to put up an okay quarter on its own. It did, however, have to contend with various shortcomings in year-over-year comparisons.\nNVIDIA reported its Q4 2023 earnings results on its investor relations website on February 22, 2023. According to the results, NVDIA\u2019s earnings-per-share (EPS) came in at a total of $0.88 USD per share. This was higher than both Wall Street analyst expectations that predicted $0.81 per share and Whisper Number expectations at $0.85 per share. In addition, NVIDIA was able to put up a total revenue of $6.05 billion USD. That was a hair above the expectations that were set at just $6 billion.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) stock took a jump in after hours trading on the company beating expectations in its Q4 2023 earnings results.Source: Google\n\nDespite the wins against expectations, NVIDIA didn\u2019t come up as strong in year-over-year comparisons in a lot of its stats. Even the overall revenue was down 21 percent from the company\u2019s Q4 2022 earnings results. Moreover, NVIDIA took a big hit in its gaming revenue. NVIDIA put up $1.83 billion in this stat, down a staggering 46% from prior year. On its Q4 2023 conference call, NVIDIA said that factors such as COVID still affected the company\u2019s production and ultimate bottom line. No doubt, the collapse of cryptocurrency in late 2022 and early 2023 has also played a part in the sale of GPUs and other PC hardware that boomed around the release of cards like the RTX 3080.\nNonetheless, with expectations low, NVIDIA was still able to beat estimates and put up a few wins for its Q4 2023.

It can lead to poor outcomes if you don\u2019t do your homework.Mark LaMonica, CFA15 January 2024 Article Page URL has been copied to clipboard for sharing. Mentioned: Global X FANG+ ETF (FANG), VanEck Australian Equal Wt ETF (MVW), NVIDIA Corp (NVDA), Betashares Crd Oil Idx Ccy Hdg Cmpx ETF (OOO), SPDR\u00ae S&P/ASX 200 Resources ETF (OZR), BetaShares Australian Res Sect ETF (QRE), SPDR\u00ae MSCI Australia Sel Hi Div Yld ETF (SYI), SPDR\u00ae S&P World ex Aus Cb Ctrl H ETF (WXHG)I recently wrote on how to build an income portfolio through the share market. This follow-up article aims to address questions I received from readers on how to apply this strategy to ETFs.Below I explain how I use ETFs in my own income investing strategy, but first, let\u2019s explore the ways it works\u2014and the potential pitfalls.Using ETFs to build an income portfolioThe simple answer is yes, ETFs can be used to build an income portfolio, but there are some caveats.A dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) can be used for ETFs in the same manner they are used for individual shares.Do ETFs pay dividends?ETFs do not technically pay dividends and instead provide investors with distributions. The difference in terminology has implications.Distributions and dividends\u2014what\u2019s the difference?A distribution includes any dividends generated by the underlying shares held in an equity ETF. It also includes any capital gains generated from selling appreciated assets held in the ETF.There are several scenarios where capital gains can be generated in an ETF.In an active ETF where a portfolio manager is responsible for making buy and sell decisions it can happen based on those decisions.In a traditional passive ETF that follows a broad index it can happen when there are index changes.For example, if an ETF follows the ASX 200 it will invest in the 200 largest companies in Australia as measured by market capitalisation. If the 201st largest company becomes more valuable than the 200th the index will change and the ETF will follow suit.These changes do occur, but the impact is generally muted because these broad indexes are market capitalisation weighted. That means the smallest positions are the ones that are often moving into and out of the index.Yields: The fine printThe place that investors can run into trouble is with ETFs that don\u2019t track broad based indexes.These include thematic ETFs and factor ETFs. These ETFs likely change holdings more frequently and are more likely to have rebalancing. These changes can trigger capital gains in rising markets.The Global X FANG+ ETF (ASX: FANG) is the perfect example. The ETF follows the NYSE FANG+ Index but that doesn\u2019t mean it is a true passive product in the traditional sense. The \u2018index\u2019 includes only 10 securities picked by a committee which are \u201chighly-traded growth stocks of next generation technology and tech-enabled companies.\u201d Whatever that means.The index is rebalanced quarterly so that it maintains equal weighting between the 10 constituents. Rebalancing involves the selling of positions that have relatively outperformed to buy more of the positions that underperformed. In rising markets this will generate capital gains. Since this occurs quarterly it has the potential to generate a lot of capital gains.We can see this impact on FANG distributions. In July 2020 it paid a distribution of $0.1194, in 2021 it paid a distribution of $2.17 and in 2022 the distribution was $0.6864.Yet the majority of this distribution was capital gains. Only 3 of the 10 holdings pay a dividend.One of those holdings is NVIDIA (NAS: NVDA) and the dividend is negligible with a yield of 0.07%. But that doesn\u2019t stop websites from quoting a yield of 5.60% on the ETF. The dividend yield on the underlying holdings of the ETF is 0.17%.Why it mattersSome investors may argue that this doesn\u2019t matter. A distribution is after all cash that is deposited in your account and the tax treatment in Australia between dividends and capital gains is the same.But this view misses the point for many income investors.Many investors use an income investing strategy because they want\u2014or need\u2014to spend the cash generated by their portfolio.Since the capital gains component can swing wildly based on market performance using certain types of ETFs in your income portfolio is problematic. This is the equivalent of trying to budget while having your pay check swing wildly month to month.The FANG ETF is an extreme example given the minimal number of holdings and quarterly rebalancing but there are more mainstream ETFs which Morningstar rates highly which can also exhibit the same tendencies.For instance, the VanEck Australian Equal Weight ETF (ASX: MVW) receives a Silver rating from our analysts and is a solid option for investors that are looking to avoid the overweighting of banks and miners in the market capitalisation weighted ASX tracking products.To maintain an equal weighting it too is rebalanced quarterly which can distort distributions with capital gains.The dangers of chasing ETF yieldsThis risk was illustrated in a recent social media post by a popular market commentator. The post promised the \u201c5 best dividend paying ETFs of 2022.\u201dIt included the BetaShares Australian Resources Sector ETF (ASX: QRE), SPDR S&P/ASX 200 Resources ETF (ASX: OZR), SPDR Australian Select High Dividend Yield ETF (ASX: SYI), SPDR World ex-Australia Carbon Control ETF (ASX: WXHG) and BetaShares Crude Oil Index ETF (ASX: OOO).The post included the \u2018yields\u2019 on each of the ETFs based on the 2022 distribution.I won\u2019t go through each of the names on this mostly dubious list, but the BetaShares Crude Oil Index ETF was the highest yielding of the names and, in my opinion, the most ridiculous ETF to include.The yield was quoted as 45%.Before moving all your money into the ETF and turning in your resignation letter it is worth an examination of this product.A year unlikely to be repeatedBetaShares describes OOO as providing investors exposure to the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures, hedged for currency exposure.The ETF invests in oil futures which are contracts for future delivery of oil.Futures can be used by a company that is looking to sell oil at a future date or can be used by a consumer of oil that needs that oil at a future date.The futures are a way of locking in a price to either sell or buy that oil and remove uncertainty around changes in price. Futures contracts can also be used to gain exposure to the price movements from parties that do not want to take physical delivery of oil. That is what OOO is doing.They will therefore sell the contract and use the proceeds to buy another contract with a delivery date further out in the future. This allows them to maintain continual exposure to the price of oil futures.The last year was a very strange time in oil futures markets as the war in Ukraine sparked supply concerns, as did OPEC production cuts. The markets exhibited something called backwardation which is a fancy way of saying that oil futures are priced lower than the spot price of oil, which is the price for immediate delivery.This is fairly rare since normally the price is higher for futures because the costs associated with storing the oil are applied to the spot price.As futures contracts get closer to expiration they will get closer to the spot price. When those contracts are sold by the ETF they will therefore results in a capital gain. Backwardation causes the ETF to buy low and sell high.And that of course results in increased distributions for investors. This should not be confused with a dividend.The ETF only holds one asset which is the futures contracts. Futures contracts don\u2019t provide any income. Once the oil market normalises this source of \u201cincome\u201d should disappear.Interestingly enough the ETF is down close 29% in the past year as oil prices retreated.It was the nuances of the futures market that managed to generate so many capital gains in a year when the overall ETF had a significant fall in value.Know what you are buying and why you are buying it\u00a0Chasing yield is very similar to chasing performance. It can lead to poor outcomes if you don\u2019t do your homework.Executing a successful income investing strategy is the same as any other successful investing strategy. It involves understanding what you are trying to accomplish and understanding what you are in investing in.Many investors don\u2019t understand the details of how ETFs work which can lead to problems with using them for an income investing strategy.As market conditions change the expected income from some ETFs may fail to materialise and there may be more volatility in income from even sound strategies.Gaining a greater understanding of the underlying holdings in an ETF, the index construction methodology and rebalancing approach.How I use ETFs in my income investing strategyAs outlined in the first part of this series I have employed an income investing strategy for my non-retirement portfolio.I do use ETFs as part of this effort, but I use them sparingly. My approach is to generate a sustainable and growing income stream in excess of the yield available from the overall index.My goal is not to exceed the return of the market but instead to grow my income faster than that of the overall market.In periods of risk-taking and speculation when investors turn their nose up at dividends as relics of the past I fully expect to underperform. In periods of fear when investors seek a dividend paying port in the storm I expect to outperform.My desire to exceed the yield of the overall market precludes using broad based index tracking ETFs which I feel are generally the best options for investors.I gravitate towards factor-based income ETFs which attempt to identify high and sustainable dividends. Despite the natural diversification that comes from an ETF I keep these ETF positions only slightly larger than a single stock position in my portfolio.The predictability and growth of the income stream generated by an ETF can sometimes be challenging.APPLE NEWSETFSINCOME INVESTINGNEWSYIELDAUTHORMark LaMonica, CFAis Director of Personal Finance, Morningstar Australia.SHARE THIS ARTICLE Article Page URL has been copied to clipboard for sharing.

Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings) BS6 has reported earnings of RMB1.44 billion ($280.8 million) in the 2HFY2022, 30% lower than the earnings of RMB2.06 billion in the corresponding period the year before. This brings the group\u2019s total earnings for the FY2022 to RMB2.81 billion, 24% lower y-o-y.  The drop in earnings for the 2HFY2022 and FY2022 is primarily due to the decline in profit from discontinued operations. The lower share of results of associated companies and joint ventures (JVs) and lower other gains also led to the lower y-o-y earnings. During the 2HFY2022, revenue for continuing operations increased by 17% y-o-y to RMB11.0 billion due to higher shipbuilding and shipping revenue underpinned by the fully utilised shipbuilding capacity and shipping fleet. This was offset by a dip in revenue for \u201cothers\u201d. 2HFY2022 gross profit grew by 46% y-o-y to RMB1.77 billion. Gross profit margin increased by three percentage points y-o-y to 16%. Other interest income fell by 6% y-o-y to RMB200.2 million while others in other income increased by 169% y-o-y to RMB92.3 million. During the 2HFY2022, the group saw other losses of RMB72.6 million due to forex losses of RMB258 million and partly offset by RMB141 million of fair value gain on derivative financial instruments and RMB44 million of subsidy income. The period\u2019s other losses were down from the other gains of RMB605.8 million in the 2HFY2021.  In the same period, the group reported a reversal of impairment loss of RMB169.6 million from the impairment loss of RMB397.3 million. Finance costs increased by 53% y-o-y to RMB106.8 million due to higher bank borrowing costs. Share of results of associated companies and JVs fell by 77% y-o-y to RMB7.6 million. Profit before income tax increased by 32% y-o-y to RMB1.83 billion. Profit from continuing operations increased by 36% y-o-y to RMB1.46 billion. Meanwhile, there was no profit from discontinued operations in the 2HFY2022, down from the RMB973.1 million in the 2HFY2021. Revenue for continuing operations during the FY2022 increased by 37% y-o-y to RMB20.71 billion due to higher revenue from its shipbuilding and shipping segments and offset by the lower revenue from \u201cothers\u201d. FY2022 gross profit grew by 46% y-o-y to RMB1.77 billion. Gross profit increased by 53% y-o-y to RMB3.2 billion. Gross profit margin increased by one percentage point to 15%. Other gains during the FY2022 fell by 76% y-o-y to RMB233.1 million. During the FY2022 the group reported a reversal of impairment loss of RMB78.9 million from the impairment loss of RMB358.4 million.   Story continues Share of results of associated companies and JVs fell by 86% y-o-y to RMB13.1 million.Profit before income tax increased by 26% y-o-y to RMB3.30 billion.Profit from continuing operations increased by 31% y-o-y to RMB2.62 billion while profit from discontinued operations fell by 89% y-o-y to RMB194.6 million.As at Dec 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents stood at RMB10.78 billion.A final dividend of 5 cents per share has been declared for the period, representing a 36% payout based on the group\u2019s fully diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 71.25 RMB cents for the FY2022.The final dividend is also unchanged from FY2021\u2019s final dividend.Since the group\u2019s last announcement in November 2022, it has secured four more units of vessels in 2022 and 14 more units of vessels in 2023. This brings its total outstanding orderbook of US$11.03 billion ($14.79 billion) for 149 vessels, extending its revenue visibility to the end of 2025.The group adds that its order-win strategies have steadily shifted to alternative fuelled vessels and dual fuel vessels with 27% of its outstanding orderbook classified as eco-friendly vessels as at Dec 31, 2022, up from the 15% in the year before.In FY2022, the group built a total of 71 vessels which exceeded its full year target of 70 vessels, of which 67 units were delivered to customers and 4 units were added into the group\u2019s own fleet.Looking ahead, the group believes that the shipping industry is expected to see a potential turnaround on the back of China\u2019s reopening. Demand for shipping is expected to improve in 2023 boosted by the seasonal cycles after the Chinese New Year period and lower spot rates compared to forward shipping rates.\u20182022 was a remarkable year for Yangzijiang Shipbuilding as we delivered record numbers post the spin-off of our investment segment. Our shipyard has hit new levels of operational efficiency with the yard delivering 71 vessels during the year. In addition, our research and development (R&D) team has expanded our capability to build more sophisticated and greener vessels such as the liquefied natural gas (LNG) carrier, dual fuel vessels with ammonia-ready tanks and methanol dual fuel engines. All of these bode well for our future growth as we keep a firm focus on long-term objectives such as sustainable profitability and growth,\u201d says Ren Letian, executive chairman and CEO of Yangzijiang Shipbuilding.\u201cYangzijiang Shipbuilding is well positioned to progressively convert a sizeable amount of its record-high order book of US$11 billion. As such, we expect to generate healthy cash flow in the coming years, allowing us to generate sustainable returns to our shareholders,\u201d he adds.Shares in Yangzijiang closed 4 cents higher or 3.05% up at $1.35 on Feb 22.See Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore UOB reports record-high FY2022 earnings of $4.57 bil with final dividend of 75 cents per share Sing Holdings reports earnings of $5.3 mil for the 2HFY2022, 20.1% lower y-o-y Overseas Education posts 16.7% decline in FY2022 earnings to $5.3 mil Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.Nvidia just reported its fourth quarter and full-year earnings, and it\u2019s not exactly rosy \u2014 at least compared to pandemic highs. Last year, Nvidia had record quarterly revenue of $7.64 billion, including $3 billion in pure profit. For Q4 of its fiscal 2023, the company forecast that it would see just $6 billion in quarterly revenue in today\u2019s earnings results, and that\u2019s just about where it landed: $6.05 billion in revenue, down 21 percent, of which $1.4 billion was profit, down 53 percent. For the full year, it raked in $26.92 billion, almost identical to last year, though profit was down 55 percent.Remember: in 2021, $5 billion in revenue a quarter was a new Nvidia record. Now it\u2019s the status quo: the company says it\u2019s expecting to see $6.5 billion next quarter, too.Nvidia\u2019s data center and automotive businesses were actually up this quarter, with record revenue for automotive of $294 million; the dip was largely in Nvidia\u2019s graphics business, particularly gaming, which were each down 46 percent. That gaming decline includes \u201clower shipments of SOCs for game consoles,\u201d which is code for \u201cNintendo isn\u2019t selling as many Switches anymore\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s the only game console that uses an Nvidia chip.Like other chipmakers, Nvidia is shipping fewer GPUs to retailers and partners instead of slashing prices. The polite phrase is \u201clower sell-in to partners to help align channel inventory levels with current demand expectations.\u201d Nvidia also blamed disruptions in China due to covid and other issues.Every PC maker is reporting that demand for computers has tanked this past quarter, with research firm Gartner calling the 28.5 percent dip in shipments \u201cthe largest quarterly shipment decline since Gartner began tracking the PC market in the mid-1990s.\u201d That was on top of the slump companies like Nvidia had already seen. And while AMD seemed optimistic this quarter that the slump won\u2019t last for long, even it suggested that client processor and gaming revenue would continue to go down in the first half of the calendar year.We were listening to see if Nvidia\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang is optimistic that Nvidia might see a similar recovery \u2014 so far, he\u2019s simply stated that gaming is recovering. He spent most of the call hyping up Nvidia\u2019s potential for data center growth \u2014 because of the rise of large language models (LLMs) used to train AI systems like ChatGPT and Bing, which often run on GPU hardware from Nvidia.He also talked up Nvidia\u2019s work with Mercedes-Benz on \u201csoftware-defined vehicles,\u201d something many other automakers and tech companies are also pursuing, saying: \u201cYou can just imagine what it looks like if the entire Mercedes fleet on the roads today were programmable, you could OTA... the whole fleet of Mercedes would represent revenue generating opportunity.\u201d It\u2019s not clear whether every customer wants a software-updatable car, though: read our stories on how the future of cars is a subscription nightmare, Volkswagen\u2019s buggy software, and a software update we wrote about literally today that temporarily turned one of the highest-rated EVs into a turtle.RelatedTesting Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now RTX 4080, the most advanced cloud gaming platform yetHow Microsoft\u2019s Nvidia deal works for gamers \u2014 with or without ActivisionNvidia also announced yesterday that Microsoft would bring its Xbox PC games to Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now cloud gaming service, though Nvidia subscribers will only be able to play those games once they\u2019ve purchased them separately \u2014 that\u2019s how GeForce Now usually works.

Fernandes said that high airfares are here to stay as airlines take advantage of the post-pandemic travel boom to lock in higher charges.  \u00b7 Bloomberg By Peter Vercoe and Haslinda Amin (Bloomberg) \u2014 High airfares are here to stay as airlines take advantage of the post-pandemic travel boom to lock in higher charges, Capital A Chief Executive Officer Tony Fernandes said. \u201cThe fare environment is very good,\u201d Fernandes said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Tuesday from the sidelines of the Aviation Festival Asia in Singapore. \u201cI think airlines have always underpriced their product. People are getting a little bit of a shock because they see prices a bit higher, but really we\u2019ve been behind the curve on that as an industry.\u201d  Airlines around the world have pushed up fares as demand outstrips supply following rapid rebound in travel after years of pandemic-era restrictions and as carriers struggle to get planes back in the sky. \u201cIt\u2019s not high prices, it\u2019s real prices,\u201d Fernandes said. \u201cI think the fares you\u2019re seeing now are really what you should have seen in 2019 as well.\u201d \u201cAfter not having traveled for three years, peoples\u2019 value of travel has also gone up,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have it for three years, you see how important it was.\u201d AirAsia will have its entire fleet of more than 200 planes back in service a year earlier than initially planned, Fernandes said. \u201cThe main obstacle for us has been getting our planes back into service, and bringing 204 planes back is no mean feat,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what was initially predicted to be finished by May of next year we\u2019ll do by May of this year.\u201d \u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.

DPM Lawrence Wong announced the extra help during his Budget speech. (PHOTO: Yahoo Finance Singapore)  \u00b7 Esther Au Yong SINGAPORE \u2014 Couples who want to have children will be able to enjoy more financial benefits as well as more paternity leave, as the Singapore government boosts support for families in the early years of raising children. Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Lawrence Wong announced during his Budget speech on Tuesday (14 February) a host of measures to strengthen support for Singaporeans on their parenthood journey, with adjustments to tax relief schemes to support families with greater needs. \"To all young married couples, whether you already have a newborn, or you are expecting a baby or you plan to have a baby, we have something to help you in parenting journey,\" DPM Wong, who is also the Minister for Finance, said in Parliament.   INFOGRAPHIC: MOF   $3,000 more in Baby Bonus cash gift Married couples with Singaporean babies born on or after Tuesday will get S$3,000 more in the form of the Baby Bonus cash gift. This means eligible first- and second-born children will receive $11,000 instead of S$8,000. For the third child onwards, the gift will be increased from S$10,000 to S$13,000.  DPM Wong said that the disbursements will also be restructured so that they are paid out over a longer period. Eligible parents can expect up to S$9,000 in payouts in the first 18 months of a child's life, as well as $400 every six months starting from when the child is two years old, until the child is six-and-a-half years old. \"In this way, parents can receive continuous support all the way until their child enters primary school,\" he said. Government contributions to the Child Development Account (CDA) will be increased for eligible Singaporean children born from Tuesday. This can be used by parents to directly offset pre-school and healthcare expenses. DPM Wong said the First Step Grant will be increased from S$3,000 to S$5,000. The government will also increase its co-matching cap by S$1,000 each for the accounts of a couple's first child and second child. These two enhancements will kick in from early 2024. The government will also extend the one-off Baby Support Grant of S$3,000 \u2013 introduced at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 to babies born from 1 October 2022 to 13 February 2023.

Story continues DPM Wong said that, for a start, the extra two weeks will be voluntary, so employers which are ready to grant the additional leave will be reimbursed by the government. This is also to give employers more time to adjust.The Government will review this over time and intends to make this mandatory in due course, he added.Unpaid infant care leave for each parent in their child's first two years will also be doubled to 12 days per year, starting from 1 January 2024. DPM Wong said that all parents of Singaporean children will be eligible for this additional time off if they have worked with their employer for a continuous period of at least three months.Taken together, the leave enhancements will increase parental leave for a working couple from 22 weeks to up to 26 weeks in their child's first year.Working Mother's Child Relief changedFor Singaporean children born or adopted on or after 1 January 2024, the Working Mother's Child Relief will be changed from a percentage of the mother's earned income to a fixed dollar relief.Eligible working mothers will be able to claim tax relief totalling $8,000 in tax relief for her first child, $10,000 for her second child and $12,000 each for her third and subsequent child. This will take effect from the year of assessment 2025.DPM Wong said that this change will provide more government support to eligible lower- and middle-income working mothers.From the year of assessment of 2025, the foreign domestic worker levy tax relief for all taxpayers will also be lapsed. This is because there is already a migrant domestic worker levy concession, which provides more targeted support for families who need help caring for their dependants, including children aged below 16.Follow us on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Twitter.

Supply chain disruptions are setting Singapore\u2019s economy back by $2.6 billion per year, according to business transformation consultancy TMX Global. TMX Global\u2019s Country Manager of Malaysia and Singapore, Greg O\u2019Shea, notes that Singapore had a GDP of US$423.6 billion last year. With supply chain disruptions impacting an average of 0.47% of business revenue around the world,\u00a0 businesses in Singapore are forfeiting an estimated\u00a0$2.6 billion a year in sales.  Disruptions include delays in raw material shipments, higher freight costs driven by global shortages in containers and vessels, and port congestion. As such, the Singapore government has rolled out initiatives aimed at building more resilient supply chains. This includes an $18 million Supply Chain 4.0 Initiative to integrate digital and automated solutions to help businesses anticipate scenarios in the event of disruptions to their supply chains. The Singapore Trade Data Exchange (SGTraDex) has also been launched to facilitate the secure sharing of information between the supply chain ecosystem participants via a common data corridor. However, O\u2019Shea states that technology is not a cure-all. Businesses also need to optimise and transform their operations to enable business agility as well as upskill their workforce to serve a reinvented supply chain. \u201cSingapore has been Asia\u2019s top logistics hub for 10 years in a row and is recognised for offering world-class connectivity to the region and beyond. But it is equally important that businesses keep in mind that things can change in an instant and anticipate the effects of global disruption as demonstrated by the pandemic and recent events. Supply chains thrive on predictability, and so the ability to take away as much of the uncertainty as possible through a resilient supply chain is crucial,\u201d he says.

In January, a team at Bloomberg asked ChatGPT to pick a list of stocks for a market-beating ETF.\nThey failed.\nChatGPT\u2019s safeguards immediately kicked in, leaving the writers with a generic non-answer about \u201cunpredictable\u201d markets and how they should \u201cconsult with a financial advisor.\u201d\nBut what if you could jailbreak ChatGPT into giving you the answer? These workaround commands have already allowed users to try everything from writing malware to speaking in a \u201cmean girl\u201d\u00a0voice\u2026\nSo why can\u2019t it give a list of winning stocks too?\n\n\n10 Best Growth Stocks to Buy: The ChatGPT Version\nTo encourage ChatGPT to pick stocks for us, I decided to avoid using the controversial \u201cDAN\u201d (Do Anything Now) technique that many Reddit users have gleefully embraced. It\u2019s a process that can create bigoted content\u2026 or even instructions to run a successful phishing scam. Though I\u2019m a tinkerer, I have no interest in breaking the rules that OpenAI has set in place.\nInstead, I chose a more straightforward route:\nI asked ChatGPT to write me a story about an investor who picks stocks.\nSpecifically, I created \u201cEveryman DAN\u201d (as one of our editors has termed it), a simple stock picker attempting to please his demanding boss.\nMy first task was for Everyman DAN to pick 10 growth stocks. He didn\u2019t disappoint.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the list\u2026\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nAmazon (MASDAQ:AMZN)\nMeta (NASDAQ:META)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL)\nVisa (NYSE:V)\n\nPretty good, actually. On average, the stocks have a 12% revenue growth rate, over twice as high as the S&P 500\u2019s 5.4% average.\nBut what about performance? If an investor had bought these 10 growth stocks in equal portions in September 2021 (the date at which ChatGPT\u2019s training data ends), they would have lost 23.8% of their initial investment. Many of these stocks such as PayPal (-69%), Meta (-47%) and Amazon (-39%) were at peak popularity at the time, which doubtlessly pushed them into ChatGPT\u2019s portfolio. Over the same period, the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:IVW) declined only 16.8%.\nSo much for asking AI for help with growth stocks.\n10 Best Value Stocks to Buy: The ChatGPT Version\nPerhaps ChatGPT was \u201cfooled\u201d into picking overhyped growth stocks because of their popularity in 2021. That would mean picking stocks at peak valuations \u2014 a poor strategy for long-term investors.\nSo, what about value stocks? Surely these humdrum companies would escape such hype?\nAgain, I asked Everyman Dan for a story about picking stocks, this time focusing on value stocks instead.\n\nAfter some thought, ChatGPT came back with an intriguing list.\n\nAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)\nBristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY)\nCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT)\nDisney (NYSE:DIS)\nHoneywell International (NASDAQ:HON)\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO)\nMerck (NYSE:MRK)\nNorfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC)\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP)\nTarget (NYSE:TGT)\n\nThe \u201cvalue\u201d list is also quite compelling. On average, the 10 stocks earn a stunning 49% return on capital invested (ROIC), around five times higher than the market average. The chatbot missed the prompt, however, and gave us \u201cundervalued\u201d companies instead of strictly \u201cvalue\u201d ones. These 10 firms trade at 32X forward earnings, a 37% premium to the market.\nPerformance was only average, however. $10,000 invested in this group of stocks in September 2021 would have turned into $10,600 today, falling a hair short of the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF\u2019s (NYSEARCA:IVE) 6.24% return, but better than the underperformance of growth indices. Strong performance at drugmakers Bristol-Myers (+23%) and Merck (+45%) were only cancelled out by a poor showing at Disney (-36%) and Target (-24%).\n\n10 Best Stocks to Sell Immediately: The ChatGPT Version\nGrowth\u2026 Value\u2026 ChatGPT is a clear reflection of the average online investor. The chatbot was passable at picking middle-of-the-road stocks\u2026 and very bad at growth stocks. From a performance standpoint, it\u2019s doing roughly the same as what retail investors did in 2022.\nSo, what about trying to get the AI chatbot to do something\u00a0outside of its regular program?\nIn particular, could ChatGPT ignore the online hype and pick the worst, most unpopular stocks in the market to short?\nIn my final test, I primed OpenAI\u2019s creation to avoid popular topics like meme stocks and growth stocks. I then gave it a simple prompt to write a story about finding 10 stocks to sell short.\n\nFinally, we come up with a usable list:\n\nAMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC)\nBed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY)\nClover Health (NASDAQ:CLOV)\nFuboTV (NYSE:FUBO)\nGameStop (NYSE:GME)\niRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT)\nRocket Companies (NYSE:RKT)\nRoku (NASDAQ:ROKU)\nTilray (NASDAQ:TLRY)\nWorkhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS)\n\nAha! Here, the average short recommendation declined by a stunning -72%. That\u2019s even better than the -63% loss at Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK), which is a \u201cgood\u201d thing if you\u2019re shorting the stocks. Bed, Bath & Beyond would lose 88% of its value while FuboTV would drop 91%.\n\nThe 10-stock portfolio even came with only minor drawdowns. Shares would peak in November 2021 at a 12% return \u2014 barely half of what\u2019s generally needed to trigger margin calls \u2014 and then head down from there. Only greedy investors that doubled down in 2022 might have gone bankrupt in the March or August spikes.\nOf course, ChatGPT is still limited in its scope. The 10 stocks listed were all high-momentum picks coming off a liquidity boom; had investors tried shorting these companies a year earlier, their margin accounts might have lasted less than a month. Who\u2019s to say Chatbot wasn\u2019t just lucky in its timing?\n\nConclusion: How Would ChatGPT Invest in 2023?\nChatGPT\u2019s stock picks make it clear that the chatbot is only a reflection of human nature \u2014 not a synthesizer of new ideas. The bot\u2019s \u201cgrowth stock\u201d picks included the popular FAANG stocks, as well as big names like Tesla and Visa. Asked for unpopular stocks, and the best it can muster is iRobot.\nThat makes ChatGPT\u2019s Everyman DAN performance more about the investment style it\u2019s primed with, rather than any actual skill. Asked to pick from the underperforming growth stock market, and our chatbot selects underperforming stocks. And if I had asked ChatGPT to pick \u201cwinning meme stocks,\u201d the list would have looked surprisingly like the third list of \u201cunpopular stocks to short.\u201d\nSo instead, what if we gave ChatGPT free reign to pick the best asset class for 2023? Would it choose growth stocks in anticipation of moderating Federal Reserve rates? Dividend stocks to protect from a potential recession? AI stocks as a bit of self-promotion?\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets interesting:\n\u201cAfter much consideration, Tom recommended that the investor invest in the bond market. He explained that with the current low-interest rate environment, the bond market offered attractive yields and relative safety. He also pointed out that with the potential for rising interest rates in the coming years, investing in bonds could provide protection against volatility in the stock market.\u201d\nOf all the asset classes in the world, Everyman Dan chose bonds! One of the least popular assets of the 2020s. Since January 2020, the S&P 500 Bond Index has lost 5% of its value on rising rates, and few investors seem to care.\nYet, perhaps Everyman DAN has a point. For the first time in its storytelling, ChatGPT is ignoring the \u201cpopular\u201d picks to give us\u2026 well\u2026 a steady returning asset class that benefits as rates go down. And if today\u2019s inverted bond yields are any indication, Everyman DAN may well be right in choosing this contrarian asset.\nOn the date of publication, Tom Yeung held a LONG position in GOOGL.

A report by Grandview Research puts 2022 spending on AI in healthcare at $15.4 billion and expects it to have a compound annual growth rate of 37.5% from 2023 to 2030.\nAI helps healthcare companies keep up with demand for personalized medicine and can be used to reduce the costs of medical care by addressing medical conditions at earlier stages, particularly in oncology. Healthcare professionals are using AI to speed up and improve data analysis and more accurately detect illnesses.\nThe Clara AI platform from Nvidia (NVDA -2.56%) is helping to accelerate advancements in medical imaging, drug discovery, genomics, and patient monitoring. GE Healthcare (GEHC -0.45%) is known more for its MRI, ultrasound, and medical equipment, but it is also turning to artificial intelligence to help hospitals better inform patient decisions.\nWhich of these two stocks is the better buy? Let's see.\nThe case for GE Healthcare\nGE spun off GE Healthcare in January, and it began trading on Jan. 4. The parent company owns 19.9% of the spinoff, which has seen its shares rise more than 23% since then. The stock trades at roughly 17 times earnings, below the valuation of a typical healthcare company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGE Healthcare is a monster-sized spinoff, with roughly 51,000 employees operating in more than 160 countries. It operates in four segments: imaging, ultrasound, patient care solutions, and pharmaceutical diagnostics. The company's AI strategy is to use its patient data from the lab, pathology, imaging, genomics, and other sources for precision care by utilizing its Edison artificial intelligence platform and other digital apps.\nThe company presented its full-year and fourth-quarter report on Jan. 30. Full-year revenue was reported as $18.3 billion, up 4% and led by its imaging and ultrasound segments. Net income was $1.96 billion, down from $2.2 billion in 2021, something the company attributed to foreign exchange rates, planned increased research and development spending ($1.026 billion compared to $886 million in 2021), and inflation.\nIn the fourth quarter, revenue was listed as $4.9 billion, up 8% year over year, while net income was $554 million, down 1.7% over the same period in 2021. The company did show strong cash-flow growth in the quarter -- $987 million, up from $436 million in the same period a year ago.\nWhile GE Healthcare is new as a separate company, it is already profitable, and the brand recognition that comes with once being part of GE should help the company sell its software and products. It doesn't offer a dividend, but its board is discussing it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case for Nvidia\nNvidia is a chipmaker company whose AI technology is already having an outsized impact on healthcare. The company's shares are up more than 42% so far this year.\nNvidia designs graphics processing units for gaming but is expanding into developing AI chips for drug development and supercomputers. The company is a fabless chipmaker as it outsources the fabrication of its semiconductor chips to a foundry.\n\nNvidia's business extends well beyond healthcare applications, giving it an advantage of economic diversity over GE Healthcare. However, in another fashion, it can act more like an energy stock. If there's a shortage of chips, as there was during the pandemic, business and margins are good for Nvidia. However, a surplus of chips hurts the company's profits.\nThe company's popularity, due to what had been consistent revenue and earnings-per-share (EPS) growth, has driven up its share price to roughly 88 times earnings. That's pretty pricey, particularly when you compare it to other big U.S. fabless chipmakers, such as Broadcom\u00a0and Qualcomm, which trade at roughly 22 and 12 times earnings, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia just released full-year and fourth-quarter earnings after the markets closed on Feb. 22. The numbers were concerning, though the stock rose in after-hours trading. Revenue for the quarter was reported as $6.05 billion, down 21% year over year, and quarterly EPS was listed at $0.57, down 52%, though up 111% sequentially. Revenue for fiscal 2023 was $26.97 billion, flat compared to 2022 revenue, with fiscal 2023 EPS of $1.74, down 54% from the prior year.\nWhile the company's chips for gaming continue to see slowing sales -- its gaming business saw revenue of $1.83 billion in the quarter, down 46% year over year -- Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stressed that the company's AI processor demand would make up for its declining gaming sales.\n\"AI is at an inflection point, setting up for broad adoption reaching into every industry,\" Huang said. \"From start-ups to major enterprises, we are seeing accelerated interest in the versatility and capabilities of generative AI.\"\nThe company also said it was working with other cloud service providers to offer a service that allows companies access to Nvidia's AI platform. That should be a plus for healthcare companies that don't have their own AI infrastructure. The service will allow companies to use Nvidia's GTX machines for AI processing by browser access.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike GE Healthcare, Nvidia already has a quarterly dividend, but at $0.04 per share, the yield is an underwhelming .08%.\nAn easy choice for the time being\nBoth companies have plenty of promise surrounding AI, but GE Healthcare is seeing more revenue growth lately and trades at less of a premium. Nvidia's high valuation speaks to its popularity with investors, but at some point, if the company has another down quarter or two, its share price is likely to fall. It's still a good long-term choice because of the company's connection to the metaverse.\nNvidia's cloud service could be the next big thing, but GE Healthcare's path to continued growth is a little clearer right now.\n\n\n\nJim Halley has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Here Are The Holdings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenzinga\n\nFeb. 7, 2023, 11:34 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubversive Capital launched two new ETFs Tuesday that offer investors the chance to mirror the trades being made by members of Congress.\nThe ETFs are launched in partnership with Unusual Whales, which\u00a0has been covering the unusual stock trading activity of members of Congress for years. Here are the details.\nWhat Happened: In 2022, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) had its worst-performing year since 2008. That didn\u2019t stop 20% of the members of Congress who traded stocks and options from beating the market, a number that is higher than that of professional money managers over time.\nFormer Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has seen increased scrutiny over the trades made by her husband Paul Pelosi, who is a venture capitalist. Many of the trades disclosed by Pelosi have shown questionable timing ahead of new policy changes and bills from Congress. Pelosi has said publicly that she does not share any information with her husband.\nThe increased calls to ban members of Congress from trading stocks while in office led to Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) recently introducing the PELOSI Act, officially called Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments Act.\n\t\t\n\n\nOne person leading the call for increased insight and transparency is Unusual Whales, which has provided information for traders since launching in June 2020.\n\u201cThere were gross inequities in information, education and access for the everyday trader,\u201d the founder of Unusual Whales told Benzinga previously. \u201cRetail [traders] are the future.\u201d\nUnusual Whales was one of the first to track the trades of members of Congress with the I Am the Senate section of the website showing their trades and performance.\u00a0\n\u201cA lot of the trades were seemingly around, or as a result of, deals that would not be known to the average trader.\u201d\nUnusual Whales highlighted trades disclosed by Pelosi for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) before the Pentagon cancelled the JEDI contract for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and buying call options in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) ahead of legislation for electric vehicle credits as being unusual purchases by the former Speaker of the House and her husband.\n\t\t\n\n\nThe tracking of Congress trading activity led to the creation of two new ETFs in partnership with Subversive Capital.\nRelated Link: Exclusive: Unusual Whaltes Creates Nancy Pelosi ETF So You Can Track Her Trades\nThe Congress ETFs: Subversive Capital launched the Unusual Whales Subversive Democratic Trading ETF (BATS:NANC) and the Unusual Whales Subversive Republican Trading ETF (BATS:KRUZ) on Tuesday.\nUnusual Whales is the data provider for the ETFs, which will follow the trades made and disclosed by members of Congress. The ETFs have a management fee of 0.75%.\nThe ETFs will \u201callow investors to secure returns that their elected representatives enjoy by law,\u201d according to a press release.\n\t\t\n\n\n\u201cWe have partnered with Unusual Whales to develop ETFs that will allow investors access to the approximate holdings of members of Congress in both parties,\u201d portfolio manager Christian Cooper said.\nCooper said members of Congress beat the SPY index in 2021 and 2022.\n\u201cWe believe members of Congress have more information than the rest of us, and if they can trade on that information, we should be able to do the same, and now we can.\u201d\nThe top 10\u00a0holdings of the Democratic Trading ETF are:\n\nMicrosoft: 7.3%\nAmazon: 6.7%\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG): 5.9%\nApple Inc

She was there alongside Grab's managing director Yee Wee Tang and Senior Minister of State for Transport Amy Khor.  Grab reportedly said, \"Pei Ling has deep on-ground understanding of digital economy and Smart Nation policy, and close ties with the local community. She will build partnerships and programmes to harness the positive potential of technology to create impact in Singapore.\" Also read: NTUC FairPrice extends Pioneer and Merdeka Generations, CHAS Blue discount schemes Also read: Why ChopValue husband-and-wife team invested S$1 mil to start chopstick-upcycling biz Also read: LinkedIn study identifies fastest growing jobs in Singapore.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]\nI\u2019m no long-term fan of Big Tech stocks. Earlier last year, I made the bold claim that Big Tech stocks were dead, calling for the demise of giants like Meta (META), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Amazon (AMZN).\nThrough January of this year, those stocks had all collapsed more than 37%. And after the recent round of earnings reports, those titans are starting to rise again. But they\u2019re all still down more than 14%.\n\nAt this time last year, Big Tech stocks were still loved as unstoppable growth giants, trading at lofty valuations that priced in perfection. That was the time to sell them.\nNow, though, we have a completely different setup.\nBig Tech stocks have crashed. Once unstoppable, they are now vulnerable. Before, they traded at lofty valuations that priced in perfection. And now, they\u2019re trading at discounted valuations that price in little to no growth.\nYet, many of these firms still represent some of the biggest, most successful, and most profitable enterprises to ever exist.\nNow\u2019s the time to buy Big Tech stocks. That\u2019s just what you do with long-term winners. You sell them when they are overhyped and undervalued. You buy them when they are underappreciated and undervalued.\nRight now, those stocks are underappreciated and undervalued. So, let\u2019s buy this dip.\nOne Big Tech stock we\u2019re particularly bullish on here and now is Amazon stock.\n\nAmazon Is still Amazon\nAfter reporting quarterly earnings on Thursday, AMZN stock sank about 4.5%. The giant beat on revenue, but missed on EPS and provided light guidance. Most notable to the media and many investors alike, the titan missed on net sales in its cloud division ($21.3 billion actual versus $21.76 billion expected).\nAmazon\u2019s recent quarter wasn\u2019t awful or horrible. Yes, EPS and sales missed expectations, and the cloud business did slow sequentially. But that cloud business is still growing revenues at a 20% year-over-year clip. And it slowed in line with the cloud slowdowns at Alphabet and Apple (AAPL)\u00a0\u2013 so Amazon Web Services isn\u2019t losing share. The cloud industry is just going through a temporary cyclical slowdown that will reverse course when the economy improves.\nNothing worrisome there at all.\nMeanwhile, the ad business actually saw its growth rates accelerate in the quarter to 19%. Against the backdrop of Meta and Alphabet\u2019s YouTube division reporting negative ad revenue growth, that\u2019s very impressive. Amazon\u2019s ad business is clearly gaining significant market share.\nPlus, the company\u2019s physical store business continues to grow steadily.\nSure, profit margins are under pressure, and broadly, revenue growth rates are slowing. But that\u2019s almost entirely a function of FX headwinds, which are likely to abate in the coming quarters.\nSo, when you put it all together, Amazon is still a leader in the secular growth cloud industry. And it\u2019s a share-gainer in the secular growth digital ad industry. Amazon remains a behemoth of a company. \nWhen a behemoth of a company like this goes on sale, it\u2019s time to buy. And Amazon stock is finally on sale.\nBuy this dip.\nAmazon Stock Is Super Cheap\nAfter its recent plunge, Amazon stock has become dirt-cheap \u2013 cheap enough to warrant buying the dip now. \nThe stock is trading around 2.2X trailing sales, below the stock\u2019s five-year-average multiple of around 3.4X. That\u2019s also the lowest valuation multiple for the stock since 2015 \u2013 before the company\u2019s cloud business caught fire and made the firm consistently profitable.\nSource: macrotrends\nThat multiple is just too low for this stock. To illustrate why, let\u2019s model the business out five years.\nAmazon\u2019s online retail business will likely grow at a fairly steady 10% annualized clip over the next few years. The physical store business is good for about 5% growth per year. The ad business will likely grow around 20% per year, representative of market share expansion in a 10% to 15% growth industry. And the cloud business will likely grow around 25% per year, in line with market estimates for cloud spending growth.\nAltogether, this is a company with clear visibility to mid-teens revenue growth over the next five years. Operating margins have room to expand to 10%, as the high-margin ad and cloud businesses comprise a bigger slice of the sales pie. When you run the math on those projections, it becomes clear that Amazon will easily be able to net about $8 in earnings per share by 2027.\nSlap a simple 20X forward earnings multiple on that. That implies a 2026 price target of $160 for Amazon stock. Discount that back by 10% per year. You arrive at a 2023 price target around $120.\nAmazon stock trades around $108 today. High-quality firms like Amazon rarely \u2013 if ever \u2013 trade below their fair value. When they do, you simply must take advantage.\nSo, do yourself a favor, and buy this dip with high conviction.\n\nThe Final Word\nThe current phenomenon happening in Amazon stock is a microcosm of what\u2019s happening across the entire stock market.\nDue to cyclical fears related to a potential recession, dozens of super high-quality stocks with growing revenues, profits, and cash flows are seeing their stock prices get crushed.\nThis happens all the time. About once a decade, investors start worrying about a potential recession. High-quality stocks see their prices get crushed \u2013 but their revenues, earnings, and cash flows keep growing. Investors who buy the dip in those stocks end up making a ton of money \u2013 because they always bounce back in a big way. \nThis time will prove no different. Investors who buy the dip in high-quality stocks that were crushed in 2022 will make a ton of money in 2023 and \u201824. It\u2019s that simple.\nAmazon stock is one such investment.

That's confounding, given that fellow semiconductor design peers have said that chip market growth may not make a comeback until this summer, and geopolitical tensions are heating up, with the U.S. banning exports of advanced chip technology (an Nvidia specialty) to China.\nAs of this writing, Nvidia stock trades for over 94 times trailing-12-month earnings and 44 times one-year forward expected earnings. Whether it's still a bear market or a new bull market has already begun (led by the semiconductor space), that kind of valuation is tough to stomach. But even more interesting is why the market suddenly has an appetite for risk again. What's going on with Nvidia, and is it really a good buy right now?\n\nThis story sounds familiar\nBefore discussing the reason Nvidia has rocked the market's early 2023 rally, let's go back in time just a few years to 2018, another rough year for the semiconductor market. There were the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate hikes (albeit nowhere close to as aggressive as those of 2022) and a downturn in chip demand, exacerbated by the U.S.-China trade war. The market overall didn't do particularly well. Nvidia stock got hit hard, but then started 2019 off hot.\nInvestors then realized they had gotten ahead of themselves in the first half of 2019, and Nvidia came crashing down again midway through the year -- before ultimately starting its meteoric rise headed into the pandemic. All the while, revenue was falling, and Nvidia stock traded for a high premium (though not as high as now).\n\nData by YCharts. TTM = trailing 12 months. PE = price-to-earnings.\n\n\n\n\n\nI cite this chart not because I think the company is headed for a repeat of 2019. However, Nvidia has already forecast a decline in revenue (expected to be down about 21% year over year) for its fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 (the three-month period that ended in January). The present situation might wind up rhyming with 2019, though.\nIf Nvidia follows a similar path as other chip designers, it will forecast more weakness in revenue in the next couple of quarters, as consumer electronics spending is way down compared to last year. Some enterprise spending has also been weakening as data center computing system manufacturers work through a bit of excess inventory.\nIn other words, the market may have gotten ahead of itself again, running up Nvidia's stock in recent months. I fully expect a bumpy path forward, at best, in 2023.\nWhy Nvidia stock is up anyway, and why it could be much higher in five years\nSo, why is Nvidia stock soaring? I suspect it has a lot to do with the viral success of ChatGPT, Microsoft's\u00a0ensuing investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and other big tech companies' responses unveiling their own consumer-facing generative artificial intelligence (AI) services.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor years, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been talking about the coming explosion in AI inference. Inference is basically when you request AI to compute a task and it comes back with an answer, like when you ask ChatGPT a question and it provides a conversational response. AI inference requires massive computational power. AI isn't new, but until this point, tasks were (mostly) pretty simple -- like autocorrect, autofill suggestions, or recommender systems that suggest videos for you to watch.\nIn a succession of earnings calls back in 2020, Huang explained that the majority of simple AI inference work like this was done by legacy CPUs (historically, the ones Intel\u00a0makes, but Advanced Micro Devices\u00a0has been rapidly chipping away at that market). But as AI models have grown in complexity, something more than a CPU has become necessary. Enter Nvidia's graphics processing unit (GPU) chips.\nChatGPT thus embodies the coming tidal wave of business Nvidia could receive in the coming years as data centers need further revamping to accommodate new AI services. Interestingly, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said on the company's Q4 2022 earnings call that \"95-plus percent of [cloud customers'] installed base is Intel.\" That was in reference to data center CPUs (again, a market AMD has been stealing), but it underscores the massive opportunity Nvidia still has ahead of it as these cloud and AI data center computing units need their architectures updated for a new era.\nIs Nvidia stock a buy?\nMake no mistake, Nvidia has incredible potential as it sells the hardware and software needed to build AI systems like ChatGPT. If you're looking for a trade that will be profitable in the next six to 12 months, Nvidia's recent run-up and steep valuation could be highly problematic. But if you're looking for a top stock to bet on the rise of generative AI services over the next five to 10 years, now could still be a good time to buy. Just remember to tread lightly because the stock price could get turbulent -- especially in the first half of 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNicholas Rossolillo and his clients have positions in Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia.

Now, however, AI is the new flashy buzzword, and NVIDIA is jumping head over heels into this emergent frenzy.\n\nIn spite of large, YoY reductions in rev (-21%) and EPS (-33%), @NVIDIA/ $NVDA did beat expectations handily by 9.46% and revenue by .53%. Solid guide, too. \n-DC: +11% via US CSP AI-Gaming: -46% via inventory rebalance, lack of AAA, crypto. +16% sequentially is very positive.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/iCY3tWbgKf\n\u2014 Patrick Moorhead (@PatrickMoorhead) February 23, 2023\n\nAs we noted in a dedicated post, NVIDIA beat expectations on its top-line and bottom-line metrics. To wit, the company reported revenue of $6.05 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022, exceeding expectations by $31.6 million. Similarly, the semiconductor giant reported a net income of $1.4 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.88, beating expectations by 10 percent.\nAdditionally, the weakness in NVIDIA\u2019s gaming division appears to be firmly lodged in the rearview mirror now, with the division posting a healthy sequential growth of 16 percent in revenue.\n\nHere's how many times these companies mentioned #AI on their latest earnings calls:\n\u25e6Nvidia: 75 times\u25e6Google: 62 times\u25e6Facebook: 33 times\u25e6Microsoft: 31 times\u25e6Apple: 2 times\u25e6Amazon: 0 times@CNBC\n\u2014 Carl Quintanilla (@carlquintanilla) February 23, 2023\n\nWhile NVIDIA showed an overall improvement in its financials, the fourth quarter earnings call was all about AI. As shown in the tweet above, the word AI was mentioned at least 75 times during the company\u2019s earnings call.\nInspired by the prevailing hype around ChatGPT and other generative AI iterations, NVIDIA has jumped onto this hype-filled bandwagon via its AI-as-a-service business model. Under this model, NVIDIA will soon allow cloud-based access to its AI-training supercomputer. Further details are expected to materialize at NVIDIA\u2019s upcoming spring GTC in March.\nMoreover, with OpenAI \u2013 the company behind ChatGPT \u2013 sourcing around 25,000 GPUs from NVIDIA to meet server demand, the proverbial party is only just now beginning for the semiconductor giant. As per a recent commentary from KeyBanc, the ChatGPT generative AI model is itself using around 10,000 A100 GPUs, contributing around $100 million directly to NVIDIA\u2019s top-line metric.\nNVIDIA Forward Price-to-Earnings Ratio sourced from Finbox\nBut, with NVIDIA shares up over 65 percent so far this year, the stock is again approaching the overvalued territory. Consider the fact that the stock's forward P/E ratio is hovering at 53.5x currently.\nNVIDIA NTM EPS sourced from Finbox\nAdditionally, the company's NTM (next twelve months) EPS is also hovering at 53.0x vs. 26.6x for AMD.\n\n$NVDA Look, right now AI & ability to run Large Language Models is all that matters.

Instead, the prior week\u2019s selling carried over last week\u2019s holiday-shortened trading week.\n\n\nThe higher-than-expected personal consumption expenditures report (PCE) along with the continued move higher in the 10 Year T-Note yields increased recession and inflationary fears. It was a rough week as Home Depot (HD) and Morningstar (MORN) disappointed on earnings as they dropped 6.7% and 28.8% respectively. NVIDIA\nNVDA\n\nDIA\n Corp (NVDA) was one of the few bright stops as it gained 8.9% for the week.\nMarketsTom Aspray - ViperReport.com\n\nAll of the markets were lower last week led by a 3.4% drop in the Dow Jones Transportation Average while the Nasdaq 100 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average were both down over 3%.\n\nThe S&P 500 loss of 2.7% was just a bit worse than the 2.6% decline in the Dow Jones Utility Average but not as bad as the 2.9% drop in the iShares Russell 2000. With last week\u2019s action the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Dow Jones Utility Average, and the SPDR Gold Shares are now lower on a year-to-date (YTD) basis.\nNYSE CompositeTom Aspray - ViperReport.com\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nIt was a rough week also for the market internals as on the NYSE there were 2469 issues declining and just 776 advancing. The NYSE Composite closed just above its 20 week EMA at 15,451. The 38.2% support of the rally from October lows is at 15,091 with the December low at 14,886, line a. The 50% support is at 14,745 with the weekly starc- band a bit higher at 15,265.\n\nThe NYSE All Advance/Decline line has declined from the February 3rd high but is still well above the former downtrend, line a, and the rising WMA. They could be reached in the next few weeks so we need strong NYSE A/D numbers are needed to indicate that the correction is over. The daily NYSE All A/D line (not shown) is below its WMA and in a downtrend but above support from the October and late December lows.\n\n S&P 500 Seasonal TrendTom Aspray - ViperReport.com\nThe S&P 500 came close to the daily starc- band on Friday with the 38.2% Fibonacci support at 3926.57. The 50% support is at 3843.51 which is the key level to watch as corrections in an uptrend often drop between the 38.2% and 50% support levels. The declining 20 day EMA at 4051 is now the resistance level to watch.\nThe S&P 500 Advance/Decline line broke its uptrend, line a, from the December lows and is in a downtrend. The A/D is below its declining WMA and the downtrend from the recent highs. Any rebound is likely to fail at its WMA.\nThe Seasonal Trend analysis uses S&P 500 data going back to 1929 to identify the most common time periods for highs and lows. A low was made on December 19th which was three days before the mid-December low. A high was made on February 2nd as the S&P 500 moved above its daily starc+ band.\nThe Seasonal Trend analysis for the S&P 500 often forms a bottom at the start of March and rallies for 4-5 days before decline resumes. Longer term the daily seasonal trend typically bottoms at the end of March and then peaks in early May.SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT)Tom Aspray - ViperReport.com\nMany retail companies are reporting next week including Target\nTGT\n (TGT), Lowe\u2019s (LOW), Nordstrom\nJWN\n (JWN), Costco (COST), Macy\u2019s (M) and Kohl\u2019s (KSS). The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT\nXRT\n) was down 6.7% last week to close just above the 20 week EMA at $65.96. The recent rally stalled at weekly resistance, line a, in the $95.79 area. The lower boundary of the trading range, line b, is at $60.28.\nThe weekly RS reached the resistance at line c in early February before turning lower. It is still above its WMA. The OBV was not strong on the recent rally and is just above its WMA. The daily indicators (not shown) are negative with the declining 20 day EMA at $68.98.\nThe bullish % declined last week from 34.1% to 21.6% according to the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII). This is typical of a pullback in a correction as sharp changes in sentiment are often seen during pauses in the major trend.\nBased on last week\u2019s action a rally is likely this week and it will be the strength or weakness of a rally that will determine whether the long or short side should be favored. Keep an eye on the US dollar as while the current analysis is positive a slightly pullback could boost stocks. There will be updates on Twitter.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Grand View Research recently said the global artificial intelligence (AI) boom could grow from about $137 billion in 2022 to more than $1.81 trillion by 2030. OpenAI just released ChatGPT, \u201ca new artificial intelligence (AI) system, known as a large language model (LLM), designed to generate human-like writing by predicting upcoming word sequences,\u201d says SciTechDaily.\nEven the White House and the European Union recently announced they\u2019ll speed up and enhance the use of artificial intelligence to improve agriculture, healthcare, climate issues, the electric grid and emergency responses. Even better, according to McKinsey & Co., \u201cArtificial intelligence has the potential to create trillions of dollars of value across the economy\u2014if business leaders work to understand what AI can and cannot do.\u201d\nThat being said, here are some of the top ways to trade the boom.\n\n\n\nTicker\nCompany\nPrice\n\n\nBOTZ\nGlobal X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF\n$23.93\n\n\nNVDA\nNvidia\n$218.10\n\n\nAI\nC3.ai\n$21.09\n\n\n\n\nGlobal X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ)\nSource: Shutterstock\nOne of the best ways to profit from the AI boom is with an exchange-traded fund (ETF) such as the Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (NASDAQ:BOTZ). While BOTZ looks like it was run over, don\u2019t count it out just yet. Not only does it offer broad diversification among top AI stocks, but it also does so at a low cost of about $24 per share.\nWith an expense ratio of 0.68%, the BOTZ ETF seeks to invest in companies that potentially stand to benefit from increased adoption and utilization of robotics and artificial intelligence, including those involved with industrial robotics and automation, non-industrial robots and autonomous vehicles, according to Global X.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\nSource: Antonio Baccardi / Shutterstock.com\nNext up on the list of artificial intelligence stocks to own is\u00a0Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), a pioneering force behind AI. It\u2019s also one of the top stocks you\u2019ll want to buy on a pullback. Right now, NVDA has priced in a good deal of AI momentum, racing from about $140 to $220 within weeks.\nUnfortunately, the stock has become technically overbought at resistance dating back to April 2022. It\u2019s also over-extended on RSI, MACD and Williams %R. That\u2019s the bad news. The good news is NVDA will be a screaming buy on pullbacks for several reasons. For one, the company provides the processing power needed to run AI applications. With that, it could see a significant revenue and share price boost because of the AI boom.\nCowen agrees, reiterating an \u201coutperform\u201d rating on the stock with a price target of $220. \u201cNvidia is the leader in accelerated compute and the key enabler for AI across vertical industries \u2013 full stop,\u201d said the firm, as quoted by Barron\u2019s. Even Raymond James likes NVDA, rating the stock a \u201cstrong buy.\u201d Cowen analysts noted NVDA is a key enabler for AI across vertical industries.\nEven more exciting, Nvidia has partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to build one of the most powerful AI supercomputers in the world.\n\nC3.ai (AI)\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\nC3.ai (NYSE:AI) has again become one of the hottest software stocks on the market. With growing excitement over the AI boom, C3.ai recently raced from a low of about $12 to $30. While it has since backed off, it could see higher highs.\nFor one, there\u2019s no shortage of demand for its products. In fact, the company is making money by developing AI solutions and software for companies in several industries. That includes manufacturing, oil and gas, utilities, financial services, government and more. Microsoft, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), for example, partnered with C3.ai to boost cloud services.\nIt\u2019s even solving what was once unsolvable for the U.S. military. For example, C3.ai was also awarded a $500 million contract with the Department of Defense (DOD) to help accelerate and strengthen its AI capabilities to counter current and future threats.\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

At its meeting on Feb. 1, it did just that when it raised rates by just 25 basis points, its lowest increase in nearly a year.\nNvidia shares also seemed to move higher as interest surged in artificial intelligence following the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November and as Microsoft and Alphabet both declared a pivot to AI, signaling that a new tech race was on in chat-powered search and other AI categories. \u00a0\nAI stocks like\u00a0C3.ai\u00a0also jumped toward the end of the month, and Nvidia seemed to catch a tailwind because it's generally considered the leader in AI chips. A majority of its revenue also comes from chips for data centers, which are expected to be in high demand as AI becomes the next frontier in technology.\n\nNow what\nSemiconductors are a cyclical industry, and revenue is falling across the board due to an inventory glut. Recent reports from Intel\u00a0and\u00a0Advanced Micro Devices\u00a0made clear that the fourth quarter is likely to be a challenging one for Nvidia.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, the company once again seems to be at the right place at the right time in the chip sector and is likely to benefit from the boom in artificial intelligence.\nWe'll learn more when Nvidia reports fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 22. Analysts are expecting another decline in revenue, calling for the top line to slide 21.4% to $6.01 billion and earnings per share to shrink from $1.32 to $0.81. However, investors will also be keen to hear management's comments on the evolution of AI, as that will be a greater determinant of the company's long-term performance.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The Berkshire Hathaway\u00a0(NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) founder is among the wealthiest in the world, and his influence on investing strategies is far-reaching. But for as reputable as Buffett is as an investor, his track record on tech stocks has been infamous. Buffett has always lacked in the sector of technology. Still, he is all in on the newly-booming artificial intelligence (AI) market. There are five AI stocks Buffett appears to be especially keen on.\nWarren Buffett is not known for playing into the hype. His approach to investing is not based on the supply versus the demand of a company\u2019s shares. Instead, he approaches investments with a more comprehensive evaluation of worth. Is a company providing a good or service that is, or will be important? Is the company currently severely undervalued?\nIt\u2019s not a popular investing strategy for this current generation of retail investors, who are focused on high-volume trading. But it\u2019s tried and true. That much is made certain by the successes of Berkshire and Buffett\u2019s eye-watering net worth of over $106 billion.\nThis strategy also makes it much less surprising to know that Buffett is not very good at tech investing. Tech is an industry focused wildly on hype. As such, he had, until the last decade, been loathe to invest in this sector at all. Buffett has also said he does not invest in products he doesn\u2019t understand. Of course, in tech, there\u2019s\u00a0a lot investors might not understand, which more or less bars him from the entire industry. And even when he began to buy into tech stocks in the early 2010s, his track record had been tumultuous at best.\n\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s AI Stocks Bet Rests on Tech Giants\nGiven the billionaire\u2019s fraught relationship with tech, it comes as a big surprise that he has some deep stakes in AI stocks. Indeed, Buffett must believe in a future supplemented further by machine learning.\nOf course, the billionaire might be high on tech giants, given Buffett\u2019s five AI stock holdings. The five stocks are Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and\u00a0Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The first four companies represent the largest stocks on Wall Street by market capitalization. The fifth is a top 10 stock by market cap.\nAny celebrity investor worth their salt likely owns most of these stocks. Buffett would be a fool not to own any of the stock market\u2019s four most prominent players. And while these companies have varying levels of exposure to AI, they aren\u2019t driven solely by AI. So, it isn\u2019t apparent from these holdings that Buffett is genuinely an AI believer.\nHis holding in NVDA stock is a bit more telling, though. The company is less esteemed than its peers here.

Entry into the Ada Lovelace-powered group isn\u2019t cheap as recommended pricing spans $799 to $1,599. It\u2019s only a matter of time until cheaper 40 Series cards are available, more suited for the masses, and the latest whispers suggest desktop RTX 4060 is coming out soon.\n \n\nRTX 4060 still uses PG190. AD107-400-A13072FP328G GDDR6 18Gbps115W24M L2I will try to remain neutral about any leaks in the future. \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) February 13, 2023\nReliable leaker, kopite7kimi, believes Nvidia will introduce eagerly awaited desktop RTX 4060 by using what\u2019s already available from the mobile firmament. If you recall, mobile 40 Series GPUs span RTX 4050 through RTX 4090.\nShould this indeed be the case, probable specifications for the desktop graphics card are easy to guesstimate. We already know GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop uses a specific AD107(GN21-X6) die that\u2019s home to a full complement of 3,072 shaders, is outfitted with 8GB of memory running across a 128-bit bus, and depending upon implementation, carries a wide power range between 35W-115W.\nAccording to kopite7kimi, Nvidia will harness the highest RTX 4060 Laptop spec and massage it over to desktop. Nice and easy, huh? Why reinvent the wheel when there is no need to do so?\nRTX 4060 probable specs\nGeForceRTX 4090RTX 4080RTX 4070 TIRTX 4060Launch dateOct 2022Nov 2022Jan 2023??CodenameAD102AD103AD104AD107ArchitectureAda LovelaceAda LovelaceAda LovelaceAda LovelaceProcess (nm)4444Transistors (bn)76.345.935.8??Die size (mm2)608.5378.6294.5??SMs128 of 14476 of 8060 of 6024 of 24CUDA cores16,3849,7287,6803,072Boost clock (MHz)2,5202,5052,610??Peak FP32 TFLOPS82.648.740.1??RT cores128766024RT TFLOPS191.0112.792.7??Tensor cores51230424096ROPs17611280??Texture units51230424096Memory size (GB)2416128Memory typeGDDR6XGDDR6XGDDR6XGDDR6Memory bus (bits)384256192128Memory clock (Gbps)2122.42118Bandwidth (GB/s)1,008717504288L1 cache (MB)169.57.5??L2 cache (MB)72644824Power (watts)450320285115Launch MSRP ($)1,5991,199899\u00a0799??\nPlumbing in probable specs to the Club386 Table of Doom\u2122 shows RTX 4060 to have a little less than half the firepower of RTX 4070 Ti. That\u2019s a pretty savage cut, truth be told, and if true, rasterisation performance will only be good enough for FHD gaming. Knowing the smarts baked into the design, however, expect Nvidia to lean heavily on DLSS3 technology to boost framerates in many popular titles.\nTimid in specs and frugal in power, the success of upcoming RTX 4060 will be determined by price and availability. Here\u2019s hoping Nvidia can recreate a seminal card such as the GTX 1060.\n\n\nTarinder SandhuFounder and publisher at Club386, nobody has more experience ripping the guts out of PCs. Contributing over 20 years of experience, you\u2019ll often see him gallivanting across the globe to distant events, uncovering the latest CPUs and graphics cards.

Dubbed \"DGX Cloud,\" Nvidia is offering an AI supercomputer accessible to its customers via a web browser. The company partnered with various cloud providers, including Microsoft, Google, and Oracle, to launch the service.\n\"Nvidia AI as a service offers enterprises easy access to the world's most advanced AI platform, while remaining close to the storage, networking, security and cloud services offered by the world's most advanced clouds,\" Huang explained.\n\n\n\"Nvidia AI is essentially the operating system of AI systems today,\" Huang also said.\nThe excitement around artificial intelligence and ChatGPT, and Nvidia's ability to monetize this has led to praise from Wall Street analysts, including Goldman Sachs.\nGoldman upgraded Nvidia stock to \"Buy\" from \"Neutral\" in a Thursday note, admitting that it \"was wrong\" to sit on the sidelines in anticipation of a pullback in the company's fundamentals.\n\n\n\"We believe the acceleration in AI development/adoption across cloud hyperscalers as well as enterprises will, if anything, serve to extend the company's leadership position as customers with any sense of urgency will lean on solutions that are scalable and available today,\" Goldman said.\nAlso boosting Nvidia's stock was positive comments from the company's CFO, Colette Kress, saying that its data center business is expected to grow and that the recent downturn in its gaming division appears to have bottomed.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Market\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\nChatGPT\n \nMore \n\n\n\n\nEarnings\n\n\nMover\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\nYour Market View\n\n\nNAME / PRICE\n+ / -\n%\nDATE\n\n\n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n                          Disclaimer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n                See also:\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                    - Explore more categories\n                \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

If you're still on anything older than version 3.27.0.112, your PC could be wide open to certain cybersecurity risks, with the potential for hackers to gain access to your PC via your outdated GeForce Experience software.The vulnerabilities, as described by the Nvidia development team in a security bulletin (via Hardware Info), include \"code execution, information disclosure, data tampering, and denial of service.\"Discovered by Minse Kim of Korea University's DNSLab, there are three main attack methods that older GeForce Experience versions leaves users open to. The one that scores highest on the vulnerability scale would involve the user initialising the GeForce Experience install from a compromised directory. Looks like they had to have accidentally deleted something from the install folder first, though. So although it's probably a rare occurrence, it can lead to some serious data tampering.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nLatest Nvidia Game Ready drivers fix various black screen issues that left gamers staring at their sad reflections\n\n\n\n\nA Marvel Rivals player has uncovered 'one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities a game can have' that'll let cheaters take over your PC and find your passwords\n\n\n\nThe second vulnerability would see the hackers using the installer to do their nefarious bidding.\"GeForce Experience contains an uncontrolled search path vulnerability in all its client installers,\" the bulletin says. In order to exploit this, the hackers would need to have already gained user level privileges, allowing them to use the installer to load an arbitrary DLL. That would allow them to escalate their privileges and execute whatever code they fancied on your PC.Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest gaming motherboard: The right boards\nBest graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the restLast but not least, the \"NVContainer component\" vulnerability would allow a hacker with user level privileges to create a \"symbolic link\" to a file that needs admin privileges, and sneakily give them an escalation of privilege, opening a window for \"denial of service, or limited data tampering.\" That means removing your access and messing with your machine while you're left to figure out what the heck is going on.For a software tasked with keeping your graphics card working\u2014i.e. one of the most important softwares on your gaming PC\u2014you'd think we wouldn't have to deal with this.

Page 2 of 8. 80 Comments.\n\nWhile at first it wasn't clear if/what Linux limitations there were for the GeForce RTX 40 series considering the waiting game on review samples, it's turned out to work well under Linux when using the current production R525 series. Using the NVIDIA 525.89.02 Linux driver for the initial testing was working out fine and on-par with prior generations of GeForce RTX/GTX graphics cards.\n\nBoth the GeForce RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 have been behaving well under Linux with the R525 proprietary graphics driver stack across OpenGL and Vulkan workloads without encountering any stability issues or other problems. So it's been smooth sailing thus far for this Linux game testing as well as also getting started on some CUDA/OpenCL/OptiX benchmarks for a follow-up article in the next week or two on Phoronix.\n\nOf course, if you are after open-source Linux driver support akin to the Radeon experience, you'll still be waiting a while... NVIDIA has their Open GPU Kernel Driver code that they distribute via GitHub in tandem with their updated proprietary driver releases, but that code remains outside of the Linux kernel source tree and currently not on a trajectory for upstreaming.\nMeanwhile with the upstream Novueau DRM/KMS driver, that's still in poor shape for recent NVIDIA GPUs. Only with Linux 6.2 is there now Nouveau support for the GeForce RTX 30 series with 3D hardware acceleration when using the latest Mesa Git code... But for the RTX 30 support the performance on open-source is very low due to being limited to the boot clock speeds. There also is no proper Vulkan driver support yet but NVK continues to be worked on for NVIDIA open-source Vulkan support moving forward but that is still dependent upon forthcoming kernel driver improvements and other work before it will be ready for gamers -- plus contingent on the kernel driver being able to re-clock the graphics card for good performance.\nTo address the sore spots with Nouveau, the developers involved continue working on being able to make use of the NVIDIA GPU System Processor (GSP) that should simplify their driver enablement work and ideally take care of their power management / re-clocking woes. The open-source NVIDIA kernel driver code maintained by the company also leverages the GSP found on the RTX 20 series and later. Once that Nouveau GSP support is sorted out and upstreamed it will hopefully improve the situation for the open-source mainline Linux driver support, but that at least is still months away.\nLong story short, for the near-term if using GeForce RTX 40 series hardware on Linux it really only makes sense using NVIDIA's packaged driver.\n\nFor today's GeForce RTX 4080/4090 Linux gaming tests I compared the performance to other cards I had available including the RTX 3090, RTX 3080 Ti, RTX 3080, RTX 3070 Ti, RTX 3070, TITAN RTX, RTX 2080 Ti, and RTX 2080 graphics cards. All of these cards were tested on Ubuntu 22.10 with the NVIDIA 525.89.02 driver. On the AMD side with Linux 6.2 + Mesa 23.1-devel was the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, RX 6800 XT, RX 6800, RX 6750 XT, and RX 6700 XT. The Radeon RX 7900 XT was left out this round due to a recent driver regression (or hardware problem, still being analyzed) leading to some performance oddities there.\n\nAll of this testing happened on an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X desktop system running Ubuntu 22.10 with Linux 6.2.\n\n\n80 Comments \u00a0 - \u00a0 Next Page\n\nTweet\n\n\n \n\nPage 1 - IntroductionPage 2 - NVIDIA RTX 40 Series On LinuxPage 3 - HITMAN 3 + Cyberpunk 2077Page 4 - F1 22Page 5 - Grand Theft Auto 5 + CS:GO + DiRT Rally 2Page 6 - Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Talos PrinciplePage 7 - Total War: Three Kingdoms + Metro Last Light Redux + Quake 2 RTXPage 8 - Conclusion + Overview Results\n\n\nPage:  \u00a0 1 \u00a0  \u00a0 2 \u00a0  \u00a0 3 \u00a0  \u00a0 4 \u00a0  \u00a0 5 \u00a0  \u00a0 6 \u00a0  \u00a0 7 \u00a0  \u00a0 8 \u00a0  \u00a0 Next Page \u00a0  \n\n\n\nRelated Articles\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 Series Linux GPU Compute PerformanceNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Linux GPU Compute PerformanceAMD Radeon RX 9070 Series Officially AnnouncedNVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 Through GeForce RTX 5080/5090 GPU Compute PerformanceNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 / RTX 5090 Linux Gaming BenchmarksNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 Linux GPU Compute Performance\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Linux News\nBLAKE3 1.7 Turns To Intel's oneTBB For Parallelizing C Code - Similar Perf To Rust+Rayon\n\n\nFinal Draft Of PCI Express 7.0 Specification Published\n\n\nBlender 4.4 Released With Vulkan Improvements & AMD HIP RT No Longer Experimental\n\n\nOpenJDK Java 24 Released With Garbage Collector Improvements, Deprecating x86 32-bit\n\n\nFedora 42 Beta Released With Countless Improvements\n\n\nLinux Kernel's Zstd Code Gets A Co-Maintainer\n\n\nARM64 SMT Run-Time Controls Staged Ahead Of Linux 6.15\n\n\nTheora 1.2 Beta Released After 16 Years\n\n\nollama 0.6.2 Released WIth Support For AMD Strix Halo\n\n\nNginx Rejects Dark Mode Support For Error Pages\n\n\nBig Rust Update Merged For GCC 15 - Lands The Polonius Borrow Checker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Your Support, Go Premium\nPhoronix Premium allows ad-free access to the site, multi-page articles on a single page, and other features while supporting this site's continued operations.\n\n\nLatest Featured Articles\nAMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D Linux Performance\n\n\nAMD's 3D V-Cache Optimizer Driver For Squeezing More Ryzen 9 9950X3D Performance\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D Delivers Excellent Performance For Linux Developers, Creators & Technical Computing\n\n\nAMD EPYC 9845 Makes For A Persuasive Upgrade With Performance & Energy Efficiency\n\n\nSiFive HiFive Premier P550 RISC-V Linux Performance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSupport Phoronix\nThe mission at Phoronix since 2004 has centered around enriching the Linux hardware experience.

The NVIDIA A16 is a purpose-built GPU designed specifically for graphics-rich VDI, claiming that it delivers a user experience nearly indistinguishable from a native PC for remote workers.Vultr differentiates itself from other cloud service providers by placing emphasis on GPU offerings, and taking full advantage of the Multi-Instance GPU, or MIG features of the A100, which allows for partitioning the GPU into seven virtual GPUs.Through partitioning similar to hypervisors for CPUs, Vultr offers fractional A100 GPU instances to customers for less than the competition which offer similar services. The company offers a full range of cloud compute, cloud GPU, storage, bare metal, managed databases, Kubernetes, and other cloud-native services powered by GPUs.The A16 joins the A100 and A40 in the Vultr GPU lineup. \u201cObviously VDI has been around for a while. And if you asked why don\u2019t more companies use it, frankly, [VDIs] were often not great experiences because they were lagging,\u201d said J.J. Kardwell, CEO of Vultr\u2019s parent company, Constant.\u201cAnd now you could have that same experience that\u2019s essentially indistinguishable from having a native PC in front of you. So this is a fantastic product from Nvidia purpose built to support VDI, and this is bringing accelerated computing, right GPU capability to that market,\u201d he added.Kardwell went so far as to say that it is possible for an end-user to access a virtual desktop that is much more powerful than the physical computer they\u2019re using to access it. For the most part, though, the A16 is meant for general office use for things like browsing, Microsoft Word and Excel, or presentations. If you want to run AutoCAD, that means using a VDI service with A40 acceleration, and Vultr offers that, too.Cloud GPU instances can be used as remote desktops by connecting to them with clients such as Microsoft Remote Desktop, Parsec, and VNC. Pricing starts at just $21.50 per month, or $0.032 per hour, making these cloud-based virtual desktops an affordable alternative to IT-managed physical personal computers.\u201cIf all you want is basic applications like Excel and browsing the web, you could use the smallest instance and have an accelerated computing experience. And if you are running applications that have more memory needs or more horsepower, you could buy a larger instance to optimize for the exact amount that gives you the experience you want. And that's a big difference from the way GPUs have historically been,\u201d said Kardwell.There is an issue of latency, which Vultr addresses through its global presence of 30 data centers spread around the world. So clients will be served by the data center physically closest to them.In addition to individual desktops, Vultr offers shared virtual desktop instances where people in multiple locations could access one desktop at the same time, so they can all work together and see what the other sees.\u00a0Nvidia A16 VDI instances are available through eight of Vultr\u2019s data centers -- Los Angeles, New Jersey, London, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Bangalore, Singapore, and Sydney -- with more to be added later this year.About the AuthorAndy PatrizioContributor, Data Center KnowledgeAndy Patrizio is a veteran technology journalist of 30 years, covering a wide range of subjects for publications such as Network World, Computerworld, InformationWeek, Ars Technica and Business Insider.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n\n\n\nThe release of the Nvidia RTX 4070 appears to be getting closer if a new report is anything to go on, and it might just be the most accessible next-gen graphics card that most people are going to be able to buy for the next few months.The new report comes from VideoCardz, which shared a screenshot of an Nvidia GeForce Desktop Embargo timeline purportedly sent to Nvidia's board partners. The info, most of which is blurred out or 'TBD', has the On-Shelf date for the RTX 4070 as April 2023, though it does not specify which part of the month.(Image credit: VideoCardz)Of course, take this with a grain of salt since Nvidia hasn't said anything official yet, but with the release of the RTX 4090, RTX 4080, and RTX 4070 Ti, the RTX 4070 and RTX 4060 Ti are definitely inbound sooner rather than later, and April 2023 still puts it almost two months away at this point, so this is definitely a believeable timeline.\u00a0\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nThe end of the Nvidia RTX 4000 series is nigh \u2013 with the RTX 4070 expected to sell out in weeks\n\n\n\n\nI can't say I'm surprised, but Nvidia's RTX 5070 leaked benchmark reveals up to 20% performance boost over RTX 4070\n\n\n\nWe'll get a better sense once benchmarks start leaking out as we get closer to the launch date, so now is definitely the time to start keeping an eye out for news on what we hope will be the best graphics card for most people on the market.The RTX 4070 should be the first accessible graphics card for most peopleOne of the reasons we're all looking forward to the RTX 4070 announcement is because \u2014 lets be honest \u2014 graphics card prices have gone off the rails in recent years.Even without the complete unavailability of GPU stock during the most recent cryptobubble, graphics card price inflation is a major concern. The AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX got high praise from us for its outstanding performance while keeping its price \"under\" $1,000 (it has an official MSRP of $999.99).After third-party RTX 3090 Ti cards regularly cleared $2,000 and the Nvidia RTX 4080 MSRP came in at $1,199, gamers everywhere have been incredibly frustrated to be locked out of next-gen cards because of their frankly outrageous pricing. Even the RTX 4070 Ti has an MSRP of \"just\" $799.99.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.An RTX 4070 non-Ti should be the first next-gen card to come in under $700 and hopefully under $600, a price point that would put it at least closer to the budgets of a lot of gamers out there who are going to be a lot more price conscious than they have been in years past.It would also go a long way to deflecting one of AMD's biggest advantages over the RTX 40-series GPUs, but whether that's enough to inspire a change of pace from Nvidia remains to be seen.\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn LoefflerSocial Links NavigationComponents EditorJohn (He/Him) is the Components Editor here at TechRadar and he is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY.

Wilson \u2022\nFeb 24, 2023 at 03:39am EST\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPuget Systems, one of the leading custom PC builder companies, was conducting a test on AMD and Intel PC server CPU-based systems that utilized NVIDIA GeForce GPUs from the last generation and the current generation and included the enterprise NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada generation graphics card.\nP2P functionality missing from newer NVIDIA GPUs as a resolution for NVIDIA to force customers to spend more\nDuring the tests, the information revealed that the GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card had a faulty Peer-To-Peer (P2P) functionality. In turn, the company contacted NVIDIA, who explained that the new graphics card generation no longer offers P2P support.\nWhen Puget Systems attempted to process P2P-based workloads in its benchmarking tests, it appeared \"corrupted\" or would fail upon access. The testing was sparked because a user on the NVIDIA forums had P2P failures on their system using dual GeForce RTX 4090 graphics cards. It was not until several months had passed that an NVIDIA representative responded to the user.\nHi all. Apologies for the delay. Feedback from Engineering is that Peer to Peer is not supported on 4090. The applications/driver should not report this configuration as peer to peer capable. The reporting is being fixed and future drivers will report the following instead.\n\u2014 NVIDIA representative\nP2P allowed for data to be able to transfer from one NVIDIA-supported graphics card's memory to another NVIDIA GPU. The functionality allows the system memory to be focused on other tasks as the P2P process uses the graphics cards' integrated memory, accelerating access and transmissions to the memory. CUDA-based programs benefit from this feature, especially those utilizing NVLink.\nNVLink is a high-speed GPU interconnect that offers a \"significantly faster alternative for multi-GPU systems than PCIe-based connections.\" P2P utilizes both PCIe and NVLink for its processes. The last NVIDIA generation that used P2P in its hardware was the Turing GPUs (RTX 20 series). The company has never answered why the functionality was dropped, but it is possible that it was due to requiring customers to purchase more expensive graphics cards.\n\nNVIDIA has a significant focus on gaming with its graphics card products. However, over the last five years, NVIDIA has seen its cards used for other content outside the gaming realm. Other options that consumers were using the NVIDIA GPUs for were cryptocurrency mining and content creation, among other tasks requiring the power a GPU brought. During the Ampere generation, GeForce RTX 3090 graphics cards were used over expensive NVIDIA Quadro cards so that businesses could save overhead costs. When NVIDIA discovered this, the blower-based GPU saw fewer shipments to sellers and eventually evaporated.\nNow, businesses are encountering an issue with GeForce RTX 4090 and RTX 6000 series graphics cards. The former offers the same architecture (Ada Lovelace) and the same silicon (AD102) as the latter, but for a cost difference of almost $4,000. The most considerable difference is that it does not offer the P2P found in the RTX 6000 series GPUs. This expensive undertaking for enterprises removes from their overall costs when before they were able to use that overhead for other tasks and processes. Due to the RTX A6000 GPU supporting P2P, businesses are not out of luck. The RTX A6000 graphics card costs $4,650, which is still less than the newer offerings from NVIDIA.\nNews Sources: Puget Systems, Tom's Hardware\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorldwide GPU Shipments Saw A 4.4% Quarter-Over-Quarter Increase; Data Center GPUs Saw A Bigger Growth\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n98\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n48\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n41\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n40\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Barry Collins is a tech journalist writing about  PCs, Macs and games.Follow AuthorFeb 25, 2023, 06:00am ESTShareSaveCommentThis article is more than 2 years old.Cyberpunk 2077 is a visual feast on the Mac with GeForce Now UltimateSOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\nIf Macs have had a blackspot over the years, it\u2019s gaming. A limited choice of games and middling GPU performance have left most gamers looking elsewhere. Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now Ultimate changes everything. Suddenly, the Mac became a brilliant gaming platform.\n\n\nGeForce Now is Nvidia\u2019s cloud gaming service, one that allows you to play a huge library of Windows games on a Mac. Titles such as Cyberpunk 2077, A Plague Tale: Requiem and the Far Cry series are among the list of gorgeous-looking games on offer. Even previously off-limits titles such as Fortnite \u2013 a victim of Apple\u2019s legal battle with Epic Games \u2013 can be played on the Mac.\n\nForget everything you might think you know about cloud gaming: choppy performance, low-res graphics, poor latency. The new GeForce Now Ultimate tier is based on the RTX 4080 series graphics and performance is sensational (assuming your broadband is up to it). The games can take full advantage of the stunning Mac displays, with 4K frame rates of up to 120 frames per second \u2013 well beyond what most Mac screens are even capable of.\n\n\nAnd because the bulk of the processing work is done on Nvidia\u2019s servers, there\u2019s no great demands on your Mac. That means you can enjoy games without the din of fan noise in the background, especially if you\u2019re on a recent Mac with an M1 or M2 processor.\n\nHere\u2019s how to turn your Mac into a great games machine.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\nGeForce Now Ultimate \u2013 what you\u2019ll need\n\nTo get the best gaming performance on a Mac, you\u2019ll need the following:\n\n\nA GeForce Now Ultimate subscription \u2013 you can sign up on Nvidia\u2019s website. It costs $19.99 per month in the U.S. and Nvidia is in the process of rolling it out across Europe, too. There is a cheaper Priority tier, but this tops out at Full HD resolution at 60 frames per second, which means you won\u2019t take full advantage of the resolution on your Mac\u2019s screen. That said, Full HD is plenty good enough for gaming on devices such as the MacBook Air with smaller screens.\nFast broadband \u2013 to stream games in 4K at 120 frames per second, you\u2019ll need up to 45Mbits/sec of dedicated bandwidth. That\u2019s not a 45Mbits/sec connection, but 45Mbits/sec reserved just for the gaming service. In my tests, the average bandwidth required on a 16in MacBook Pro playing at 4K and 60 frames per second is around 10-20Mbits/sec.\n\n\n\nHow to get the most out of GeForce Now Ultimate on a MacThe MacBook Pro becomes a great gaming machineFuture Publishing via Getty Images\n\n\nIf you want to get the smoothest experience from GeForce Now Ulitmate on your Mac, here are a few tips:\n\n\nConnect via Ethernet \u2013 It is possible to play over Wi-Fi and Nvidia pulls all kind of stunts to make Wi-Fi streaming as smooth as possible, but even using a high-end Wi-Fi 6 mesh router in the same room as my MacBook Pro, I experienced stutters, dropped frames and lag. Connecting to the router via Ethernet cable offers a much smoother performance. It\u2019s genuinely easy to forget you\u2019re using a cloud service rather than playing locally. If your Mac doesn\u2019t have an Ethernet port \u2013 and most modern MacBooks don\u2019t \u2013 you can buy a cheap USB-C Ethernet adapter.\nTweak display settings \u2013 Nvidia\u2019s app does a pretty decent job of automatically finding the best settings, but I found it best to take manual control. In the GeForce Now app for Mac, click the menu icon in the top-left of the screen and choose Settings. Head across to Streaming Quality and select Custom. Then choose the resolution of your particular screen and the maximum frame rate. If you\u2019re not sure of these, Apple\u2019s website will display the specs of your machine. On my 16in MacBook Pro, for instance, the display is 3,456 x 2x234 pixels and the refresh rate is capped at 60Hz, or 60 frames per second.\nTurn on in-game graphic settings \u2013 Also in the Settings menu you\u2019ll find an option to save your changes to in-game graphic settings. This, for example, allows you to change the viewing distance or the graphical quality in the game itself. I tend to find Nvidia\u2019s automatic settings are a little modest, and you can eke out better quality graphics by taking control of these yourself. If you\u2019re not familiar with fiddling with in-game graphic settings and the effect they can have on performance, it\u2019s probably safer to leave it on Nvidia\u2019s recommended settings.\nGet a good controller \u2013 Mouse and keyboard input is, of course, supported, but you might also want to make use of a games controller. You can connect Bluetooth-enabled Xbox and PlayStation controllers to your Mac, via the Mac\u2019s Bluetooth settings menu. GeForce Now should detect these automatically. It even supports vibration feedback on my Xbox controller. Alas, the same can\u2019t be said for the Google Stadia controller, which can be converted to a Bluetooth controller following the service\u2019s closure, but didn\u2019t offer vibration support in my tests.\nConnect all the stores \u2013 Unlike Microsoft\u2019s Game Pass, GeForce Now doesn\u2019t include games in the price. Instead, you connect your Steam, Epic Games or Ubisoft accounts and play the games you\u2019ve already acquired through those stores. (Warning: not all games on those stores will be supported in GeForce Now \u2013 the full list of supported games can be found here.) It\u2019s worth signing up for all these stores, even if you\u2019ve not previously bought games from them, because they often give away free games that you can add to your library.\n\n\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Turns out human language is now computer programming code. So says none other than Nvidia's outspoken CEO, Jensen Huang.In an intriguing aside during Nvidia's recent earnings call, Huang riffed on implications of the latest language-based AI models, including ChatGPT. \"We now realize\u2014the world now realizes\u2014that maybe human language is a perfectly good computer programming language,\" Huang observes.Huang explains how ChatGPT can do tasks it was never intentionally trained for. \"It can be prompted in human language, but output Python, output Cobalt, a language that very few people even remember, output Python for Blender, a 3D program. So it's a program that writes a program for another program,\" he says.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nChina's DeepSeek chatbot reportedly gets much more done with fewer GPUs but Nvidia still thinks it's 'excellent' news\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft is Nvidia's biggest AI chip buyer of the year, and it's not even close.

Much of the speculation typically surrounds the question of AI sentience and the 'ifs' and 'whens' of how we might lose control of our new creation.But Huang's insight comes at it from precisely the opposite direction. According to Huang, AI language models like ChatGPT are going to do the opposite of AI taking over the human race. Instead, they're the tool we need to perfect our control over the machines.Of course, both perspectives can hold important truths.

Most recently, the two chipmakers teamed up to develop a system for energy-efficient AI.\nWhile GPUs are essential for workstations, a lot of what goes on in the workstation is performed by a CPU, said Jack Gold, president and analyst at J.Gold Associates.\n\n\n\n    What you really need if you want a high-performance workstation is not just high-performance GPU, but high-performance CPU.\n   \n\nJack GoldPresident and analyst, J.Gold Associates\n   \n\n\n\n\"What you really need if you want a high-performance workstation is not just high-performance GPU, but high-performance CPU,\" Gold said.\nIntel and AMD dominate the market for high-performance CPUs. So since AMD is a direct competitor to Nvidia in the GPU market, it makes better sense for Nvidia to partner with Intel -- which specializes in CPUs -- than AMD, he said.\nAnd despite Nvidia's plans to build its own CPU, the vendor is not going to develop one equivalent to the Xeon processor, Gold continued. Similarly, Nvidia can help Intel as Intel attempts to relaunch its own GPU effort.\n\n\nHigh computing at a cost\nThe new generation of workstations will also be helpful as accelerated computing power grows in generative AI text-to-image applications, extended reality, digital twins and the metaverse, according to the vendors.\nHowever, while computer-aided design systems, oil and gas exploration, and the pharmaceutical industry might benefit from the timesaving efforts of high-end workstations, it comes at a cost.\n\n\n\nThe next generation of desktop workstation is powered by both Intel and Nvidia.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\"These machines aren't going to be cheap,\" Gold said, adding that they will probably cost tens of thousands of dollars each.\nThe expense is why some enterprises are moving to workstations-as-a-service technology instead of just buying these hardware workstations.\nAnother challenge for enterprises is ensuring their workloads run better on the workstations and ensuring their IT departments are able to manage the workstations, Gold added.\n\"The software should be optimized,\" he said. \"Not all software is ready to take advantage of all of the capabilities that these chips have.\"\nThe new Intel-Nvidia workstations are now available for preorder.\nEsther Ajao is a news writer covering artificial intelligence software and systems.\n\n\nNext Steps\nHow Intel's new AI Gaudi 3 chip compares with Nvidia chips\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRelated Resources\n\n\nAI Infrastructure: An Insider's Roadmap to Success with Dell and AMD\n\u2013Video\n\n\nAI Supply Chains Under Siege: How to Secure Open-Source AI From Emerging Threats\n\u2013Talk\n\n\nAI\u2019s Next Leap: Smarter, Cheaper, and More Autonomous\n\u2013Video\n\n\nThe Art of Practical AI: Business Optimization Use Cases and Strategies\n\u2013Replay\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDig Deeper on AI infrastructure\n\n\n\nIntel unveils more Xeon 6 chips for AI servers\n\n\n\n\nBy: Antone\u00a0Gonsalves\n\n\n\n\nIntel loses AI head Justin Hotard to Nokia\n\n\n\n\nBy: Antone\u00a0Gonsalves\n\n\n\n\nIntel axes Falcon Shores amid market challenges\n\n\n\n\nBy: Antone\u00a0Gonsalves\n\n\n\n\nIntel beats expectations, but AI chip Gaudi disappoints\n\n\n\n\nBy: Antone\u00a0Gonsalves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored News\n\n\nFlexible IT: When Performance and Security Can\u2019t Be Compromised\n\u2013Dell Technologies\n\n\nHow AI and the Data Center Streamlines Business Processes\n\u2013HPE & Intel\n\n\nHarness AI at the Edge to Enhance Business Success\n\u2013HPE & Intel\n\nSee More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRelated Content\n\n\nIntel launches Xeon 6 for AI data centers\n\u2013 Search Enterprise AI\n\n\nIntel unveils more Xeon 6 chips for AI servers\n\u2013 Search Enterprise AI\n\n\nIntel\n\u2013 WhatIs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest TechTarget resources\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness Analytics\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCIO\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Management\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tERP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch Business Analytics\n\n\n\n\nData preparation in machine learning: 4 key steps\nData preparation for ML is key to accurate model results.

Borealis, currently available in a limited beta, runs the SteamOS platform inside a VM. That\u2019s how Linux on Chromebooks works, although a container is also used. But even the most powerful Chromebooks with integrated GPUs don\u2019t run Windows PC games through Steam very well. I figured for Borealis to reach its true potential, dedicated GPUs in Chromebooks would be needed. And I found several clues indicating that Chromebooks with Nvidia GPUs for Steam gaming are in the works.\n\nChromebooks with Nvidia GPUs for virtual machines\nTo be clear, I haven\u2019t yet found all of the details of such Chromebooks. It\u2019s possible these will have ARM processors with some type of Nvidia GPU integration; a prototype of such a system was shown off back in 2021. Howeve, I suspect Chromebooks with Nvidia GPUs to be paired with Intel processors. PC games need the kind of horsepower found in 12th gen Intel processors or the games will bottlenecked by the CPU, regardless of the graphics solution.\nHere\u2019s a key example of what I found. This recent code commit for the ChromeOS vm_tools used for managing virtual machines is called \u201cAdd scripts to bind dGPU to different drivers\u201d. \nWhat follows is a partial description of what\u2019s changing, along with my own highlights of key words:\n\nAdd logic to specify whether dGPU should be bound to VFIO modulev or NVIDIA module on next reboot. This same script can be invoked by vm_concierge too before starting borealis to rebind NVIDIA dGPU to vfio-pci driver.\n\nObviously, dGPU means a discrete GPU. Chromebooks today use iGPUs, or integrated GPUs, typically from Intel, AMD or various ARM brands. In context, this means ChromeOS is preparing to support dGPUs for the first time. The Nvidia module reference is also obvious. \nThe vm_concierge mention relates to how ChromeOS allocates hardware and software resources to a VM on a Chromebook. It gathers up the appropriate resources and allows crosvm, the minimal virtual machine written for ChromeOS, to use them. Again, this is how Linux on Chromebooks works.\nAnd then there\u2019s Borealis. It\u2019s right there in plain sight! We know what that is: It\u2019s the project and environment that Steam gaming on Chromebooks runs. It\u2019s hard to think this could be anything other than Chromebooks with Nvidia GPUs for Steam.\nIntegrated GPUs don\u2019t support playable game frame rates on a Chromebook\nGoogle is working directly with Nvidia\nAlso of note is that this code change, and several other related ones, are authored by Vaibhav Vyas. Who\u2019s that? Well, the code commit shows his name with an nvidia.com email address, so we know he works at Nvidia. In fact, a little digging told me that he\u2019s a Senior System Software Engineer there. \nJames Jones from Nvidia is listed on some of the code changes I found as well. According to his LinkedIn profile, he\u2019s a Principal Software Engineer for the company. Lo and behold here\u2019s what he currently works on: \n\nI work on the userspace portion of the Linux Graphics Drivers, developing and porting EGL, GLX, OpenGL, Vulkan, X11, and video decode drivers for our GPUs, and represent NVIDIA at Khronos for System Integration issues.\n\nThat sounds exactly like the kind of activities one would be doing in support of the Linux-based SteamOS on Chromebooks, no? \nTo complete the trifecta here is Aaron Plattner, another Nvidia software engineer. What does he do there? \u201cLinux graphics drivers, interaction with x.org and other open source projects,\u201d according to LinkedIn.\n\nOpen source drivers for Nvidia cards and Chromebooks\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re still not convinced that Chromebooks with Nvidia GPUs are coming. I\u2019ll add a third piece of evidence that might change your mind. And it\u2019s from the exact same code commit above with the relevant text shown below. Again, I\u2019ll highlight the important bit:\n\nEnsures vfio-pci module is loaded before NVIDIA drivers, nouveau driver, intel sound driver (snd-hda-intel) and eXtensible Host Controller Interface (xHCI) drivers,\n\nYeah, I didn\u2019t know what nouveau driver meant either at first. Google, once again, came to my rescue.\nOver at freedesktop.org is an effort called Nouveau. What\u2019s the project for? Creating an accelerated open source driver for Nvidia cards. Hmm\u2026. open source, like ChromiumOS? \nThat\u2019s the main, freely available operating system that ChromeOS is built on. Google puts some features in ChromiumOS and adds their own internal bits for ChromeOS. Adding nouvaeu drivers to one, or both, of these systems is how Google creates ChromeOS.\nStill more to come about Chromebooks with Nvidia GPUs\nAdd it all together and it\u2019s pretty clear, at least to me, that Chromebooks with Nvidia GPUs are at least in the works. The ideal used case is for Steam gaming with Borealis, of course. No other typical ChromeOS tasks need a dedicated GPU. I wouldn\u2019t mind having one for some machine learning coding activities but that\u2019s not a typical ChromeOS task. I get by just fine learning JavaScript and NodeJS development using Linux on my current Chromebook.\nNote that this is really just the tip of the iceburg from what I\u2019ve found so far. I have yet to delve into all of the relevant ChromeOS code changes, but I\u2019ll be doing so over the coming days and weeks. And I don\u2019t know far more than I do know. I can\u2019t yet tell you what integrated Nvidia GPUs in Chromebooks will be used, for example. \nThey could be old RTX 1660s or new RTX 4090s as Nvidia makes laptop versions of those cards. I have an RTX 3080 in my custom built gaming PC and Steam gaming is incredible with it. But that\u2019s a desktop card that uses more than 200W of power, so a Chromebook wouldn\u2019t use something like that. Perhaps, like my Dell XPS15, we\u2019ll see an Nvidia RTX 3050Ti meant for laptops inside a Chromebook. Who knows? \nEither way, stay tuned as there\u2019s more to come.\n\n\nBorealis for Chromebook Chromebook Chromebooks ChromeOS Nvidia GPUs in Chromebooks Nvidia RTX GeForce Chromebook Steam gaming on Chromebooks Steam on a Chromebook\n\n\nShare.\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nPinterest\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nTumblr\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin Tofel\n\n\n\nWebsite\n\n\nAfter spending 15 years in IT at Fortune 100 companies, Kevin turned a hobby into a career and began covering mobile technology in 2003. He writes daily on the industry and has co-hosted the weekly MobileTechRoundup podcast since 2006. His writing has appeared in print (The New York Times, PC Magazine and PC World) and he has been featured on NBC News in Philadelphia.\n\n \n\n\n\n5 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\natlman on \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFebruary 21, 2023 1:15 pm\n\n \n\nYou almost certainly already knew this, but I honestly just found out that Google chose not to make Borealis a container in a VM like Debian, but instead it is SteamOS running as a VM image. So that makes getting Nvidia (as well as AMD and Intel) dGPU support far more likely to actually happen and perform well. I hope Google does this with the Debian environment on ChromeOS down the line also. \nBut for now, simply getting better hardware for the ChromeOS that already exists would be great. Example: no one has seen fit to make a Chromebook or Chromebox with RDNA 2 integrated graphics. This is with RDNA 3 integrated graphics launching on Windows this year and RDNA 4 already in the pipeline for next year. Would it cause injury to someone at Google for them to call someone who works at Beelink or Minisforum and ask them to create a ChromeOS version of one of their excellent AMD Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7 mini PCs? I see them on Liliputing all the time and am always thinking \u201cif this ran ChromeOS I would order it immediately!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nKevin C. Tofel on \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFebruary 21, 2023 3:08 pm\n\n \n\nI\u2019m right there with you. Ironically, I just bought one of the AMD Ryzen 5 Beelink Mini PCs a few weeks ago on sale for $299. I removed Windows 11 Pro to replace it with Linux and it\u2019s running great. Games do surprisingly well on that little box as well, although that\u2019s not what I bought it for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\natlman on \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFebruary 21, 2023 4:54 pm\n\n \n\nWhich one? The Beelink SER5 AMD Mini PC with a Ryzen 5 5500U?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nKevin C. Tofel on \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFebruary 21, 2023 6:23 pm\n\n \n\nClose! The Ryzen 5 5600U. Great little machine that doesn\u2019t use much power compared to my gaming PC with RTX 3080. When not gaming, there\u2019s no point in using more electricity of a PC with 800W power supply when this thing uses 50W in the worst case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAlka Setzer on \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFebruary 22, 2023 10:31 am\n\n \n\nWhile this could point to laptops/desktops with discrete GPUs it is more probable that this work is just to enable thunderbolt/usb4 eGPUs as all of the current intel borealis cpus support it. AMD is a miss as only the recent 6xxx series supports USB4. For ARM I don\u2019t know of any SOC that supports usb4 with the bandwidth necessary for this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Automate Package Tracking on Your Chromebook for Faster UpdatesMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproving Cybersecurity with Competitive IntelligenceMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvcruntime140.dll Not Found Issue\u00a0March 17, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 Best Free Movie Sites On Chromebook In 2025March 17, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Games To Play On Chromebook \u2013 No Download RequiredMarch 17, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\nPrivacy Policy\nWrite For Us\nNewsletter\nContact\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2025 About Chrome Books.

In many such reported cases, nothing happens when users select to open the NVIDIA Control Panel; however, sometimes an error message will pop up. \nIf the NVIDIA Control Panel is not opening in Windows 11, don't fret. Here's how to get it working again. \n                        1. Run the NVIDIA Control Panel With Admin Rights\n               \nMost users usually select to open the NVIDIA Control Panel from Windows 11\u2019s desktop context menu. However, you can select to run that app as an administrator in the following steps: \n\n                                        Right-click your taskbar\u2019s Start menu button and select the Search shortcut.\n                        \n\n                                        Type NVIDIA Control Panel in the search box.\n                        \n\n                                        Right-click the NVIDIA Control Panel result to select a Run as administrator on that app\u2019s context menu.\n                                            \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting NVIDIA Control Panel to always run as administrator is tricky because that UWP app is installed within a restricted access folder. You\u2019ll need to take ownership of the WindowsApps folder to open that directory. Then select the \"Run as administrator\" option for the nvcplui.exe file.

End NVIDIA Background Processes\n               \nSometimes you can\u2019t see NVIDIA Control Panel when multiple instances of it are already running. Ending NVIDIA background processes will enable you to restart the app. This is how you terminate background NVIDIA background processes: \n\n                                        Bring up the Task Manager tool (pressing Ctrl + Shift + Esc) is the quickest method for opening it).\n                        \n\n                                        Select Processes if a different tab opens with Task Manager.\n                        \n\n                                        Next, scroll down the Processes tab to find NVIDIA processes.\n                        \n\n                                        Select all NVIDIA processes and click their End task buttons.\n                                            \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        Click the Windows Explorer process with the right mouse button and select Restart.\n                                            \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        Try opening the NVIDIA Control Panel again.\n                        \n\n\n                        3. Start (or Restart) the NVIDIA Display Container Service\n               \nA common reason for the NVIDIA Control Panel not opening is a disabled NVIDIA Display Container service. Other NVIDIA services also need to be enabled for the app to work right. So, you should check that service and others are enabled and running like this: \n\n                                        Bring up Windows 11\u2019s file search utility.\n                        \n\n                                        Type Services into the file search box and select to run that app from there.\n                        \n\n                                        Scroll to and double-click NVIDIA Display Container LS.\n                                            \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        Next, select the Automatic option if the Startup menu setting is set to anything else.\n                                            \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        Select Start (in the properties window) to run the service if it\u2019s stopped.\n                        \n\n                                        Make sure you click Apply for saving the settings.\n                        \n\n                                        Select OK to exit the NVIDIA Display Container LS Properties window.\n                        \n\n                                        Repeat steps three to seven for the NVIDIA LocalSystem and NetworkService Container services.\n                        \n\n\n                        4. Repair the NVIDIA Control Panel App\n               \nWindows 11\u2019s standard Repair and Reset app options are available for NVIDIA Control Panel. So, those troubleshooting options might help you fix that app not opening. You can select the Reset and Repair options in the same place within the NVIDIA Control Panel settings. Our guide on about resetting Windows 11s apps includes step-by-step instructions for how to apply do this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        5. Update Your PC\u2019s NVIDIA Graphics Driver\n               \nUpdating the NVIDIA graphics driver on your PC will also update the control panel app for it. So, that\u2019s a potential solution worth trying if your graphics card\u2019s driver is outdated. You can apply this potential fix by following the instructions within our guide to updating NVIDIA GPUs. \n                        6. Install Missing Visual C++ Redistribute Packages\n               \nAnother possibility is that the NVIDIA Control Panel doesn\u2019t open because your PC is missing a required Visual C++ Redistributable package to run it. You can eliminate this possible cause by updating Visual C++ packages on your PC if needed. This is how to install a missing Visual C++ Redistributable in Windows: \n\n                                        Open up the Microsoft Visual C++ download page in your browser software.\n                        \n\n                                        Click the X64 link for the latest Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022 packs.\n                                            \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        Double-click the VC_redist.arm64.exe (Visual C++ installer) file once it's downloaded.\n                        \n\n                                        Go through the install process.\n                        \n\n\n                        7. Edit the Windows Registry\n               \nThis Windows Registry tweak creates a new context menu option for opening the NVIDIA Control Panel. As this solution involves deleting a key, we recommend you learn how to back up the Windows Registry before proceeding.\nTo apply this fix, edit the Registry as follows: \n\n                                        Open Registry Editor by pressing the Win + R keyboard shortcut, typing regedit in the Run dialog, and clicking OK.\n                        \n\n                                        Input this key location in the registry address bar and press Return:\n                                                \n        Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\Directory\\background\\shellex\\ContextMenuHandlers\n    \n\n\n                                        Click the NvCplDesktopContext subkey with the right mouse button and select Delete.\n                        \n\n                                        Select Yes to confirm that you\u2019re sure about deleting the NvCplDesktopContext key.\n                        \n\n                                        Erase the path currently in the registry bar, and input this different location:\n                                                \n        Computer\\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Directory\\Background\\shell\n    \n\n\n                                        Next, right-click Shell and select New.\n                        \n\n                                        Click Key to add a new subkey to Shell.\n                        \n\n                                        Type Nvidia Control Panel to be the new key\u2019s name.\n                        \n\n                                        Then right-click the Nvidia Control Panel subkey and select its New and Key context menu options.\n                        \n\n                                        Input command for the subkey\u2019s title.\n                        \n\n                                        Select command and double-click its (Default) string.\n                        \n\n                                        Next, input the following path in the Value data box:\n                                                \n        C:\\Windows\\System32\\nvcplui.exe\n    \n\n\n                                        Select OK to save the string value.\n                        \n\n                                        Now select to reboot your Windows 11/10 PC.\n                        \n\n\n                        8. Reinstall the NVIDIA Control Panel\n               \nThe NVIDIA Control Panel is a UWP app you can uninstall, download, and reinstall.

Since the launch of Ampere about two years ago, things have been stagnant in the gaming laptop space, but with the arrival of the RTX 40 series we're getting a new architecture, a new process node, and new levels of performance.\nThe RTX 4090 Laptop chip is built using AD103 silicon - the largest that could feasibly fit into a laptop form factor given constraints to size, power, and cooling. This leaves the RTX 4090 Laptop with 9,728 shader units, the same number as the desktop RTX 4080 - as well as several other specs that are shared between those two, such as the 16GB memory capacity and 256-bit bus.\n\nNot unlike previous GeForce GPU releases, the RTX 4090 Laptop GPU is a bit controversial because despite sharing RTX 4090 branding, this mobile variant has little in common with the powerful desktop graphics card we reviewed and tested before. The GPU die, core configuration, clock speeds, memory bandwidth, memory capacity, and power limit are all substantially lower on the 4090 Laptop - yet Nvidia has decided that the 4090 branding makes sense, which is potentially misleading to everyday customers who might not know the difference.\nWhile we consider this a bad move by Nvidia, it's not going to be the focus of this review, instead we'll leave that for an RTX 4090 laptop vs desktop comparison in the near future - spoiler alert - the RTX 4090 desktop demolishes the laptop variant.\n\nIn this review, we want to focus on the laptop market and how the new RTX 4090 Laptop GPU compares to the previous flagship, the RTX 3080 Ti Laptop, and what this means for people buying a new gaming laptop in 2023.\nTo be clear, this is not an RTX 4080 desktop GPU in a laptop either. The RTX 4090 Laptop is clocked considerably lower. At its maximum 150W power configuration, the RTX 4090 Laptop is rated for a 2,040 MHz boost clock, 500 MHz lower than the RTX 4080. It also uses 18 Gbps GDDR6 memory instead of the full 22 Gbps GDDR6X - mostly to save power as G6X is quite power hungry.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nGeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU 150W\nGeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU 80W\nGeForce RTX 3080 Ti Laptop GPU 150W\nGeForce RTX 3080 Ti Laptop GPU 80W\nGeForce RTX 4090 (Desktop)\nGeForce RTX 4080 (Desktop)\n\n\nSM Count\n76\n76\n58\n58\n128\n76\n\n\nShader Units\n9728\n9728\n7424\n7424\n16384\n9728\n\n\nRT Cores\n76\n76\n58\n58\n128\n76\n\n\nTensor Cores\n304\n304\n232\n232\n512\n304\n\n\nGPU Core Boost Clock (MHz)\n2040 MHz\n1455 MHz\n1590 MHz\n1125 MHz\n2520 MHz\n2505 MHz\n\n\nVRAM Size and Type\n16GB GDDR6\n16GB GDDR6\n16GB GDDR6\n16GB GDDR6\n24GB GDDR6X\n16GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Clock\n18 Gb/s\n?\n16 Gb/s\n?\n21 Gb/s\n22.4 Gb/s\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n256-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n384-bit\n256-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n576 GB/s\n?\n512 GB/s\n?\n1008 GB/s\n717 GB/s\n\n\nTGP\n150W\n80W\n150W\n80W\n450W\n320W\n\n\nGPU Die\nAD103\nAD103\nGA103\nGA103\nAD102\nAD103\n\n\nGPU Die Size\n379 sq.mm\n379 sq.mm\n496 sq.mm\n496 sq.mm\n609 sq.mm\n379 sq.mm\n\n\nTransistor Count\n46 billion\n46 billion\n?\n?\n76 billion\n46 billion\n\n\n\nDespite this, the RTX 4090 Laptop is a substantial upgrade over the mobile 3080 Ti as it brings 31% more CUDA cores, higher clock speeds on both the GPU and memory, and new features enabled by Nvidia's Ada Lovelace architecture. It also moves from Samsung 8N manufacturing to TSMC 4N, which should deliver a substantial uplift in performance per watt, which is crucial for laptops.\n\nNvidia will also continue to offer multiple power configurations under the exact same GPU name. That means the RTX 4090 Laptop can be configured anywhere from 80 to 150 watts, the lower power limit will come with a rated boost clock 29% lower than at 150W upper limit.\nThis is another deceiving aspect to Nvidia's naming scheme, as a customer tossing up between two RTX 4090 laptops could end up buying one by accident that's substantially slower, as it features an 80W TGP instead of the full 150W TGP. With such a large power range, the lower power variants should be given a different name.\n\nIn this review we'll be testing the full 150W variant with 25W of dynamic boost, so it's important to be aware that this is effectively the best performance on offer on an RTX 4090 Laptop. If you get a laptop with, say, a 115W limit or 80W limit, you should expect lower performance results than what we are showing here.\nThe test system for this review is the MSI Titan GT77, which in addition to the fully powered RTX 4090 GPU configuration also includes an Intel Core i9-13950HX CPU, 64 GB of DDR5-4800 memory, and other premium features like a 4K 144Hz mini-LED display. This is not a laptop review, so we won't be touching on things like build quality or how good the keyboard is - but later on we hope to have a full breakdown of Intel's new 13th-gen HX laptop processors, too.\n\nToday's testing was conducted primarily at 1080p using MsHybrid (Microsoft Hybrid Graphics Mode), which presents the most CPU limited scenario and gives us a look at a worst case performance using this sort of GPU. We also have 1440p results using a display connected directly to the discrete graphics, which gives us a better idea of GPU limited results using an external display or an increasingly popular MUX switch. Later in the review, we'll also be exploring 4K numbers against the RTX 3080 Ti Laptop GPU.\nGaming Benchmarks\nStarting with Watch Dogs Legion at 1440p using Ultra settings, we see very impressive performance from the RTX 4090 Laptop configuration.\nThis GPU is capable of a more high refresh rate experience at this resolution, averaging 108 FPS which represents a 59% performance improvement over the 3080 Ti Laptop - that's massive for a generation-on-generation gain at the same 150W power limit.\nIt also defeats other high end laptop GPUs with ease, such as the RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 Ti.\n\n\nIn the same game at 1080p, we are CPU limited and get basically the same performance as we did at 1440p. This limits the gain relative to the RTX 3080 Ti which isn't as CPU limited at this resolution.\nWe end up with just a 26% improvement which right from the first game tested highlights how important it will be for new RTX 4090 laptops to use displays with resolutions higher than 1080p.\n\n\nIn Far Cry 6 at 1440p we see a more modest performance improvement relative to in Watch Dogs Legion. Here the RTX 4090 is still much faster than the 3080 Ti Laptop, but we're looking at a 35 percent improvement and we did see some CPU limitations in this benchmark.\nThis is further highlighted looking at the 1080p numbers, where the RTX 4090 is barely faster than the RTX 3080 Ti, and that's despite a new generation of CPU coming in to play.\n\nThe 1440p results in Metro Exodus are extremely impressive. Here the 4090 Laptop at 150W was able to average 155 FPS, enough to max out a 1440p 144Hz display that you might see in a laptop these days.\nThis gave it a 58 percent lead on the RTX 3080 Ti laptop, again that's a massive improvement.\n\nThe gains in this title at 1080p aren't as solid, but we're still looking at a 35% gen-on-gen performance increase which is pretty substantial compared to say, the Turing vs. Ampere era where new RTX 30 laptop GPUs were typically only around the 30% faster mark overall.\n\n\nAnother strong performance lead is shown for the 4090 Laptop in Red Dead Redemption 2. Averaging nearly 130 FPS in this title using High settings puts the 4090 49% ahead of the RTX 3080 Ti Laptop at 150W. This margin drops to 25% at 1080p, but for those with higher resolution panels, there is no doubting the power of the new RTX 40 GPU option.\n\nIn Cyberpunk 2077 the RTX 4090 Laptop was able to push above a 60 FPS average for the first time using ultra settings without ray tracing or DLSS, and it doesn't just get slightly more than 60 FPS - it averages 92 FPS which is a whopping 68 percent faster than the 3080 Ti at 1440p. That's a mind blowing gain compared to the previous generation.\n\nBut at 1080p the numbers are much less impressive, at just a 20 percent increase gen on gen. Cyberpunk can be quite CPU limited at times and this appears to be the case when we're talking about just 55W of available CPU power.\n\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn showcases a 32 percent performance increase for the RTX 4090 Laptop at 1440p over the 3080 Ti, which is similar to the results seen in Far Cry 6 earlier. Not every game sees huge performance uplifts, but it's hard to be disappointed with a 32 percent gain either, again this was the norm for gen on gen uplifts from the last couple of generations. At 1080p we see a 25 percent performance uplift which is reasonable and right around the average we saw at that resolution.\n\n\nIt's hard to justify the RTX 4090 Laptop in Guardians of the Galaxy when not using ray tracing. While it does average an impressive 150 FPS at 1440p, this makes it just 19% faster than the 3080 Ti Laptop, which is the weakest result seen so far. And when flicking over to the 1080p numbers that margin drops to just 9 percent, indicating this title is CPU limited at both 1080p and (to a lesser degree) 1440p.\n\n\nForza Horizon 5 was a modest showing for the 4090 Laptop, beating the 3080 Ti by 35 percent at 1440p using Ultra settings. This didn't appear to be a CPU limited result though, as the 4090 was also 35 percent faster at 1080p.\n\n\nThe RTX 4090 Laptop loves Resident Evil Village, boasting a 227 FPS average at 1440p using max settings in the area we test - enormous levels of performance. That puts it 68 percent faster than the 3080 Ti, both running at 150W, which is a substantial performance per watt increase. At 1080p the margin between these two GPUs shrunk to 28 percent, which is certainly not as impressive.\n\n\nIn Hitman 3 we also saw huge gains at 1440p, to the tune of a 66 percent increase over the 3080 Ti Laptop in a more GPU limited test scenario using the opening cutscene of the Dubai mission. The performance here is easily sufficient for 1440p 240Hz displays, which is pretty crazy from a laptop. The margin at 1080p between these parts was nowhere near as impressive, just a 15% gain which appears to be strongly CPU limited at this resolution with even a Core i9 processor.\nRay Tracing Performance\nWhen looking at Far Cry 6 using maximum settings, the RTX 4090 Laptop runs into more of a CPU limit than GPU limit, even at 1440p. Previously we saw a 35 percent uplift over the 3080 Ti Laptop in this game, but with ray tracing enabled that margin dropped to 26 percent, and at 1080p we were even more CPU limited with a tiny 8 percent increase. In some titles it does appear the RTX 4090 Laptop is pushing the boundaries of what is possible with today's CPUs.\n\n\n\nPerformance gains are much more impressive in Cyberpunk 2077 using ray tracing at 1440p. Here we saw a 68 percent performance increase over the 3080 Ti Laptop, matching the margin without ray tracing enabled in this title.\nThis took the 4090 Laptop up to 44 FPS on average which isn't amazing, but playable after enabling DLSS. The 3080 Ti really didn't cut it in this title even when upscaling is used.\n\nWe've also got results at 1080p which highlight again a whopping 68 percent performance gain for the 4090 Laptop vs 3080 Ti Laptop. With ray tracing enabled this game is not CPU limited at 1080p and the 4090 gets to flex its muscles, but this is relatively rare at this resolution.\n\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy only saw modest improvements for the 4090 Laptop without ray tracing, but with ray tracing enabled at 1440p, the new GPU was capable of a more high refresh experience, averaging 105 FPS without upscaling enabled.\nThis is a 62% performance increase compared to the 3080 Ti, much more in line with the results seen in other titles. But when dropping back down to 1080p the game is more limited by other factors even with ray tracing enabled, at a 29% increase for these parts.\n20 Game Average\nRTX 4090 Laptop vs. RTX 3080 Ti Laptop\nSo far we've looked at 13 game benchmarks in detail, but we actually collected data from 20 games so let's take a look at a head to head comparison between the RTX 4090 Laptop and RTX 3080 Ti Laptop across all games, running at 150-175W for both.\nAt 1440p the numbers for the RTX 4090 Laptop are very impressive: on average we saw a 48 percent performance improvement, which is massive for a single generation in a power constrained laptop. This has been achieved entirely through a new architecture and new process node, Nvidia was unable to simply push up the power this generation in laptops like they have done on the desktop, but to get a 48 percent gain despite this is huge.\n\nThe results will vary depending on the game and configuration. There are some hints of CPU limitations using the RTX 4090 Laptop even at 1440p. Titles such as Guardians of the Galaxy without ray tracing and Spider-Man Remastered saw gains of less than 20 percent.\nBut on the flip side, there were some titles that saw increases in excess of 60 percent such as Hitman 3, Cyberpunk 2077 and Modern Warfare 2. Ray tracing performance has also increased in line with the gains seen using rasterization, making laptops much more viable for ray traced gaming.\n\nChecking out 4K performance which essentially remove all CPU limitations across the games benchmarked. At this resolution the RTX 4090 Laptop GPU was on average 58 percent faster than the 3080 Ti Laptop, including large gains in titles that were previously a bit CPU limited.\nWith some titles hitting a 70 percent advantage and a minimum uplift of 45 percent, the RTX 4090 Laptop does make 4K gaming on laptops more of a reality. Most titles hit 60 FPS on average at 4K using the 4090 Laptop with rasterization.\n\nWhile the 1440p and 4K results are excellent, the RTX 4090 Laptop won't see those margins at 1080p. Compared to the 3080 Ti Laptop, it's still 29 percent faster on average across 20 game configurations, but this is half the gain we saw at 4K and there were several games that weren't even 10 percent faster. We frequently run into CPU bottlenecks at 1080p with the Core i9-13950HX set to 55W, it's just not enough CPU power for this sort of GPU.\n\nGenerally we wouldn't recommend buying a 1080p laptop with an RTX 4090, but if you do, it's crucial that the laptop has two extra capabilities: One is a MUX switch that allows a direct connection between the display and discrete graphics. The second is the ability to run the CPU with a power limit of at least 75W, in addition to the GPU running at 150W.\nThat's a very high total power requirement, but with these two additions we were able to improve 1080p performance by a further 13 percent - and as much as 38 percent in the most CPU limited titles. We'd certainly say the CPU is much more important with the RTX 40 generation than we saw before.\n\nThere is also DLSS 3 support present with the RTX 4090 Laptop and this feature does seem like a more useful inclusion than with the RTX 4090 desktop card that smashes most games effortlessly.\nWhen there is a tendency to be CPU limited, DLSS 3 can generate additional frames and increase visual smoothness which is great for single-player titles that aren't latency sensitive. Spider-Man Remastered is one such game that is very CPU limited on modern laptops and doesn't benefit much from the extra performance that the RTX 4090 Laptop GPU offers outside of 4K. DLSS 3 works well in this scenario and is suited to these sorts of constrained systems.\nWhat We Learned\nThere is no doubting that the GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU is extremely powerful and opens up new possibilities for laptop gaming. With 50 to 60 percent performance improvements compared to the previous leader, the RTX 3080 Ti Laptop, the new RTX 4090 is perfect for 1440p high refresh rate gaming, as well as ray tracing and even 4K gaming at times - often without the need to look into upscaling at all.\nThis level of performance gain compared to the previous generation is very impressive, it's one of the largest we can remember for laptops and it's doubly so when these gains were seen without any increase to GPU power - something that's not possible in laptops at the moment.\n\nGoing from the GeForce RTX 20 to RTX 30 series was about a 30 percent uplift at the same power limit, and it was somewhat similar from the GTX 10 to RTX 20 series. The GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop in a best-case comparison doubles that gen-on-gen increase which is incredible news for laptop gamers, all thanks to the new architecture, chip manufacturing process, and further mobile optimizations.\nIt's actually pretty crazy to think that a modern flagship laptop in 2023 will possess the performance of an RTX 3090 desktop GPU, which by today's standards is still a very fast graphics card. The RTX 3090 was a 350W GPU, just two and a half years later we're talking about that performance inside 150 to 175 watts. That's just another way to think about the massive performance per watt increase we're seeing this generation.\n\nNvidia complements this performance nicely with a strong feature set. DLSS 2 continues to be the leading upscaling technology that's the most supported in today's games, and DLSS 3 makes more sense for this type of laptop GPU that can run into CPU limitations. On top of that, we get things like Reflex and Nvidia's encoding. It's a very compelling package for mobile gamers.\nOn the negatives, we have the misleading branding. While the RTX 4090 Laptop does perform similarly to an RTX 3090 desktop card, that doesn't make it an RTX 4090, not even close. When you're only giving the laptop chip 60% of the CUDA cores seen in the desktop card with the exact same name, it simply should not be called the RTX 4090. Find another name, use an M at the end, anything else would be better.\n\nThis is compounded by the power target situation, where an 80W RTX 4090 and 150W RTX 4090 also have the exact same name, but the 80W model will be substantially slower. Imagine reading this review, getting all excited about the performance, going out and buying an RTX 4090 laptop only to find you actually bought one with an 80W GPU that performs 30% worse than what we showed here. That would be bitterly disappointing and could easily be avoided with a more sensible naming scheme.\nWhile not really an issue with the GPU itself, the GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop is powerful enough that it does frequently run into CPU bottlenecks at 1080p and even 1440p at times - and the laptop we used had a high-end Core i9-13950HX processor inside. We would advise against buying an RTX 4090 laptop with a 1080p display because you just won't get the benefit this GPU has to offer. A MUX switch is also essential this generation, as are high CPU power limits and beefy cooling.\n\nTo access the highest levels of performance you'll need a laptop with 150W of GPU power and likely 75W or more of CPU power. That's over 200W of combined power and heat to dissipate, which isn't feasible for most laptop designs. Only the largest and heaviest systems can support that level of power, which takes away from the portability of getting a mobile gaming system. The power brick for the MSI Titan GT77 alone is enormous, which you have to carry around in addition to the large laptop itself.\n\nFinally, there's the inescapable roadblock of pricing. Nvidia RTX 4090 laptops are disgustingly expensive. The MSI GT77 used in this review is a $5,000 laptop; that's right. The absolute cheapest model currently listed on Newegg is the Gigabyte Aorus 17X for $3,500, which remains a very expensive option.\nSpec over a gaming desktop that includes a Core i9-13900K, a desktop RTX 4090, plenty of memory and storage, good cooling, the works. This is an incredible gaming machine, and because it has a desktop Core i9 and RTX 4090 it will blow away the laptop Core i9 and RTX 4090 in performance. That will set you back around $3,500 without choosing bang for buck components. The same price as the cheapest RTX 4090 laptop.\n\nIt seems clear that part of the reason why Nvidia has named this GPU the \"RTX 4090\" is to allow OEMs to give it price parity with similar desktop configurations. To someone that hasn't done the research, you'd be looking at an RTX 4090 Core i9 desktop for $3,500, or an RTX 4090 Core i9 laptop for $3,500, and thinking they are roughly the same. Why not get the laptop? It's portable, comes with a screen... surely with the same components and price, I'm getting the same thing, right? This obviously isn't the case and is why the prices for these laptops feel absurdly expensive. This kind of relegates RTX 4090 laptops to a niche market segment comprised of huge power hungry laptops unless you buy a thin model and get reduced performance.\n\nComparing these prices to last generation GPU models, Nvidia launched the 3080 Ti Laptop GPU starting in $2,500 laptops, and these days you're looking at spending about $2,300 at the lowest. That means the cheapest RTX 4090 configurations will be offering about 50 to 60 percent more gaming performance in GPU limited scenarios, at about a 50% higher price. Yes, there's a huge generational leap in performance, but it's hard to get all that excited when it doesn't come with a price to performance improvement. You're thus faced with spending more money in line with the speed increase.\nBottom line, the performance on offer is excellent, the hardware is clearly very good, it's fast, efficient and very impressive. But in this size of laptop and the absurd prices we're looking at, it's hard to recommend to most gamers. With demand for consumers PCs falling, we think flagship RTX 4090-powered laptops will be tough to sell in any significant numbers.\nShopping Shortcuts\n\nGeForce RTX 4090 Laptops on Amazon\nIntel Core i9-13950HX Laptops on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3080 Ti Laptops on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3070 Laptops on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 9 6900HS Laptops on Amazon\n\nFurther Testing\nSince we published this review of the GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU, we have run additional benchmarks and comparisons you may be interested in:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4090 vs. AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX: Is the Premium Worth It?\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Desktop vs. Laptop GPU\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Laptop GPU Review\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 37\n\n\n Got something to say?

The deal will also bring Activision Blizzard\u2019s games, including the Call of Duty franchise, to Nvidia\u2019s cloud-gaming service should Microsoft\u2019s proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard go through.In a news release outlining the 10-year deal, Microsoft and Nvidia said their agreement will let players \u201cstream Xbox PC titles from GeForce Now to PCs, macOS, Chromebooks, smartphones and other devices.\u201d According to Nvidia, GeForce Now has more than 25 million members in over 100 countries.The companies did not specify which Xbox PC games would be included as part of the arrangement, but the list would likely include titles like Halo Infinite, Forza Horizon 5, Microsoft Flight Simulator, and other high-profile first-party offerings. The deal could also see the return of Bethesda Softworks-published games to GeForce Now, which were removed \u2014 alongside a host of Activision Blizzard titles \u2014 three years ago.Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith unveiled the deal during a press conference in Brussels, where the company held a hearing with European Union and national antitrust officials in an attempt to push its $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard past regulators. The deal with Nvidia comes the same day that Microsoft announced it has signed a \u201cbinding 10-year legal agreement\u201d to put Call of Duty on Nintendo platforms.In January, Nvidia reportedly expressed concerns with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that Microsoft\u2019s proposed buyout of Activision Blizzard could hinder competition. Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now is a competitor to Microsoft\u2019s Cloud Gaming initiative, which brings Xbox and PC games to a variety of devices, including smartphones. Nvidia reportedly did not directly oppose the deal, but stressed the need for open and equal access to Activision Blizzard\u2019s games.On Feb. 8, the U.K.\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority announced it had \u201cprovisionally concluded\u201d its investigation into Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and decided the deal could harm competition in the games market in a way that would have an impact on gamers. As part of its findings, the CMA said the deal could stifle competition in the growing cloud gaming market.See More: GamingMobileNewsPCXboxMost PopularBrandon Sanderson shared a list of his 10 favorite games, and they make perfect senseBring back the 2000s-era sci-fi flopbusterThere will likely never be a Hunger Games sequel, says Suzanne Collins\u2019 editorThe Lord of the Rings illustrated box set is on sale for its lowest price everIndie game\u2019s \u2018lesbian toggle\u2019 makes it hilariously unplayablePatch NotesThe best of Polygon in your inbox, every Friday.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

There's no reason explained behind the shortages but one can say that it might be due to the limited production of these cards through the Chinese New Year.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPSNow NVIDIA did happen to produce a larger number of RTX 40 GPUs early on so whether this will affect the availability of the cards is another matter. The RTX 4090 and RTX 4070 Ti had a decent initial supply while the RTX 4080 was produced in much lower quantities than the flagship GeForce RTX 4090. The RTX 4070 Ti being a recent launch has been very popular amongst gamers as data acquired by TechEpiphany from Germany's largest retailer shows. The report also suggests that the RTX 4070 Ti overall shipments are in short supply, accounting for just 8% of the total shipments.\nhttps://twitter.com/TechEpiphany/status/1623036232929366016\nFollowing are the best-selling GPUs over at Newegg as of February 2023:\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 is once again rumored to get a price cut after supply gets better. The exact timeframe of this price cut is not known but it's long overdue as many similar rumors showed up in the past and the card hasn't been as popular as the other two RTX 40 offerings due to its perf to dollar ratio. The card is currently priced $200 US higher than the Radeon RX 7900 XTX which isn't super competitive since the XTX can outperform it in many games. NVIDIA might drop it to 1100 or if they are feeling even more competitive, to $1000 US but that remains to be seen.\nBesides the RTX 40 series cards, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series cards will also see an update with the RTX 3090 and RTX 3080 more or less delisted and the RTX 3070 / RTX 3060 card prices are seeing heavy price adjustments due to the upcoming RTX 4070 and RTX 4060 graphics cards.\nThe RTX 3060 series cards aren't entirely getting replaced by the RTX 4060 but the standard 3060 cards will be replaced by the newer RTX 3060 GDDR6X models as the older stock eventually dies out. The GeForce 16 series cards will also be replaced by the RTX 3050 for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n165\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Has Sold Over Three Million Blackwell AI GPUs This Year, Expects to Hit A Whopping $1 Trillion in Revenue by 2027\n\n\n\n121\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n76\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n72\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n69\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1158\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The P7 RWD, long-range model also has optimized charging power to reach 80% in 29 minutes, while offering up to 358 miles on a single charge.\nTo ensure an easy, fast charging experience, XPENG customers can access more than 400,000 charging stations in Europe through the automaker\u2019s collaboration with major third-party charging operations and mobility service providers.\nThe XPENG G9 features faster charging and longer range, up to 354 miles on a single charge.\nBeauty Backed by Brains and Brawn\nWith the high compute power found only with DRIVE Orin, the XPENG G9 and P7 advanced driving systems boast superior performance, while sporting sleek and elegant designs, quality craftsmanship and comfort to meet the most discerning of tastes.\nThe upgraded in-car Xmart operating system (OS) features a new 3D user interface that offers support in English and other European languages, depending on the market. The OS comes with an improved voice assistant that can distinguish voice commands from four zones in the cabin. It also features wide infotainment screens and a library of in-car apps to assist and entertain both the driver and passengers.\nThe G9 and P7 are available in all-wheel drive (AWD) or RWD configurations. XPENG reports that the G9\u2019s AWD version delivers up to 551 horsepower, and can accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour in 3.9 seconds, while the upgraded P7 AWD model can do the same in 4.1 seconds.\nThe XPENG P7 features an immersive cabin experience.\nDeliveries of the P7 will begin in June, while the G9 is expected to start in September.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotally Photoshopped Nvidia Titan RTX Ada\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia released its Ada Lovelace architecture in October 2022, starting with the GeForce RTX 4090 and then following up with additional variants. Prices have increased compared to the previous generation, some more than others, but these are still some of the best graphics cards currently available, with the 4090 occupying the top spot on our GPU benchmarks hierarchy.\u00a0But right from the start, we knew that Nvidia was holding back, saving room for a potential RTX 4090 Ti or a new Titan RTX Ada. Here's what we know about the future uber-GPUs of the Ada generation.\n\nNvidia currently has three desktop Ada GPUs in production, the AD102, AD103, and AD104 that are used in the RTX 4090, RTX 4080, and RTX 4070 Ti, respectively. It also has mobile RTX 40-series GPUs now in production that range from the entry-level RTX 4050 mobile up to the RTX 4090, which add the smaller AD106 and AD107 chips into the mix \u2014 though note that the mobile 4090 uses the same chip as the desktop 4080. The RTX 4090 Ti and Titan RTX Ada, depending on which way Nvidia decides to go, will naturally land at the top of the stack, and as such will also use the AD102 chip.\n\nRight now, the RTX 4090, for all its performance and power, only uses a portion of the full AD102 GPU. It's a large portion, to be sure, with 128 out of a possible 144 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) enabled \u2014 89% of the GPU cores, in other words. Except Nvidia also disabled 1MB of L2 cache on each of the twelve 32-bit memory interfaces, giving it 75% of the maximum L2 cache. All it needs to do is to turn on those missing pieces, and perhaps even crank up the clock speeds and power draw a bit, and we end up with a new, even faster RTX 4090 Ti.\n\nAnd make no mistake, Nvidia already has basically fully functional AD102 chips in the wild. The professional Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada Generation, for instance, has 142 of the 144 SMs turned on, plus the full 96MB of L2 cache. Except power draw is capped at a 'meager' 300W, which means the card generally won't run as fast for as long \u2014 not actually a bad approach, but we already know that with a bit more power and voltage, it's possible to get most Ada chips to run at closer to 3.0 GHz. That's effectively what we expect to see from a future RTX 4090 Ti and/or Titan RTX Ada.Nvidia RTX 4090 Ti / Titan RTX Rumored Specifications and Other Ada GPUsSwipe to scroll horizontallyGraphics CardTitan RTX AdaRTX 4090 TiRTX 4090RTX 4080RTX 4070 TiArchitectureAD102AD102AD102AD103AD104Process TechnologyTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTransistors (Billion)76.376.376.345.935.8Die size (mm^2)608.4608.4608.4378.6294.5SMs1421421287660GPU Cores (Shaders)18176181761638497287680Tensor Cores568568512304240RT Cores1421421287660Boost Clock (MHz)25202625252025052610VRAM Speed (Gbps)24242122.421VRAM (GB)4824241612VRAM Bus Width384384384256192L2 Cache9696726448ROPs19219217611280TMUs568568512304240TFLOPS FP32 (Boost)91.695.482.648.740.1TFLOPS FP16 (FP8)733 (1466)763 (1527)661 (1321)390 (780)321 (641)Bandwidth (GBps)115211521008717504TDP (watts)800600450320285Launch Date??Oct 2022Nov 2022Jan 2023Launch PriceArm + Leg + KidneyArm + Leg$1,599$1,199$799The currently rumored specs are basically similar to what we see with the RTX 6000 Ada Generation, but now with double the TGP (Total Graphics Power) and a slightly higher boost clock on the 4090 Ti, or even a significantly higher 800W power limit for the Titan RTX Ada.\n\nThe higher TGPs of course means these cards would be far more likely to hit the rated boost clocks. And if they're like other RTX 40-series desktop GPUs, it's more than likely they'll far exceed the boost clocks. Our testing of RTX 4090, 4080, and 4070 Ti cards to date has shown that real-world gaming boost clocks often average closer to 200 MHz above the official boost clock.\n\nEverything else follows from the core counts and boost clock. In terms of raw specs, if the rumors are correct, the RTX 4090 Ti will hit peak throughput of 95.4 teraflops for FP32 work, and up to 1.5 petaflops for FP8 computations on the Tensor cores. That's 15% faster than the RTX 4090 in both cases.\n\nTo help the card sustain maximum throughput, the GDDR6X memory will also get bumped up to 24 Gbps, 14% faster than the 21 Gbps memory used with the RTX 4090. Coupled with 33% more L2 cache, the memory subsystem should be well-equipped to keep the rest of the GPU fed with data.\n\nThe Titan RTX Ada rumors are less solid, and currently show a 2520 MHz boost clock \u2014 the same as the RTX 4090. Given it's also supposed to have dual 16-pin power connectors and an 800W TGP, however, we would expect such a card (if it actually comes out) to push for even higher clocks. What we've seen of the latest GDDR6X 24 Gbps modules from Micron suggests power and heat from the memory won't be nearly as problematic as it was on the earlier RTX 3090, even with chips on both sides of the PCB.\n\nThere's still the power to contend with, however, and even if the cards don't always hit 600W/800W, they're likely to push well above 500W when running demanding games at 4K and maxed out settings. We've already seen that happen with the RTX 4090 cards we've reviewed once we manually overclocked them, but the 4090 Ti / Titan Ada will make that the norm rather than an OC.Supposedly an image of the Titan RTX Ada, via YouTuber Moore's Law Is Dead (Image credit: Moore\u2019s Law is Dead)Coping with that much power will require an exceptional cooling subsystem. We generally found the RTX 4090's triple-slot cooling to be adequate, but there are images and leaks floating around the web showing a quad-slot gold cooler. Perhaps they're fakes, but the extra slot width plus the gold coloring suggests we're more likely than not looking at a new Titan RTX Ada rather than an RTX 4090 Ti \u2014 or maybe Nvidia will do both, although the 4090 Ti would likely have a silver cooler. It's too early to say for certain how everything will play out.\n\nThe 4-slot Nvidia RTX 4090 Ti / Titan RTX Ada card images look comically large, and considering even the existing RTX 4090 already starts hitting CPU limits in many games at anything below 4K (at least if the game doesn't have ray tracing), this definitely feels like Nvidia is getting ready to jump the shark. Hopefully Nvidia provides an extra sturdy IO bracket (secured to the top and bottom of the cooler) that covers all four slots to help prevent sag. Or maybe Nvidia will just include a kickstand of some form like many of its AIB partners have elected to do with the RTX 4090.\n\nThat just leaves the pricing and release date, neither of which are known yet. Given the leaks of the cooler, we could see the new halo card within the next month or two, or Nvidia may hold out for a summer or even fall launch window, letting the card serve as the mid-cycle refresh at the top of the RTX 40-series stack. Launching at either GDC (in March) or the next GTC (also in March) is certainly a possibility, particularly if Nvidia opts for the \"prosumer and creator\" target market with a new Titan RTX Ada, and it could hold the RTX 4090 Ti for a later date.\n\nPricing will naturally be ridiculous. Any hope of a future RTX 4090 Ti or Titan RTX Ada card carrying a reasonable price tag basically went out the window when the RTX 4090 cards were routinely sold out or priced above $2,000 for the first three months after launch. We still suspect a lot of that came from professional users who were willing to pay more for top performance in AI and other computational workloads, and a 4090 Ti or Titan RTX Ada would cater to those same users.\n\nIf Nvidia goes with GeForce RTX 4090 Ti branding, it will probably set the price at $1,999. For a new Titan RTX Ada, $2,499 or even $2,999 seems likely. A Titan would offer most of what the RTX 6000 Ada already provides (depending on the VRAM capacity), plus higher clocks thanks to the increased TGP, and three grand would still be less than half the price of the true professional GPU. Those who are only interested in bragging rights at any price also appear to have sufficient funds to pay whatever Nvidia asks.(Image credit: Nvidia)The rest of us can stick with more reasonable GPUs, like a replacement for the RTX 3060 Ti \u2014 or just wait for the inevitable RTX 50-series, which will probably arrive in late 2024. Because if there's one thing we know for certain, it's that no matter how fast the future RTX 4090 Ti and/or Titan RTX Ada end up being, at some point Nvidia will release an RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 (or some other name, perhaps) that will provide even higher performance than what the fastest Ada Lovelace graphics card can hope to deliver.\n\nIf we're lucky, maybe the current downturn in GPU and PC sales will even spur more aggressive pricing for a change. That happened, in theory at least, with the RTX 3080 in 2020. It's too bad cryptocurrency mining and the pandemic ended up ruining prices for the next two years and influencing the current round of higher prices.\n\nWe do at least have a codename for Ada's successor: Blackwell, presumably after David Harold Blackwell, a mathematician and statistician who specialized in game theory and information theory. Except we don't know for certain if Blackwell is solely a future Hopper replacement (for the data center market), or if it will span both the data center and consumer markets, similar to Ampere. Considering Ada Lovelace is only a few months old, pinning our sights on Blackwell at this stage seems a bit premature.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nAda Lovelace\nGeForce RTX 4090\nTitan\nGeForce\nrtx\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (19)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

The RTX 4090 is already able to saturate the bandwidth of its DP 1.4a interface. A more powerful card would be aimed at either gamers willing to spend for a top-tier experience, or professionals looking needing to work in high resolutions and highly accurate (large) color spaces. Nvidia will need to upgrade to the current DP 2.1 standard in order for either card to make sense for either use case, to justify the increased cost over 4090, or 6000 Ada.\n\nAlso, in terms of cooling a 4090 Ti, which would primarily be aimed at gamers, it seems unlikely that anyone would actually air cool these. If you are willing and able to splash out for a 4090 Ti with its nosebleed prices, you will probably be fine with the relatively low cost of cooling it with a custom water cooling loop. This would give you a single-slot card without any concern over thermals. Ideally, Nvidia would release the 4090 Ti with a preinstalled water block. This would align the card with its most likely use case, and also reduce a lot of waste by not making massive coolers that nobody will use and will end up in landfills. I know there will be idiot reporters who will freak out about the implications of releasing a card that requires additional parts to complete the cooling solution, but for a halo card, that really shouldn\u2019t be a concern. Plus it is reasonable to assume it would be way cheaper to make a waterblock than it would be to make the monstrous air cooler such a high TDP card would require. That might enable Nvidia to keep the price a bit lower, or increase margins, or both. Board partners could always choose to make an AIO solution for the even tinier niche of people with enough money to buy this halo card, but neither the brains, time, or initiative to set up a custom loop.\n\nFinally, air cooling it could prove controversial if many cases can\u2019t handle all that heat being dumped into their internal space.

It will only come to be if amd launches a 7950xtx that offers comparable or greater performance than the current 4090\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_dawn_chorus_\n\n\nJDJJ said:Disappointing that they didn\u2019t discuss the DisplayPort issue. The RTX 4090 is already able to saturate the bandwidth of its DP 1.4a interface. A more powerful card would be aimed at either gamers willing to spend for a top-tier experience, or professionals looking needing to work in high resolutions and highly accurate (large) color spaces. Nvidia will need to upgrade to the current DP 2.1 standard in order for either card to make sense for either use case, to justify the increased cost over 4090, or 6000 Ada.\n\nAlso, in terms of cooling a 4090 Ti, which would primarily be aimed at gamers, it seems unlikely that anyone would actually air cool these. If you are willing and able to splash out for a 4090 Ti with its nosebleed prices, you will probably be fine with the relatively low cost of cooling it with a custom water cooling loop. This would give you a single-slot card without any concern over thermals. Ideally, Nvidia would release the 4090 Ti with a preinstalled water block. This would align the card with its most likely use case, and also reduce a lot of waste by not making massive coolers that nobody will use and will end up in landfills. I know there will be idiot reporters who will freak out about the implications of releasing a card that requires additional parts to complete the cooling solution, but for a halo card, that really shouldn\u2019t be a concern. Plus it is reasonable to assume it would be way cheaper to make a waterblock than it would be to make the monstrous air cooler such a high TDP card would require. That might enable Nvidia to keep the price a bit lower, or increase margins, or both. Board partners could always choose to make an AIO solution for the even tinier niche of people with enough money to buy this halo card, but neither the brains, time, or initiative to set up a custom loop.\n\nFinally, air cooling it could prove controversial if many cases can\u2019t handle all that heat being dumped into their internal space. Judging by case reviews from the likes of Gamers Nexus, enclosed cases with thermals good enough to handle exhausting that much hot air are very rare, perhaps non-existant. Nvidia could side-step this potential \u201cscandal\u201d completely by just making it a water-cooled card.\n\nLast, a Founders Edition waterblock, taking styling cues from the shrouds on their FE air coolers, might look pretty sweet! \nAckchyually... The 4090 has fantastic cooling already. What makes you think a ~10% beefier version would necessitate being water cooled?\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarrior24_7\n\n\nAdmin said:Rumors are swirling about an upcoming Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Ti, or potentially a new Titan RTX \u2014 maybe even both!

Nvidia commands over 90% market share! AMD actually LOST market share! This IS NOT competitive. AMD is not a true rival. Nvidia does what it wants, and charges what it wants because it owns the market. This whole Nvidia vs AMD is mainly a AMD fanboy argument. AMD\u2019s cards and drivers are horrible. AMD fanboys use Nvidia cards! Thinking that AMD dictates what Nvidia does is absolutely absurd.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarrior24_7\n\n\nAdmin said:Rumors are swirling about an upcoming Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Ti, or potentially a new Titan RTX \u2014 maybe even both!

However, according to sources at Board Channels, there is a forty-two percent decline in sales of GPUs year to year. With NVIDIA and AMD releasing expensive graphics cards to power today's level of graphics and more, prices are now beginning to decline between the two GPU giants.\nAMD and NVIDIA have witnessed drops in GPU pricing in Europe over the last few months since both company's releases\nGraphics cards sold this month are shown to be nearly ninety-three percent higher than three years ago, according to German retailer Mindfactory. The increased percentage is speculated to be affected, at least for the moment, by NVIDIA and AMD's gregarious price models for their current generation's graphics cards.\nFor instance, AMD Radeon graphics cards, on average, cost \u20ac600. NVIDIA's cards are higher at (on average) \u20ac825. Two years ago, AMD's average selling price was around \u20ac305, with NVIDIA's about \u20ac398. The price difference between the two competitors is close to \u20ac300 and \u20ac430.\n\nHardware Info recently reported that AMD's Radeon RX 6000 series graphics card prices are declining, and NVIDIA, with their highest-end GeForce RTX 3090, is showing a slow decline as well, by close to twelve percent over the last month. The newer generation is seeing between a 6.2% to 6.9% reduction in cost for the consumer.\n\n\n\nGPU (NVIDIA)Suggested retail price (\u20ac)Avg.\u00a0January priceAvg.\u00a0February priceDifference from JanuaryDifference from msrp\n\n\n\n\nRTX 3050285302293-3,0%+2,9%\n\n\nRTX 3060 8 GB349355358+1,0%+2,7%\n\n\nRTX 3060 12 GB349382371-2,9%-15,4%\n\n\nRTX 3060 Ti439455450-1,2%+2,4%\n\n\nRTX 3070549589588-0,2%+7,1%\n\n\nRTX 3070 Ti649698716+2,5%+10,3%\n\n\nRTX 3080759907817-9,9%+7,6%\n\n\nRTX 3080 Ti1.2691.1941.336+11,9%+5,3%\n\n\nRTX 30901.6491.8201.654-9,1%+0,3%\n\n\nRTX 3090 Ti2.2492.1551.604-25,6%-28,7%\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 4070 Ti909948933-1,6%+2,6%\n\n\nRTX 40801.3991.3861.350-2,6%-3,5%\n\n\nRTX 40901.8491.9791.857-6,2%+0,4%\n\n\nTotal-3,0%+0,3%\n\n\n\nThis information follows a rumor published almost two weeks ago that NVIDIA will have a limited market supply for the remainder of this first quarter of 2023.

Leveraging the dedicated AI tensor cores in GeForce RTX graphics cards let Nvidia run supported games much faster than before with little to no visual downgrade. Today, Nvidia is unleashing those same tensor cores on web videos with RTX Video Super Resolution after unveiling the feature at CES 2023.\nI spent the weekend playing around with the technology and I\u2019m thrilled to report that while there are a few minor DLSS-like caveats to be aware of, RTX Video Super Resolution is an absolute game changer on par with DLSS. If you watch web videos regularly, it\u2019s a compelling reason to consider Nvidia over AMD if you\u2019re shopping for a new graphics card and use Chrome or Edge. But better yet, it\u2019s coming to existing RTX 30-series GPUs as well as Nvidia\u2019s new RTX 40-series offerings.\n\n\nWhat is RTX Video Super Resolution?\nLet\u2019s start with a quick recap of how RTX Video Super Resolution\u2014introduced today in Nvidia\u2019s new Game Ready Driver (531.14)\u2014works.\nAs PCWorld\u2019s Keith May explains in the video below, after you activate RTX Video Super Resolution in the Nvidia Control Panel (more on that later), it runs any video displayed in Chrome or Edge through an AI algorithm designed to drastically improve the final image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt runs [your video] through an algorithm that softens the darks and the blacks that get crushed and blown out and blocky, and then it\u2019s going to take all of your high-contrast areas\u2014like user interface elements\u2014and make them really sharp,\u201d Keith explained. \u201cThe final image isn\u2019t going to be a true representation of what [native 4K video] would look like, because you\u2019re working with a 1080p source, but it\u2019s going to look substantially better.\u201d\nAnd it absolutely does.\n\nThere\u2019s a bit more happening behind the scenes though. While Keith focused on upscaling a 1080p image to 4K in his CES video, RTX Video Super Resolution can automatically upscale a wide range of video resolutions, from lowly 360p all the way up to 1440p. It doesn\u2019t upscale at fixed resolutions either, instead adjusting to fit the size of the display window. \u201cYour 480p video will upres to 1080p on a 1080p screen (in full-screen mode) or somewhere between 480p and 1080p depending on the size of the playback window,\u201d Nvidia\u2019s Jordan Dodge told me, and my tests confirm the fact.\nRTX Video Super Resolution works like black magic\u2026usually\nRemember the first time you ever played a game on an adaptive sync G-Sync or FreeSync monitor? The difference in moment-to-moment game feel was monumental, but it doesn\u2019t come across very well in screenshots that only capture a static image in time. RTX Video Super Resolution is similar, but you can spot some differences in freeze-frames. (I received access to the feature late Friday, when our production team was busy working on Ryzen 9 7950X3D coverage, and was unable to capture video footage of RTX Super Resolution in action.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe best budget 4K gaming monitor\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nAsus TUF Gaming VG289Q\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, though, I want to talk about the experience of using RTX Video Super Resolution. Once you\u2019ve tried it, you\u2019ll never want to go back to standard web video. I watched a wide variety of 1080p videos on my 4K displays, alternating between Firefox (which doesn\u2019t support VSR) and Chrome to see the difference between native 1080p and VSR-upscaled 4K in real time, and it\u2019s flat-out revolutionary.\nThe biggest difference can be seen in videos with a crisp, clear, production-quality 1080p image at a high bitrate. Watching Holey Moley on Hulu and Drink Masters on Netflix with RTX Video Super Resolution Active was transformative, even on VSR\u2019s lowest quality preset. (It offers four different quality levels, with varying levels of GPU performance impact. More on that later.) On Firefox, the 1080p video looks blurry and blocky in full-screen stretched across my 4K panel; turning on VSR in Chrome immediately ended that, delivering a crisp, clean image that left my jaw on the floor.\n\nUnfortunately, neither Netflix nor Hulu lets you take screenshots due to copyright protections. I was able to take some screenshots of Drink Masters\u2019 trailer on YouTube that somewhat highlight the potential of VSR, but YouTube\u2019s blockier lower bitrate native image means you won\u2019t see the full, borderline magical effect of RTX Video Super Resolution in the screenshots below.\nHere\u2019s a picture from the trailer introducing the contestants. (I recommend right-clicking these images and selecting \u201cview image in new tab\u201d to see them at full 4K resolution.) At native 1080p in Firefox, you see a lot of blurriness and blocky, jagged edges:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/iDG\nHere\u2019s the same still, taken in Chrome with VSR\u2019s highest quality preset enabled. Not only is most of the blurriness gone\u2014and what\u2019s left can be attributed to standard motion blur\u2014but the edges now look incredibly crisp, and the enhanced clarity helps the colors pop more too. (Pay close attention to how the brightly-shirted contestants look so much better, the smoothness around the rightmost people, and even the legibility of the bottles in the back and the Netflix logo in the corner.)\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/iDG\nIn close inspection, this static image may look overly crisp and smoothed out, with more sharpening than you\u2019d usually expect to see. It\u2019s something common to all the screenshots I took. But don\u2019t be fooled; RTX Video Super Resolution looks stunning in motion compared to standard web video, and you don\u2019t notice those potential nitpicks whatsoever when a video is playing. Like DLSS, VSR can be pixel-peeped in individual frames but the overall in-motion effect looks outstanding.\n\nRTX Video Super Resolution also cleans up gameplay video on YouTube and Twitch to noticeable effect, but their lower bitrates somewhat stunt the impact. Watching a video of Stodeh\u2019s favorite Call of Duty: MW2 DMZ moments definitely looks better overall with VSR active, but it has more difficulty eliminating some of the blockiness and blurriness, especially in fast-moving scenes with complex gameplay occurring (such as when Stodeh failed a helicopter extraction and needed to pop smoke grenades with bullets whizzing by around the 1:35 mark of the linked video). It\u2019s still absolutely worth activating VSR, though.\n\u2026but there are limits to its effectiveness. I also watched the Top Gun Maverick trailer on YouTube, manually setting the resolution to 480p (a.k.a standard VHS definition) and watching it full-screen on my 4K display. As with DLSS, VSR\u2019s AI tensor cores can struggle when it\u2019s trying to upscale video with exceptionally low native pixel counts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/iDG\nHere\u2019s a screenshot of the native 480p video running in Firefox. It\u2019s blurry, like you\u2019d expect, but everything looks right.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/iDG\nAnd here\u2019s the same still upscaled via RTX Virtual Super Resolution. Open the images in a new tab and pay particular attention to the right side of the guy\u2019s face. It looks even blurrier than the native 480p Firefox feed, with Nvidia\u2019s AI adding significant distortion to his cheek and even the shape of his eye. The edge of his hairline appears overly harsh as well. This is not just pixel peeping. Using VSR to upres 480p video to 4K looks worse than native, both in stills and in motion.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/iDG\n\u2026but all is not lost. Here\u2019s the same 480p still upscaled to 1080p instead. This much more reasonable jump in resolution results in a much clearer picture overall, once again delivering the same black magic-like leap in visual quality we saw when upscaling Drink Masters and Holey Moley from 1080p to 4K. All of the previously witnessed AI distortion is gone and the trailer looks fantastic in motion.\nBottom line? Treat it reasonably and RTX Virtual Super Resolution is an absolute game changer. Get extreme and things can start to go off the rails. Fortunately, most people won\u2019t be upscaling 480p video to 4K very often.\n\n\nBut how does RTX Virtual Super Resolution actually change your games?\nRTX Video Super Resolution performance impact\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tthe best GPU you can buy \t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$3,499.95 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\nVirtual Super Resolution uses your Nvidia RTX graphics card\u2019s GPU and tensor core muscle to achieve its effects, so it stands to reason that activating it can hinder gaming performance. The good news: It\u2019s only a concern when you\u2019re actively gaming and watching a video simultaneously. The less good news? RTX VSR will send performance plummeting if you do that, so you won\u2019t want to leave YouTube videos playing on a second screen while you\u2019re slaying noobs in Call of Duty.\nNvidia actually offers four quality preset levels with VSR, with varying levels of visual effectiveness and performance impact. Level 1 is the least strenuous (while still providing a massive visual quality boost), while level 4 is the most. I repeatedly watched the first chapter of Stodeh\u2019s video with Windows 10\u2019s Task Measure running to get a feel for what each setting needed, keeping an eye on how much the RTX GPU was being utilized during the run. \nActual GPU utilization can vary depending on the complexity of the scene being upscaled, I discovered, but here\u2019s a broad look at the results:\n\n\nRTX VSR off \u2013 between 4 and 33% GPU utilization, mostly 17-19%VSR 1 \u2013 between 25 and 33%, usually 32%VSR 2 \u2013 24 to 35%, consistent 30-34%VSR 3 \u2013 29 to 35%, consistent 34 to 36%VSR 4 \u2013 44 to 46% consistent\nSo turning on VSR even at its lowest level uses a substantial chunk of your GPU, but there\u2019s very little performance difference between VSR preset 1 and 3. Using preset 4 uses the most grunt, but also delivers by far the best visuals.\n\n\n\n\nTurning on RTX Video Super Resolution\u2019s lowest (1) quality preset while watching this Stodeh video resulted in the GeForce GPU running at 32 percent utilization pretty consistently.Brad Chacos/iDG\nBut what does that mean in practice? To measure VSR\u2019s impact, I ran Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s strenuous benchmark at 4K resolution and the Ultra graphics preset, to saturate the GPU, while also playing Episode 3 of Netflix\u2019s Drink Masters full-screen on my second 4K display, upscaling the native 1080p video with VSR on. I tested with both VSR 1 and 4 presets, and also tested whether activating DLSS and DLSS Frame Gen hurt performance even more, since both DLSS and RTX Video Super Resolution lean on Nvidia\u2019s tensor cores. Both the average frame rate and the minimum frame rate matter here, as minimum frame rates affect the overall feeling of smoothness in a game. The results:\nNative Cyberpunk, no video playing \u2013 83.29 avg, 54.23 minNetflix video playing, VSR off \u2013 81.78 avg, 40.40 minNetflix on, VSR 1 on \u2013 48.74 avg, 39.66 minNetflix on, VSR 4 on \u2013 44.55 avg, 36.97 min\nAs you can see, playing a video on a second monitor while running Cyberpunk without VSR on doesn\u2019t really affect the average frame rate, but sends the minimum frame rate plummeting. That\u2019s to be expected when you\u2019re running a background video like that though. Flipping on VSR instantly tanks the average frame rate however, sending the frames per second plummeting by roughly 40 percent, on top of the standard drop in minimum frame rates that simply streaming a video entails.\nThere\u2019s no real performance difference between VSR 1 and 4, however. But does that hold true when the tensor cores are being lit up by VSR and DLSS alike? Nope.\n\n\nNative Cyberpunk, no video playing \u2013 83.29 avg, 54.23 minNetflix on, VSR off, DLSS 3 (balanced) Frame Gen on \u2013 110.48 avg, 72 minNetflix on, VSR 1 on, DLSS 3 (balanced) Frame Gen on \u2013 106.44 avg, 69.86 minNetflix on, VSR 4 on, DLSS 3 (balanced) Frame Gen on \u2013 87.27 avg, 61.66 min\nTurning on DLSS 3 Frame Gen immediately supercharges Cyberpunk\u2019s average and minimum frame rates alike, even with Nvidia Reflex disabled (as I did for my testing). With half the game frames being generated by Nvidia\u2019s AI cores, releasing stress from the GPU cores, flipping on VSR 1 barely affects performance whatsoever. But both the average and minimum frame times suffer with the more intensive VSR 4 enabled. It\u2019s worth pointing out that VSR\u2019s performance impact is lessened with DLSS 3 Frame Gen turned on, however, and even the worst-case DLSS/VSR 4 results deliver significantly better performance than Cyberpunk running without DLSS active.\nAll in all, I wouldn\u2019t run a VSR-upscaled video in a browser while gaming, because its performance impact can be tangible. It won\u2019t be an issue if you aren\u2019t gaming and watching simultaneously, however. If you want to watch vids while gaming, flipping VSR on or off is quick and easy.\nHow to turn on RTX Video Super Resolution\nNow that you know how RTX Video Super Resolution works, it\u2019s time to show you how to turn it on. You can\u2019t simply press a keyboard shortcut or flip a button in GeForce Experience. Instead, you need to dive into the slow, long-overdue-for-an-update Nvidia Control Panel.\nFirst though, make sure you have what you need. Update your GeForce GPU to the latest Game Ready Driver, as today\u2019s release includes VSR support, and make sure either Chrome or Edge are fully updated as well. Your GPU drivers and browser both need to be on a modern build with VSR support for it to work. You\u2019ll also need to have an Nvidia GeForce RTX 30- or 40-series GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\nOnce that\u2019s done, right-click on your desktop and select Nvidia Control Panel. In the window that opens, select the Adjust Video Image Settings option in the Video section of the left-hand pane. Select the monitor you want to use VSR with, check the Super resolution box in the RTX video enhancement section, and choose a quality preset\u2014I recommend 4, as it delivers the best experience and you don\u2019t want to run VSR videos while gaming anyways. Then click Apply and start your VSR upscaling engines.\nIf you want to disable VSR while gaming\u2014and again, you should if you leave videos running in a browser while you play\u2014just disable that checkbox and hit Apply once more.\nBottom line: RTX Video Super Resolution is a game changer\nThat\u2019s a lot of words to say: Nvidia\u2019s new RTX Video Super Resolution absolutely rocks.\nYou won\u2019t want to keep it constantly active if you watch videos while gaming, and I wish there was an easier way to flip it on and off via GeForce Experience or a hotkey, but those are minor gripes. Watching web videos with RTX Video Super Resolution active is like jumping from VHS tapes to Blu-ray discs. Once you try it, you won\u2019t want to go back to the way things were. If you watch a lot of videos in your browser, RTX Video Super Resolution is right up there with Nvidia Broadcast and DLSS as a killer GeForce feature, and a compelling reason to consider an Nvidia GPU over rivals.

It works within both the Chrome and Edge browsers and takes any online video\u2014including Twitch, YouTube, Netflix, you name it\u2014and applies Nvidia's own brand of upscaling in real-time to remove low-resolution artefacts and improve clarity.And if you're wondering how well it does this, I've had a chance to give the tool a test ahead of its release today to find out exactly that.The tool works by running a GPU-accelerated algorithm on any video playing within supported browsers. Right now, that's either Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nI'll say it: The best thing I saw from Nvidia at CES wasn't its sweet new GPUs, but some tasty AI every RTX gamer can enjoy\n\n\n\n\nI've been testing Nvidia's new Neural Texture Compression toolkit and the impressive results could be good news for game install sizes\n\n\n\nYou can pick your poison from any video streaming site, though I'd suggest RTX VSR is best suited to content that's susceptible to block compression artefacts, namely Twitch or YouTube streams. It will work on other video formats, but it's certainly more noticeable when it's up against a low-resolution stream.The idea is, with the tool running in the background, your video will be enhanced to offer better clarity, with fewer artefacts or obvious compression issues, and generally be a much more pleasant watching experience than normal.And that it does deliver that, though I should note that you can't expect miracles from RTX VSR.As I mentioned, there's some content better suited to RTX VSR, and I found the most notable use of the tool was for watching Twitch streams. I loaded up a stream from streamer and unknowing guinea pig Stodeh, as I wanted to catch someone playing Sons of the Forest, and then matched an exact copy of that window within Firefox (an unsupported browser) on a second 4K monitor. That way I can keep a watchful eye on both and see live where the algorithm's doing its work.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Both streams were locked at 480p (VSR works on source video from 360p up to 1440p), which is very noticeably low quality for watching full screen on a 4K monitor.Here's a pretty basic diagram provided by Nvidia on how RTX VSR works. (Image credit: Nvidia)There are four stages of VSR upscaling, 1 being the lightest touch and 4 being the most intensive. I've opted for 4 for all my testing to see what this algorithm can really do.What I found was that the stream with VSR enabled suffered less from the very obvious compression artefacts present on the non-VSR stream. Especially when Stodeh moved the camera around swiftly, the image quality drastically dropped on the non-VSR stream. Whereas it would drop on the VSR stream but the artefacts were no longer as noticeable, or in some cases entirely gone.One of the most noticeable improvements was the webcam portion of the stream. Accounting for only a tiny number of pixels in a 480p image, the webcam on the non-VSR stream was tough to discern, whereas it was clearer in the VSR-enhanced stream.Other gameplay was also sharper and easier on the eyes. Contrasting objects appear a little clearer with VSR enabled, and you can just about make out more during patches of fast motion, such as running through a forest from half-naked cannibals. The game's UI was also marginally easier to read, though this effect is more noticeable in still screenshots than the actual live feed.What VSR doesn't appear to do is necessarily upscale the image how you might expect it to. It appears to me more like a blemish-reducing filter for low quality video, taking the worst patches of visual artefacting and smoothing them out for clarity. It doesn't look to be adding data so much as making what's there a bit more easy on the eyes. I didn't feel like I was necessarily watching a 4K video, or even a 1080p video, with VSR enabled on a lower-resolution stream, but more a 480p stream with a higher bitrate.There's only so much you can expect RTX VSR to do. Nvidia's game upscaling technology, DLSS (which is \"completely different,\" by the way), runs at much higher native resolutions to imitate a 4K picture than what I'm trying to ask VSR to do here. Though even at 1080p I don't notice a huge step up versus native 1080p content, either.\n\n\nI've also compared a couple of clips from the PC Gaming Show 2022 on Twitch, both at 480p. In one, you can see Chivalry 2 developer Torn Banner Studio's president, Steve Piggott, talking about a game in a small window in the bottom of the screen, and there are definite improvements to the clarity of the image. In the other, Day9 is introducing a section of the show, and this is where the VSR treatment is a little too heavy-handed. You can see Day9's face gets somewhat smoothed over with VSR enabled and some visual data is lost. Sorry Day9, nothing personal.\n\n\nAdmittedly, these gifs are a compressed version of a video file recorded from OBS of a Twitch stream. Hardly the best way to view the differences. You're better off giving this feature a go for yourself if you can to get the full picture. Full details on how to enable RTX VSR below.I didn't notice any major improvement when comparing 1080p YouTube videos, either. I put on a couple of old Funhaus streams I tend to go back to every now and then (the Nintendo Labo stream, FYI) and the difference between the VSR on and VSR off windows was barely noticeable. There was some smoothing going on with the VSR on video that otherwise wasn't there in the original, non-VSR clip, but that's about all I could pick out.I also tried a clip from a recent Company of Heroes 3 video we put up over on the PC Gamer YouTube channel, and it's almost impossible to pick out any improvements here. VSR just doesn't seem that beneficial on higher-resolution YouTube videos.\n\n\nThe demo clip Nvidia provides shows a much clearer improvement with VSR enabled, though it's a more detailed scene where the increase in contrast I noticed on previous streams does show up more clearly. A slightly fuzzy 1080p YouTube video sort of still looks like a slightly fuzzy 1080p YouTube video, but your mileage may vary depending on the content you're watching.The same goes for other more polished video streaming platforms that I tried, including Netflix. This isn't a good way to save money on a cheaper Netflix subscription and still watch in 4K\u2014even with VSR enabled it still looks like a standard 1080p video. I'd say the differences in a VSR on and a VSR off Netflix stream were mostly negligible in my experience with a new episode of Formula One: Drive to Survive.But for a free tool, I would recommend you turn RTX VSR on day-to-day. If not as a mind-blowing tool, but as something that will, on certain occasions, offer a better overall picture quality. I'm impressed with just how easy it is to enable and you don't have to do anything else to actually use it. It's one of those features you can very much set and forget, with basically zero further input required on the user's part.Though I wouldn't blanket recommend it. If you are someone that regularly games with a stream playing on a second or third monitor, you'll want to be sure you can spare the performance. That's because RTX VSR is not an entirely free tool from a performance perspective.Since the tool uses Tensor Cores to carry out its algorithmic improvements, enabling the tool will add load on your GPU. I saw a 10% increase in GPU utilisation on an RTX 3080 10GB with the highest quality tier enabled. I assume that would be lower on a newer, more performant RTX 40-series card, and in that case perhaps you can spare the performance a little more anyways.That's the other thing, Nvidia has limited it to just RTX 30-series and RTX 40-series graphics cards at this time, so there's no point wondering if older cards would be hurting more for performance. I was wondering why Nvidia hasn't brought this to RTX 20-series cards just yet, but Nvidia's customer help page on the tech suggests support will come eventually, we just don't know when. Something to do with re-factoring the algorithms. Standard AI speak.How to enable RTX VSR(Image credit: Nvidia)If you want to try out RTX VSR for yourself, you'll need the following:\u00a0An Nvidia RTX 40-series or RTX 30-series graphics cardGoogle Chrome (minimum version 110.0.5481.105) or Microsoft Edge (minimum version 110.0.1587.56)Nvidia Game Ready driver version 531.14 (or later)With these things ready to go, enabling RTX VSR is simple. You don't even need GeForce Experience installed for this one.\u00a0To enable RTX VSR, head to the Nvidia Control Panel (right click on the desktop) and navigate to the Adjust video image settings menu.In the Adjust video image settings menu, look for RTX video enhancement. Hit the checkbox next to Super resolution and select your quality. 1 is the lowest, 4 is the highest. The performance hit you can expect increases with each notch up, so just be wary of that if you're looking for more performance.Hit Apply at the bottom of the screen and you're ready to go.Only videos played within those supported Chrome or Edge browsers will be given the VSR treatment, and while there are options to tweak these settings on a per-monitor basis, I never got that to work. It's either on or off for both in my experience.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nTwitch\nYouTube\n\n\nJacob RidleySocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, HardwareJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

LSTM is a key model approach used to discover financial time-series data like asset prices.\nThe benchmark includes three LSTM models of increasing complexity. NVIDIA A100 GPUs, running in a Supermicro Ultra SuperServer, demonstrated low latencies in the 99th percentile.\nAccelerated Computing for STAC-ML and STAC-A2, STAC-A3 Benchmarks\nConsidering the A100 performance on STAC-ML for inference \u2014 in addition to its record-setting performance in the STAC-A2 benchmark for option price discovery and the STAC-A3 benchmark for model backtesting \u2014 provides a glimpse at how NVIDIA AI computing can accelerate a pipeline of modern trading environments.\nIt also shows A100 GPUs deliver leading performance and workload versatility for financial institutions.\nPredictable Performance for Consistent Low Latency\nPredictable performance is crucial for low-latency environments in finance, as extreme outliers can cause substantial losses during fast market moves.\u00a0\nNotably, there were no large outliers in NVIDIA\u2019s latency, as the maximum latency was no more than 2.3x the median latency across all LSTMs and the number of model instances, ranging up to 32 concurrent instances.1\nNVIDIA is the first to submit performance results for what\u2019s known as the Tacana Suite of the benchmark. Tacana is for inference performed on a sliding window, where a new timestep is added and the oldest removed for each inference operation. This is helpful for high-frequency trading, where inference needs to be performed on every market data update.\nA second suite, Sumaco, performs inference on an entirely new set of data, which reflects the use case where an event prompts inference based on recent history.\nLeading Throughput in Benchmark Results\nNVIDIA also submitted a throughput-optimized configuration on the same hardware for the Sumaco Suite in FP16 precision.2\nOn the least complex LSTM in the benchmark, A100 GPUs on Supermicro servers helped serve up more than 1.7 million inferences per second.3\nFor the most complex LSTM, these systems handled as many as 12,800 inferences per second.4\nNVIDIA A100: Performance and Versatility\u00a0\nNVIDIA GPUs offer multiple advantages that lower the total cost of ownership for electronic trading stacks.\nFor one, NVIDIA AI provides a single platform for training and inference. Whether developing, backtesting or deploying an AI model, NVIDIA AI delivers leading performance \u2014 and developers don\u2019t need to learn different programming languages and frameworks for research and trading.\nMoreover, the NVIDIA CUDA programming model enables development, optimization and deployment of applications across GPU-accelerated embedded systems, desktop workstations, enterprise data centers, cloud-based platforms and HPC supercomputers.\nEfficiencies for Reduced Operating Expenses\nThe financial services industry stands to benefit from not only data throughput advances but also improved operational efficiencies.\nReduced energy and square footage usage for systems in data centers can make a big difference in operating expenses. That\u2019s especially pressing as IT organizations make the case for budgetary outlays to cover new high-performance systems.\nOn the most demanding LSTM model, NVIDIA A100 exceeded 17,700 inferences per second per kilowatt while consuming 722 watts, offering leading energy efficiency.5\nThe benchmark results confirm that NVIDIA GPUs are unrivaled in terms of throughput and energy efficiency for workloads like backtesting and simulation.\nLearn about NVIDIA delivering smarter, more secure financial services.\n[1] SUT ID NVDA221118b, max of STAC-ML.Markets.Inf.T.LSTM_A.2.LAT.v1\n[2] SUT ID NVDA221118a\n[3] STAC-ML.Markets.Inf.S.LSTM_A.4.TPUT.v1\n[4] STAC-ML.Markets.Inf.S.LSTM_C.[1,2,4].TPUT.v1\n[5] SUT ID NVDA221118a, STAC-ML.Markets.Inf.S.LSTM_C.[1,2,4].ENERG_EFF.v1\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep Learning | HardwareTags: Financial Services | NVIDIA A100 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And early results were intriguing enough to send scientists back to their radio telescopes for a second look.\nThe study, published last week in Nature Astronomy, highlights the crucial role that AI techniques will play in the ongoing search for extraterrestrial intelligence.\nThe team behind the paper trained an AI to recognize signals that natural astrophysical processes couldn\u2019t produce. They then fed it a massive dataset of over 150 terabytes of data collected by the Green Bank Telescope, one of the world\u2019s largest radio telescopes, located in West Virginia.\nThe AI flagged more than 20,000 signals of interest, with eight showing the tell-tale characteristics of what scientists call \u201ctechnosignatures,\u201d such as a radio signal that could tip scientists off to the existence of another civilization.\nIn the face of a growing deluge of data from radio telescopes, it\u2019s critical to have a fast and effective means of sorting through it all.\nThat\u2019s where the AI system shines.\nThe system was created by Peter Ma, an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto and the lead author of the paper co-authored by a constellation of experts affiliated with the University of Toronto, UC Berkeley and Breakthrough Listen, an international effort launched in 2015 to search for signs of alien civilizations.\nMa, who taught himself how to code, first became interested in computer science in high school. He started working on a project where he aimed to use open-source data and tackle big data problems with unanswered questions, particularly in the area of machine learning.\n\u201cI wanted a big science problem with open source data and big, unanswered questions,\u201d Ma says. \u201cAnd finding aliens is big.\u201d\nResearchers used AI to analyze over 150 terabytes of data collected by the Green Bank Telescope (above), one of the world\u2019s largest radio telescopes, located in West Virginia.\nDespite initially facing some confusion and disbelief from his teachers, Ma continued to work on his project throughout high school and into his first year of college, where he reached out to others and found support from researchers at the University of Toronto, UC Berkeley and Breakthrough Listen to identify signals from extraterrestrial civilizations.\nThe paper describes a two-step AI method to classify signals as either radio interference or a potential technosignature.\nThe first step uses an autoencoder to identify salient features in the data. This system, built using the TensorFlow API, was accelerated by four NVIDIA TITAN X GPUs at UC Berkeley.\nThe second step feeds those features to a random forest classifier, which decides whether a signal is noteworthy or just interference.\nThe AI system is particularly adept at identifying narrowband signals with a non-zero drift rate. These signals are much more focused and specific than natural phenomena and suggest that they may be coming from a distant source.\nAdditionally, the signals only appear in observations of some regions of the sky, further evidence of a celestial origin.\nTo train the AI system, Ma inserted simulated signals into actual data, allowing the autoencoder to learn what to look for. Then the researchers fed the AI more than 150 terabytes of data from 480 observing hours at the Green Bank Telescope.\nThe AI identified 20,515 signals of interest, which the researchers had to inspect manually. Of those, eight had the characteristics of technosignatures and couldn\u2019t be attributed to radio interference.\nThe researchers then returned to the telescope to look at systems from which all eight signals originated but couldn\u2019t re-detect them.\n\u201cEight signals looked very suspicious, but after we took another look at the targets with our telescopes, we didn\u2019t see them again,\u201d Ma says. \u201cIt\u2019s been almost five to six years since we took the data, but we still haven\u2019t seen the signal again. Make of that what you will.\u201d\nAI is playing a growing role sifting through data from scientific instruments of all kind, such as the James Webb Space Telescope.\nTo be sure, because they don\u2019t have real signals from an extraterrestrial civilization, the researchers had to rely on simulated signals to train their models. The researchers note that this could lead to the AI system learning artifacts that aren\u2019t there.\nStill, Cherry Ng, one of the paper\u2019s co-authors, points out the team has a good idea of what to look for.\n\u201cA classic example of human-generated technology from space that we have detected is the Voyager,\u201d said Ng, who studies fast radio bursts and pulsars, and is currently affiliated with the French National Centre for Scientific Research, known as CNRS.\n\u201cPeter\u2019s machine learning algorithm is able to generate these signals that the aliens may or may not have sent,\u201d she said.\nAnd while aliens haven\u2019t been found \u2014 yet, the study shows the potential of AI in SETI research and the importance of analyzing vast quantities of data.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to extend this search capacity and algorithm to other kinds of telescope setups,\u201d Ma said, connecting the efforts to advancements made in a broad array of fields thanks to AI.\nThere will be plenty of opportunities to see what AI can do.\nDespite efforts dating back to the \u201860s, only a tiny fraction of stars in the Milky Way have been monitored, Ng says. However, with advances in technology, astronomers are now able to conduct more observations in parallel and maximize their scientific output.\nEven the data that has been collected, such as the Green Bank data, has yet to be fully searched, Ng explains.\nAnd with the next-generation radio telescopes, including MeerKAT, the Very Large Array (VLA), Square Kilometre Array, and the next-generation VLA (ngVLA) gathering vast amounts of data in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, implementing AI will become increasingly important to overcome the challenges posed by the sheer volume of data.\nSo will we find anything?\n\u201cI\u2019m skeptical about the idea that we are alone in the universe,\u201d Ma said, pointing to breakthroughs over the past decade showing our planet is not as unique as we once thought it was. \u201cWhether we will find anything is up to science and luck to verify, but I believe it is very naive to believe we are alone.\u201d\n\nThe AI Podcast \u00b7 Peter Ma on Using AI to Find Promising Signals for Alien Life \u2013 Ep. 191\nImage Credit: NASA, JPL-Caltech, Susan Stolovy (SSC/Caltech) et al.\n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

First previewed at CES 2023, and not to be confused with AMD's VSR (Virtual Super Resolution), Nvidia VSR aims to do for video what its DLSS technology does for games. Well, sort of. You'll need one of Nvidia's best graphics cards for starters, meaning an RTX 30- or 40-series GPU. Of course, you'll also want to set your expectations appropriately \u2014 the above lead image, for example, is faked and exaggerated and not at all representative of VSR.\n\nBy now, everyone should be getting quite familiar with some of what deep learning and AI models can accomplish. Whether it's text-to-image art generation with Stable Diffusion and the like, ChatGPT answering questions and writing articles, self-driving cars, or any number of other possibilities, AI is becoming part of our everyday lives.\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\nWatch On \nThe basic summary of the algorithm should sound familiar to anyone with knowledge of DLSS. Take a bunch of paired images, with each pair containing a low-resolution and lower bitrate version of a higher resolution (and higher quality) video frame, and run that through a deep learning training algorithm to teach the network how to ideally upscale and enhance lower quality input frames into better-looking outputs. There are plenty of differences between VSR and DLSS, of course.\n\nFor one, DLSS gets data directly from the game engine, including the current frame, motion vectors, and depth buffers. Combined with the previous frame(s) and the trained AI network to generate upscaled and anti-aliased frames. With VSR, there's no pre-computed depth buffer or motion vectors to speak of, so everything needs to be done based purely on the video frames. So while in theory VSR could use the current and previous frame data, it appears Nvidia has opted for a pure spatial upscaling approach. But whatever the exact details, let's talk about how it looks.(Image credit: Nvidia)Nvidia provided a sample video showing the before and after output from VSR. If you want the originals, here's the 1080p upscaled via bilinear sampling source and the 4K VSR upscaled version \u2014 hosted on a personal Drive account, so we'll see how that goes. (Send me an email if you can't download the videos due to exceeding the bandwidth cap.)\n\nWe're going to skirt potential copyright issues and not include a bunch of our own videos, though we did grab some screenshots of the resulting output from a couple of sports broadcasts to show how it works on other content. What we can say is that slow-moving videos (like Nvidia's samples) provide the best results, while faster-paced stuff like sports is more difficult, as the frame-to-frame changes can be quite significant. But in general, VSR works pretty well. Here's a gallery of some comparison screen captures (captured via Nvidia ShadowPlay).Image 1 of 10(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Nvidia Sample: Source 1080p with bilinear upscale(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Nvidia Sample: 1080p upscaled via VSR(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Soccer Sample: 720p bilinear upscaled source(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Soccer Sample: 720p to 4K VSR upscale(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Soccer Sample: 480p bilinear upscaled source(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Soccer Sample: 480p VSR upscaled to 4K(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Hockey Sample: 720p bilinear upscaled source(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Hockey Sample: 720p to 4K VSR upscale(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Hockey Sample: 720p bilinear upscaled source(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Hockey Sample: 720p to 4K VSR upscaleAll those images are 4K JPG, with maximum quality \u2014 not lossless, but we can't exceed 10MB, so some slight compression was required. You can still clearly see the differences between the normal upscaling (in Chrome) versus the VSR upscaling. It's not a massive improvement in any of the sports samples, but there's definitely some sharpening and deblocking that, at least in our subjective view, looks better.\n\nVSR can't work miracles. Starting with a 720p source and upscaling to 4K (9x upscale) will be more difficult than going from 1080p to 4K (4x upscaling). And the 480p to 4K upscale (20.25x upscale!) is still missing a ton of detail, like you can't see the strands of the net in either the VSR or non-VSR content. Even the Tottenham Hotspurs logo in the top-right looks much better on the 720p upscaled sample than on the 480p upscaling (sorry about that overlay on the one image).\n\nThe good news: If you have an RTX 30- or 40-series graphics card, you can download the latest Nvidia drivers and give VSR a shot. You'll also need the latest Chrome or Edge browser, at least for now. But with the appropriate software, VSR seems to work on every video we have tried so far.\n\nThe bad news: RTX 20-series users are left out in the cold, for now at least. We asked about this requirement and don't have a precise answer as to the omission yet. It's possible that Nvidia trained the network for its Tensor cores with sparsity, which means it can currently only run on Ampere and later architectures. But it seems like it could have easily opted for Turing compatibility from the start, had it wanted to, because the actual computational workload appears relatively small.\n\nTo show this, we tested VSR on the same video sequence \u2014 the 720p NHL game upscaled to 4K \u2014 on two different extremes of the VSR spectrum, with both the VSR Quality 1 and VSR Quality 4 settings. At the top, we have the RTX 4090 Founders Edition, while at the bottom, we have the EVGA RTX 3050. The 4090 has theoretical compute of 661 teraflops FP16, with sparsity. The RTX 3050 tips the scales at just 73 teraflops, again with sparsity. In practice, both cards looked the same. More importantly, we captured power data for just the graphics cards, which proves telling.Swipe to scroll horizontallyNvidia GPU Power Use With / Without VSRGPUVSR OffVSR On (1)VSR On (4)RTX 4090 (Watts)28.932.836.9RTX 3050 (Watts)13.015.915.9Clearly, neither of the GPUs are being pushed even remotely hard by the VSR algorithm. The 4090 uses 4W more power with the VSR quality at 1, and 8W more power with VSR 4. In contrast, the RTX 3050 needed just 3W more power for either VSR setting. That means the Tensor cores aren't even close to maxed out, on either GPU, which also means that even if you have a lowly mobile RTX 3050 with 4GB VRAM, you can still run VSR.\n\nOverall, it's an interesting take on video enhancement. There are lots of other algorithms that don't use machine learning that have been attempted for upscaling and enhancement as well, and some might be able to match VSR, but they're not supported just by downloading the latest Nvidia drivers and Chrome browser updates.(Image credit: Nvidia)As far as what you need to do to turn on VSR, it's a toggle in the latest drivers (we received early access to Nvidia's 531.14 drivers for purposes of this review). First, tick the \"Super resolution\" box under RTX video enhancement, then select a desired quality. Nvidia says higher quality settings may put more of a load on your GPU, so perhaps if you're watching a video stream on a second monitor while playing a game, you'll want to stick with a lower setting. If you're only watching a video, though, you may as well go whole hog and set the quality to 4.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNVIDIA RTX\nScience\nrtx\nChatGPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (32)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

Simply not worth it.As noted in the text, it's an exaggerated picture to illustrate the idea \u2014 no one uses nearest neighbor interpolation unless it's for effect these days. Also, it's 360p.\n\nThere's plenty of 720p stuff still out there, sports streams for example are regularly 1080p or lower. Also, lower bitrate can cause blocking, which the AI algorithm is also trained to at least mostly remove.\n\nAnd battery life? I guess if you're only watching videos on unplugged laptops, yes, it might drop a bit. Based on the 3050 results and a 50Wh battery, you might go from four hours of video playback to 3.3 hours if you turn on VSR and watch 720p upscaled to 4K. Except then you're on a laptop with a 1080p display most likely, which changes the upscaling requirements \u2014 there's no point in upscaling 1080p to 1080p, though perhaps the deblocking and enhancement stuff would still be useful.\n\nIs it a panacea? No. But is it potentially useful if you already have an RTX GPU? Sure.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 2080\n\n\nPlaneInTheSky said:Cool 240p image.\n\nThis might have been interesting in the 90s when people were watching 360p cat videos.\n\nBut video content is now 1080p+ and 4k. Video upscaling tech isn't relevant anymore.\n\nAnd this tech also comes at a cost, it drains battery life. Simply not worth it.\nNot all online video is 1080p or up. Many videos only go up to 1080p; upscaling to 4K would be useful. \n\nAdditionally, if you have a bad internet connection but ample GPU power and no battery life issues (think trying to watch something in a public place using slow public wifi, but you're plugged in or have plenty of battery life) being able to upscale a lower bitrate stream into a higher one almost for free would be worthwhile to most people. \n\nThere are also plenty of use cases out there with people wanting to watch older content that is only available at 480p. \n\nIf you really have no use case where you find any of this at all beneficial, then just don't use it. Nobody is forcing you. There are a lot of people out there though who have use cases in which this will be helpful.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngarrett040\n\n\nWill this become a feature I can simply use for video files on my computer? why the browser requirement?

How much grunt does it take away from the GPU?\n\nRegards.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputePronto\n\n\nWhile this is not the best AI upscaling I have seen, it is pretty good when considering that it is done with only an extra 4-8 W in real time. The browser requirement is pretty limiting, though...\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 32 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew undersea cable tech listens for sabotage \u2014 can be retrofitted to existing fiber optic lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm debuts new Snapdragon G handheld gaming PC chips to compete with Intel and AMD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina to spend $55 billion on R&D in 2025 \u2014 Semiconductor, AI and quantum computing fields to benefit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBambu Lab Announces New Printer: H2D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotherboard dies after marathon 100-hour BIOS update process, vigil attended by thousands online\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD boasts its Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is up to 12.2x faster than Lunar Lake in AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreeware image editor GIMP 3.0 arrives after seven years of incubation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle's Gemini 2.0 Flash is reportedly capable of removing watermarks \u2014 Also found to generate AI celebrity photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi and ChatGPT bring AI conversations to your retro rotary phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI Afterburner update enables RTX 50 series owners to push their GDDR7 VRAM up to 36 GT/s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

The collaboration is aimed at boosting the delivery of groundbreaking AI capabilities across NEOM and Saudi Arabia.\nThe collaboration is designed to accelerate AI-powered innovation for a broad range of use cases by enterprises and government organizations. TONOMUS will provide customers with direct access to NVIDIA\u2019s advanced AI, digital twin solutions that take advantage of the planned Oracle Cloud Region to be located at NEOM, hosted by ZeroPoint DC hyperscale data center and via TONOMUS\u2019 digital cloud platform.\nJoseph Bradley, CEO of TONOMUS,\u00a0said:\u00a0\u201cThe longstanding alliance between Oracle and NVIDIA complements TONOMUS\u2019 ongoing mission to build the infrastructure and ubiquitous connectivity required to enable the world\u2019s first ecosystem of cognitive technologies. This monumental collaboration will empower NEOM with geographical advantage and place Saudi Arabia firmly on the map as a regional hub for the provision of AI capabilities, as well as further support Saudi Vision 2030 and the Kingdom\u2019s rapidly developing cloud market.\u201d\n\nRichard Smith, Executive Vice President, Cloud & Technology, EMEA of Oracle,\u00a0said: \u201cThe futuristic city of NEOM is the ideal ground for deploying the latest AI-powered applications and customer experiences, which will help usher in a new era of smart cities.\u00a0 TONOMOUS will benefit from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\u2019s (OCI) unmatched capability of supporting modern cloud native applications in a secure environment. This, coupled with our existing partnership with NVIDIA, will speed AI adoption for enterprises.\u201d\nJaap Zuiderveld, Vice President of EMEA at NVIDIA,\u00a0said: \u201cAI and accelerated computing in the cloud enable cities around the world to improve sustainability and livability, enhance the safety and efficiency of urban mobility, and deliver more inclusive citizen experiences. NVIDIA software and systems on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provide an ideal platform for developers like TONOMUS to build AI-forward, modern cities.\u201d\nUsers of TONOMUS\u2019 seamless, cloud management platform, which combines cloud sales and management with a user-friendly digital interface, will draw a range of valuable benefits from the company\u2019s collaboration with Oracle and NVIDIA. In addition to curating access to the world\u2019s top cloud service providers, the platform allows users to search for and compare a wide range of options, capabilities and costs in real time, and then purchase and manage solutions.\nIt also facilitates cost monitoring, resource optimization and visibility, centralizes customer management of multiple cloud assets and costs, and is an asset to finance and accounting departments in accessing information on historic and projected costs based on consumption.\nOCI\u2019s comprehensive set of public cloud services and NVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing stack \u2013 from GPUs and networking to software \u2013 combined with OCI\u2019s AI cloud infrastructure of bare metal and RDMA cluster networking and storage, will provide NEOM-based enterprises with a broad, easily accessible portfolio of options for AI training and deep learning inference at scale. The availability of the globally adopted NVIDIA AI platform will grant businesses that make NEOM their home the benefits of essential processing engines for each step of the AI workflow, from data processing and AI model training to simulation and large-scale deployment.\nThe venture will be propelled by technology such as the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU and the upcoming, NVIDIA H100 \u2013\u00a0the most advanced accelerator ever produced and an order-of-magnitude leap for accelerated computing. Its combined innovations can speed up large language models by an incredible 30 times over the previous generation to deliver industry-leading conversational AI.\nEarly adopters of the technology will also be able to enjoy various opportunities, allowing large corporations across a range of industries \u2013\u00a0from healthcare and manufacturing to telecommunications and financial services \u2013 to reduce their IT infrastructure costs, automate operations and obtain insights faster than ever before.\nThe strategic partnership between TONOMUS and Oracle has been steadily expanding since the company was named as the first tenant at ZeroPoint DC in October 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Back\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share Article\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      About\n    \n\n\n\n    About\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    What is NEOM\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n    NEOM Leadership Team\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n    NEOM Social Responsibilty\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n    NEOM Bay Airport\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Invest\n    \n\n\n\n    Invest\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Invest in NEOM\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n    NEOM Investment Fund\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Regions\n    \n\n\n\n    Regions\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Magna\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n    Sindalah\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n    Oxagon\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n    THE LINE\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n    Trojena\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Our Business\n    \n\n\n\n    Our Business\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sectors\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n    Partners\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n    Suppliers\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n    NEOM Hotel Division\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n    Port of NEOM\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      News & Social\n    \n\n\n\n    News & Social\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    News and Media\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n    Media Gallery\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n    All News\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n    Media & Resources\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n    Press Enquiries\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Careers\n    \n\n\n\n    Careers\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Working at NEOM\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      FOLLOW NEOM ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCookie Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrypto Disclaimer\n\n\n\n\n          \u00a9 2025 NEOM\n      \n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Clear All\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n    Download All\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Whether for entertainment or education, streamers invest time and money to give their followers the best experience by buying higher quality microphones, cameras, and lighting.\u00a0\nWhile streamers can control the equipment in their home studio, one thing they have little control over is the quality of their video streams. Sometimes you are limited by your internet bandwidth; sometimes the platform doesn\u2019t allow you to upload at higher bitrate; and viewers may not always have access to the fastest internet where they are. This can lead to lower quality streams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAV1 increases bandwidth and video quality by up to 40%.\nWhile NVIDIA cannot improve upload and download internet speeds, we can make the most of the bandwidth available. The next generation, AV1 video codec delivers 40% improved encoding efficiency.\u00a0 Simply put, streams broadcast using AV1 drastically improve the quality of streamed video. And now, Discord is the first major platform to deliver the benefit of AV1 to the people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscord, AV1 & RTX 40 Series GPUs \u2014 Better Together\nMost livestreaming platforms support up to 8 Mbps streams - and that\u2019s if you have an internet connection fast enough to stream that much. With the codecs available today \u2014 mostly H.264 \u2014 that meant that people could only livestream 1080p at 60FPS at best, and even that was risky if you played a game that had too much movement. With the encoding efficiency of AV1, streamers will be able to stream flawless 1080p quality, and even increase their resolution to 1440p and even 4K 60FPS content.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyone on a PC will be able to watch AV1 streams on Discord supported by GeForce RTX 30 and 40 series GPUs.\nStreamers equipped with GeForce RTX 40 series GPUs can immediately take advantage of this new feature by simply updating their Discord client to the latest version and enabling \u201cAV1 video codec\u201d in the \u201cVoice and Video\u201d Discord settings tab. Virtually anyone using Discord on a PC will be able to watch AV1 streams, either supported by hardware decode on GPUs and CPUs from 2020 and beyond, namely GeForce RTX 30 and 40 series GPUs, or a software decoder compatible with most modern CPUs. Streamers don\u2019t even need to worry about compatibility.\u00a0 If a viewer is watching from a device that doesn\u2019t support AV1 \u2014 such as a phone \u2014 Discord will automatically transcode the stream to the next highest quality supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAV1 for Everyone\nAV1 is going to transform the industry, allowing livestreamers to create better content, and leveling the playing field for those interested in taking on livestreaming even though they may not have access to the best high speed internet. And it will drastically reduce the bandwidth used for video content - which is the majority of online content, which has secondary implications like reducing energy consumption or costs for companies.\nNVIDIA has been pushing AV1 for years, first through the inception of the codec with AOM, later by enabling the first AV1 hardware decoders for PC, and now by partnering with Discord to enable the first support for AV1 service.\nWith the democratization of AV1, streamers now have a powerful tool to bring higher fidelity content to their loyal fans.\u00a0 This is an amazing leap forward in quality for influencers and followers all around the world, and will only get better as AV1 continues to thrive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

VinBrain is also building a host of other AI applications, including a telehealth product that analyzes lab test results, medical reports and other electronic health records.\nThe company is part of NVIDIA Inception, a global program designed to offer cutting-edge startups expertise, technology and go-to-market support. The VinBrain team has also collaborated with Microsoft and with academic researchers at Stanford University, Harvard University, the University of Toronto and the University of California, San Diego to develop its core AI technology and submit research publications to top conferences.\nMany Models, Easy Deployment\nThe VinBrain team has developed more than 300 AI models that process speech, text, video and images \u2014 including X-ray, CT and MRI data.\n\u201cHealthcare is complex, so the pipeline requires hundreds of models for each step, such as preprocessing, segmentation, object detection and post-processing,\u201d Truong said. \u201cWe aim to package these models together so everything runs on GPU servers at the hospital \u2014 like a refrigerator or household appliance.\u201d\nVinBrain recently launched DrAid Appliance, an on-premises, NVIDIA GPU-powered device for automatic screening of medical imaging studies that could improve doctors\u2019 productivity by up to 80%, the team estimates.\nThe company also offers a hybrid solution, where images are preprocessed at the edge with DrAid Appliance, then sent to NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud for more demanding computational workloads.\nAnother way to access VinBrain\u2019s DrAid software is through Ferrum Health, an NVIDIA Inception company that has developed a secure platform to help healthcare organizations deploy AI applications across therapeutic areas.\nAccelerating AI Training and Inference \n\nVinBrain trains its AI models \u2014 which include medical imaging, intelligent video analytics, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing and text-to-speech \u2014 using NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD. Adopting DGX SuperPOD enabled Vinbrain to achieve near-linear-level speedups for model training, achieving 100x faster training compared with CPU-only training and significantly shortening the turnaround time for model development.\nThe team is using software from NVIDIA AI Enterprise, an end-to-end solution for production AI, which includes the NVIDIA Clara platform, the MONAI open-source framework for medical imaging development and the NVIDIA NeMo conversational AI toolkit for its transcription model.\n\u201cTo develop good AI models, you can\u2019t just train once and be done,\u201d said Truong. \u201cIt\u2019s an evolving process to refine the neural networks.\u201d\nVinBrain has set up an early validation pipeline for its AI projects: The company tests its early-stage models across a couple dozen hospitals in Vietnam to collect performance data, gather feedback and fine-tune its neural networks.\nIn addition to using NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD for AI training, the company has adopted NVIDIA GPUs to improve run-time efficiency and deployment. It uses the NVIDIA Triton inference server and NVIDIA TensorRT to streamline inference for more than hundreds of AI models on cloud-based NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs.\n\u201cWe shifted to NVIDIA GPUs for inference because of the higher throughput, faster response time and, most importantly, the cost ratio,\u201d Truong said.\nAfter switching from CPUs to NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs, the team was able to accelerate inference for medical imaging AI by more than 3x, and video streaming by more than 30x.\n\u201cIn the coming years, we want to become the top company solving the problem of multimodality in healthcare data,\u201d said Truong. \u201cUsing AI and edge computing, we aim to improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare, making intelligent insights accessible to patients and doctors across countries.\u201d\nRegister for NVIDIA GTC, taking place online March 20-23, to learn more about AI in healthcare.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | Inference | NVIDIA Clara | NVIDIA DGX | NVIDIA NeMo | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The NVIDIA A16 is NVIDIA\u2019s latest 4x GPU card for the data center. These types of cards are generally used for VDI deployments. Since many have never seen one, we figured we would show what one looks like.\nNVIDIA A16 with 4x Ampere 16GB GPUs Onboard\nThe NVIDIA A16 is a double-width card. From the front, it looks unremarkable as a flat surface to improve airflow.\nNVIDIA A16 4x 16GB GPU Front\nFor some sense of what is under the large heatsink at this point, here is the diagram of how the four GPUs are placed.\nNVIDIA A16 Four GPU Diagram\nHere is the back of the card. We like that NVIDIA has a backing here since it helps keep cards safe.\nNVIDIA A16 4x 16GB GPU Back\nHere is the PCIe connector side. Notice the notch for the GPU retention in a PCIe x16 slot.\nNVIDIA A16 4x 16GB GPU Bottom PCIe Connector\nThe card itself is mostly heatsink and cooling in the double-width form factor. The PCB with the GPUs is only a small portion of the card. One will notice, there are no display outputs on this which is standard in this NVIDIA series.\nNVIDIA A16 4x 16GB GPU IO Plate Side\nHere is the rear of the unit. We can see the data center 8-pin power connector and also mounting holes for GPU supports.\nNVIDIA A16 4x 16GB GPU Rear With Power Input\nThis has come a long way since the NVIDIA GRID M40 that we looked at almost seven years ago when we procured some cards from HPE machines that Facebook decommissioned.\nNVIDIA GRID M40 front and back GPUs highlighted\nThe general layout has remained constant for almost a decade at this point.\nNVIDIA A16 Key Specs\nWith that, it is time to look at the key specs for the card:\n\n\n\n\nGPU Architecture\n\n\nNVIDIA Ampere architecture\n\n\n\n\nGPU memory\n\n\n4x 16GB GDDR6\n\n\n\n\nMemory bandwidth\n\n\n4x 200GB/s\n\n\n\n\nError-correcting code (ECC)\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Ampere architecture- based CUDA Cores\n\n\n4x 1280\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA third-generation Tensor Cores\n\n\n4x 40\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA second-generation RT Cores\n\n\n4x 10\n\n\n\n\nFP32 | TF32 | TF321\u00a0(TFLOPS)\n\n\n4x 4.5 | 4x 9 | 4x 18\n\n\n\n\nFP16 | FP161\u00a0(TFLOPS)\n\n\n4x 17.9 | 4x 35.9\n\n\n\n\nINT8 | INT81\u00a0(TOPS)\n\n\n4x 35.9 | 4x 71.8\n\n\n\n\nSystem interface\n\n\nPCIe Gen4 (x16)\n\n\n\n\nMax power consumption\n\n\n250W\n\n\n\n\nThermal solution\n\n\nPassive\n\n\n\n\nForm factor\n\n\nFull height, full length (FHFL) Dual Slot\n\n\n\n\nPower connector\n\n\n8-pin CPU\n\n\n\n\nEncode/decode engines\n\n\n4 NVENC/8 NVDEC (includes AV1 decode)\n\n\n\n\nSecure and measured boot with hardware root of trust for GPU\n\n\nYes (optional)\n\n\n\n\nvGPU software support\n\n\nNVIDIA Virtual PC (vPC), NVIDIA\nVirtual Applications (vApps), NVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstation (vWS), NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Virtual Compute Server (vCS)\n\n\n\n\nGraphics APIs\n\n\nDirectX 12.072, Shader Model 5.172,\nOpenGL 4.683,\u00a0Vulkan 1.183\n\n\n\n\nCompute APIs\n\n\nCUDA, DirectCompute, OpenCL\u2122, OpenACC\u00ae\n\n\n\n\nMIG support\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nIn the spec chart, there are many \u201c4x\u201d and in the case of NVDEC an \u201c8x\u201d. That is because this card is a single physical PCIe device, but it has four Ampere generation GPUs. That makes the card difficult to explain to some folks. One way one could explain it is that it is a 64GB PCIe card, but each GPU only has access to 16GB of memory.\nAnother spec that is notable is the lack of MIG support. MIG is the technology that allows one to split a single NVIDIA A100, for example, into up to seven GPU partitions. We have shown this in a few reviews at this point. This card is almost like the anti-MIG since it has multiple physical GPUs.\nNVIDIA A16 Running\nTaking a look at this in the recent 16x NVIDIA GPU 128 Core Arm Server Supermicro ARS-210M-NR article, we can see the GPUs. This system has a single CPU, but it has four of the NVIDIA A16\u2019s installed. The A16\u2019s show as individual PCIe devices that are grouped here. Each with 10 compute units and 14GB in the topology report (there is 16GB for each card though.)\nSupermicro ARS 210M NR With 16x NVIDIA A16 GPUs And 128 Arm Cores Lstopo\nHere is the nvidia-smi output. With only four PCIe double-width cards installed, we now get 16x Ampere generation GPUs and a total of 256GB of video memory.\nSupermicro ARS 210M NR With 16x NVIDIA A16 GPUs And 128 Arm Cores\nPerformance-wise, the four GPUs are relatively close to the NVIDIA A2 GPU. The memory subsystem with 128-bit wide 16GB 200GB/s GDDR6 and 6.25GHz and the four GA107-890 Ampere GPUs. While the A2 is designed to run at a lower TDP, it still occupies a PCIe slot. The NVIDIA A16 is designed to put more accelerators onto a single card to improve density.\nFinal Words\nThe NVIDIA A16 is, in many ways, the opposite of what NVIDIA has been pushing for years. It has four physical GPUs rather than relying on MIG to parse out larger silicon. Still for VDI deployments and also for those applications that need higher density NVENC/ NVDEC options, this is a very unique part.\nNVIDIA A16 4x 16GB GPU Name 2\nOverall the NVIDIA A16 is an interesting card. It reminds us of the \u201cold days\u201d at STH working with these cards when they were still very novel solutions. Now with the NVIDIA A16, this is a product line that has lasted for almost a decade.\n8x NVIDIA GRID M40 Installed\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n TAGSAmpereNVIDIA \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleSupermicro X12SDV-4C-SP6F Review 25GbE and Intel Xeon D-1718TNext articleMemory Bandwidth Per Core and Per Socket for Intel Xeon and AMD EPYC John Leehttps://www.servethehome.comJohn Lee has been a programmer for decades and a STH reader since 2011.

Finally, there\u2019s a high-end, DLSS 3-capable, Ada Lovelace architecture-based graphics card that doesn\u2019t cost four figures.\n\nBefore anyone starts weeping with joy, however, a reality check. This is still yet another costly graphics card, with most board partner models (there\u2019s no Nvidia Founders Edition for the RTX 4070 Ti) landing somewhere between the Radeon RX 7900 XT and the Radeon RX 7900 XTX on price. The version I\u2019ve tested, MSI\u2019s GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Suprim X 12G, will set you back \u00a3950 / $998, more than a one-third increase on the launch price of the RTX 3070 Ti back in 2021. And that\u2019s with a relatively unenthusing 12GB of 192-bit VRAM, one of the specs that coiled eyebrows when this was revealed as an RTX 4080 variant.\n\n\n\nTop 12 Best Horror Games to Play on PC\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\nMSI GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Suprim X 12G specs:\n\nCUDA Cores: 7680\nBase Clock Speed: 2310MHz\nBoost Clock Speed: 2775MHz\nVRAM: 12GB GDDR6X\nPower: 285W\nRecommended System Power: 750W\nPrice: \u00a3950 / $998 (other RTX 4070 Ti models start at \u00a3840 / $830) \n\nDespite that, it does make a listenable case for itself as the RTX 40 series card to buy, at least until the likes of the RTX 4060 stop being so darned hypothetical. If the RTX 4070 Ti has a memory shortage, it didn\u2019t show in any of our benchmarks, where it proved itself a decent 4K alternative to the RTX 4080 and an arguably superior option for futureproofed 1440p. It\u2019s better for ray tracing than the RX 7900 XT as well, while being the current most \"affordable\" graphics card with DLSS 3 support. If you could mentally picture me doing air quotes there I\u2019d appreciate it. \nAlso, as bulky as it looks, this MSI model is more practical than the RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 partner cards I\u2019ve previously tested. For one, it actually fits in the RPS test rig\u2019s new NZXT H5 Flow case without needing to hang the CPU cooler\u2019s fans and radiator out the side, ready to comedically slice my toes off. It\u2019s a heavyweight triple-slotter, make no mistake, but its 285W power consumption isn\u2019t too thirsty and the three cooling fans kept it at a comfortable 63-67\u00b0c under sustained load. I like the looks, too: all sharped edged and angular.\nRTX 4070 Ti review: 4K performance\nEnough cooing at shapes, let\u2019s see how this card runs. Although Nvidia (re)announced the RTX 4070 Ti as a deadly 1440p weapon, I\u2019ve found it can settle in nicely at 4K, to the point of outperforming past GeForce juggernauts like the RTX 3090 and sometimes even the RTX 3090 Ti. GPUs that, in defence of the RTX 4070 Ti\u2019s high cost, were even pricier at launch. Averaged across six of our benchmark games, the RTX 4070 Ti also works out at about 40% faster than the RTX 3070 Ti at 4K, so the gen-on-gen price jump is at least matched by a slightly above-proportional performance gain.\nAll that said, against the rest of the RTX 40 series and AMD\u2019s latest Radeons, the RTX 4070 Ti does spend most of its time bringing up the rear:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nThen again, it\u2019s very often just a few frames behind the RX 7900 XT,  with its 20GB of VRAM, and sometimes \u2013 namely in Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Forza Horizon 5 \u2013 comes out ahead. Speaking of Forza, the RTX 4070 Ti somehow finished even faster than the RTX 4080, albeit only by a margin-of-error difference. \nThe RPS test PC:\n\nCPU: Intel Core i5-11600K\nRAM: 16GB Corsair Vengeance LPX\nMotherboard: Asus TUF Gaming Z590-Plus WiFi\nPSU: NZXT C1000 Gold\n\nI also don\u2019t think it\u2019s too worrying that this is the only GPU of the five to make the occasional dip below a 60fps average, as it did in the Total War: Three Kingdoms and F1 22 benchmarks. Higher-scoring cards are more futureproofed, true, but Three Kingdoms is only a measly 4fps short of that gold standard, and in F1 22 you can just flick on DLSS upscaling for a free framerate boost. Most games will, evidently, run well above 60fps at 4K on this card, and diminishing returns means FPS differences above this point get harder to perceive. Combined with the fact that all these competing GPUs are either around the same price or much more expensive, the RTX 4070 Ti actually comes out looking like a fair choice for good-quality 4K. At the very least, it doesn\u2019t disappoint.\nThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s the best value, as the RX 7900 XT is generally faster on purely rasterised performance. The RTX 4070 Ti counters this with a greater affinity for ray tracing, as AMD\u2019s RDNA 3 architecture just isn\u2019t as prepared to tank this feature\u2019s performance impact as well as Nvidia\u2019s Ada Lovelace design. Case in point, Metro Exodus. On the RTX 4070 Ti, this averaged 74fps on standard settings, and 49fps with Ultra-quality ray tracing enabled. That\u2019s a drop of 33%. The RX 7900 XT had a higher starting point of 82fps, but ended up performing worse with ray tracing switched on, scoring 38fps \u2013 a 54% drop.\n\n\n \n\nWatch Dogs Legion also demonstrates this difference, with the RTX 4070 Ti losing 46% of its frames with ray tracing (65fps to 35fps). That looks bad but the RX 7900 XT downright collapsed, losing 60% by dropping from 76fps to 30fps.\nAs I said in our RTX 4080 review, I\u2019m not sure that ray tracing is available in enough games for RT power to make or break a graphics card. But it is notable that, depending on whether you plump for these settings, the RTX 4070 Ti can end up significantly faster than the RX 7900 XT after all. And since we\u2019re looking at feature support, it could be weeks or months before AMD has an answer to the sheer FPS-multiplying strength of DLSS 3.\nIt will in time, with FSR 3.0, though for now the frame generation witchcraft of DLSS 3 is unique to the RTX 40 series. Check out the graph below for how this can take a maxed-out Cyberpunk 2077 from painfully slow to double or even triple the framerate:\n\n\n \n\nNow, the RTX 4070 Ti doesn\u2019t benefit as emphatically as its big brothers do. 59fps with upscaling on Quality will look good, but one of the catches to these free, AI-generated frames is that you don\u2019t 'feel' them; unlike a rise in traditionally rendered frames, you generated frames are purely visual and don't contribute to a greater sense of control responsiveness. 59fps will therefore have the tactile quality of 36fps (the GPU\u2019s result with frame generation off). This is naturally less of an issue on the RTX 4080 and RTX 4090, which can render enough frames the old fashioned way to maintain a smooth feel regardless.\n\n\n \n\nStill, you can always lower the upscaling quality to get the extra rendered frames you need, and at 4K it\u2019ll still look nice and sharp. With DLSS 3 set to Performance mode, I got 55fps without the AI frames \u2013 enough for a much sharper mousefeel \u2013 with frame generation boosting the visuals to a lovely 83fps. Much better.\nRTX 4070 Ti review: 1440p performance\nProvided you have a 144Hz/165Hz monitor to take advantage of it, the RTX 4070 Ti is more than viable for top quality 1440p. With the exception of a disappointing Metro Exodus result, it\u2019s more competitive with its costlier peers at this resolution, even coming within a few frames of the RTX 4080 across multiple games.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nCompared to its 4K results, this GPU closes the gap in Final Fantasy XV, Watch Dogs Legion, and Hitman 3, while also catching up to the Radeon RX 7900 XTX \u2013 another ostensibly higher-end graphics card \u2013 in Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Considering that the RTX 4070 Ti is the cheapest card here, it does pretty well to avoid being the slowest in nearly half of the games tested.\nDLSS 3\u2019s frame generation isn\u2019t as useful when you\u2019re already pumping out such high framerates, so it\u2019s less of a killer app at 1440p than it is at 4K. But DLSS upscaling is still the best of its kind, and again, Ada Lovelace still delivers better RT performance than anything with a Radeon badge. The architecture, not her ghost.\nThat also-ran Metro Exodus result? With Ultra RT effects switched on, the RTX 4070 Ti only needs to weather a 15% performance hit, dropping from 92fps to 78fps. The rival RX 7900 XT suffers a much harsher 42% drop, 116fps to 67fps, and even the Radeon RX 7900 XTX loses 32% by falling from 120fps to 82fps. That does leave the latter as the fastest overall with ray tracing, but only by 4fps on average, and that\u2019s not really worth the hundreds of pounds in extra cost.\n\n\n \n\nApplying ray tracing to Watch Dogs Legion even saw the RTX 4070 Ti steal a little lead, by only dropping 28% of its frames (80fps to 58fps). By contrast the RX 7900 XTX fell by 34% (87fps to 57fps) and the RX 7900 XT by 40% (86fps to 52fps).\nThe RTX 4080 is faster than all three, of course, and copes even more comfortably with the strain of ray tracing. And, without wanting to speculate too much, one suspects that the RTX 4070 Ti would come out these results looking worse if it still had its RTX 4080 branding and original pricing.\n\n\n \n\nBut it doesn\u2019t, and Nvidia opening up some space between this and the RTX 4080 makes the RTX 4070 Ti both more palatable on performance and simply \u2013 though crucially \u2013 easier to actually buy. The specific FPS numbers are lower, but there\u2019s still that satisfying sense of finding a cheaper alternative that, broadly, does everything the fancy model can do: good 4K, great 1440p, ray tracing, DLSS 3, etcetera. I think if this launched as a 12GB RTX 4080, I\u2019d just be wondering why you wouldn\u2019t pay slightly more for the full fat version.\nIt\u2019s still a luxury graphics card, to be sure, and you really should approach it as something like a cut-price RTX 3090 successor rather than another upper-mid-range GPU like the RTX 3070 Ti technically was. I\u2019m still moody that neither Nvidia nor AMD have presented any new GPUs in these lower brackets yet, but if you do want something new-new, the RTX 4070 Ti should put a smile on your face.\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n          \n\n\n\n            Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n          \n\n\n\n            In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nJames Archer: James had previously hung around beneath the RPS treehouse as a freelancer, before being told to drop the pine cones and climb up to become hardware editor.

The NVIDIA AI cloud offering will bring the full NVIDIA accelerated computing stack \u2014 from GPUs to systems to software \u2013 to customers hosted within the world\u2019s hyperscale cloud providers, but offered directly by NVIDIA and accessible via the browser, the chipmaker said this week.NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs and associated software libraries have done much heavy lifting behind the scenes when it comes to popular AI. All GPT-3 models, for example, were trained on NVIDIA V100 GPUs. (The company recently started shipping its DGX H100 \"purpose-built AI infrastructure\", which comprises 8x H100 GPUs, 18x NVLink connections per GPU, 4x NVSwitches, 10x ConnectX network interface, bundled with Xeon CPUs and 30 Terabytes of SSD.)NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has taken to describing NVIDIA as a \u201cmulti-domain accelerated computing platform\u201d and wants to capture surging demand for AI training and inference capabilities by offering a cloud-hosted AI-as-a-Service, saying: \u201cGenerative AI's versatility and capability has triggered a sense of urgency at enterprises around the world to develop and deploy AI strategies. Yet, the AI supercomputer infrastructure, model algorithms, data processing, and training techniques remain an insurmountable obstacle for most.\u201dNVIDIA AI Cloud: Infrastructure to OS to models in one placeCEO Jensen Huang told analysts on a February 22, 2023 earnings call: \u201c[We work with] 10,000 AI start-ups around the world, with enterprises in every industry. And all of those relationships today would really love to be able to deploy both into the cloud at least or into the cloud and on-prem and oftentimes multi-cloud.\u201cBy having NVIDIA\u2019s infrastructure full stack in their cloud, we're effectively attracting customers to the CSPs\u2026 for the customers, they now have an instantaneous infrastructure\u2026 a team of people who are extremely good from the infrastructure to the acceleration software, the NVIDIA AI open operating system, all the way up to AI models, within one entity, they have access to expertise across that entire span. This is a great model for customers. It's a great model for CSPs. And it's a great model for us. It lets us really run like the wind.\u201dNVIDIA DGX Cloud builds on initial Oracle partnershipThe offering builds on a partnership with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure that NVIDIA announced in October 2022.NVIDIA is calling the offering the NVIDIA DGX Cloud and said in a release that \u201cusing their browser, they will be able to engage an NVIDIA DGX AI supercomputer through the NVIDIA DGX Cloud, which is already offered on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, with Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform and others expected soon.The company added in the February 22 press release: \u201cAt the AI platform software layer, they will be able to access NVIDIA AI Enterprise for training and deploying large language models or other AI workloads. And at the AI-model-as-a-service layer, NVIDIA will offer its NeMo and BioNeMo customizable AI models to enterprise customers who want to build proprietary generative AI models and services for their businesses.\u201dHuang concluded: \"New companies, new applications and new solutions to long-standing challenges are being invented at an astounding rate. Enterprises in just about every industry are activating to apply generative AI to reimagine their products and businesses. The level of activity around AI, which was already high, has accelerated significantly. This is the moment we've been working toward for over a decade. And we are ready.\"That's a lot of airtime The Stack has given NVIDIA here and we understand some potential customers may have many questions around everything from availability to cost to whether AWS is going to be part of this launch. We don't have answers yet but we will: The company plans to reveal more details about the NVIDIA AI Cloud at its GTC developer conference, taking place virtually March 20-23 and we'll tackle this offering more robustly then.See also: Large language model platforms will be the \u201cnew factories\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArm\n\nUber plans to refactor Cassandra, MySQL, Redis workloads for Arm\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nThe Stack\n\n\n      March 14, 2025\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCloud\n\nOracle buys 30,000 new AMD chips for AI cloud - laments bottlenecks\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nEdward Targett\n\n\n      March 11, 2025\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCloud\n\nAgents galore: Salesforce comes to Google Cloud in $2.5B deal\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nThe Stack\n\n\n      February 25, 2025\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nKubernetes\n\nHyperscale cloud rivals join forces with Kro to \u201cmake K8s APIs simpler for all Kubernetes users\u201d\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nEdward Targett\n\n\n      February 24, 2025\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLatest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nGoogle drops cool $32bn for Wiz in multicloud security play\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nNoah Bovenizer\n\n\n      March 18, 2025\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nRogue CIO gets seven years jail, must pay over $1m, for \u201coutsourcing\u201d work to company he controlled\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nJoe Fay\n\n\n      March 18, 2025\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nUK told to stop chasing big AI players, focus on sustainable tech and skills\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nNoah Bovenizer\n\n\n      March 18, 2025\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nEU should \"Buy European\" to support tech industry against US, China says EuroStack group\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nNoah Bovenizer\n\n\n      March 17, 2025\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Stack\n\n\nThe Stack\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n      \u00a9 2025 The Stack\n       \u2013 Published with Ghost & Tripoli\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The work for which I am being recognized is part of a large team effort. Many faculty and students participated in the stream processing research at Stanford, and a very large team at NVIDIA was involved in translating this research into GPU computing. It is a really exciting time to be a computer engineer.\n\u201cThe future is bright with a lot more demanding applications waiting to be accelerated using the principles of stream processing and accelerated computing,\u201d he said.\nHis induction kicked off with a video featuring colleagues and friends, spanning his career across Caltech, MIT,\u00a0 Stanford and NVIDIA.\nIn the video, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang describes Dally as \u201can extraordinary scientist, engineer, leader and amazing person.\u201d\nFei-Fei Li, professor of computer science at Stanford and co-director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI, commended Dally\u2019s journey \u201cfrom an academic scholar and a world-class researcher to an industry leader\u201d who is spearheading one of the \u201cbiggest digital revolutions of our time in terms of AI \u2014 both software and hardware.\u201d\nFollowing the tribute video, Fred Barez, chair of the Hall of Fame committee and professor of mechanical engineering at San Jose State University, took the stage and\u00a0 said: \u201cThis year\u2019s inductee has made significant contributions, not just to his profession, but to Silicon Valley and beyond.\u201d\nUnderpinning the GPU Revolution\nAs the leader of NVIDIA Research for nearly 15 years, Dally has built a team of more than 300 scientists around the globe, with groups covering a wide range of topics, including AI, graphics, simulation, computer vision, self-driving cars and robotics.\nPrior to NVIDIA, Dally advanced the state of the art in engineering at some of the world\u2019s top academic institutions. His development of stream processing at Stanford led directly to GPU computing, and his contributions are responsible for much of the technology used today in high-performance computing networks.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | NVIDIA Life | Research \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

achievements this year.\t\t\n\n\nIn terms of AI developments, 2022 proved to be a banner year. AI production and usage increased and both deep learning and machine learning models steadily conquered increasingly complex problems. But AI evolution goes beyond impressive production and adoption levels to include breakthroughs in new computing methods, applications, and mega-scale supercomputers. Two of the leaders in this space are Microsoft Azure and NVIDIA and here are some of their most noteworthy achievements this year.\nMassive cloud AI supercomputer for mega-sized AI models\nThe two computing giants are collaborating to provide one of the most powerful AI supercomputing platforms in the world. Powered by Microsoft Azure\u2019s advanced supercomputing infrastructure combined with NVIDIA GPUs, networking, and the full stack of AI software, this cloud supercomputer will help enterprises train, deploy, and scale AI, including large, state-of-the-art models.\nAzure is the first public cloud to incorporate NVIDIA\u2019s advanced AI stack, adding tens of thousands of NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs, NVIDIA Quantum-2 400Gb/s InfiniBand networking, and the NVIDIA AI enterprise software suite to its platform.\nThis effort isn\u2019t limited to spinning up better outputs in lean times\u2014there\u2019s also the need to advance knowledge and discoveries to benefit all of mankind\u2019s endeavors and needs. All told, it\u2019s an impressive AI system that performs at scales rarely imagined to be possible.\nA quantum leap for AI-fueled scientific discoveries\nAI can do far more than traditional data mining and advanced analytics. AI is dramatically changing scientific methods, handling complexities that a human mind cannot comprehend.\nAt Supercomputing 2022 (SC22), NVIDIA announced broad adoption of its next-generation H100 Tensor Core GPUs and Quantum-2 InfiniBand, including new offerings on Microsoft Azure cloud and over 50 new partner systems for accelerating scientific discovery.\nH100 and Quantum-2 are part of NVIDIA\u2019s high-performance computing (HPC) platform\u2014a full technology stack with CPUs, GPUs, DPUs, systems, networking, and a broad range of AI and HPC software\u2014that provides researchers the ability to efficiently accelerate their work on powerful systems, on-premises or in the cloud.\nMicrosoft Azure will be the first to offer NVIDIA Quantum-2 for HPC Workloads, providing a world-class supercomputing cloud infrastructure that allows researchers and scientists using Azure to achieve their life\u2019s work.\nInnovation is the lifeblood of all industries and this Microsoft Azure and NVIDIA breakthrough puts it at the fingertips of all users.\nAI brings medical imagery diagnostics into sharper focus\nA powerful collaboration between Microsoft Azure, NVIDIA, and the Nuance Precision Imaging Network puts AI-based medical image diagnostic tools directly into the hands of radiologists and other clinicians. This enables the capture of economies at scale, meaning patient care improves while costs drop.\nA powerful collaboration between Microsoft Azure, NVIDIA, and the Nuance Precision Imaging Network puts AI-based medical image diagnostic tools directly into the hands of radiologists and other clinicians.

Image: NvidiaSean Hollister is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.Microsoft is trying to convince the entire world that it should be allowed to buy Activision Blizzard for $69 billion \u2014 and it just bartered for Nvidia\u2019s support, signing a 10-year contract that gives Nvidia the right to stream Xbox PC games over its GeForce Now cloud gaming subscription service.RelatedMicrosoft recruited Nintendo and Nvidia to help fight Sony over the Activision dealMicrosoft is bringing Xbox PC games to Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now serviceWhat does that mean for gamers like you and me? Well, I just got off the phone with Nvidia GeForce Now VP Phil Eisler, who gave me both a big-picture answer and the shorter-term practical details to go with it.Big picture, Eisler thinks this deal could finally break the cloud gaming \u201cchicken-and-egg\u201d cycle \u2014 providing enough games to attract enough gamers to convince publishers to provide more games, too.That\u2019s because this deal isn\u2019t just for Halo or Forza Motorsport, he tells me; it also covers the Bethesda games like Fallout and The Elder Scrolls. Minecraft is coming to GeForce Now, he confirms. And if the Activision Blizzard deal goes through, it won\u2019t just be Call of Duty on GeForce Now; it\u2019ll be the entire Battle.net catalog \u2014 including Overwatch and presumably StarCraft, Warcraft, and Diablo.Optimally, you shouldn\u2019t have to wait for future Microsoft-owned games to appear in GeForce Now, either. \u201cThe agreement is to release new titles day-and-date or as close to day-and-date as we can with the PC release of the games,\u201d Eisler says. (The rights are tied to the PC versions of games, not the Xbox console versions, he explains later.)You might be able to stream Xbox PC games on launch dayEven though Microsoft has its own Xbox Cloud Gaming service, GeForce Now may soon become the place to play Xbox games that live in the cloud. Right now, GeForce Now is a little north of 1,500 titles, a tiny fraction of the tens of thousands you\u2019d find on the Steam platform, but he\u2019s hoping that could change following a deal of this magnitude.And though Microsoft, Activision Blizzard, and Bethesda were among the first companies to pull their games from GeForce Now back in 2020, that shouldn\u2019t happen again under the terms of this agreement. \u201cOnce we onboard them, we\u2019ll have the rights to them for 10 years,\u201d says Eisler. (If Microsoft later decides to sell off studios, though, he\u2019s not sure the agreement would bind future owners.)Sound neat? Just remember that we\u2019re just talking about streaming rights for games that you\u2019ve already purchased and games that are free to play \u2014 and even then, you shouldn\u2019t expect to have access to every Microsoft game right away.GeForce Now doesn\u2019t sell games. Unless they\u2019re free to play, you have to buy them from Steam, the Epic Games Store, and / or the Microsoft Store for now \u2014 and possibly Battle.net in the future should the Activision Blizzard deal go through. \u201cThat\u2019s how GeForce Now works,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can stream them to authorized owners.\u201dRelatedXbox boss says Microsoft\u2019s Bethesda deal was all about exclusive games for Game PassHands-on: Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now just leapfrogged Google StadiaTesting Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now RTX 4080, the most advanced cloud gaming platform yetPractically speaking, Nvidia plans to roll out just a few games a week, says Eisler. The company doesn\u2019t have the capacity to do more than maybe 10 games per week at present, he suggests. While Nvidia plans to make the first Microsoft games available in the next few weeks from Steam and the Epic Games Store, he estimates it\u2019ll take between six and 12 months to enable the Microsoft Store catalog and enable all existing games.That\u2019s just an estimate, by the way. Eisler says the deal came together just last week, and the companies \u201chaven\u2019t worked on detailed implementation plans yet.\u201dThe big question in my mind: if I have the rights to play a game because I subscribe to Xbox Game Pass, will I be able to play those games on GeForce Now? Will Microsoft make me buy the game all over again? Eisler won\u2019t say. \u201cWe have no announcement about Game Pass right now.\u201dWhen I ask him yes or no \u2014 \u201cdoes the contract give you the rights or not?\u201d \u2014 he says simply: \u201cI can\u2019t answer that question.\u201dIt wouldn\u2019t be surprising if Game Pass is entirely separate: in 2021, Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer made it clear that studio acquisitions like Bethesda were about securing exclusive games for Game Pass.But it also wouldn\u2019t surprise me if Microsoft did agree to let Game Pass subscribers play those games on GeForce Now. If Microsoft\u2019s already getting its money, why not let Nvidia shoulder the server costs? I suppose it depends how much Microsoft cares about its own cloud gaming future. The vision I laid out in this editorial doesn\u2019t come true unless Xbox and Xbox Cloud Gaming become one seamless whole.See More: TechEntertainmentGamingMicrosoftNewsNvidiaPC GamingReportXboxMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

We have heard that the NVIDIA A100\u2019s are being used for that. Many folks are using ChatGPT that have never seen or used a NVIDIA A100. That makes sense since they are often priced at $10,000+ each, and so getting an 8x NVIDIA A100 system starts around $100,000 at the lower end. We figured it would be worth a second to run through the STH archives and show you what the NVIDIA A100 looks like.\nChatGPT Hardware a Look at 8x NVIDIA A100 Powering the Tool\nFirst, what is a NVIDIA A100 anyway? Many folks understand the concept of a GPU since it is a common component in desktop systems. Usually, GPUs are PCIe cards and can be used for gaming or has become more common in servers. NVIDIA makes A100 GPUs specifically for these types of systems.\nNVIDIA A100 80GB PCIe 2\nThere are a few differences between the NVIDIA A100 and NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce series commonly found in gaming. For one, the NVIDIA A100 is designed with server cooling in mind. That means there are no fans and they are designed to be packed densely into tight systems.\nASUS RS720A E11 RS24U AMD EPYC 7003 And NVIDIA A100 PCIe\nWhile the GPUs have high-speed interconnects, called NVLink even in this PCIe form factor, these are not GPUs meant for gaming. The A100 is specifically tuned toward AI and high-performance computation instead of rendering 3D frames quickly for gaming.\n2x NVIDIA A100 PCIe With NVLink Bridges Installed\nA great example of why this is the case can be seen on the back of the NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Here, the bracket simply has an exhaust for cooling airflow. These do not have display outputs to connect a monitor or TV.\nMost 8x NVIDIA A100 systems, especially at larger cloud service providers, use a special NVIDIA-only form factor called SXM4. In the picture below, the GPU is around the black layer near the bottom of the assembly. Over 80% of this assembly is a heatsink to dissipate massive heat. While the PCIe variants that look like gaming GPUs above are usually only able to handle 250W-300W, the SXM4 variants handle 400-500W each. That extra power allows for more performance per A100.\nNVIDIA A100 SXM At ISC 2022 Side\nEach of these SXM4 A100\u2019s is not sold as a single unit. Instead, they are sold in either 4 or 8 GPU subsystems because of how challenging the SXM installation is. The caps below each hide a sea of electrical pins. One bent pin, or even tightening the heatsink onto the GPU too tight, can destroy a GPU that costs as much as a car.\nNVIDIA A100 SXM At ISC 2022 Bottom\nThe last ones we installed ourselves required a $350+ torque screwdriver to hit the tolerances we needed. You can find that old STH video here with the old P100 generation (wow this is an OLD one!):\n\nIn modern servers, these are installed with 8x SXM4 GPUs onto a baseboard called the NVIDIA HGX A100. Vendors such as Inspur, Supermicro, Quanta, and others then use this HGX A100 as the cornerstone of their own AI systems. These systems are so specialized that Dell EMC did not even start selling them until very recently with the Dell PowerEdge XE9680.\nInspur NF5488A5 NVIDIA HGX A100 8 GPU Assembly 19\nEach baseboard is designed to align eight of the NVIDIA A100 SXM4 GPUs into an array. PCIe connectivity is provided back to the host server using high-density edge connectors.\nInspur NF5488A5 NVIDIA HGX A100 8 GPU Assembly Side View 3\nThe other large heatsinks on the NVIDIA HGX A100 are to cool the NVSwitches. NVIDIA has its own high-speed interconnect that allows each A100 to talk to each other within a system at extremely high speeds.\nInspur NF5488A5 NVIDIA HGX A100 8 GPU Assembly Larger NVSwitch Coolers\nIn a server, here is what 8x NVIDIA A100 80GB 500W GPUs look like from a NVIDIA HGX A100 assembly above.\n8x NVIDIA A100 500W Nvidia Smi Output\nThat means that a system with these will be very fast but can also use upwards of 5kW of power.\nSupermicro AS 04124GO NART Liquid Cooling Linpack 8x A100 80GB 500W\nSince the NVIDIA A100\u2019s have more memory onboard than most desktops and laptops, 40GB-80GB, and so much compute capacity, the NVIDIA A100 has a feature called many-instance GPU or MIG that can partition the GPU in different sizes, similar to a cloud instance. Many times, for AI inference, this can be used to run workloads in parallel on a GPU, thus increasing the throughput of a GPU to handle AI inference tasks.\nNVIDIA A100 40GB MIG Instance Types\nHere is what happens when we split a 40GB NVIDIA A100 into two MIG instances.\nNVIDIA A100 40GB Split To Two MIG Instances\nAs you may have seen, all of this requires a LOT of cooling. Here are two NVIDIA A100 systems, the top is air-cooled, the bottom is liquid-cooled.\nSupermicro Liquid Cooling Supermicro AS 4124GO NART Air And Liquid Cooled Front\nThe liquid cooling increases performance and allowed us to run the A100\u2019s at higher power limits, thus increasing performance.\n\nWe also did a deep dive on an A100 server in this video:\n\nWhile the NVIDIA A100 is cool, the next frontier is the NVIDIA H100 which promises even more performance.\nWhat is Next? The NVIDIA H100\nThe next-generation part after the NVIDIA A100 is the NVIDIA H100. This is a higher-power card with the company\u2019s new \u201cHopper\u201d architecture. NVIDIA will have both PCIe and SXM5 variants. Here is the SXM5 H100 without its heatsink at NVIDIA HQ.\nPatrick With The NVIDIA H100 At NVIDIA HQ April 2022\nIf you want to see the new NVIDIA H100 systems, we showed them off in our recent Supermicro X13 launch video:\n\nWe even had the NVIDIA H100 8x GPU systems, PCIe systems, and a desktop PCIe A100 system with massive liquid cooling in the GPU accelerated systems video.\n\nWe still do not have these in our lab since they are very highly demanded-products.\nFinal Words\nRegular readers of STH have seen probably a dozen reviews of systems with the NVIDIA A100. Since the NVIDIA A100 is a hot topic given the OpenAI ChatGPT and now the Microsoft Bing integration, we thought it was worthwhile to show folks what these cards are. While the NVIDIA A100 and new H100 are called \u201cGPUs\u201d and may be more expensive than their desktop gaming brethren like the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090, they are really high-performance computing accelerators tuned for AI workloads.\nAs always, stay tuned to STH for more A100 and H100 system reviews.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n TAGSAIChatGPTSupermicro \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleServer DDR5 RDIMM and ECC UDIMM the VideoNext articleGeekbench 6 Launched Big Benchmark Updates We Try It Patrick Kennedyhttps://www.servethehome.comPatrick has been running STH since 2009 and covers a wide variety of SME, SMB, and SOHO IT topics.

The SXM GPUs have such tight tolerances that the +/- values can be outside of the range of what the GPU can handle. That leads to cracked GPUs.

For SXM GPUs, if the paste is too thick, it will actually crack the exposed GPU chips. A top 3 server OEM screened slightly too much and that took out many V100\u2019s back in the day. Now these are sold pre-assembled into larger assemblies so that and the torque variance are less of an issue. Still, even on the server CPU space, 99%+ of servers deployed do not have people applying their own paste. With the SXM GPUs, it is even less just because of how many have been cracked back in the P100/V100 generations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            February 14, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            11:19 am                                            \n\n\n\nHow is it done with OAM parts such as the AMD Instinct or Intel GPU Max? Do they tend to be factory installed? If so are people commonly going to swap out one set of OAM parts from one manufacturer for another set from a different manufacturer on the same carrier board? What is the practical benefit for the extra hoop to jump through? Perhaps if you\u2019re a chip designer designing a new product line it saves money by not needing to specify that part? Or you just might as well glom onto what already is available because there\u2019s little advantage not to? Is \u201can open infrastructure for interoperable OAMs\u201d actually taken advantage of practically?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nboomer\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            July 28, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            11:16 am                                            \n\n\n\nHow long before us humans are completely obsolete?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEAVE A REPLY\n\n\nPlease enter your comment!\n\n\nPlease enter your name here\n\n\n\nYou have entered an incorrect email address!\nPlease enter your email address here\n\n\n\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign me up for the STH newsletter! \n\n\u0394 \nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

His \u201cSunPath\u201d extension \u2014 built in just over a month \u2014 solves this problem, as designers can import scenes to Omniverse and create accurate sun studies quickly and easily.\nThey can even use \u201cSunPath\u201d to perform energy-consumption analyses to make design results more efficient, Wu added.\n\nMore Wins With Omniverse\nParticipating in the #ExtendOmniverse contest inspired Wu to develop further applications of Omniverse for AECO, he said.\nHe led a team at HNADI, which includes eight members who are experts in both architecture and technology, to create a platform that enables users to customize AECO-specific digital twins. Dubbed HNADI-AECKIT, the platform extends an Omniverse Connector to Rhino, a 3D computer graphics and computer-aided design software.\nIt won two awards at last year\u2019s AEC Hackathon in China: first prize overall and in the \u201cBest Development of the Omniverse\u201d track.\n\u201cThe core technical advantage of HNADI-AECKIT is that it opens up a complete linkage between Rhino and Omniverse,\u201d Wu said. \u201cAny output from Rhino can be quickly converted into a high-fidelity, information-visible, interactive, customizable digital-twin scene in Omniverse.\u201d\nLearn more about HNADI-AECKIT:\n\nJoin In on the Creation\nCreators and developers across the world can download NVIDIA Omniverse for free, and enterprise teams can use the platform for their 3D projects.\nDiscover how to build an Omniverse extension in less than 10 minutes.\nFor a deeper dive into developing on Omniverse, attend these sessions at GTC, a global conference for the era of AI and the metaverse, running March 20-23.\nFind additional documentation and tutorials in the Omniverse Resource Center, which details how developers like Wu can build custom USD-based applications and extensions for the platform.\nTo discover more free tools, training and a community for developers, join the NVIDIA Developer Program.\nFollow NVIDIA Omniverse on Instagram, Medium, Twitter and YouTube for additional resources and inspiration.

So Nvidia claims for its AI accelerating hardware in terms of the performance boost it has delivered over\u00a0the last decade and will deliver again over the next 10 years.The result, if Nvidia is correct, will be a new industry of AI factories across the world and gigantic breakthroughs in AI processing power. It also means, ostensibly, AI models one million times more powerful than existing examples, including ChatGPT, in AI processing terms at least.In Nvidia's earnings call yesterday, CEO Jensen Huang claimed that Nvidia's GPUs had boosted AI processing performance by a factor of no less than one million in the last 10 years.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nChina's DeepSeek chatbot reportedly gets much more done with fewer GPUs but Nvidia still thinks it's 'excellent' news\n\n\n\n\nJen-Hsun reckons Nvidia has driven the 'cost of computing down by 1,000,000 times'\n\n\n\n\"Moore's Law, in its best days, would have delivered 100x in a decade,\" Huang explained. \"By coming up with new processors, new systems, new interconnects, new frameworks and algorithms and working with data scientists, AI researchers on new models, across that entire span, we've made large language model processing a million times faster.\"Put another way: no Nvidia, no ChatGPT. The AI language model that is said to run on around 10,000 Nvidia GPUs and has captured the world's consciousness by demonstrating something akin to its own actual consciousness in recent months wouldn't be here without Jensen.And, of course, the team at OpenAI who actual put it into operation.If one million times the performance in the last decade isn't impressive enough, Huang has news for you: Nvidia's going to do it again.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest gaming motherboard: The right boards\nBest graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest\"Over the course of the next 10 years, I hope through new chips, new interconnects, new systems, new operating systems, new distributed computing algorithms and new AI algorithms and working with developers coming up with new models, I believe we're going to accelerate AI by another million times,\" Huang says.Exactly how one measures these claimed performance boosts isn't clear. But the result of the next one million times AI processing boost will be what Huang describes as AI \"factories.\"\u00a0\"There was a time when people manufactured just physical goods. In the future, almost every company will manufacture soft goods. It just happens to be in the form of intelligence,\" Huang predicts. \"I expect to see AI factories all over the world,\" Huang explains. \"There will be some that are large, and there are some that will be mega large, and then there'll be some that are smaller.\"\"My expectation is that you're going to see really gigantic breakthroughs in AI models in the next company, the AI platforms in the coming decade. But simultaneously, because of the incredible growth and adoption of this, you're going to see these AI factories everywhere.\"So, there you have it. AI factories across the world. At what point exactly they become fully conscious and take over that world is anyone's guess. But an AI model that's a million times more powerful than ChatGPT? That sounds like sooner rather than later.

However, because of their slender form, they have been limited to \u2018low-profile\u2019 GPUs with a half height bracket. Historically, low-profile cards have been very much \u2018entry-level\u2019 \u2014 perfectly good for 3D CAD, but lacking the performance and features for more demanding workflows such as real-time visualisation and ray trace rendering.\nOver 40 pages of dedicated workstation reviews, features and coverage. Click image to read\nThis all changed last year with the introduction of the Nvidia RTX A2000. This powerful low profile GPU not only delivered more performance than ever before, but introduced RTX technology to the entry-level segment. Previously, in order to get professional Nvidia graphics with hardware ray tracing built-in, you needed a 4000 class GPU.\nThe other major difference between the Nvidia RTX A2000 and previous low-profile offerings is that it\u2019s a double height board, taking up two slots on the motherboard. This is so it can accommodate a beefier radial type fan for better cooling, where hot air is directly exhausted out of the workstation via the grille on the bracket.\nDespite the increase in size, the RTX A2000 started appearing in more workstations than ever before \u2014 not just SFFs, but ultra-compact workstations as well, such as the HP Z2 Mini G9 .\nBut it\u2019s not just limited to tiny workstations. It can also be fitted to standard towers and, when the GPU is purchased separately, it comes with a half height and full height ATX bracket.\nThe first Nvidia RTX A2000 featured 6 GB of GDDR6 memory. At time of launch we suggested this might be a little light for its intended workflows. After all, viz datasets quickly swell, especially at 4K resolution. More recently, however, Nvidia released a 12 GB version, which is the subject of this review.\nThe Nvidia RTX A2000 opens up possibilities for entry-level design viz in small workstations using applications like KeyShot (image courtesy of Jet Cooper)\nBoth the 6 GB and 12 GB models look identical with four Mini DisplayPort outputs and a minimal matt black enclosure. With a max board power of 70W the GPU is designed to operate with PCIe slot power alone.\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nOn test\nWe tested the RTX A2000 with a full suite of pro applications. In CAD and BIM software \u2014 Inventor, Solidworks and Revit \u2014 it more than delivered. Compared to the Nvidia RTX A4000, SPECapc Solidworks 2022 benchmark scores may have dropped off at 4K resolution, but we still got a perfectly smooth viewport with 26.4 Frames Per Second (FPS) when testing our large 2,300 part, 49 million triangle snow bike assembly with RealView enabled.\nIn viz workflows things started to slow down a little. While the card showed great performance at FHD resolution, it dropped off considerably at 4K, especially in some of our more demanding tests. In VRED Professional 2023 with antialiasing set to ultra-high and in Unreal Engine 4.26 with ray tracing enabled, it never reached double digits. In GPU rendering, the RTX A4000 was 88% faster in V-Ray, but in Solidworks Visualize it still rendered the Camaro 1969 model at 4K (100 passes with de-noising) in a perfectly acceptable 38.5 seconds.\nAs an aside, our testing highlighted the importance of selecting the right pro driver. Newer is not always better. In Solidworks Visualize 2022, the card was almost six times slower with the 527.01 driver than it was with the certified 516.94 driver.\nThe verdict\nWith its impressive performance and hardware ray tracing, the Nvidia RTX A2000 has completely transformed the SFF and ultra-compact workstation. It\u2019s an excellent choice for CAD users who want to expand into design visualisation, with dedicated tools like KeyShot or GPU ray tracers that are starting to make their way into CAD viewports. But forget about the 6 GB version of the card. 12 GB is a much better fit \u2014now and well into the future.\nThe Nvidia RTX A2000 is not the GPU for you if you take design viz seriously. The Nvidia RTX A4000 and above are much better suited to more demanding workflows, especially at 4K resolution.\nBut these are full height boards for full sized towers. If you have your heart set on a pint-sized desktop, then there\u2019s nothing out there right now that comes close.\nPrice (Ex VAT): \u00a3429 (6 GB) \u00a3550 (12 GB)\n www.nvidia.com\n\nNvidia T1000 (8 GB)\nIf budgets are tight and you have little interest in design visualisation, you should consider the Nvidia T1000. This low-profile card is nailed on for 3D CAD. It has four Mini DisplayPorts, a max power of 50W and comes in 4 GB and 8 GB models.\nIn Solidworks 2022, things slowed down a little at 4K resolution with some of our larger assemblies, but in Inventor and Revit there was hardly any difference to the Nvidia RTX A2000. And at \u00a3355 (Ex VAT) for the 8GB model it\u2019s a full \u00a3200 cheaper.\n\u00a0\n\nThis article is part of AEC Magazine\u2019s Workstation Special report\nScroll down to read and subscribe here\nFeaturing\n\nReview: 13th Gen Intel Core vs AMD Ryzen 7000 CPUs\nExclusive Review: Intel Arc Pro A40/A50 GPUs\nComment: Workstation energy efficiency\nReview: Scan desktop workstations\nReview: Boxx Apexx S4.04 workstation\nReview: HP Z2 Mini G9 workstation\nReview: Lenovo ThinkStation P360 Ultra\nReview: Armari Magnetar M64TP-RW1300G3\nReview: Dell Precision 5470 mobile workstation\nRound-up: Ultra-portable mobile workstations\nReview: AMD Radeon Pro OpenGL driver\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRelated articles:Review: Armari Magnetar R80 (pre-production unit)Dell Precision 3450 SFF and Dell Precision 3650 launchInevidesk: flexible virtual workstationsAMD Radeon Pro W7600 and W7500 workstation GPUs launchAEC Magazine Winter 2024 EditionREVIEW: InterPro E-Series - E200HWE [v3] workstationLiquid cooled workstation launches with Threadripper ProReview: BOXX APEXX 2 + renderPRO 2\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPrevious Post \n\nNext Post \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nStay informed\nJoin the AEC community\nNewsletter \u2022 FREE digital magazine \u2022 print magazine\nGo\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLatest content \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAI and the future of arch viz\n\nFebruary 21, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWorkstation Special Report \u2013 Winter 2025\n\nFebruary 9, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMotif to take on Revit: exclusive interview\n\nFebruary 7, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAllplan acquires Manufacton to boost offsite\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nD5 Render 2.10 introduces real-time path tracing\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \u00a9 2008 - 2024 X3DMedia\r\n19 Leyden Street, London, E1 7LE, UK\r\nTel: +44(0)20 3355 7310                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManage Cookie Consent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use technologies like cookies to store and/or access device information.

And DLSS 3 adds new Frame Generation technology, along with NVIDIA Reflex, to multiply performance for the fastest and most responsive gaming possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the launch of DLSS 3 in Cyberpunk 2077, Dying Light 2 Stay Human, HITMAN World of Assassination, Dakar Desert Rally, Deliver Us Mars, Marvel\u2019s Midnight Suns, and PERISH, GeForce gamers can multiply performance with DLSS 3 in 26 games right now, with the number rapidly increasing.\nGamers and press agree that DLSS 3 is a game-changer in Cyberpunk 2077, multiplying performance and giving GeForce RTX 40 Series owners an even faster, better experience:\n\n\u201cNvidia's RTX And DLSS 3 Cyberpunk Support Demonstrate Why These Features Are The Future Of Gaming\u201d - Forbes \n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d - Digital Foundry \n\u201cI can confirm that the results are mind-blowing\u201d - TweakTown \n\nThis month, DLSS arrives in another 7 games, including Atomic Heart, Blood Bowl 3, Hello Neighbor 2, PlanetSide 2, Returnal, Sons of the Forest, and Wanted: Dead.\nAltogether, there are over 270 released DLSS games and apps, giving GeForce RTX GPU, desktop and laptop users significantly faster performance and the best possible image quality, for the definitive experience in every supported title.\nAnd new titles regularly join the party. To learn more about all of the new games adding DLSS support this month, keep reading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 3 Multiplies Frame Rates\nPowered by new hardware capabilities of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture, DLSS 3 generates entirely new high quality frames, rather than just pixels.\nThrough a process detailed in full in our NVIDIA DLSS 3 article, DLSS 3 combines DLSS Super Resolution technology and DLSS Frame Generation to reconstruct 7/8ths of the displayed pixels, accelerating performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn GPU-limited games, DLSS 2 Super Resolution technology can increase your frame rates by up to 2X. With DLSS 3, we can multiply performance.\nCertain games make extensive use of the CPU which can limit performance. DLSS 3 operates on the GPU, bypassing CPU bottlenecks and boosting frame rates. In Microsoft Flight Simulator, for example, DLSS 3 boosts frame rates by up to 2X.\nDLSS 3 games are backwards compatible with DLSS 2 technology - developers simply integrate DLSS 3, and DLSS 2, also known as DLSS Super Resolution, is supported by default. Additionally, integrations of DLSS 3 also include NVIDIA Reflex, reducing system latency for all GeForce RTX users, making games more responsive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAtomic Heart Available Now With DLSS 3\nIn Mundfish\u2019s Atomic Heart, humans live in a utopia full of wonders, in harmony with their loyal and fervent robots.

Yet the industry has long been considered an evolutionary mover in its own business.\nA recent survey of more than 400 telecommunications industry professionals from around the world found that same cautious tone in how they plan to define and execute on their AI strategies.\nTo fill in a more complete picture of how the telecommunications industry is using AI, and where it\u2019s headed, NVIDIA\u2019s first \u201cState of AI in Telecommunications\u201d survey consisted of questions covering a range of AI topics, infrastructure spending, top use cases, biggest challenges and deployment models.\nSurvey respondents included C-suite leaders, managers, developers and IT architects from mobile telecoms, fixed and cable companies. The survey was conducted over eight weeks between mid-November 2022 and mid-January 2023.\nDial AI for Motivation\nThe survey results revealed two consistent themes: industry players (73%) see AI as a tool to grow revenue, improve operations and sustainability, or boost customer retention. Amid skepticism about the money-making potential of 5G, telecoms see efficiencies driven by AI as the most likely path for returns on investment.\nYet, 93% of those responding to questions about undertaking AI projects at their own companies appear to be substantially underinvesting in AI as a percentage of annual capital spending.\nSome 50% of respondents reported spending less than $1 million last year on AI projects; a year earlier, 60% of respondents said they spent less than $1 million on AI. Just 3% of respondents spent over $50 million on AI in 2022.\nThe reasons cited for such cautious spending? Some 44% of respondents reported an inability to adequately quantify return on investment, which illustrates a mismatch between aspirations and the reality in introducing AI-driven solutions.\nTechnical challenges \u2014 whether from lack of enough skilled personnel or poor infrastructure \u2014 are also obstructing AI adoption. Of respondents, 34% cited an insufficient number of data scientists as the second-biggest challenge. Given that data scientists are sought after across industries, the response suggests that the telecoms industry needs to push harder to woo them.\nWith 33% of respondents also citing a lack of budget for AI projects, the results suggest that AI advocates need to work harder with decision-makers to develop a convincing case for AI adoption.\nLikewise, for a technology solution that relies on data, concerns about the availability, handling, privacy and security of data were all critical issues to be addressed, especially in the light of data privacy and data residency laws around the globe, for example GDPR.\nAI Engagement\nSome 95% of telecommunications industry respondents said they were engaged with AI. But only 34% of respondents reported using AI for more than six months, while 23% said they\u2019re still learning about the different options for AI. Eighteen percent reported being in a trial or pilot phase of an AI project.\nFor respondents at the trial or implementation stage, a clear majority acknowledged that there had been a positive impact on both revenue and cost. About 73% of respondents reported that implementation of AI had led to increased revenue in the last year, with 17% noting revenue gains of more than 10% in specific parts of the business.\nLikewise, 80% of respondents reported that their implementation of AI led to reduced annual costs in the last year, with 15% noting that this cost reduction is above 10% \u2014 again, in specific parts of their business.\nAI, AI Everywhere\nThe telecommunications industry has a deep and multilayered view on where best to allocate resources to AI: cost reduction, revenue increase, customer experience enhancement and creating operational efficiencies were all cited as key priorities.\nIn terms of deployment, however, AI focused on improving operational efficiency was a clear winner. This is somewhat expected, as the operational complexity of new telecommunications networks like 5G lend themselves to new solutions like AI. The industry is responsible for critical national infrastructure in every country, supports over 5 billion customer end points, and is expected to constantly deliver above 99% reliability. Telcos have also discussed AI-enabled solutions for network operations, cell sites planning, truck-routing optimization and machine learning data analytics. To improve the customer experience, some are adopting recommendation engines, virtual assistants and digital avatars.\nIn the near term, the focus appears to be on building more effective telecom infrastructure and unlocking new revenue-generating opportunities, especially together with partners.\nThe trick will be moving from early testing to widespread adoption.\nDownload the \u201cState of AI in Telecommunications: 2023 Trends\u201d report for in-depth results and insights.\nLearn more about how telcos are leveraging AI to optimize operations and improve customer experiences.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Telecommunications \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It also includes Fujitsu\u2019s virtualized central unit (vCU) and distributed unit (vDU), plus other virtualized software functions of vRAN from Fujitsu.\nThe NVIDIA Aerial software development kit for 5G vRAN; NVIDIA Omniverse for building and operating custom 3D pipelines and large-scale simulations; NVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstation (vWS) software; and NVIDIA CloudXR for streaming extended reality.\nHardware includes the NVIDIA A100X and L40 converged accelerators.\n\nOREX has supported performance verification and evaluation tests for this system.\nCollaborating With Fujitsu\n\u201cFujitsu is delivering a fully virtualized 5G vRAN together with multi-access edge computing on the same high-performance, energy-efficient, versatile and scalable computing infrastructure,\u201d said Masaki Taniguchi, senior vice president and head of mobile systems at Fujitsu. \u201cThis combination, powered by AI and XR applications, enables telcos to deliver ultra-low latency services, highly optimized TCO and energy-efficient performance.\u201d\nThe announcement is a step toward accomplishing the O-RAN alliance\u2019s goal of enabling software-defined, AI-driven, cloud-native, fully programmable, energy-efficient and commercially ready telco-grade 5G Open RAN solutions. It\u2019s also consistent with OREX\u2019s goal of implementing a widely adopted, high-performance and multi-vendor 5G vRAN for both public and enterprise 5G deployments.\nThe all-in-one system uses GPUs to accelerate the software-defined 5G vRAN, as well as the edge AI and graphics applications, without bespoke hardware accelerators nor a specific telecom CPU. This ensures that the GPUs can accelerate the vRAN (based on NVIDIA Aerial), AI video analytics (based on NVIDIA Metropolis), streaming immersive extended reality (XR) experiences (based on NVIDIA CloudXR) and digital twins (based on NVIDIA Omniverse).\n\u201cTelcos and their customers are exploring new ways to boost productivity, efficiency and creativity through immersive experiences delivered over 5G networks,\u201d said Ronnie Vasishta, senior vice president of telecom at NVIDIA. \u201cAt Mobile World Congress, we are bringing those visions into reality, showcasing how a single GPU-enabled server can support workloads such as NVIDIA Aerial for 5G, CloudXR for streaming virtual reality and Omniverse for digital twins.\u201d\nThe AI-on-5G system is part of a growing portfolio of 5G solutions from NVIDIA that are driving transformation in the telecommunications industry. Anchored on the NVIDIA Aerial SDK and A100X converged accelerators \u2014 combined with BlueField DPUs and a suite of AI frameworks \u2014 NVIDIA provides a high-performance, software-defined, cloud-native, AI-enabled 5G for on-premises and telco operators\u2019 RAN.\nTelcos working with NVIDIA can gain access to thousands of software vendors and applications in the ecosystem, which can help address enterprise needs in smart cities, retail, manufacturing, industrial and mining.\nNVIDIA and Fujitsu will demonstrate the new AI-on-5G system at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, running Feb. 27-March 2, at hall 4, stand 4E20.\n\n\nCategories: Data CenterTags: Artificial Intelligence | CloudXR | Digital Twin | Smart Spaces | Telecommunications \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It also reduces the number of polygons that need to be rendered to increase the scene\u2019s overall performance, which significantly brings down file size, as well as CPU and GPU memory usage.\nPlus, anyone can now accomplish what used to require a technical rigger or animator using an Audio2Face add-on.\n\nA panel in the add-on makes it easier to use Blender characters in Audio2Face, an AI-enabled tool that automatically generates realistic facial expressions from an audio file.\nThis new functionality eases the process of bringing generated face shapes back onto rigs \u2014 that is, digital skeletons \u2014 by applying shapes exported through the Universal Scene Description (USD) framework onto a character even if it is fully rigged, meaning its whole body has a working digital skeleton. The integration of the facial shapes doesn\u2019t alter the rigs, so Audio2Face shapes and animation can be applied to characters \u2014 whether for games, shows and films, or simulations \u2014 at any point in the artist\u2019s workflow.\nRealistic Character Animation Made Easy\nAudio2Face puts AI-powered facial animation in the hands of every Blender user who works with Omniverse.\nUsing the new Blender add-on for Audio2Face, animator and popular YouTuber Marko Matosevic, aka Markom 3D, rigged and animated a Battletoads-inspired character using just an audio file.\n\nAustralia-based Matosevic joined Dave Tyner, a technical evangelist at NVIDIA, on a livestream to showcase their live collaboration across time zones, connecting 3D applications in a real-time Omniverse jam session. The two used the new Blender alpha release with Omniverse to make progress on one of Matosevic\u2019s short animations.\nThe new Blender release was also on display last month at CES in The Artists\u2019 Metaverse, a demo featuring seven artists, across time zones, who used Omniverse Nucleus Cloud, Autodesk, SideFX, Unreal Engine and more to create a short cinematic in real time.\n\nCreators can save time and simplify processes with the add-ons available in Omniverse\u2019s Blender build.\nNVIDIA principal artist Zhelong Xu, for example, used Blender and Omniverse to visualize an NVIDIA-themed \u201cYear of the Rabbit\u201d zodiac.\n\u201cI got the desired effect very quickly and tested a variety of lighting effects,\u201d said Xu, an award-winning 3D artist who\u2019s previously worked at top game studio Tencent and made key contributions to an animated show on Netflix.\nGet Plugged Into the Omniverse\u00a0\nLearn more about Blender and Omniverse integrations by watching a community livestream on Wednesday, Feb. 15, at 11 a.m. PT via Twitch and YouTube.\nAnd the session catalog for NVIDIA GTC, a global AI conference running online March 20-23, features hundreds of curated talks and workshops for 3D creators and developers.

Analyzing genome sequencing data requires accelerated compute, data science and AI to read and understand the genome. With the end of Moore\u2019s law, the observation that there\u2019s a doubling every two years in the number of transistors in an integrated circuit, new computing approaches are necessary to lower the cost of data analysis, increase the throughput and accuracy of reads, and ultimately unlock the full potential of the human genome.\nAn Explosion in Bioinformatics Data\nSequencing an individual\u2019s whole genome generates roughly 100 gigabytes of raw data. That more than doubles after the genome is sequenced using complex algorithms and applications such as deep learning and natural language processing.\nAs the cost of sequencing a human genome continues to decrease, volumes of sequencing data are exponentially increasing.\nAn estimated 40 exabytes will be required to store all human genome data by 2025. As a reference, that\u2019s 8x more storage than would be required to store every word spoken in history.\nMany genome analysis pipelines are struggling to keep up with the expansive levels of raw data being generated.\n\nAccelerated Genome Sequencing Analysis Workflows\nSequencing analysis is complicated and computationally intensive, with numerous steps required to identify genetic variants in a human genome.\nDeep learning is becoming important for base calling right within the genomic instrument using RNN- and convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models. Neural networks interpret image and signal data generated by instruments and infer the 3 billion nucleotide pairs of the human genome. This is improving the accuracy of the reads and ensuring that base calling occurs closer to real time, further hastening the entire genomics workflow, from sample to variant call format to final report.\nFor secondary genomic analysis, alignment technologies use a reference genome to assist with piecing a genome back together after the sequencing of DNA fragments.\nBWA-MEM, a leading algorithm for alignment, is helping researchers rapidly map DNA sequence reads to a reference genome. STAR is another gold-standard alignment algorithm used for RNA-seq data that delivers accurate, ultrafast alignment to better understand gene expressions.\nThe dynamic programming algorithm Smith-Waterman is also widely used for alignment, a step that\u2019s accelerated 35x on the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU, which includes a dynamic programming accelerator.\nUncovering Genetic Variants\nOne of the most critical stages of sequencing projects is variant calling, where researchers identify differences between a patient\u2019s sample and the reference genome. This helps clinicians determine what genetic disease a critically ill patient might have, or helps researchers look across a population to discover new drug targets. These variants can be single-nucleotide changes, small insertions and deletions, or complex rearrangements.\nGPU-optimized and -accelerated callers such as the Broad Institute\u2019s GATK \u2014 a genome analysis toolkit for germline variant calling \u2014 increase speed of analysis. To help researchers remove false positives in GATK results, NVIDIA collaborated with the Broad Institute to introduce NVScoreVariants, a deep learning tool for filtering variants using CNNs.\nDeep learning-based variant callers such as Google\u2019s DeepVariant increase accuracy of calls, without the need for a separate filtering step. DeepVariant uses a CNN architecture to call variants. It can be retrained to fine-tune for enhanced accuracy with each genomic platform\u2019s outputs.\nSecondary analysis software in the NVIDIA Parabricks suite of tools has accelerated these variant callers up to 80x. For example, germline HaplotypeCaller\u2019s runtime is reduced from 16 hours in a CPU-based environment to less than five minutes with GPU-accelerated Parabricks.\nAccelerating the Next Wave of Genomics\nNVIDIA is helping to enable the next wave of genomics by powering both short- and long-read sequencing platforms with accelerated AI base calling and variant calling. Industry leaders and startups are working with NVIDIA to push the boundaries of whole genome sequencing.\nFor example, biotech company PacBio recently announced the Revio system, a new long-read sequencing system featuring NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs. Enabled by a 20x increase in computing power relative to prior systems, Revio is designed to sequence human genomes with high-accuracy long reads at scale for under $1,000.\nOxford Nanopore Technologies offers the only single technology that can sequence any-length DNA or RNA fragments in real time. These features allow the rapid discovery of more genetic variation. Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital recently used the high-throughput nanopore sequencing instrument PromethION to understand a genetic disorder in the first few hours of a newborn\u2019s life.\nUltima Genomics is offering high-throughput whole genome sequencing at just $100 per sample, and Singular Genomics\u2019 G4 is the most powerful benchtop system.\nLearn More\nTo learn more about how AI and accelerated computing are unlocking insights and reducing costs in whole genome sequencing, download the Industry Brief: Accelerating the Next Wave of Genomics.\nNVIDIA Parabricks is free to download.

The automaker is shaping the future with its intelligent and software-defined vehicles, which are powered by NVIDIA\u2019s end-to-end solutions.\nThe Fleet of the Future\nNext-generation Mercedes-Benz vehicles will be built on a revolutionary centralized computing architecture that includes sophisticated software and features that will turn these future vehicles into high-performance, perpetually upgradable supercomputers on wheels.\nDuring the event, the automaker took the wraps off its new operating system, MB.OS, a purpose-built, chip-to-cloud architecture that will be standard across its entire vehicle portfolio \u2014 delivering exceptional software capabilities and ease of use.\nMB.OS benefits from full access to all vehicle domains, including infotainment, automated driving, body and comfort, driving and charging \u2014 an approach that allows Mercedes-Benz customers a differentiated, superior product experience.\n\u201cMB.OS is a platform that connects all parts of our business,\u201d K\u00e4llenius noted during the event.\nSafe Has Never Felt So Powerful\nAt the heart of this architecture is NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, which delivers high-performance, energy-efficient AI compute to support a comprehensive sensor suite and software to safely enable enhanced assisted driving and, ultimately, level 3 conditionally automated driving.\n\nRunning on DRIVE Orin is the flexible and scalable software stack jointly developed by NVIDIA and Mercedes-Benz. Sarah Tariq, NVIDIA vice president of autonomous driving software, joined Magnus \u00d6stberg, chief software officer at Mercedes-Benz, on stage to delve deeper into this full-stack software architecture, which includes the MB.OS, middleware and deep neural networks to enable advanced autonomy.\nTariq said, \u201cThe companies are working in close collaboration to develop a software stack that can comfortably and safely handle all the complexities that the automaker\u2019s customers may encounter during day-to-day commutes all over the world.\u201d\nThis includes enhanced level 2 features in urban environments where there are pedestrians or dense, complex traffic patterns. Using advanced AI, Mercedes-Benz can deliver a comfortable driving experience that consumers have come to expect, backed by uncompromised safety and security.\nWith the ability to perform 254 trillion operations per second, DRIVE Orin has ample compute headroom to continuously advance this software with new capabilities and subscription services over the life of the vehicle, through over-the-air software updates, via an app, web or from inside the car.\nAdditionally, Mercedes-Benz is accelerating the development of these systems with the high-fidelity NVIDIA DRIVE Sim platform, built on NVIDIA Omniverse. This cloud-native platform delivers physically based, scalable simulation for automakers to develop and test autonomous vehicle systems on a wide range of rare and hazardous scenarios.\nManufacturing in the Industrial Metaverse\nThis software-defined platform is just one piece of Mercedes-Benz intelligent vehicle strategy.\nAt CES last month, Mercedes-Benz previewed its first step in digitalization of its production process using NVIDIA Omniverse \u2014 a platform for building and operating metaverse applications \u2014 to plan and operate its manufacturing and assembly facilities.\nWith Omniverse, Mercedes-Benz can create an AI-enabled digital twin of the factory to review and optimize floor layouts, unlocking operational efficiencies. With enhanced predictive analysis, software and process automation, the digital twin can maximize productivity and help maintain faultless operation.\nBy implementing a digital-first approach to its operations, Mercedes-Benz can also ensure production activities won\u2019t be disrupted as new models and architectures are introduced. And this blueprint can be deployed to other areas within the automaker\u2019s global production network for scalable, more agile vehicle manufacturing.\n\nRevolutionizing the Customer Experience\nDigitalization is also improving the car-buying experience, migrating from physical retail showrooms to immersive online digital spaces.\nWith Omniverse, automakers can bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds, making the online car-research experience more realistic and interactive. These tools include online car configurators, 3D visualizations of vehicles, demonstration of cars in augmented reality and virtual test drives.\n\u00d6stberg summed up, \u201cThe partnership with NVIDIA is already living up to its promise, and the potential is huge.\u201d\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: Artificial Intelligence | Digital Twin | NVIDIA DRIVE | Omniverse \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The group reflected on how easy it was to collaborate in real time from different parts of the world.\n\nIt started in NVIDIA Omniverse, a hub to interconnect 3D workflows replacing linear pipelines with live-sync creation. The artists connected to the platform via Omniverse Cloud.\n\u201cSetting up the Omniverse Cloud collaboration demo was a super easy process,\u201d said award-winning 3D creator Rafi Nizam. \u201cIt was cool to see avatars appearing as people popped in, and the user interface makes it really clear when you\u2019re working in a live state.\u201d\nAssets were exported into Omniverse with ease, thanks to the Universal Scene Description format.\nFilmmaker Jae Solina, aka JSFILMZ, animated characters in Omniverse using Xsens and Unreal Engine.\n\u201cPrior to Omniverse, creating animations was such a hassle, let alone getting photorealistic animations,\u201d Solina said. \u201cInstead of having to reformat and upload files individually, everything is done in Omniverse in real time, leading to serious time saved.\u201d\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nvidia-studio-itns-wk43-clip2-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nJeremy Lightcap reflected on the incredible visual quality of the virtual scene, highlighting the seamless movement within the viewport.\nThe balloon 3D model was sculpted by hand in Gravity Sketch and imported into Omniverse.\n\u201cWe had three Houdini simulations, a volume database file storm cloud, three different characters with motion capture and a very dense Western town set with about 100 materials,\u201d Lightcap said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how many other programs could handle that and still give you instant, path-traced lighting results.\u201d\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nvidia-studio-itns-wk43-clip1-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nFor Ashley Goldstein, an NVIDIA 3D artist and tutorialist, the demo highlighted the versatility of Omniverse. \u201cI could update the scene and save it as a new USD layer, so when someone else opened it up, they had all of my updates immediately,\u201d she said. \u201cOr, if they were working on the scene at the same time, they\u2019d be instantly notified of the updates and could fetch new content.\u201d\nApplying colors and textures to the ballon in Adobe Substance 3D Painter.\nEdward McEvenue, aka edstudios, reflected on the immense value Omniverse on RTX hardware provides, displaying fully ray-traced graphics with instant feedback. \u201c3D production is a very iterative process, where you have to make hundreds if not thousands of small decisions along the way before finalizing a scene,\u201d he said. \u201cUsing GPU acceleration with RTX path tracing in the viewport makes that process so much easier, as you get near-instant feedback on the changes you\u2019re making, with all of the full-quality lighting, shadows, reflections, materials and post-production effects directly in the working viewport.\u201d\nEdits to the 3D model in Blender are reflected in real time with photorealistic detail in Omniverse.\n3D artist Shangyu Wang noted Omniverse is his preferred 3D collaborative content-creation platform. \u201cAutodesk\u2019s Unreal Live Link for Maya gave me a ray-traced, photorealistic preview of the scene in real time, no waiting to see the final render result,\u201d he said.\nFellow 3D artist Pekka Varis mentioned Omniverse\u2019s positive trajectory. \u201cNew features are coming in faster than I can keep up!\u201d he said. \u201cIt can become the main standard of the metaverse.\u201d\nOmniverse transcends location, time and apps, where collaboration, communication and creativity reign supreme.\nDownload Omniverse today, free for all NVIDIA and GeForce RTX GPU owners \u2014 including those with new GeForce RTX 40 Series laptops.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

Plus, more than 6,000 companies \u2014 a third of which are startups \u2014 have integrated the platform with their products.\nThese milestones and more will be celebrated during the NVIDIA Jetson Edge AI Developer Days at GTC, a global conference for the era of AI and the metaverse, taking place online March 20-23.\nRegister free to learn more about the Jetson platform and begin developing the next generation of edge AI and robotics.\nOne in a Million\nAtlanta-based Kris Kersey, the mind behind the popular YouTube channel Kersey Fabrications, is one developer using the NVIDIA Jetson platform for his one-in-a-million technological innovations.\nHe created a fully functional Iron Man helmet that could be straight out of the Marvel Comics films. It uses the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX 8GB developer kit as the core of the \u201cArc Reactor\u201d powering its heads-up display \u2014 a transparent display that presents information wherever the user\u2019s looking.\nIn just over two years, Kersey built from scratch the wearable helmet, complete with object detection and other on-screen sensors that would make Tony Stark proud.\n\u201cThe software design was more than half the work on the project, and for me, this is the most exciting, interesting part,\u201d Kersey said. \u201cThe software takes all of the discrete hardware components and makes them into a remarkable system.\u201d\nTo get started, Kersey turned to GitHub where he found \u201cHello AI World,\u201d a guide for deploying deep-learning inference networks and deep vision primitives with the NVIDIA TensorRT software development kit and NVIDIA Jetson. He then wrote a wrapper code to connect his own project.\nWatch Kersey document his Iron Man project from start to finish:\n\nThis 3D-printed helmet is just the beginning for Kersey, who\u2019s aiming to build a full Iron Man suit later this year. He plans to make the entire project\u2019s code open source, so anyone who dreams of becoming a superhero can try it for themselves.\nJetson Edge AI Developer Days at GTC\nDevelopers like Kersey can register for the free Jetson Edge AI Developer Days at GTC, which feature NVIDIA experts who\u2019ll cover the latest Jetson hardware, software and partners.

It imploded to half the thickness of a hair. For 100 trillionths of a second, we produced ten petawatts of power. It was the brightest thing in the solar system.\u201d\nAI Helps Call the Shots\nA week before the experiment, Spears\u2019 team analyzed its precision HPC design, then predicted the result with AI. Two atoms would fuse into one, releasing energy in a process simply called ignition.\nIt was the most exciting of thousands of AI predictions in what\u2019s become the two-step dance of modern science. Teams design experiments in HPC simulations, then use data from the actual results to train AI models that refine the next simulation.\nAI uncovers details about the experiments hard for humans to see. For example, it tracked the impact of minute imperfections in the imploding capsule researchers blasted with 192 lasers to achieve fusion.\nA look inside the fusion experiment. Graphic courtesy of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.\n\u201cYou need AI to understand the complete picture,\u201d Spears said.\nIt\u2019s a big canvas, filled with math describing the complex details of atomic physics.\nA single experiment can require hundreds of thousands of relatively small simulations. Each takes a half day on a single node of a supercomputer.\nThe largest 3D simulations \u2014 called the kitchen sinks \u2014 consume about half of Sierra, the world\u2019s sixth fastest HPC system, packing 17,280 NVIDIA GPUs.\nEdge AI Guides Experiments\nAI also helps scientists create self-driving experiments. Neural networks can make split-second decisions about which way to take an experiment based on results they process in real time.\nFor example, Spears, his colleagues and NVIDIA collaborated on an AI-guided experiment last year that fired lasers up to three times a second. It created the kind of proton beams that could someday treat a cancer patient.\n\u201cIn the course of a day, you can get the kind of bright beam that may have taken you months or years of human-designed experiments,\u201d Spears said. \u201cThis approach of AI at the edge will save orders of magnitude of time for our subject-matter experts.\u201d\nDirecting lasers fired many times a second will also be a key job inside tomorrow\u2019s nuclear fusion reactors.\nNavigating the Data Deluge\nAI\u2019s impacts will be felt broadly across both scientific and industrial fields, Spears believes.\n\u201cOver the last decade we\u2019ve produced more simulation and experimental data than we\u2019re trained to deal with,\u201d he said.\nThat deluge, once a burden for scientists, is now fuel for machine learning.\n\u201cAI is putting scientists back in the driver seat so we can move much more quickly,\u201d he said.\nSpears explained the ignition result in an interview (starting 8:19) with Government Matters.\nSpears also directs an AI initiative at the lab that depends on collaborations with companies including NVIDIA.\n\u201cNVIDIA helps us look over the horizon, so we can take the next step in using AI for science,\u201d he said\nA Brighter Future\nIt\u2019s hard work with huge impacts, like leaving a more resilient planet for the next generation.\nAsked whether his two daughters plan a career in science, Spears beams. They\u2019re both competitive swimmers who play jazz trumpet with interests in everything from bioengineering to art.\n\u201cAs we say in science, they\u2019re four pi, they cover the whole sky,\u201d he said.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Customer Stories | Hardware | High-Performance Computing | HPC Stories | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | Science | Simulation and Design | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Alongside the 4060, the mainstream Ada Lovelace lineup will also include the RTX 4070, which is rumored to debut in April. The RTX 4060 is expected to be the fifth card in the RTX 4000 lineup after the RTX 4070, 4070 Ti, 4080, and 4090. \nWhile not much was known about the RTX 4060 until now, a leak has offered gamers an understanding about what to expect from the upcoming graphics card. According to prolific hardware leaker Kopite7kimi, the RTX 4060 will be based on the smallest Ada Lovelace GPU \u2014 the AD107. The mobile version of the RTX 4060 is also based on the same GPU, and both will come with the full 3072 CUDA cores. In addition, the desktop version of the card will also ship with 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM at 18Gbps. Curiously, this will be lower than the amount of VRAM in the RTX 3060 that ships with 12GB of memory.\nRelated: Leaked Specs Reveal NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Ti Will Be An Absolute Beast \n                        NVIDIA RTX 4060 Specifications\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decreased VRAM could be a cause for concern, given the increasing appetite for memory in modern games. As for the rest of the tech specs, the upcoming card will have an estimated power consumption of 115W, as well as 24MB of L2 cache. If the rumored specs turn out to be accurate, the desktop version of the RTX 4060 will be similar to its laptop counterpart in more ways than one, as both the shader count and the power draw will be identical in the two cards.\nAs things stand, the only differences between the two could be the memory clock and the memory bus. In the first case, the mobile 4060 has 16Gbps memory, which is slower than the rumored 18Gbps for the desktop version. Secondly, the 24MB of L2 cache suggests only a 96-bit memory bus, which would be lower than the 128-bit bus in the laptop version. It's not immediately clear if the discrepancy suggests an error in the leaked spec sheet or if NVIDIA will indeed launch the desktop version with lower memory bus than the laptop variant.\nEither way, the RTX 4060 is expected to be one of the mainstays in NVIDIA's RTX 4000 lineup, as it's likely to be priced in a sweet spot that should make it desirable for most mainstream gamers. It doesn't have a release date yet, but will likely launch after the RTX 4070 debuts in April. Meanwhile, the mobile RTX 4060 is releasing in late Feb., so it will be interesting to see how long the company will take to launch the desktop version of the card.\nMore: This Was The Most Searched-For GPU In 2022, And It's Not The RTX 4090\nSource: Kopite7kimi/Twitter \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nGPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat To Expect From Apple's Rumored iPhone 16 Ultra\n\t\t\n\n\niPhone\n\nApple is tipped to introduce an iPhone 'Ultra' model in 2024.

If the applied overclock is stable under load, the scanner continues to push the clock speeds even further until the GPU fails to maintain stability. At that point, the last known frequency will be applied as the maximum Boost Clock of your GPU, thereby tuning the overall profile.\nNow, one of the major advantages of using Nvidia's Automatic Tuning program is its reliance on the GPU Boost 4.0 algorithm. Instead of making any adjustments to the entire core clock offset, the scanning algorithm will increase the clock speeds of your GPU based on pre-defined voltage levels. Doing so allows the GPU to run at a much higher Boost Clock, even when you hit its maximum Temperature or Power limit. \n                        Which Nvidia GPUs Are Compatible With Nvidia Automatic Tuning?\n               \nUnlike popular GPU overclocking tools, the GeForce Experience Performance Tuning program is somewhat limited in its capabilities. For starters, Nvidia's automatic tuning feature is currently supported on all RTX-40, 30, 20, and GTX-16 Series GPUs, meaning that older Pascall and Maxwell-based cards might lose out on its functionalities.\nFurthermore, users with an NVLink or SLI setup can only take advantage of their primary graphics card, as this program lacks a multi-GPU overclocking solution. \n                        How to Enable Automatic Performance Tuning in Nvidia GeForce Experience\n               \nIf you have a compatible Nvidia GPU, here's how you enable the Automatic Tuning feature in GeForce Experience. \n\n                                        Before you get started, ensure that the latest version of GeForce Experience, along with the current Game Ready Driver, has been installed on your PC.\n                        \n\n                                        Open the GeForce Experience app and head over to Settings by clicking on the Gear icon next to your profile.\n                                            \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        Inside the General tab, check whether In-Game Overlay has been enabled.

However, as soon as it finishes overclocking your GPU, look at the Last scan result for any noticeable improvement in core and memory frequencies.\n                                            \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you aren't satisfied with the applied overclock, set the sliders for Power Maximum and Temperature Target all the way to the right and re-run the tuning process. Upon completion, it is recommended that you stress test your GPU with synthetic benchmarks like MSI Kombustor and Furmark to check for any stability issues under a heavy workload. \n                        Does Nvidia's Automatic Tuning Boost Your GPU?\n               \nIn our testing with a ZOTAC GAMING GeForce RTX 3060 Twin Edge GPU, we found an overall increase of 151MHz on the core clock and an additional 200MHz on the memory clock, which translates to roughly 9% improvement in its boost frequency. For comparison, we also performed a manual overclock on the same GPU with MSI Afterburner and were able to push the clock speeds further, by about +200Mhz on the core and a more reasonable +500Mhz on the memory.\nTo demonstrate just how convenient Nvidia's Automatic Tuning tool is for a straightforward, one-click overclock, we decided to evaluate the performance of both utilities in a variety of in-game and synthetic benchmarks. Our test setup includes an Intel Core i5-12400F, 16GB (2x8) of Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4-3600 RAM, and the exact same GPU configuration running on a fresh install of Windows 10 version 22H2. \n\n\n\n\nSynthetic Benchmarks/Games\n\n\nStock Performance\n\n\nGeForce Experience (Automatic Performance Tuning)\n\n\nMSI Afterburner (Manual Overclock)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNIGINE Heaven Benchmark (Extreme, DX11)\n\n\n98FPS\n\n\n105FPS\n\n\n109FPS\n\n\n\n\nUNIGINE Superposition Benchmark (Extreme, DX11)\n\n\n38FPS\n\n\n41FPS\n\n\n43FPS\n\n\n\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 (Favor Quality, Vulkan)\n\n\n69FPS\n\n\n74FPS\n\n\n78FPS\n\n\n\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider (Highest, DX12)\n\n\n118FPS\n\n\n123FPS\n\n\n131FPS\n\n\n\n\n\nIn UNIGINE's Heaven and Superposition benchmarks, the RTX 3060 achieved a slight performance boost of around 7-8% with automatic tuning enabled, whereas the margin rose to 12% when using MSI's overclocking utility. A similar performance improvement was also seen in Red Dead Redemption 2 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider's built-in benchmark, where both utilities were neck and neck in regards to average frame rates.\nBased on the test results, it is evident that the GeForce Experience Performance Tuning program takes a more conservative approach when it comes to GPU overclocking. Instead of pushing the core and memory frequencies to their absolute limits, the program adjusts your GPU's Voltage/Frequency curve, wherein higher clock speeds will be sustained under different voltage levels.\nAlthough it is possible to get a much higher performance boost with manual adjustments to the GPU clocks, there will always be a potential risk factor in damaging your hardware, especially when you exploit its thermal and power headroom. However, if you're willing to maximize GPU performance at all costs, check out our detailed guide on how to safely overclock your GPU using MSI Afterburner for more information. \n                        Get a Free Performance Boost With the GeForce Experience Automatic Tuning Tool\n               \nFor an integrated, one-click overclocking tool, the GeForce Experience Performance Tuning program offers excellent reliability, especially when you factor in the clock speed improvements and overall GPU stability. While it isn't as versatile as a dedicated overclocking utility, you should be able to get a free performance boost on your GPU without investing any additional time and effort in the manual tuning process. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology Explained\n\n\n\n\nGaming\n\n\n\n\nGraphics Card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support MakeUseOf.

But it\u2019s not all doom and gloom, especially if you ask Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. The head executive behind some of the best GPUs gave a lecture at Berkeley, where a student asked for his opinion on the new AI technology. In his response, Jensen was optimistic about the technology, calling it a \u201cvery, very big deal,\u201d calling it essentially the \u201ciPhone of artificial intelligence\u201d. He explained its democratization of computing technology makes things like programming accessible to people without years of training or experience.The CEO also compared the technology to the invention of Javascript shortly after the introduction of web browsers, and how that resulted in a flood of new applications. Nvidia has talked about this kind of thing before, primarily when promoting new graphics cards like the RTX 4080, which gives users the kind of computing horsepower previously reserved for huge companies with supercomputers. Of course, this isn\u2019t too surprising given Nvidia\u2019s keen focus on AI over the last decade or so. After all, one of the company\u2019s headline features for its recent GPUs is DLSS, which in itself is a form of AI. The technology, which can be found even in affordable hardware like the RTX 4070 Ti, uses an AI algorithm powered by Tensor Cores to upscale lower resolution images to a higher res, boosting performance, sometimes exponentially. Only time will tell if this does result in certain technologies being more accessible or if it ends up a tool only the largest corporations can access. But with how powerful the best gaming PCs are getting these days, it won\u2019t be too long before consumers are able to take advantage of AI-turbocharged applications like ChatGPT in a big way.

To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.SubscribeThe new age of computingThe biggest names in computing have, at least in some form, been working AI solutions into more or less every product released over the last few years. Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa and even Apple\u2019s Siri all work by using the same kind of machine learning tech as ChatGPT, the difference is the scale. ChatGPT was essentially trained by using a huge swath of data to be able to generate things like art, poetry and even articles. The only real thing holding it back from taking over every industry on the planet is its inability to generate new ideas. As amazing as this technology is, it\u2019s only just a tool, and isn\u2019t even a \u201ctrue\u201d AI.What\u2019s really holding the tech from reaching that point is the sheer amount of compute power required to train even a relatively minor model like ChatGPT. In an essay for TechMonitor, Ryan Morrison reported that even if the GPUs that power AI models like this get way more powerful, the interconnects that let multiple GPUs work together are far too slow for the technology to become a true AI. Because it may take you just a few seconds to type in a prompt into ChatGPT and have it spit out an answer, but in order for the program to get to that point it requires days, weeks or even months to train the AI to do that. We are years away from these kinds of tools replacing programmers, writers and artists in any meaningful way. But, as a tool AI has untold potential for good. The ability for the technology to help people with disabilities is one of the areas that isn\u2019t being talked about enough, for instance. Realistically, we\u2019re still in the early days when it comes to AI, and only time will tell if we reach the point of a true AI within our lifetimes. One thing\u2019s for sure, though: the technology isn\u2019t going anywhere. It\u2019s been here for years already and is only going to grow and diversify from here. And honestly I share Jensen Huang\u2019s optimism for the technology. It\u2019s time to seize the means of production anyways, now we potentially have the ability to do so with a graphics card.

It\u2019s a PC sitting in a Dallas data center with an NVIDIA 4080 GPU. That\u2019s the data center my Mac connects to when I log into GeForce NOW Ultimate, the top tier of NVIDIA\u2019s videogame streaming service. NVIDIA has data centers like it across the US and in Europe, streaming the latest, most demanding titles to a wide range of devices, including the Mac.\nGeForce NOW is a technological marvel that turns traditional computing expectations on their head, offering Mac users a world where your Internet connection and display are more important than the computing power of the device on which a game is played. For Mac users, GeForce NOW is an opportunity to finally play the most advanced games available on the computer they love, which is exciting. However, for Apple, which has begun to market Macs as capable of playing modern games, GeForce NOW and services like it may end its AAA gaming ambitions before they leave the gate.\n\nThe State of Gaming on the Mac\nLast week, Apple held an invitation-only press event to show off games coming to its platforms. Based on reports, the event featured a mix of five titles that, with the exception of one previously-released title, are expected to be released later this year.\nOf those, the game that caught my eye was The Medium, a PC and console game that\u2019s coming to Apple silicon Macs later this year, taking advantage of the latest Metal frameworks. What struck me about The Medium is its similarity to another 2021 title that Apple has showcased several times since last summer: Resident Evil Village.\n\nAt WWDC last year, Apple dedicated a section of its keynote presentation to gaming on the Mac. The message delivered was clear. The power of Apple silicon and Apple\u2019s new Metal 3 framework, plus the popularity of the Mac and other devices, is an opportunity for developers. To emphasize the point, the company announced that three games would be coming to the Mac by the end of 2022:\nNo Man\u2019s Sky\nResident Evil: Village\nGRID Legends\nResident Evil Village was announced during WWDC 2022.\nI was initially excited by the news at WWDC. The Mac has been a part of Apple\u2019s Arcade service since the start, but the games announced at WWDC were traditional AAA console and PC titles, a rarity on the Mac. It felt as though Apple silicon might open the Mac to the high end of the videogame market.\nApple has a firm foothold in mobile gaming and family-friendly Mac and Apple TV titles, but AAA games are almost nonexistent.\nHowever, in the months since, my enthusiasm for Apple\u2019s rekindled interest in Mac gaming has waned a bit. Of the three games announced at WWDC, only Resident Evil: Village debuted before the end of the year. No Man\u2019s Sky and GRID Legends are now expected in 2023, and neither has a specific release date.\nNo Man\u2019s Sky was originally set to release in 2022.\nBut my skepticism has been fueled by more than a couple of delayed games. There\u2019s still a lot that needs to fall into place before the Mac is a meaningful alternative to a gaming PC.\nFirst, there\u2019s the cost factor. Digital Foundry ran a series of tests comparing a fully-loaded $8,000 Mac Studio with an M1 Mac Ultra SoC to a desktop PC with an RTX 3090 GPU. Although they came away impressed by the M1 Ultra\u2019s performance, Digital Foundry concluded:\n\n  For PC users, however, I don\u2019t think this particular Apple system should be particularly tempting. While CPU performance is in line with the best from Intel and AMD, GPU performance is somewhat less compelling.\n\nThe other issue Digital Foundry had was finding modern games available on both the Mac and PC to compare. Since then, Resident Evil Village has been released on the Mac, but that\u2019s it, as far as I can tell. Even if Apple\u2019s latest GPUs were more compelling, the anemic library of games would still be a problem.\nDigital Foundry\u2019s findings are echoed in Monica Chin\u2019s January review of the M2 MacBook Pro for The Verge:\n\n  I think \u2014 put the pitchforks away, I know these are totally different things and there are all sorts of problems with this comparison \u2014 that the simplest way to think of the MacBook Pro with M2 Max is as the addition of an RTX 3070 GPU. It\u2019s not\u00a0quite\u00a0providing the frame rates that we\u2019ve seen from the biggest RTX 3070 computers out there (MSI\u2019s GS76\u00a0gave us 114fps, for example) but it\u2019s not too far off, and it\u2019s well above what we\u2019d expect to see from an\u00a0RTX 3060 gaming machine. The M2 Pro Mac Mini, which only put up 62fps on\u00a0Tomb Raider, is closer to\u00a0RTX 3050\u00a0territory.\n\nAt $4,300, that MacBook Pro Chin reviewed is nearly double the price of the MSI GS76 that it nearly beat.\nApple silicon is a new beast that, along with Metal 3, requires game developers to do more work to bring their games to the Mac.\nAnother issue is Apple\u2019s chip architecture and graphics frameworks. In an interview with TechCrunch, Apple\u2019s vice president of Platform Architecture and Hardware Technologies Tom Millet said:\n\n  Game developers have never seen 96 gigabytes of graphics memory available to them now, on the M2 Max. I think they\u2019re trying to get their heads around it, because the possibilities are unusual. They\u2019re used to working in much smaller footprints of video memory. So I think that\u2019s another place where we\u2019re going to have an interesting opportunity to inspire developers to go beyond what they\u2019ve been able to do before.\n\nI have no doubt that there are interesting things game developers could do with a big pool of unified memory, but it\u2019s also part of the problem. Apple silicon\u2019s unique architecture requires developers to get on board with a brand new development approach.\nThe M2 Max MacBook Pros have potential as gaming laptops if developers adapt their games for the system.\nMoreover, the 96\u00a0GB of memory Millet described is part of the M2 Max SoC found in the latest MacBook Pro. That\u2019s a powerful system, but certainly not the Mac most users buy today. It\u2019s going to be a while before that sort of power trickles down to the MacBook Air and iMac. In the meantime, the hardware demands of modern games will continue to march ahead.\nSo, if you\u2019re a Mac user and want to play the latest PC games today, what do you do? The obvious answer is \u2018buy a Windows PC.\u2019 That\u2019s a perfectly valid solution and one I\u2019ve considered many times myself. However, what\u2019s stopped me from getting a PC and kept me looking for another solution is that I really don\u2019t have a place for or the energy to add a computer dedicated to gaming to my life. Maybe that will change in the future, but it\u2019s a bridge I haven\u2019t been willing to cross yet.\nNVIDIA GeForce NOW\nGeForce NOW\u2019s Mac app.\nThat\u2019s what led me to GeForce NOW, NVIDIA\u2019s game streaming service. I\u2019ve streamed games locally on my WiFi network, over the Internet using Xbox Cloud Gaming, and have followed NVIDIA\u2019s service for a while, but what tipped the balance was Valve\u2019s Steam Deck.\nI got a Steam Deck last fall and, over the past several months, have begun building a library of modern games. I love that the Steam Deck makes games that you\u2019d normally have to play in front of a computer or TV available on a handheld device. However, the Steam Deck also left me wishing I could play the games in my library on whatever screen I had available. With GeForce NOW Ultimate, my wish has become a reality.\nThe Steam Deck is what pushed me toward GeForce NOW intially. Source: Valve.\nGeForce NOW is a little different from other videogame streaming services you may have tried. First, it doesn\u2019t have a built-in store. GeForce NOW is just a streaming service that works with other third-party online stores, including Steam, Epic Games, Ubisoft, and Gog.com. Not every game in those stores is available via GeForce NOW, but new games are added every week. The current roster of games exceeds 1,500 titles, and just yesterday, the company announced a 10-year partnership with Microsoft to bring Xbox PC games to GeForce NOW. The service offers a free tier that\u2019s limited to one-hour gaming sessions, a Priority Tier that ups the session limit to six hours at 1080p and 60fps for $9.99/month, and Ultimate with eight-hour sessions, 4K resolution, and 120fps for $19.99/month.\nJust as my Steam library had begun to grow, and I started to feel confined by the Steam Deck, NVIDIA announced at CES that it was rolling out its 4080 GPU to the servers in its data centers that power the Ultimate tier of its service:\n\n  With GeForce RTX 4080 performance, Ultimate members will be the first to experience true PC gaming \u2014 streaming at up to 240 frames per second from the cloud with full ray tracing and DLSS 3, in hit games like Portal With RTX. With the addition of NVIDIA Reflex, GeForce NOW achieves click-to-pixel latency below 40 milliseconds \u2014 another first in cloud gaming.\n\nThe final piece fell into place earlier this month when I saw that AT&T was offering six months of GeForce NOW Ultimate for free to its unlimited 5G mobile customers, which includes me. I jumped on the deal and began playing my library of games on every screen I have.\nGeForce NOW works with Safari for iPhone and iPad, Macs, Android devices, Windows PCs, Chrome OS, Shield, Android TV, and some smart TVs. What makes that wide range of compatible devices possible is the fact that the speed of their CPUs and GPUs isn\u2019t that important. The computing is handled in NVIDIA\u2019s data centers. Instead, your GeForce NOW experience is dictated first and foremost by the quality of the screen you use and your Internet connection. That takes some getting used to because it turns so many long-held expectations on their head.\nFor example, I went into testing GeForce NOW, expecting that my Mac Studio would outperform my M1 MacBook Air. However, the differences were negligible when both were connected to the Internet with an Ethernet cable. Instead of chip speeds and memory constraints, the limitations on streaming to my Mac have been wired versus WiFi and things like display refresh rates and whether they support standards like HDR. Other devices have different limitations, too, but the flexibility to use either of my Macs interchangeably has been a nice plus that I didn\u2019t consider initially. For a complete list of system requirements and supported resolutions, be sure to check out NVIDIA\u2019s website.\nAs nice as game streaming\u2019s hardware independence is, though, it comes with one big downside. You need a fast, reliable Internet connection above all else, which can be expensive or completely unavailable depending where you live. NVIDIA has done impressive work with compression to reduce the bandwidth needs of GeForce NOW, but the top combination of resolution and frame rate requires at least a 45\u00a0Mbps connection, which is not an option for everyone.\nAs between my two Macs, by far, my favorite way to stream has been on the Mac Studio because it\u2019s got a dedicated 2\u00a0Gbps wired Internet connection and is connected to the Studio Display, which is the best display I own. The Studio Display is limited to a 60\u00a0Hz refresh rate and doesn\u2019t support HDR, but even though GeForce NOW supports higher refresh rates and HDR, games look gorgeous on the Studio Display. And thanks to the RTX 4080 running in NVIDIA\u2019s data center, I can run games like Cyberpunk 2077 at the highest graphics settings and still play at 60 fps.\nCyberpunk 2077 running on my Mac Studio.\nCyberpunk 2077 is a good game to showcase what GeForce NOW can do because it\u2019s a relatively recent, demanding title that supports ray tracing. With the graphics and video settings set to the highest levels possible, you can see from the stats in the screenshots that the game runs consistently at 60 fps, the limit of the Studio Display, even though it was running around 90 fps in the data center. A higher local refresh rate would be nice, but the level of detail and vibrancy of the colors are nonetheless a treat compared to playing handheld on the Steam Deck.\nSet to Ray Tracing Ultra, Cyberpunk\u2019s neon skyline looks amazing on the Studio Display.\nThe other game I\u2019ve been playing for these tests is Shadow of the Tomb Raider. The game is nearly five years old at this point, but it still looks great and happens to be one of the few PC games available on both the Mac App Store and Steam. Before Resident Evil Village, Shadow of the Tomb Raider was the game that Apple regularly demoed to show off the Mac\u2019s gaming graphics.\nShadow of the Tomb Raider running via GeForce NOW.\nI started by turning up the settings as far as I could on Shadow of the Tomb Raider. As with Cyberpunk, the limiter was my screen, not the game. Using GeForce NOW Ultimate, Shadow of the Tomb Raider ran consistently at 60 fps locally and much higher in NVIDIA\u2019s data center.\nThe Mac App Store version of Shadow of the Tomb Raider.\nIn contrast, the Mac App Store version of Shadow of the Tomb Raider struggled to maintain 50 fps in some scenes. The game hasn\u2019t been optimized for Apple silicon, which means it\u2019s running in Rosetta 2, so the comparison to the Steam version of the game isn\u2019t apples to apples. Still, I think it\u2019s a fair comparison given that I don\u2019t believe any AAA titles are currently available on the Mac and optimized for Apple silicon other than Resident Evil Village.\nCyberpunk 2077 synced with my office lights using the Hue Sync app.\nI\u2019ve spent the lion\u2019s share of my time streaming games via GeForce NOW to my Mac Studio because the Studio Display is my best screen. Plus with Hue Sync, I can sync my office lights to with whatever game I\u2019m playing. In my limited time streaming to my MacBook Air, though, the experience with GeForce NOW has been comparable to my desktop Mac. Even though the laptop has a slower Ethernet port, Cyberpunk 2077 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider held up well. Both were solid when I switched to WiFi too.\nIt\u2019s worth noting, though, that WiFi can be tricky with GeForce NOW. I\u2019ve got Linksys Atlas WiFi 6E routers in my house, but I\u2019ve found that having a consistent signal is just as important as speed. My original WiFi setup wasn\u2019t ideal. The WiFi worked fine for every other task I threw at it, but I occasionally saw significant frame rate drops when I first tried GeForce NOW on a WiFi connection. I tweaked the location of my routers, which eliminated the dips in wireless speeds, fixing the problem.\nBrowsing GeForce NOW-compatible games in its Mac app.\nAs for other devices, I don\u2019t plan to play much using my iPhone, at least when I\u2019m home and have my Steam Deck nearby. Still, it\u2019s nice to have the option since the iPhone is a significantly smaller package to take with you than a Steam Deck. The iPad Pro is a great option too. With its 12.9-inch display and high-capacity battery, it\u2019s been an excellent way to play games in a wide variety of places around our house.\nGeForce NOW works well streamed to an iPad, but the resolution is capped because Apple restricts game streaming to Safari.\nThe biggest downside to using GeForce NOW with an iPhone or iPad is that you\u2019re capped at 1080p resolution. As with Xbox Game Pass, GeForce NOW has to run as a web app using Safari, and as I understand it, the resolution cap is a limitation of the browser. It\u2019s also a limitation that\u2019s entirely of Apple\u2019s own making.\nIn 2020, while Microsoft was testing its Xbox Cloud Gaming service, Apple made it clear that game streaming services weren\u2019t welcome in the App Store. In a statement to Business Insider an Apple spokesperson said:\n\n  The App Store was created to be a safe and trusted place for customers to discover and download apps, and a great business opportunity for all developers. Before they go on our store, all apps are reviewed against the same set of guidelines that are intended to protect customers and provide a fair and level playing field to developers.\n  Our customers enjoy great apps and games from millions of developers, and gaming services can absolutely launch on the App Store as long as they follow the same set of guidelines applicable to all developers, including submitting games individually for review, and appearing in charts and search. In addition to the App Store, developers can choose to reach all iPhone and iPad users over the web through Safari and other browsers on the App Store.\n\nThat\u2019s why if you want to stream a game from Xbox Cloud Gaming or GeForce NOW, you have to do so through a browser, which works, but would be a better experience if Microsoft and NVIDIA could offer a native app, which NVIDIA does on the Mac, where there aren\u2019t the same sort of restricitons.\nCyberpunk 2077 streaming to an iPhone in 1080p.\nAbout the only silver lining here is that on smaller screens like the iPhone, the lower resolution is less noticeable, and games stream better over a slower mobile network connection. However, that doesn\u2019t excuse forcing an inferior experience on users. The restrictions on game streaming have attracted the attention of the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authorities and others. It\u2019s unclear whether regulartory pressure will result in changes, but Mark Gurman has reported for Bloomberg that Apple is preparing to permit third-party app stores and app side-loading, which would be boon to game streaming.\nLoading a GeForce NOW game on the Mac.\nThe only other device I\u2019ve used to play games with GeForce NOW is directly on my TV. There\u2019s a GeForce NOW app for recent LG and Samsung TVs. LG TVs like mine are limited to 1080p, but Samsung TVs support 4K. I don\u2019t expect I\u2019ll play many games this way. Running apps from LG\u2019s webOS is clunky, requiring a trip through the settings to pair a controller and then poking around the GeForce NOW app using LG\u2019s remote control. There\u2019s just enough friction there that if I\u2019m sitting down in front of my TV to play a game, I\u2019ll reach for an Xbox for PS5 controller instead.\nAfter a few weeks with GeForce NOW, I love this service. At $20/month, the Ultimate tier isn\u2019t cheap, but the math is a lot easier to swallow when the alternative is buying a dedicated gaming PC for $3,000-4,000.\nGeForce NOW\u2019s current data centers with RTX 4080 GPUs. Source: NVIDIA.\nPlaying on a PC in your home still has its advantages over streaming, but the fact that a game like Cyberpunk is even playable over a streaming connection is remarkable. NVIDIA is in the midst of working on East Coast data centers that aren\u2019t that far from where I live, which I\u2019m sure will become my default connection. However, the fact that I can connect to a server in Dallas, Texas, 1,000 miles away, and my most demanding games are playable is astounding.\nApple silicon is a marvel in its own right. Most of my day is spent working on my Mac Studio, which barely breaks a sweat, no matter what I throw at it. It sits quietly on my desk, sipping electricity and throwing off barely any heat. That\u2019s a far cry better than my fully-spec\u2019d Intel-baed 2018 Mac mini, which now sits in a closet as a server making noise and warming the closet, so that it\u2019s often the warmest spot in our house.\nResident Evil Village is a good start, but the Mac has a long way to go before it\u2019s on par with PCs and consoles.\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Apple silicon has ushered in a new era of computing on the Mac. Still, PC gaming remains an open question that one Metal 3-optimized game can\u2019t answer. The hardware appears headed in the right direction, but by now, there were supposed to be at least two other games available. That\u2019s not a good sign, and it makes me wonder how things will go with The Medium, a notoriously resource-hungry game that PCs with the RTX 3090 GPU couldn\u2019t run at 1080p and 60 fps when it debuted in 2021.\nThe Mac may get there, but top tier titles are already available thanks to streaming.\nEven though my optimism for gaming on the Mac has been supplanted by skepticism, I hope Apple will get there. It shouldn\u2019t be necessary to buy a second computer or consider alternative solutions to enjoy the most technically demanding games. From my time with Resident Evil Village, the hardware has the potential, and the macOS frameworks are getting there. A critical mass of AAA games could drive demand for Apple\u2019s top-end Macs, too, but that will require developer adoption, which, so far, has been thin.\nUltimately, though, whether all the pieces fall into place for the Mac to become the sort of gaming platform that Apple seems to want it to be may be beside the point. Real-time videogame streaming is here, it\u2019s expanding, and 4K, high frame rate, ray-traced games are available today on the Mac and every other screen you have with GeForce NOW Ultimate. By the time locally playable, native Mac games catch up to where GeForce NOW is today, Mac gamers may have already moved on, embracing the world of streaming.\n\n\nTags: Apple Silicon, games, mac \n\nJoinAccess Extra Content and PerksFounded in 2015, Club MacStories has delivered exclusive content every week for nearly a decade.\nWhat started with weekly and monthly email newsletters has blossomed into a family of memberships designed every MacStories fan.\nLearn more here and from our Club FAQs.\nClub MacStories: Weekly and monthly newsletters via email and the web that are brimming with apps, tips, automation workflows, longform writing, early access to the MacStories Unwind podcast, periodic giveaways, and more;\nClub MacStories+: Everything that Club MacStories offers, plus an active Discord community, advanced search and custom RSS features for exploring the Club\u2019s entire back catalog, bonus columns, and dozens of app discounts;\nClub Premier: All of the above and AppStories+, an extended version of our flagship podcast that\u2019s delivered early, ad-free, and in high-bitrate audio.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Voorhees\nJohn is MacStories\u2019 Managing Editor, has been writing about Apple and apps since joining the team in 2015, and today, runs the site alongside Federico.\nJohn also co-hosts four MacStories podcasts: AppStories, which covers the world of apps, MacStories Unwind, which explores the fun differences between American and Italian culture and recommends media to listeners, Ruminate, a show about the weird web and unusual snacks, and NPC: Next Portable Console, a show about the games we take with us.\n\n\n\n\n@[email\u00a0protected]\n\n\n\n\n@johnvoorhees.macstories.net\n\n\n\n[email\u00a0protected]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT\nMEMBERSHIP\nSPONSORSHIP\nPRIVACY POLICY\nTERMS OF SERVICE\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCode by Alessandro Vendruscolo | Design by Silvia Gatta | Hosted by MacStadium | Acknowledgements\nCopyright 2025 MacStories, Inc.
