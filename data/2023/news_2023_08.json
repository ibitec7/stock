by Colette Kress, NVIDIA\u2019s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at https://investor.nvidia.com.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\r\nNVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its second quarter fiscal 2024 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA\u2019s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA\u2019s conference call to discuss its financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2024.\nNon-GAAP Measures\r\nTo supplement NVIDIA\u2019s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA\u2019s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude acquisition termination costs, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, IP-related costs, legal settlement costs, contributions, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user\u2019s overall understanding of the company\u2019s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company\u2019s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company\u2019s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n\u00a0\nNVIDIA CORPORATION\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\r\n(In

Following a blowout earnings report for the second quarter, investment firm Rosenblatt liked what it saw. Subsequently, analysts there raised their price target of NVDA stock to $1,100 from $800, raising questions on Wall Street.\nAlthough such a forecast would imply a more than doubling of Nvidia shares\u2019 present price tag, it\u2019s important to consider just how impressive the Q2 print was. According to a CNBC report, the tech giant posted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.70, easily beating the consensus EPS target of $2.09. On the top line, Nvidia rang up $13.51 billion in revenue, also handily beating the consensus target of $11.22 billion.\nFurther, net income jumped to $6.19 billion, up sharply from the $656 million posted in the year-ago quarter. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, Nvidia\u2019s revenue guidance for the current quarter implies 170% year-over-year growth.\nSubsequently, Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosemann labeled the underlying artificial intelligence growth story as \u201cthe mother of all cycles.\u201d\nWith more companies and industries turning to AI for various efficiency solutions, the GPUs that undergird digital intelligence will likely be in extremely high demand. Thus, Mosemann labels NVDA stock as Rosenblatt\u2019s top conviction idea.\n\nCould NVDA Stock Really Hit Such a Lofty Target?\nAlthough few question the viability of NVDA stock, the stratospheric forecast raises questions. Predominantly, data from Yahoo Finance reveals that shares trade at a trailing earnings multiple of 245.4x and a forward multiple of 60.24x. Both stats ping at an incredibly high level compared to the underlying semiconductor industry.\nHowever, NVDA stock has continued to swing higher based on two main factors: one, the company continues to beat lofty expectations and two, demand for generative AI applications has only increased. As CNBC pointed out, \u201cNvidia\u2019s A100 and H100 AI chips are needed to build and run AI applications like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and other services that take simple text queries and respond with conversational answers or images.\u201d\nWhile an $1,100 price target for NVDA stock seems awfully aggressive, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang brought clarity to the thesis. During the Q2 call with analysts, Huang stated the following:\n\u201cThe world has something along the lines of about a trillion dollars worth of data centers installed, in the cloud, enterprise and otherwise. That trillion dollars of data centers is in the process of transitioning into accelerated computing and generative AI.\u201d\nTo be sure, with NVDA stock already up almost 240% since the start of the year, another doubling could take a while. Still, $1,100 may not be an unreasonable target given the extraordinary relevancies.\nWhy It Matters\nPresently, TipRanks notes that NVDA stock carries a strong buy consensus view. This assessment breaks down as 39 buys, one hold and zero sells. Further, the analysts\u2019 average price target lands at $617.98, implying nearly 28% upside potential.\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2023/08/nvda-stock-price-prediction-is-nvidia-worth-1100-after-q2-earnings/.\n\u00a92025 InvestorPlace Media, LLC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored Headlines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMore from InvestorPlace\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHot Stocks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Top Stocks to Buy Under Trump Come From Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018BRAIN\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Luke Lango, InvestorPlace Senior Investment Analyst\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Danger that Could Derail Our Economy\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Jeff Remsburg, Contributing Editor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy Prediction Came True: Where to Find Opportunity Despite Market Unpredictability\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Eric Fry, Editor, Fry's Investment Report\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTop Stories\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFeb 8, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWolfpack Research Short Report Sends B.

You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website.  And with that, let me turn the call over to Colette. Colette Kress: Thanks, Simona. We had an exceptional quarter. Record Q2 revenue of $13.51 billion was up 88% sequentially and up 101% year-on-year, and above our outlook of $11 billion. Let me first start with Data Center. Record revenue of $10.32 billion was up 141% sequentially and up 171% year-on-year. Data Center compute revenue nearly tripled year-on-year, driven primarily by accelerating demand from cloud service providers and large consumer Internet companies for HGX platform, the engine of generative AI and large language models. Major companies, including AWS, Google Cloud, Meta, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud as well as a growing number of GPU cloud providers are deploying, in volume, HGX systems based on our Hopper and Ampere architecture Tensor Core GPUs. Networking revenue almost doubled year-on-year, driven by our end-to-end InfiniBand networking platform, the gold standard for AI.   Story Continues There is tremendous demand for NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI platforms. Our supply partners have been exceptional in ramping capacity to support our needs. Our data center supply chain, including HGX with 35,000 parts and highly complex networking has been built up over the past decade. We have also developed and qualified additional capacity and suppliers for key steps in the manufacturing process such as [indiscernible] packaging. We expect supply to increase each quarter through next year. By geography, data center growth was strongest in the U.S. as customers direct their capital investments to AI and accelerated computing. China demand was within the historical range of 20% to 25% of our Data Center revenue, including compute and networking solutions.At this time, let me take a moment to address recent reports on the potential for increased regulations on our exports to China. We believe the current regulation is achieving the intended results. Given the strength of demand for our products worldwide, we do not anticipate that additional export restrictions on our Data Center GPUs, if adopted, would have an immediate material impact to our financial results. However, over the long term, restrictions prohibiting the sale of our Data Center GPUs to China, if implemented, will result in a permanent loss and opportunity for the U.S. industry to compete and lead in one of the world's largest markets. Our cloud service providers drove exceptional strong demand for HGX systems in the quarter, as they undertake a generational transition to upgrade their data center infrastructure for the new era of accelerated computing and AI.The NVIDIA HGX platform is culminating of nearly two decades of full stack innovation across silicon, systems, interconnects, networking, software and algorithms. Instances powered by the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs are now generally available at AWS, Microsoft Azure and several GPU cloud providers, with others on the way shortly. Consumer Internet companies also drove the very strong demand. Their investments in data center infrastructure purpose-built for AI are already generating significant returns. For example, Meta, recently highlighted that since launching Reels, AI recommendations have driven a more than 24% increase in time spent on Instagram. Enterprises are also racing to deploy generative AI, driving strong consumption of NVIDIA powered instances in the cloud as well as demand for on-premise infrastructure.Whether we serve customers in the cloud or on-prem through partners or direct, their applications can run seamlessly on NVIDIA AI enterprise software with access to our acceleration libraries, pre-trained models and APIs. We announced a partnership with Snowflake to provide enterprises with accelerated path to create customized generative AI applications using their own proprietary data, all securely within the Snowflake Data Cloud. With the NVIDIA NeMo platform for developing large language models, enterprises will be able to make custom LLMs for advanced AI services, including chatbot, search and summarization, right from the Snowflake Data Cloud. Virtually, every industry can benefit from generative AI. For example, AI Copilot such as those just announced by Microsoft can boost the productivity of over 1 billion office workers and tens of millions of software engineers.Billions of professionals in legal services, sales, customer support and education will be available to leverage AI systems trained in their field. AI Copilot and assistants are set to create new multi-hundred billion dollar market opportunities for our customers. We are seeing some of the earliest applications of generative AI in marketing, media and entertainment. WPP, the world's largest marketing and communication services organization, is developing a content engine using NVIDIA Omniverse to enable artists and designers to integrate generative AI into 3D content creation. WPP designers can create images from text prompts while responsibly trained generative AI tools and content from NVIDIA partners such as Adobe and Getty Images using NVIDIA Picasso, a foundry for custom generative AI models for visual design.  NVIDIA software  jose-g-ortega-castro-sKZ_qkgg8T0-unsplashVisual content provider Shutterstock is also using NVIDIA Picasso to build tools and services that enables users to create 3D scene background with the help of generative AI. We've partnered with ServiceNow and Accenture to launch the AI Lighthouse program, fast tracking the development of enterprise AI capabilities. AI Lighthouse unites the ServiceNow enterprise automation platform and engine with NVIDIA accelerated computing and with Accenture consulting and deployment services. We are collaborating also with Hugging Face to simplify the creation of new and custom AI models for enterprises. Hugging Face will offer a new service for enterprises to train and tune advanced AI models powered by NVIDIA HGX cloud. And just yesterday, VMware and NVIDIA announced a major new enterprise offering called VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA, a fully integrated platform featuring AI software and accelerated computing from NVIDIA with multi-cloud software for enterprises running VMware.VMware's hundreds of thousands of enterprise customers will have access to the infrastructure, AI and cloud management software needed to customize models and run generative AI applications such as intelligent chatbot, assistants, search and summarization. We also announced new NVIDIA AI enterprise-ready servers featuring the new NVIDIA L40S GPU built for the industry standard data center server ecosystem and BlueField-3 DPU data center infrastructure processor. L40S is not limited by [indiscernible] supply and is shipping to the world's leading server system makers (ph). L40S is a universal data center processor designed for high volume data center standing out to accelerate the most compute-intensive applications, including AI training and inventing through the designing, visualization, video processing and NVIDIA Omniverse industrial digitalization.NVIDIA AI enterprise ready servers are fully optimized for VMware, Cloud Foundation and Private AI Foundation. Nearly 100 configurations of NVIDIA AI enterprise ready servers will soon be available from the world's leading enterprise IT computing companies, including Dell, HP and Lenovo. The GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip which combines our ARM-based Grace CPU with Hopper GPU entered full production and will be available this quarter in OEM servers. It is also shipping to multiple supercomputing customers, including Atmos (ph), National Labs and the Swiss National Computing Center. And NVIDIA and SoftBank are collaborating on a platform based on GH200 for generative AI and 5G/6G applications. The second generation version of our Grace Hopper Superchip with the latest HBM3e memory will be available in Q2 of calendar 2024.We announced the DGX GH200, a new class of large memory AI supercomputer for giant AI language model, recommendator systems and data analytics. This is the first use of the new NVIDIA [indiscernible] switch system, enabling all of its 256 Grace Hopper Superchips to work together as one, a huge jump compared to our prior generation connecting just eight GPUs over [indiscernible]. DGX GH200 systems are expected to be available by the end of the year, Google Cloud, Meta and Microsoft among the first to gain access. Strong networking growth was driven primarily by InfiniBand infrastructure to connect HGX GPU systems. Thanks to its end-to-end optimization and in-network computing capabilities, InfiniBand delivers more than double the performance of traditional Ethernet for AI.For billions of dollar AI infrastructures, the value from the increased throughput of InfiniBand is worth hundreds of [indiscernible] and pays for the network. In addition, only InfiniBand can scale to hundreds of thousands of GPUs. It is the network of choice for leading AI practitioners. For Ethernet-based cloud data centers that seek to optimize their AI performance, we announced NVIDIA Spectrum-X, an accelerated networking platform designed to optimize Ethernet for AI workloads. Spectrum-X couples the Spectrum or Ethernet switch with the BlueField-3 DPU, achieving 1.5x better overall AI performance and power efficiency versus traditional Ethernet. BlueField-3 DPU is a major success. It is in qualification with major OEMs and ramping across multiple CSPs and consumer Internet companies.Now moving to gaming. Gaming revenue of $2.49 billion was up 11% sequentially and 22% year-on-year. Growth was fueled by GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs for laptops and desktop. End customer demand was solid and consistent with seasonality. We believe global end demand has returned to growth after last year's slowdown. We have a large upgrade opportunity ahead of us. Just 47% of our installed base have upgraded to RTX and about 20% of the GPU with an RTX 3060 or higher performance. Laptop GPUs posted strong growth in the key back-to-school season, led by RTX 4060 GPUs. NVIDIA's GPU-powered laptops have gained in popularity, and their shipments are now outpacing desktop GPUs from several regions around the world. This is likely to shift the reality of our overall gaming revenue a bit, with Q2 and Q3 as the stronger quarters of the year, reflecting the back-to-school and holiday build schedules for laptops.In desktop, we launched the GeForce RTX 4060 and the GeForce RTX 4060 TI GPUs, bringing the Ada Lovelace architecture down to price points as low as $299. The ecosystem of RTX and DLSS games continue to expand. 35 new games added to DLSS support, including blockbusters such as Diablo IV and Baldur\u2019s Gate 3. There's now over 330 RTX accelerated games and apps. We are bringing generative AI to gaming. At COMPUTEX, we announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine or ACE for games, a custom AI model foundry service. Developers can use this service to bring intelligence to non-player characters. And it harnesses a number of NVIDIA Omniverse and AI technologies, including NeMo, Riva and Audio2Face. Now moving to Professional Visualization. Revenue of $375 million was up 28% sequentially and down 24% year-on-year.The Ada architecture ramp drove strong growth in Q2, rolling out initially in laptop workstations with a refresh of desktop workstations coming in Q3. These will include powerful new RTX systems with up to 4 NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs, providing more than 5,800 teraflops of AI performance and 192 gigabytes of GPU memory. They can be configured with NVIDIA AI enterprise or NVIDIA Omniverse inside. We also announced three new desktop workstation GPUs based on the Ada generation. The NVIDIA RTX 5000, 4500 and 4000, offering up to 2x the RT core throughput and up to 2x faster AI training performance compared to the previous generation. In addition to traditional workloads such as 3D design and content creation, new workloads in generative AI, large language model development and data science are expanding the opportunity in pro visualization for our RTX technology.One of the key themes in Jensen's keynote [indiscernible] earlier this month was the conversion of graphics and AI. This is where NVIDIA Omniverse is positioned. Omniverse is OpenUSD's native platform. OpenUSD is a universal interchange that is quickly becoming the standard for the 3D world, much like HTML is the universal language for the 2D [indiscernible]. Together, Adobe, Apple, Autodesk, Pixar and NVIDIA form the Alliance for OpenUSD. Our mission is to accelerate OpenUSD's development and adoption. We announced new and upcoming Omniverse cloud APIs, including RunUSD and ChatUSD to bring generative AI to OpenUSD workload. Moving to automotive. Revenue was $253 million, down 15% sequentially and up 15% year-on-year. Solid year-on-year growth was driven by the ramp of self-driving platforms based on [indiscernible] or associated with a number of new energy vehicle makers.The sequential decline reflects lower overall automotive demand, particularly in China. We announced a partnership with MediaTek to bring drivers and passengers new experiences inside the car. MediaTek will develop automotive SoCs and integrate a new product line of NVIDIA's GPU chiplet. The partnership covers a wide range of vehicle segments from luxury to entry level. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins expanded to 70.1% and non-GAAP gross margin to 71.2%, driven by higher data center sales. Our Data Center products include a significant amount of software and complexity, which is also helping drive our gross margin. Sequential GAAP operating expenses were up 6% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 5%, primarily reflecting increased compensation and benefits.We returned approximately $3.4 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Our Board of Directors has just approved an additional $25 billion in stock repurchases to add to our remaining $4 billion of authorization as of the end of Q2. Let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Demand for our Data Center platform where AI is tremendous and broad-based across industries on customers. Our demand visibility extends into next year. Our supply over the next several quarters will continue to ramp as we lower cycle times and work with our supply partners to add capacity. Additionally, the new L40S GPU will help address the growing demand for many types of workloads from cloud to enterprise. For Q3, total revenue is expected to be $16 billion, plus or minus 2%.We expect sequential growth to be driven largely by Data Center with gaming and ProViz also contributing. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 71.5% and 72.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.95 billion and $2 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $100 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 14.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community.We will attend the Jefferies Tech Summit on August 30 in Chicago, the Goldman Sachs Conference on September 5 in San Francisco, the Evercore Semiconductor Conference on September 6 as well as the Citi Tech Conference on September 7, both in New York. And the BofA Virtual AI conference on September 11. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our third quarter of fiscal 2024 is scheduled for Tuesday, November 21. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Could you please poll for questions for us?

From being a supplier of graphics processors for personal computers (PCs) and smartphones a decade ago, Nvidia expanded its wings into multiple high-growth markets such as automotive, data centers, cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), digital twins, and cloud gaming.\nAs a result, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia replicate its outstanding run on the stock market over the next 10 years as well.\nWhy Nvidia's revenue can multiply significantly over the next 10 years\nNvidia delivered annual revenue of $4.3 billion in fiscal 2013 (which ended in January 2013 and coincided largely with calendar year 2012). By fiscal 2023, which ended in January of this year, Nvidia's annual revenue increased to $27 billion. The chipmaker's revenue has increased over 6 times over the past decade.\nThe good part is that the chipmaker is expected to sustain its terrific revenue growth in the future as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA Revenue Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead data by YCharts.\nNvidia's revenue is expected to jump 2.6 times over the next three fiscal years when compared to its fiscal 2023 revenue, clocking a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38%. For comparison, the chipmaker's revenue increased at a CAGR of 20% over the past decade. This suggests that Nvidia is positioned to not just equal its impressive revenue-growth record of the past 10 years over the next decade but even exceed the same.\nThat won't be surprising as Nvidia management claims to be sitting on a massive revenue opportunity worth $1 trillion, spread across different applications.\n\n\n\n\nApplication\n\n\nNvidia revenue opportunity in $billion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\nChips and systems\n\n\n$300\n\n\n\n\nAutomotive\n\n\n$300\n\n\n\n\nOmniverse enterprise software\n\n\n$150\n\n\n\n\nNvidia AI enterprise software\n\n\n$150\n\n\n\n\nSource: Nvidia Investor Day 2022 presentation.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeventy percent of Nvidia's revenue opportunity will come from selling chips for various applications, and the good part is that the company dominates those segments. For instance, the company controls 84% of the market for gaming graphics processing units (GPUs), according to Jon Peddie Research. It already cornered a big chunk of the nascent cloud-gaming market as well, which has the potential to substantially boost its growth in the future.\nMeanwhile, the company is also making solid progress in the automotive market by quickly building up a nice revenue pipeline. Nvidia said on its May earnings conference call that its automotive design win pipeline was worth $14 billion, up from $11 billion in the year-ago quarter. It won't be surprising to see this design win pipeline expanding further as Nvidia has built a solid partner ecosystem, and its technology is going to play a critical role in the proliferation of self-driving cars.\nIn terms of data center chips, Nvidia sees\u00a0a $300 billion revenue opportunity in enterprise and high-performance computing. AI is going to play a key role in this segment's growth, driven by the need for chips to train AI models and for running inference applications as well. Precedence Research estimates that the AI chip market could generate annual revenue of almost $230 billion\u00a0in 2032, up from just under $17 billion last year.\n\nThis market alone could give Nvidia a serious boost over the next decade as the company reportedly controls 90% of the AI chip space at present, according\u00a0to Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh. The analyst is quite upbeat about Nvidia's prospects in the market for AI chips, pointing out that the company could generate $300 billion in AI-specific revenue by 2027 even if its share of this market dips to 75%.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much upside can investors expect over the next decade?\nNvidia could achieve faster revenue growth in the coming decade than the 20% CAGR it has clocked in the past 10 years. While analysts have ambitious growth targets, let's assume Nvidia's top line increases at an annual rate of 25% over the next decade. That would translate into annual revenue of $250 billion after 10 years, using its fiscal 2023 revenue as the base.\nNvidia has a five-year average price-to-sales ratio of 18.4. Assuming that multiple drops down to 10 after a decade, the company's market cap could jump to $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years based on revenue projections. That would be more than double Nvidia's current market cap. However, it won't be surprising to see this semiconductor stock deliver an even bigger upside since it could grow at a faster pace thanks to the trillion-dollar revenue opportunity it is sitting on.\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Despite a slight decline, don\u2019t dismiss the ongoing generative AI mega trend driving its powerful performance.\u00a0\nThat said, investors should recognize the limits of Nvidia\u2019s growth potential despite the market\u2019s enthusiasm for AI. \nWhile NVDA benefits from AI chip demand, its valuation may have already factored in this advantage, leading many to join the party when most of the upside is priced in.\nNow, being the leading player in AI chips positions, Nvidia to gain significantly from this trend. Thus, this is a stock that\u2019s likely to see continued strong growth over time. So, how do investors play this gem?\nHere\u2019s why I think a covered call or put selling strategy may be the best option right now. \nThe Obsession with Nvidia\nNvidia has remained among the top growth stocks, it has rewarded investors for buying and holding. As more of the company\u2019s customers gravitate toward AI application development, Nvidia\u2019s powerful chips will continue to see increased demand.\nOther high-growth sectors, such as machine learning, big data, cybersecurity, gaming, and crypto, among others, all use a significant number of the company\u2019s chips. Thus, when one of these high-growth sectors is running hot, so too is NVDA stock.\nNow, given the breadth of Nvidia\u2019s incline this year, it\u2019s clear that much of the enthusiasm around the AI boom is priced in.\nWhile Nvidia has seen this hype translate into real revenue and earnings growth (as well as forecasted growth), it\u2019s also true that much of it may already be priced in.\nThis year, NVDA stock surged from $143 to $480 this year, now aiming to surpass $500. Anticipation builds for the Q2 2023 earnings report, which could either boost or undermine the stock, reminiscent of the dot-com era.\nWhy Selling Puts or Calls is An Option\nI grasp the concept that owning stock represents a share in a business, yet at times, a stock can deviate from its business value. \nThis seems to be the case with Nvidia, whose shares trade at approximately 41-times sales, a steep ratio for earnings, but we\u2019re discussing sales here.\u00a0\nSo, for those looking to maintain (or add) exposure to Nvidia right now, but are worried about valuation, there are two excellent options to consider.\nFor those who own Nvidia at current levels, selling call options is a great strategy to consider. One can essentially lock in one\u2019s gains in NVDA stock at a specific level at a date in the future, while raking in premium for doing so.\nThus, for those betting on a market staying put or declining over the medium-term, this is one way investors can take profits down the road, and lock in premium for doing so.\nFor those who don\u2019t own Nvidia but want to (at a lower price), selling puts could be a great option. Selling a put contract gives the writer (put seller) the option to buy that contract at a lower price in the future.\nThose with the ability to sell put contacts (one contract accounts for 100 shares) can do so, limiting the price one will have to pay for said shares (though also paying a premium to do so).\nWhat Now\nThese are two strategies I think could bode well for long-term bulls, but short-term skeptics on Nvidia. Currently, I find myself in this category, and these two strategies are among the only that make sense to me right now.\nI can\u2019t justify buying shares at this valuation, and I\u2019m betting most investors can\u2019t either.\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTechnology, Semiconductor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2023/08/hedging-your-bets-the-2-best-ways-to-play-nvidia-stock-right-now/.\n\u00a92025 InvestorPlace Media, LLC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored Headlines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMore from InvestorPlace\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHot Stocks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Top Stocks to Buy Under Trump Come From Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018BRAIN\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Luke Lango, InvestorPlace Senior Investment Analyst\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Danger that Could Derail Our Economy\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Jeff Remsburg, Contributing Editor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy Prediction Came True: Where to Find Opportunity Despite Market Unpredictability\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Eric Fry, Editor, Fry's Investment Report\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMost Popular\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 10, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBig Tech\u2019s Quantum War Has Begun \u2014 and One Tiny Stock Could Win It\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 5, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat to Make of the Weakening Economy and Trade War\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInvestors Applaud a Cool Inflation Print\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow to Escape the \u2018Tyranny of the Immediate\u2019 in Investing\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExpert Stock Picks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe System Flagging a Potential 50X Opportunity\u2026 Even in This Ugly Market\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAbout InvestorPlace\nProducts\nContact Us\nHelp\nCareers\nAdvertise With Us\nDisclosures & Disclaimers\nPrivacy Policy\nAd Choices\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\nCookie Policy\nCookie Preferences\nTerms of Use\nDMCA Policy\n All rights reserved.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\n\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) stock is trending on social media, and PLTR stock is down 4%. Palantir, which unveiled an artificial intelligence (AI) platform earlier this year, climbed in sympathy with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in pre-market trading. However, after the market opened, PLTR proceeded to drop into the red.\nYesterday after the market closed, Nvidia, for the second straight quarter, delivered stronger-than-expected quarterly results and provided guidance that came in well above analysts\u2019 average outlooks. Once again, AI was the positive catalyst that enabled NVDA to surpass the mean estimates by large amounts.\nNvidia\u2019s Q2 Results and Palantir\nLast quarter, Nvidia\u2019s top line soared 88% versus Q1 and 101% compared with the same period a year earlier to $13.51 billion. Analysts\u2019 average estimate was only $11.09 billion. The company\u2019s sales from data centers, whose workloads are greatly increasing as a result of the AI revolution, soared an incredible 141% versus Q1 and 171% year-over-year.\nOn the bottom line, the chipmaker\u2019s earnings per share, excluding certain items, came in at $2.70, versus the mean estimate of $2.09. As far as Q3 guidance is concerned, NVDA expects sales of $16 billion, plus or minus 2%, very far above the mean estimate of $12.4 billion.\nNvidia is providing \u201cthe computing infrastructure\u201d of AI, with cloud infrastructure companies and \u201c[l]eading enterprise IT system and software providers\u201d all using the firm\u2019s chips to enable the technology, CEO Jensen Huang reported.\nThe company\u2019s chips power the calculations that enable generative AI, and Nvidia\u2019s results show that the use of AI is accelerating tremendously, boding very well for many AI stocks, such\u00a0as PLTR.\nPLTR Stock: Palantir\u2019s AI Connection\nIn June, PLTR launched an AI platform that can, like ChatGPT, generate \u201cconversational\u201d answers to users\u2019 questions. Palantir believes that its new platform can avoid the \u201challucinations\u201d that other chatbots have been notorious for.\nEarlier this month, PLTR CEO Alex Karp said the company \u201cwill figure out how to monetize\u201d AI. The firm has contended that its platform will enable organizations to make better decisions.\nIn 20 years, Palantir has never turned an annual profit. However, with Nvidia\u2019s chips powering a new wave of AI tools, PLTR might finally manage to do it.\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

From record revenue and stunning year-over-year growth to share prices that continue to climb and the biggest tech companies on Earth breaking down its door to get access to its latest chips, Nvidia can seemingly do no wrong.  But the chip giant\u2019s rivals, including AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC), aren\u2019t sitting idly by while it gobbles up the spoils of the AI wave. They\u2019re busy building out their own AI capabilities in an effort to chip away at Nvidia\u2019s lead. Even Nvidia\u2019s customers, including Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN), are building custom AI chips, in order to break free of their dependence on Nvidia\u2019s products.

NVDA AMD INTC   Advanced Chart    And while Nvidia is in no immediate danger of losing its grip on the market, Intel\u2019s fall from the world\u2019s most advanced chipmaker proves that there\u2019s no guarantee the company will maintain its lead. \u201cThings can change pretty dramatically in this industry,\u201d Forrester research director Glenn O\u2019Donnell told Yahoo Finance. \u201cIntel was king of the hill and it stumbled a few years ago and really made some bad mistakes, and now they have to catch up. The same thing could happen to Nvidia.\u201d Rivals are hunting for their share Nvidia is the undisputed leader of AI chips, with an estimated 80% to 95% market share, but as its competitors build out their own AI efforts, that\u2019s all but guaranteed to decline. \u201cI believe on the hardware front, AMD and Intel will be able to field competitive offerings to Nvidia for both training and inference,\u201d Moor Insights and Strategy CEO Patrick Moorhead told Yahoo Finance. \u201cBoth companies will field very interesting offerings available in early 2024 for [large language models (LLMs)]. Even upstarts like Groq have shown advantages on certain models and workflows for LLM inference, today,\u201d Moorhead added. During Intel\u2019s second quarter earnings report, CEO Pat Gelsinger said the company is seeing surging demand for its AI products and services, including its Gaudi line of AI chips, which will continue into next year.

(Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)  \u00b7 SOPA Images via Getty Images \u201cOur pipeline of opportunities through 2024 is rapidly increasing and is now over $1 billion and continuing to expand with Gaudi driving the lion\u2019s share,\u201d Gelsinger said during the company\u2019s earnings call. Intel is also in the midst of developing its next-generation AI platform called Falcon Shores, which it hopes will rival Nvidia\u2019s and AMD\u2019s most powerful systems. Intel initially planned for the chip to hit the market in 2024 and serve as a combined central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) platform. Nvidia already offers a combined platform called Grace Hopper.   Story Continues But Intel has since changed course and Falcon Shores will initially launch with just a GPU. The move also means the chip won\u2019t hit the market until 2025.AMD is a step ahead of Intel thanks to its MI300 platform. The product line, which includes a combination CPU and GPU offering called the MI300A and a GPU-only chip called the MI300X, could give AMD the kind of capabilities it needs to tackle Nvidia.  The empire strikes back: CEO Lisa Su speaks at the AMD Keynote address, during the Consumer Electronics Show in January. (ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images)  \u00b7 ROBYN BECK via Getty ImagesThe problem? AMD didn\u2019t announce any major customers when it announced the platform in June, according to Reuters. Still, the company and Intel are at least on course to take on Nvidia directly.\u201c[AMD and Intel are] not going to overcome Nvidia, certainly not anytime in the next few years,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cBut can they chip away and gain some of that share? Yes, they can. And they already are doing that.\u201dMore companies are building their own chipsIntel and AMD aren\u2019t the only threats to Nvidia\u2019s position at the top of the AI hardware market.An increasing number of Big Tech firms are building their own custom AI chips. In April, The Information reported that Microsoft was working on an AI chip, and Google, Amazon, and Meta (META) have also announced their own chips.And with their own AI platforms in hand, those companies won\u2019t necessarily need to buy as many Nvidia chips.  Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is positioning the chipmaker as a rival to Nvidia's AI power. (Peter Gercke/picture alliance via Getty Images)  \u00b7 picture alliance via Getty Images\u201cHyperscalers [massive cloud firms like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google] are a measurable part of [Nvidia\u2019s] business,\u201d explained Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster. \u201cThe biggest threat is that these big customers start to try to find their own solutions.\u201dBut Nvidia still has a few aces up its sleeve, chief among them its software capabilities.\u201cI believe the hardest part of the equation is software, a moat Nvidia has built with CUDA and its libraries and workflows,\u201d Moorhead said.Nvidia\u2019s CUDA is a programming model that allows developers to take advantage of its chips\u2019 parallel processing capabilities. And it\u2019s that software, coupled with Nvidia\u2019s hardware, that helps give Nvidia a lead over its competitors.Nvidia\u2019s biggest threats, Intel and AMD, are still years off from being able to put any significant pressure on the graphics chipmaker. But Nvidia will need to continue to innovate if it hopes to stay on top in the long run.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

Even better, analysts at the International Data Corporation (IDC) say the global quantum computing market could be worth well over $8.6 billion by 2030. So, there\u2019s plenty of opportunity, even for the companies still in the early stages of development and commercialization. In fact, I\u2019ve listed three of the top quantum computing stocks investors may want to consider buying and holding for the long haul.\n\nQuantum Computing Stocks: Quantum Computing (QUBT)\nSource: Bartlomiej K. Wroblewski / Shutterstock.com\nQuantum Computing (NASDAQ:QUBT) is a small $92.1 million company that\u2019s\u00a0developing software solutions for quantum computers. One of those solutions is its cloud platform Qatalyst, which allows users to access and optimize quantum algorithms for various use cases, such as machine learning, finance, and even cybersecurity.\u00a0While the QUBT stock trades for about $1, it could turn out to be a rewarding trade idea. All as demand for quantum computing solutions grows.\nEarnings growth has been solid. \u00a0In fact, in the second quarter, the company posted revenues of $112,000, as compared to the $65,000 recorded a year earlier. Also, for the first six months of 2023, revenues jumped 141% year over year to $233,000. In addition, as noted in the company\u2019s earnings release, \u201cAs the Company has only recently entered its commercialization phase, revenues were expected to be minimal during the first half of 2023; however, as contracted testing and a backlog of proof-of-concept projects demonstrate positive results, the Company anticipates increasing revenue sequentially as the year progresses and into 2024.\u201d\nNvidia (NVDA)\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) needs little introduction at this point. The graphics card maker has transformed into one of the most important semiconductor companies of the decade, specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming, data centers, and artificial intelligence. Unknown to some, Nvidia is, however, one of the key players in quantum computing, with its\u00a0Tensor Core GPUs used to power some of the most advanced quantum simulators and algorithms.\nFurther, Nvidia has developed its own quantum software development kit and platform called cuQuantum, which leverages its CUDA programming model and libraries to enable developers to create and run quantum applications on Nvidia GPUs. Similar to other quantum computing firms in the space, Nvidia collaborates with various quantum hardware providers, such as IBM (NYSE:IBM), IonQ (NYSE:IONQ), and D-Wave Quantum\u00a0(NYSE:QBTS), to integrate its cuQuantum platform with their quantum devices.\nNvidia is a growth powerhouse that offers exposure to quantum computing as well as many other booming markets. The stock has gained over 221% year-to-date and shows no signs of slowing down. Quantum computing could very well be Nvidia\u2019s next breakthrough.\nIonQ (IONQ)\nSource: Amin Van / Shutterstock.com\nFounded in 2015 by two leading quantum physicists from the University of Maryland and Duke University, IonQ was the first pure-play quantum computing firm. IonQ uses trapped ion technology to build its quantum computers. Even better, the company has a\u00a0partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and other cloud providers to offer its quantum computing services on the cloud.\nWhile IonQ\u2019s revenues are still low, the company does boast a strong balance sheet with $375 million in cash and short-term investments with no debt.

Although it\u2019s been known for graphics processors, Nvidia has now become almost synonymous with AI, after successfully diving head-first into the production of the type of microchip that powers the promising technology. \n    \n\nDemand has outpaced supply, making Nvidia the hottest of hot stocks: It\u2019s leading the S&P 500 this year by a mile, and is now one of only a handful of companies with a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion. \n    \n\n            Investor enthusiasm for AI has also helped boost other tech stocks. Meta is up 144% this year, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has grown 31%. But Nvidia is by far the most sought-after AI stock. The American chipmaker produces the building blocks of generative artificial intelligence (think ChatGPT and the like). \n    \n\n            The Santa Clara, California-based company posted year-over-year sales growth of 101% in the second quarter. Revenue went from $6.7 billion in the second quarter last year to $13.5 billion this year. The results were even stronger than the $11.2 billion in revenue that Wall Street analysts expected.\n    \n\n            This is the second time in a row that Nvidia\u2019s quarterly earnings have blown past expectations. Its success is beginning to provide assurances that the AI gold rush is not just a flash in the pan. \n    \n\nAI enthusiasm has helped power stocks into a bull market, even as the Federal Reserve has continued to hike interest rates in its battle against inflation.\n    \n\n            \u201cNvidia\u2019s hardware has become indispensable to the AI-driven economy,\u201d Insider Intelligence senior analyst Jacob Bourne said in an email following the blockbuster earnings report. \u201cThe pressing question is whether Nvidia can consistently exceed the now-higher expectations.\u201d\n    \n\n            It shouldn\u2019t have too much let-up: Demand for generative AI will remain robust over the next two years as apps for the new technology explode and become broadly deployed across companies, said Raj Joshi, senior vice president for Moody\u2019s Investors Service, in a note to investors. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN Business Videos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDEEP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\nCould humans live underwater?

Gather your party and return to the Forgotten Realms in Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, a tale of fellowship and betrayal, sacrifice and survival, and the lure of absolute power. Mysterious abilities are awakening inside you, drawn from a mind flayer parasite planted in your brain. Resist, and turn darkness against itself. Or embrace corruption, and become ultimate evil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter nearly 3 years, Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 exits Early Access on August 3rd, having already entertained millions of gamers. Now though, you can experience the epic game from start to finish, in single-player or co-op, with a ridiculous amount of content, 12 classes, 174 hours of cinematics, and 2000 interactive characters.\nOn PC, get the definitive experience with a GeForce RTX graphics card, or play with GeForce RTX power in the cloud using GeForce NOW. Whichever way you play, you can max out graphical quality with NVIDIA DLAA, or crank up the frame rate with NVIDIA DLSS 2. In our benchmarks, GeForce RTX 40 Series desktop graphics cards increased their performance by an average of 93% when activating DLSS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to DLSS 2, most GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers --and those with comparable cards-- can play Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 at 4K, with every setting maxed, at over 60 frames per second.

To wishlist or purchase, head here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESORDRE: A Puzzle Game Adventure Adds DLSS 3 & RTXDI, Upgrades To Unreal Engine 5.2\nSHK Interactive\u2019s DESORDRE: A Puzzle Game Adventure, launched with DLSS 2 in June, helping GeForce RTX gamers get faster performance in the parallel worlds players jump between as part of an experimental therapy program. Now, DESORDRE has become one of the world\u2019s first, released Unreal Engine 5.2 games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe leap from Unreal Engine 5.1 to 5.2 enhances graphics, performance, and player choice, helping users tailor their experience to the capabilities of their system.\nHeadlining the additions is NVIDIA RTX Direct Illumination (RTXDI), enabling each light source in DESORDRE to cast accurate ray-traced light and shadows, and be reflected in the game\u2019s glossy environments. Performance remains fast thanks to RTXDI\u2019s game-changing design, and on GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs ray tracing gets even faster thanks to the addition of NVIDIA Shader Execution Reordering (SER) in the new update.\nTo ensure the highest frame rates when using RTXDI and other new features, SHK Interactive has leveraged the recently-released Unreal Engine 5.2 NVIDIA Streamline plugin to upgrade their existing DLSS 2 support to DLSS 3, featuring Frame Generation, Reflex, and Super Resolution.\nWhen activated, DLSS 3 multiplies GeForce RTX 40 Series desktop GPU performance by an average of 3.6X at 4K, with the new, very demanding, max-quality Lumen and Nanite settings enabled. With this additional performance headroom, you also have the power to try experimental Unreal Engine 5.2 options that cranks options to 11, for the absolute highest levels of image quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 1440p, frame rates are multiplied by an average of 2.4X, enabling 60 FPS+ play on the GeForce RTX 4070 and up. And at 1080p, a 2.2X average performance multiplication enables all GeForce RTX 40 Series desktop GPU owners to experience DESORDRE at its absolute best.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHead to DESORDRE: A Puzzle Game Adventure\u2019s Steam page to learn more about the game, see trailers and screens, and to download a demo. And stay tuned to SHK Interactive\u2019s social feeds, as they intend to upgrade to Unreal Engine 5.3 when it\u2019s released, bringing even more goodness to the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLost Soul Aside To Launch With DLSS 3\nUltiZero Games\u2019 Lost Soul Aside is an action role-playing game developed with Unreal Engine 4 for PlayStation 5 and PC. The game has a unique combat system, gorgeous graphics, and a compelling storyline. The core of the game is smooth and intense combat, where players will face a variety of powerful enemies and challenges.\nThrough the investment and assistance of Sony Interactive Entertainment, and the continued perseverance and hard work from the China Hero project team and Lost Soul Aside development team, Lost Soul Aside continues to get bigger and better, and today, you can see the new, exclusive RTX On trailer on Bing Yang's YouTube channel:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Lost Soul Aside is released, activate NVIDIA DLSS 3 for the definitive experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemnant II Upgrades To DLSS 3\nRemnant II from Gunfire Games is the sequel to the best-selling game Remnant: From the Ashes that pits survivors of humanity against new deadly creatures and god-like bosses across terrifying worlds. Play solo or co-op with two other friends to explore the depths of the unknown to stop an evil from destroying reality itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReleased to critical acclaim on July 25th, Remnant II has racked up a swathe of 8 and 9 out of 10 reviews, and is rated Very Positive by players.\nNow, GeForce RTX gamers can tailor their Remnant II experience with a full gamut of DLSS modes! DLSS 2 enables all GeForce RTX users to accelerate frame rates, DLSS 3 gives GeForce RTX 40 Series users the power of frame rate multiplication for the fastest performance possible, and DLAA uses a native resolution image to maximize image quality, rather than boosting performance. You can even combine DLAA and DLSS 3 Frame Generation for excellent image quality, and performance.\nUsing DLSS 3, GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers can multiply Remnant II frame rates by an average of 3.5X, enabling many configurations to enjoy the game at max settings at 4K, at over 60 FPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrand Emprise: Time Travel Survival Available Now With DLSS 2\nTbjbu2\u2019s Grand Emprise: Time Travel Survival sees players ride dinosaurs, forge tools, sail dunes, build a colony, siege castles, automate and fly, mine underground, launch to the moon, and build a dyson sphere in a revolutionary survival crafting, base building, open world single-player adventure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMade by a single person in Unreal Engine 5, Grand Emprise: Time Travel Survival launched just a few days ago, boasting out of the box support for DLSS 2, ensuring GeForce RTX gamers have the fastest frame rates possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Back Next Week For Even More RTX Games\nEach week there are even more DLSS integrations arriving for an array of games.

By Aoyon Ashraf|Edited by Nick Baker Aug 23, 2023, 5:14\u202fp.m.  UTC(Getty Images) AI-related tokens such as FET, GRT, INJ, RNDR and AGIX may move after Nvidia's earnings on Wednesday.Shares of crypto miners such as APLD, IREN, HUT, and HIVE may also see some impact.Giant chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) could help determine later today if the artificial intelligence frenzy is real or just another bubble ready to burst \u2013 and take AI-related crypto tokens on a wild ride.Scheduled for after the U.S. stock market closes Wednesday, this is Nvidia's first quarterly report since blowing the roof off of Wall Street's estimates in May and revealing an extremely bullish outlook for revenue tied to AI. This sentiment, coupled with increasingly AI mainstream reach with the likes of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, spilled over onto AI-related cryptocurrencies, sending them soaring.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDon't miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.

The sector got a modest bump in July after Elon Musk unveiled his ChatGPT competitor.If the chipmaker can prove that AI is becoming a major moneymaker, that wouldn\u2019t just be a boon for the tech firms that are adopting the technology en-masse, but also for AI-related crypto tokens' sentiment, at least in the short term.Today's earnings could also show how AI may change corporate strategy at crypto miners. While the equipment they use is fine-tuned for crypto and cannot necessarily be shifted over to processing AI, their expertise and physical space in data centers could help them dive into AI.Miners like Applied Digital (APLD), Iris Energy (IREN), Hut 8 (HUT) and Hive (HIVE) have already started to revitalize their data centers to accommodate AI and other computing services as mining has become less profitable during the prolonged bear market. As investors have also been rewarding the shares of some publicly traded miners for pivoting into AI, depending on how the guidance from Nvidia goes, the prices of these mining stocks could also be affected.Read more: Crypto Miners Are Pivoting to AI (Like Everyone Else)AIArtificial IntelligenceMiningfetch-aiAoyon AshrafAoyon Ashraf is CoinDesk's managing editor for Breaking News.

Getty Images\nWhat are the odds the CEOs of two leading U.S. companies in a global industry are relatives from the same tiny city an ocean away?\u00a0Yes, there are the Dassler brothers (personal conflicts between two shoemaker brothers in early 1900s Germany led to the creation of Adidas and Puma), but what if the family members barely knew each other growing up, moved overseas with families, pursued different career paths, and eventually found themselves at the helms of two top rivals in a booming business? That\u2019s the unlikely story of Lisa Su, the CEO of chip giant AMD (AMD) (Advanced Micro Devices Inc.), and her counterpart at Nvidia (NVDA), Jensen Huang.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSign Up\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThank you for signing up!\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBy clicking submit, you agree to our <a href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties.

Huang, 60, is the founder and CEO of Nvidia. They are both first-generation Americans from Tainan, a southern city in Taiwan with a population of 1.8 million as of 2019. Rumors that Su and Huang are related began circulating in the tech world in recent years as Huang\u2019s profile (and fortune) rose with Nvidia\u2019s booming semiconductor business.\nIn an interview during the 2020 CES, Su confirmed that she and Huang were \u201cdistant relatives. \u201cSome complex second cousin type of thing,\u201d she said. In fact, they might be closer than that. According to Huang\u2019s family tree published by Wu Jia Jin, a family heritage expert in Taiwan, and widely cited in local media, Su\u2019s mother, Sandy Lo, is a cousin of Huang. Lo and Huang have the same grandfather. In Western family relationship terms, Su and Huang could be described as first cousins once removed. They might not have known each other very well, since the family is pretty large. Huang\u2019s grandfather (Su\u2019s great-grandfather) had at least 12 children, according to Wu, and their offspring are scattered all around the world.\nA shared passion for electrical engineering\nSu\u2019s family moved to the U.S. when she was three. Raised by parents who were statisticians and accountants, Su developed an interest in math early on and aspired to be an engineer when she was a kid. \u201cI just had a great curiosity about how things worked,\u201d she told SFGate in 2015. Su studied electrical engineering at MIT from 1986 to 1994 and obtained her bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s and PhD from the school. Her doctoral thesis was on silicon-on-insulator technology, a then-unproven technique for increasing efficiency in semiconductors.\nAfter graduation, Su worked for several chipmakers, including Texas Instruments and IBM, for nearly two decades. She joined AMD in 2012 as a senior vice president and was appointed CEO in 2014. Su is often credited for diversifying AMD\u2019s business away from personal computers into other segments like video gaming and embedded devices.\nBefore founding Nvidia in 1993, Huang worked as a chip designer for AMD but had no overlap with Su. Huang moved to the U.S. with his parent at age four and settled in Oregon. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from Oregon State University and later obtained a master\u2019s in the same subject from Stanford University.\nHuang made the early bet for Nvidia to focus on developing artificial intelligence chips, also known as A.I. processors, in the early 2010s. A.I. chips are more advanced than traditional semiconductors used in personal computers and are used to power heavy-duty computing required for training A.I. algorithms.\nHuang is proven prescient as the A.I. boom took off late last year and sent Nvidia\u2019s market value soaring. Nvidia is currently a clear market leader in A.I. chips and estimated to\u00a0own 95 percent of the market of graphics processing units (GPUs), a popular type of A.I. chip.\nHuang is estimated to be worth $36.8 billion, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaires Index, making him\u00a0one of the 40 richest people on Earth. Su, though not a billionaire tech founder, is the highest-paid female CEO in the U.S. Her 2022 compensation was valued at nearly $30 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Filed Under:\nBusiness, Technology, Lisa Su, Jensen Huang, Leadership, AMD, Nvidia \n\n\n\n\nSEE ALSO:  Disney\u2019s Last Magic Trick: Who Will Take Bob Iger\u2019s Throne in 2026?\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARTS\n\nArt Fairs\nArt Market\nArt Reviews\nAuctions\nGalleries\nMuseums\n\n\nBUSINESS\n\nEnergy\nFinance\nMedia\nPolicy\nTechnology\nClimate\n\n\nENTERTAINMENT\n\nBooks\nDance\nMovies\nOpera\nTheater\nTV Shows\n\n\nLIFESTYLE\n\nAutos\nHotels\nNightlife & Dining\nRestaurants\nStyle\nTravel\n\n\nWEALTH\n\nBillionaires\nParties\nPhilanthropy\nReal Estate\n\n\nEXPERT INSIGHTS\n\nA.I.

Although NVDA stock has been one of the hottest tickets on Wall Street \u2014 gaining over 200% since the start of the year \u2014 the expert\u2019s forecast represents a tall order given the already stratospheric performance. Still, it may not be completely out of bounds.\nSpecifically, Mosesmann anticipates that during Nvidia\u2019s fiscal year 2026 (translating to calendar year 2025), earnings power will be \u201cwell into the $20s.\u201d Further, the analyst pointed to \u201cunmatched strengths\u201d in compilers, libraries and vertical optimizations. Therefore, Nvidia can address hardware specification challenges and thus continue to foster ongoing software sales streams.\nAs well, the company made the decision early to invest in artificial intelligence-based capabilities, which then led to opportunities within the broader digital intelligence market as well as autonomous driving and the burgeoning metaverse.\nAlready a strong believer in NVDA stock, Mosesmann previously projected a $600 price target for NVDA stock. It\u2019s \u201cin a league of its own,\u201d the expert remarked, summing up the extremely bullish narrative.\n\nIs NVDA Stock Really Worth an $800 Price Tag?\nOn surface level, Mosesmann\u2019s anticipation of NVDA stock eventually hitting $800 a pop seems almost recklessly optimistic. Within the past two days, most analysts have issued buy ratings with a $500 price target, which implies about 15% upside potential. On the other hand, the Rosenblatt analyst\u2019s forecast calls for a near doubling of the share price.\nFundamentally, though, it\u2019s not out of the question for NVDA stock to reach such an astounding height. True, shares presently trade at a forward earnings multiple of 57.71x, significantly above the semiconductor sector\u2019s median forward multiple of 25.8x. At the same time, Nvidia commands intense demand for its graphics processors.\nDuring the second-quarter earnings call by electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), CEO Elon Musk told analysts that the company will take as many Nvidia processors as it can produce. Such underlying buying pressure helps to explain why Nvidia felt comfortable raising its fiscal Q2 guidance beyond the Street\u2019s expectations.\nHowever, the main problem now is that Nvidia can\u2019t feed everyone\u2019s orders as quickly as they would like. Certainly, it\u2019s a great problem to have. However, management is likely worried that the increased lead times for its AI products may enable rivals Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) to catch up.\nThe real acid test will come on Aug. 23, when Nvidia will disclose its Q2 results.\nWhy It Matters\nCurrently, analysts peg NVDA stock as a consensus strong buy. This assessment breaks down as 32 buys, two holds and zero sells. On average, the experts\u2019 price target lands at $521.77, implying about 20% upside potential. While Mosesmann locked up the high-side target at $800, the low-side target comes in at $440, which still represents a gain from the time-of-writing price.\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2023/08/nvda-stock-price-prediction-is-nvidia-really-worth-800/.\n\u00a92025 InvestorPlace Media, LLC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored Headlines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMore from InvestorPlace\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHot Stocks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Top Stocks to Buy Under Trump Come From Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018BRAIN\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Luke Lango, InvestorPlace Senior Investment Analyst\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Danger that Could Derail Our Economy\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Jeff Remsburg, Contributing Editor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy Prediction Came True: Where to Find Opportunity Despite Market Unpredictability\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Eric Fry, Editor, Fry's Investment Report\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTop Stories\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFeb 8, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWolfpack Research Short Report Sends B.

The PHLX Semiconductor Sector index is up an impressive 48% so far this year, far outpacing the S&P 500 index's gains of 18% over that time.\nThe solid gains were sparked by the sudden spurt in the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) applications, a technology that has opened a whole new growth frontier for chipmakers. After all, the global AI chip market is expected to grow at a healthy annual pace of 30%\u00a0over the next decade and generate $227 billion in revenue in 2032, according to Precedence Research.\nThis explains why semiconductor stocks, such as Nvidia (NVDA -2.53%) and Intel (INTC 1.25%), are in great demand this year. While share prices of Nvidia more than tripled, Intel stock gained 32%. However, Nvidia's terrific rally made the stock quite expensive, while Intel can be bought at a much lower multiple.\nDoes this make Intel a better buy for investors who want to take advantage of the AI boom but don't want to pay a hefty valuation? Let's find out.\nThe case for Nvidia\nNvidia is about to witness windfall gains thanks to the fast-growing demand for AI chips. The company will release its fiscal 2024 second-quarter results later this month, and it is forecast to report a 64%\u00a0year-over-year jump in revenue to $11 billion based on its guidance. It is worth noting that Nvidia's revenue fell 13% year over year in the fiscal first quarter (which ended on April 30) to $7.2 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the race to train large language AI models and deploy generative AI applications such as chatbots has created a huge demand for Nvidia's graphics cards, which reportedly command a waiting period now. That's not surprising as Nvidia is expected\u00a0to corner at least 90% of the market for AI chips, according to Citi Research.\nAdvanced Micro Devices, its nearest competitor in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, isn't expected\u00a0to dent Nvidia's commanding position in the AI chip market. That's because AMD's chips are said to deliver only 80% of the performance of Nvidia's hardware.\nMeanwhile, Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho Securities believes that Nvidia is at the beginning of a massive growth curve. He expects the company to generate a whopping $300 billion in AI-driven revenue by 2027, with a market share of 75% in AI chips. That points toward a tenfold jump in Nvidia's estimated AI revenue of $25 billion to $30 billion in 2023, as per Rakesh's estimates.\nSo, Nvidia seems capable of sustaining its newly found momentum thanks to the booming demand for AI chips. This explains why the company is expected\u00a0to deliver 46% revenue growth in fiscal 2024 to $39 billion despite a tepid start to the year in Q1. Analysts expect the company to maintain its momentum in fiscal 2025 with 35% revenue growth, and the good part is that Nvidia could keep growing at such impressive levels for a longer time thanks to the huge revenue opportunity in AI chips.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case for Intel\nIntel stock has appreciated nicely this year, even though the PC market's weakness weighed heavily on the company's financial performance. This is evident from Intel's second-quarter results. Chipzilla's revenue was down 15% year over year to $12.9 billion. Its non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings fell 54% over the prior year to $0.13 per share.\n\nStill, investors cheered Intel's results as the rate of decline in the company's PC business slowed down remarkably. The company's guidance for the current quarter suggests that it is getting out of the rut it is in. Intel expects Q3 revenue of $13.4 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, which points toward sequential growth. The year-over-year rate of decline in revenue\u00a0would slow down further to 12% at the midpoint, though there is a chance that it could do better thanks to AI.\nIntel revealed that its AI chips saw healthy demand, and the company has already built a $1 billion revenue pipeline in this niche. That could keep growing at a nice pace as Intel sees a huge end-market opportunity in the data center chipset market.\nAccording\u00a0to Intel's internal estimates, the market for server processors, graphics cards, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for deployment in data centers and AI servers could be worth $110 billion in 2027 as compared to $40 billion last year. The company adds that 60%\u00a0of this demand is likely to be fulfilled by general computing chips such as CPUs (central processing units) that Intel sells.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that Intel commands\u00a0more than 82% share of the server processor market, the company is in a nice position to capitalize on the AI chip opportunity. This could bring about a turnaround in Intel's fortunes and help the company regain its mojo.\n\n\n\nINTC Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts.\nThe verdict\nWhile Intel is currently working toward a turnaround, Nvidia is in red-hot form. Not surprisingly, there is a big difference in the valuations of both chipmakers. Nvidia has a price-to-sales ratio of\u00a045, which is way higher than Intel's sales multiple of\u00a02.7.\nNvidia can justify its rich multiple by sustaining a strong pace of growth in the long run, and that could tempt investors looking for a growth stock to put their money in the company. However, investors with a lower risk appetite who want to benefit from the AI boom but aren't willing to pay an expensive multiple can consider keeping Intel on their watchlists as a potential turnaround in the company's fortunes could send the stock soaring.\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Both readings were 10 basis points below consensus.\nNvidia, a leading AI-chip\u00a0manufacturer, dropped\u00a04.7% on Wednesday following news that US President Joe Biden has signed an executive order to limit investment by US corporations in specific Chinese hi-tech industries, that constitute a core segment of Nvidia's market.\nNvidia stock news: Biden administration to limit Chinese investment\nWednesday afternoon the Biden administration adopted an executive order that would limit US corporations from investing in the semiconductor, microelectronic, quantum information technology, and artificial intelligence industries of China. The latter\u2019s foreign ministry decried the new stringent regulations.\n\"This program will seek to prevent foreign countries of concern from exploiting U.S. investment in this narrow set of technologies that are critical to support their development of military, intelligence, surveillance, and cyber-enabled capabilities that risk US national security,\" the White House said in a written statement.\nThe Financial Times simultaneously reported that Chinese heavyweights in the consumer internet sector have ordered more than $5 billion worth of Nvidia chips in an attempt to stockpile them ahead of a more restrictive environment. Those tech companies include Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (TCEHY), Baidu (BIDU) and ByteDance \u2013 which all have orders for upwards of $1 billion worth of A800 GPUs with delivery timelines in 2023. For 2024, they have at least another $4 billion worth of orders already penciled in.\nNvidia designed the A800 last year in order to circumvent rules from Washington regarding state-of-the-art semiconductor technology headed to China. The A800 has a slower transfer rate than the A100 it is modeled on that is used in data centers to deal with the heavy compute required for training large language models and other generative AI technologies.\nOn Monday, a Morgan Stanley team released a client note arguing that the AI rally this year is in its \u201clater innings\u201d. Noting that Nvidia and other prominent AI-related stocks have more than tripled their share prices year to date, the team captained by equity strategist Edward Stanley said that this rally had already surpassed other niche bubbles that on average see gains of 150% over a three-year period.\nCiti reiterated its Buy rating and $560 price target on NVDA stock on Wednesday following Nvidia\u2019s unveiling of its GH200 Grace-Hopper superchip. The chip platform comes with triple the bandwidth and memory of the most recent generation of chips and is designed to deal with heavier generative AI workloads at data centers.\nNvidia is slated to report second-quarter earnings on August 23. After the company raised its outlook last quarter, Wall Street analysts now expected adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.07 on revenues of $11.06 billion.\n\n\n\nSemiconductor stocks FAQs\n\n\nWhat is a semiconductor?\nA semiconductor is a term for various types of computer chips. Officially called semiconductor devices, these computer chips rely on semiconductor materials like silicon and gallium arsenide to process the electrical current that produces the modern world of computing. They come in many shapes, sizes, enhancements and configurations such as diodes, transistors and integrated circuits to more complicated applications like DRAM memory, simple processors and even GPUs.\n\n\nWhat types of semiconductor companies are there?\nFirst, there are the pure chip designers, such as Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom and Qualcomm. These companies use sophisticated software to design and test chips. Second, there are the equipment manufacturers that provide the machines necessary to build computer chips. These include ASML and Lam Research. Then, there are foundries that manufacture the chips. These include Taiwan Semiconductor and GlobalFoundries. Last of all are the integrated device manufacturers who design their own chips and additionally manufacture themselves. These include Samsung and Intel.\n\n\nWhat is Moore\u2019s Law?\nIt is the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles every two years. The \u201claw\u201d is named after Gordon Moore, who founded Fairchild Semiconductor and later Intel. The doubling is possible due to the shrinking size of process nodes or parts in the computer chip. In 1971 the advanced commercial manufacturing had reached 10 microns in width. In 1987 semiconductor technology had advanced to 800 nanometers in width. By 1999, this process had moved to 180 nanometers. By 2007, the size had dropped to 32 nanometers, and this fell all the way to 3 nanometers in 2022, which is close to the size of human DNA.\n\n\nHow large is the semiconductor industry?\nIn 2022, the global semiconductor industry had revenues just under $600 billion. In total, the industry shipped 1.15 trillion semiconductor units in 2021. The leading nations involved in the semiconductor supply chain are Taiwan, the United States, China, the Netherlands, South Korea, Japan and Israel.\n\n\n\nNvidia stock forecast: A break of 50-day SMA speaks volumes\nAs previously mentioned, NVDA stock closed below the 50-day SMA on Wednesday. It has traded above this moving average since January 9, so that works out to roughly an 8-month uptrend.\nNvidia stock had to consolidate at some point, and there are plenty of support levels nearby that might serve as decent entries for longs. It is now trading right near the $420 price level that served as both resistance (May 30) and support (June and July). The $400 level worked as support on several occasions from May 30 through June 26, and below there comes the demand zone stretching from $373 to $378.\u00a0\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) began its bearish turn lower in late June and it could soon trend below the zero threshold, which would be a much stronger bearish warning for bulls. In mid-July, Nvidia stock ran into stubborn resistance just around $480.\n\nNVDA daily chart\n\n\nShare:\n\n  Feed news\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

The startup built the first LLM to support both Arabic and English, a 7-billion-parameter model trained on one of the world\u2019s largest Arabic/English datasets.\n\u201cWe call it Baby, because we\u2019re proud of it, and we\u2019re building a larger, 40-billion parameter model now,\u201d said Braginskiy.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MetaDialog-Baby-demo-final.mp4\n\u201cOur Baby LLM is currently integrated in one of the biggest governments in the region, and we\u2019re talking with three other governments interested in using it, too,\u201d said Livshits.\nWith more than 3 million people in just 13 square miles, Dubai is a vibrant hub for the region.\n\u201cThe way governments in the Middle East think about AI and advanced tech in general is very bold \u2014 they want to move fast, so we\u2019re training custom models in different languages and will present them at the GITEX conference\u201d said Livshits, who lived in Russia, Israel and the U.S. before moving to Dubai.\nIn February, Saudi Arabia alone announced a $2.4 billion startup fund to help diversify the nation\u2019s economy.\nCorporations Want Custom LLMs\nIn Abu Dhabi, just a hundred miles down the coast, Hussein Al-Natsheh leads a team of engineers and data scientists at Beyond Limits training and fine tuning LLMs. One is already drafting documents for a large energy company and verifying they comply with its standards.\nBeyond Limits also works on models for energy companies, utilities and other customers that will index and search corporate documents, draft marketing materials and more.\n\u201cCompanies need their own LLMs trained on their own data which is confidential, so we have machines reading their data, not us,\u201d said Al-Natsheh, a native of Amman, Jordan, who, prior to joining Beyond Limits, worked on Salma, one of the first Arabic speech assistants.\nDrilling for Data\nNow that data is the new oil, Beyond Limits is developing toolkits to extract it from unstructured files \u2014 corporate emails, PowerPoint and other sources \u2014 so it can help companies train custom LLMs approaching 70 billion parameters in size.\nThe toolkits can help address the lack of data samples from the many Arabic dialects. Indeed, a report from the UAE government on 100 top gen AI uses called for more work on Arabic, a language spoken by nearly half a billion people.\nThe good news is governments and large companies like G42, a regional cloud service company, are pouring resources into the problem. For example, Beyond Limits was able to create its regional headquarters in Dubai thanks to its last funding round, much of which came from G42.\nA Big Boost from Inception\nAll three companies are members of NVIDIA Inception, a free program that helps startups working on cutting-edge technologies like generative AI.\nAs part of Inception, Beyond Limits had access to libraries in NVIDIA NeMo, a framework for building massive gen AI models, and which cut training time in one case from five days to one.\n\u201cNVIDIA software makes our work much easier, and our clients trust NVIDIA technology,\u201d said Al-Natsheh.\nAs part of Inception, Mazzuma got access to cloud GPU services to accelerate its experiments and introductions to potential investors.\n\u201cThat really gave us a boost, and there\u2019s a lot of assurance that comes from working with the best people and tools,\u201d said Genfi.\nTreating Partners Well\nFor its part, MetaDialog trained its Baby LLM on 440 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs using a service operated by MosaicML, an Inception member recently acquired by Databricks.\n\u201cI\u2019ve built many startups, and no company treats its partners as well as NVIDIA,\u201d said Livshits.\nAt top: From left to right, Nii Osae, Hussein Al-Natsheh, Eli Braginskiy, Yakov Livshits and Kofi Genfi.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Cloud Services | Conversational AI | Customer Stories | Inception | Inference | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA A100 | NVIDIA NeMo | Public Sector \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

(NVDA) Being Followed by Smart Money?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA \u2013 After a rough 2022, chip giant NVIDIA (NVDA) has been cashing in on the current AI boom, and the stock has gained more than 220% year-to-date. Despite holding dominance in AI, the company\u2019s disappointing first-quarter financial results seem concerning. So, let\u2019s determine if NVDA is attracting smart money and should investors follow in their footsteps. Read on to know more\u2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Mangeet Kaur Bouns Aug 2, 2023  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular Stories\n\n\u2022 Has the Next Bear Market Already Arrived?\n\u2022 How Low Will Stocks Go?\n\u2022 Why is Stock Market Outlook So Uncertain?\n\u2022 Trump or the Fed More Important to Stock Investors?\n\u2022 Investors in \u201cWait and See\u201d Mode\nView All Top stories\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWith a $1.15 trillion market cap, NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) provides graphics, and compute and networking solutions in the United States, Taiwan, China, and internationally. After a tough 2022, the company has been booming this year due to the significant surge in AI popularity post the launch of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and subsequent demand for the company\u2019s hardware.\nAs one of the biggest winners of the AI boom, NVDA\u2019s stock has gained 122.1% over the past six months and 224.9% year-to-date to close the last trading session at $465.07. Recently, the stock hit a new high of $480.88 on July 14, 2023.\nMoreover, the chip giant is attracting the attention of smart money. Institutions own nearly 65.4% of NVDA, and the total value of holdings is around $750,880.\nThe chip giant is making consistent progress in pushing AI forward via strategic partnerships. On July 26, NVDA, in partnership with ServiceNow Inc. (NOW) and Accenture (ACN), announced the launch of AI Lighthouse, a first-of-its-kind program designed to fast-track the development and adoption of enterprise generative AI capabilities.\n\n\nOn June 26, NVDA partnered with Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) to help businesses leverage their data for generative AI in the data cloud applications. By integrating NVIDIA NeMo with Snowflake, businesses can securely build custom large language models using their proprietary data in the Snowflake Data Cloud. Such partnerships with leading companies should bode well for Nvidia.\nNVDA is also committed to making new, innovative product launches in the AI field. On May 28, NVDA launched\u00a0NVIDIA Spectrum-X\u2122, an accelerated networking platform designed to improve the performance and efficiency of Ethernet-based AI clouds.\nNVIDIA Spectrum-X is built on networking innovations powered by the tight coupling of the\u00a0NVIDIA Spectrum-4 Ethernet switch\u00a0with the\u00a0NVIDIA BlueField\u00ae-3 DPU, achieving 1.7x better overall AI performance and power efficiency.\u00a0World-leading cloud service providers are adopting this platform to scale out generative AI services.\nAlso, in the same month, the company announced a new class of large-memory AI supercomputer, an\u00a0NVIDIA DGX\u2122 supercomputer powered by\u00a0NVIDIA\u00ae\u00a0GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips\u00a0and the\u00a0NVIDIA NVLink\u00ae\u00a0Switch System, created to enable the development of massive, next-generation models for generative AI language applications, recommender systems, and data analytics workloads.\n3 STOCKS TO DOUBLE THIS YEARDespite dominating the AI landscape, NVDA\u2019s first-quarter results paint a disappointing picture. The company\u2019s revenue declined 13.2% year-over-year, and its non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share were 21.2% and 19.9% down, respectively.\nFurthermore, the company is expected to grapple with several macroeconomic headwinds in the near term, including high borrowing costs, lingering supply chain disruptions in the chip industry, and eroding consumer spending amid recessionary pressures.\nHere\u2019s what could influence NVDA\u2019s performance in the upcoming months:\nDeteriorating Financials\n\n\nFor the first quarter that ended April 30, 2023, NVDA\u2019s revenue decreased 13.2% year-over-year to $7.19 billion. The company\u2019s gross profit declined 14.4% from the year-ago value to $4.65 billion. Also, its non-GAAP income from operations was $3.05 billion, a decline of 22.8% year-over-year.\nFurthermore, the company\u2019s non-GAAP net income decreased 21.2% from the prior-year quarter to $2.71 billion, while its non-GAAP EPS came in at $1.09, down 19.9% year-over-year.\nFavorable Analyst Estimates\nAnalysts expect NVDA\u2019s revenue for the fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended July 2023) to increase 65.1% year-over-year to $11.07 billion. The consensus earnings per share estimate of $2.07 for the to-be-reported quarter indicates an improvement of 305.8% year-over-year.\nIn addition, analysts expect the company\u2019s revenue and EPS for the fiscal year (ending January 2024) to increase 61.2% and 137.6% year-over-year to $43.48 billion and $7.93, respectively. Also, NVDA\u2019s revenue and EPS for fiscal 2025 are expected to grow 29.2% and 37.2% year-over-year to $56.18 billion and $10.88, respectively.\nStretched Valuation\nIn terms of forward non-GAAP P/E, NVDA is currently trading at 58.62x, 144% higher than the industry average of 24.03x. The stock\u2019s forward EV/Sales of 26.38x is 800.4% higher than the industry average of 2.93x. Likewise, NVDA\u2019s forward EV/EBITDA multiple of 60.47 is 307.8% higher than the industry average of 14.83.\nAlso, the stock\u2019s forward Price/Sales of 26.45x is 806.6% higher than the industry average of 2.92x. Its forward Price/Cash Flow multiple of 58.20 is 182.9% higher than the industry average of 20.58.\nRobust Profitability\nNVDA\u2019s trailing-12-month gross profit margin of 56.31% is 16.2% higher than the 48.45% industry average. Its trailing 12-month\u00a0EBITDA margin\u00a0of 23.53% is 164% higher than the 8.92% industry average. Also, the stock\u2019s trailing 12-month net income margin of 18.52% is significantly higher than the industry average of 2.11%.\nFurthermore, NVDA\u2019s trailing 12-month ROCE, ROTC, and ROTA of 18.86%, 7.52%, and 10.78% are favorably higher than the industry averages of 0.50%, 2.09%, and 0.06%, respectively.\n POWR Ratings Reflect Uncertainty\n\n\nNVDA\u2019s mixed fundamentals are reflected in its overall C rating, equating to Neutral in our proprietary POWR Ratings system. The POWR Ratings are calculated by considering 118 distinct factors, with each factor weighted to an optimal degree.\nOur proprietary rating system also evaluates each stock based on eight distinct categories. NVDA has a B grade for Quality, in sync with higher-than-industry profitability.\nNVDA has an A grade for Sentiment and a C for Growth, consistent with its weak financials and optimistic analyst expectations.\nOn the other hand, the stock has an F grade for Value, consistent with its higher valuation relative to its industry peers. Also, its 24-month beta of 2.02 justifies a D grade for Stability.\n\n\nNVDA is ranked #45 out of 92 stocks in the\u00a0Semiconductor & Wireless Chip\u00a0industry.\nBeyond what I have stated above, we have also given NVDA grades for Momentum. Get all NVDA\u2019s POWR Ratings\u00a0here.\nBottom Line\nNVDA\u2019s stock is currently trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of $415.93 and $258.35, respectively. After crashing in 2022, the stock has been riding high on the current AI boom. However, the chip giant reported disappointing financials in the first quarter of 2023 and could face several macroeconomic headwinds in the near term.\n\n\nGiven NVDA\u2019s bleak financials, significantly high valuation, and near-term macroeconomic uncertainties, it could be wise for investors to wait for a better entry point in this chip stock.\nStocks to Consider Instead of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)\nGiven its uncertain short-term prospects, the odds of NVDA outperforming in the weeks and months ahead are compromised. However, there are many industry peers with much more impressive POWR Ratings. So, consider these three A-rated (Strong Buy) stocks from the Semiconductor & Wireless industry instead:\nInfineon Technologies AG ADR (IFNNY)\n\n\nSUMCO Corporation (SUOPY)\nRenesas Electronics Corporation (RNECF)\n43 Year Investment Pro Shares Top Picks\nSteve Reitmeister is best known for his timely market outlooks & unique trading plans to stay on the right side of the market action.

He says the chip can also help firms save significant money on capital costs to achieve the same baseline performance as CPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has a mantra that he has uttered enough times that it almost became a joke during his SIGGRAPH 2023 keynote last week: \u201cthe more you buy, the more you save.\u201d\nHuang was referring to the GPU giant\u2019s assertion that its AI chips can save companies significant money on costs compared to traditional CPUs for what he views as the future: data centers, fueled by demand for generative AI capabilities, relying on large language models (LLMs) to answer user queries and generate content for a wide range of applications.\n[Related: 7 Big Announcements Nvidia Made At SIGGRAPH 2023: New AI Chips, Software And More]\n\n\nid\nunit-1659132512259\n\n\ntype\nSponsored post\n\n\n\u201cThe canonical use case of the future is a large language model on the front end of just about everything: every single application, every single database, whenever you interact with a computer, you\u2019ll likely be first engaged in a large language model,\u201d he said.\nNvidia\u2019s AI chips can save money for operators of data centers focused on large language models and other compute-intensive workloads, according to Huang\u2019s argument, because the chips run much faster and more efficiently than CPUs, and the more chips they buy, the more those savings increase.\n\u201cThis is the reason why accelerated computing is going to be the path forward. And this is the reason why the world\u2019s data centers are very quickly transitioning to accelerated computing,\u201d Huang said.\n\u201cAnd some people say\u2014and you guys might have heard, I don\u2019t know who said it\u2014but the more you buy, the more you save. And that\u2019s wisdom,\u201d he added, as industry enthusiasts chuckled along.\nBut despite the jokey atmosphere, Huang was serious about the underlying claims, stressing that these points should be the main takeaways from his keynote.\nSaving On Energy And Capital Costs With AI Chips\nTo illustrate the benefits of Nvidia\u2019s chips in data centers, Huang gave a couple examples comparing them to CPUs, one focused on how they can reduce a data center\u2019s overall power budget while improving performance and the other on how the chips can significantly reduce capital costs.\nHuang\u2019s examples were based around the company\u2019s most advanced AI chip yet, the Grace Hopper Superchip, which combines a 72-core Grace CPU and a Hopper H100 GPU connected with a high-bandwidth chip-to-chip interconnect as well as 480GB of LPDDR5x memory and, in the case of an updated version coming next year, 141GB of HBM3e high-bandwidth memory.\nIn the power budget example, Huang offered a hypothethical data center with a $100 million budget that was running what he viewed as a representative group of workloads for generative AI use cases: Meta\u2019s Llama 2 LLM used in conjunction with a vector database and the Stable Diffusion XL LLM.\nThe data center operator could use $100 million to buy 8,800 of Intel\u2019s Xeon Platinum 8480+ CPU, one the fastest and highest-core-count processors from its latest server chip lineup, and those processors would give the data center a power budget of 5 megawatts, Huang said.\nBy contrast, $100 million could also buy 2,500 Grace Hopper Superchips and reduce the data center\u2019s power budget to 3 megawatts. Plus, the data center would be able to run inference on the LLM and database workloads 12 times faster than the CPU-only configuration, according to Huang.\nThat translates into a 20-fold improvement in energy efficiency, he added, and it would take a \u201cvery long time\u201d for a traditional chipmaker to achieve that level of improvement following Moore\u2019s law, the observation championed by Intel that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit would double every two years, bringing about boosts in performance and efficiency.\n\u201cThis is a giant step up in efficiency and throughput,\u201d Huang said.\nIn the other example, Huang took the same $100 million data center with 8,800 Intel Xeon CPUs and said if a data center operator wanted to achieve the same performance with Grace Hopper Superchips, it would only cost $8 million and a power budget of 260 kilowatts.\n\u201cSo 20 times less power and 12 times less cost,\u201d he said.\nPartners Say Nvidia\u2019s Mantra Is Right On\nTwo executives at top Nvidia partners told CRN that their companies have proven out that customers can improve performance and save money in many instances for compute-heavy applications when they switch from a data center infrastructure based around CPUs to one that is driven by GPUs.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent the last five to 10 years getting folks to go from CPU to using the GPU, which has exponentially sped up these jobs and collapses costs,\u201d said Andy Lin, CTO at Houston, Texas-based Mark III Systems, which was named Nvidia\u2019s top North American health care partner this year.\nLin said he\u2019s excited by the possibilities of how a chip like Grace Hopper could improve performance and efficiency further by creating memory coherency between the CPU and GPU in addition to removing unnecessary features that would be found in a general-purpose x86 CPU.\n\u201cWhen you have something purpose-built for these types of workloads, the economics tend to be better because they\u2019re designed specifically for that versus having a lot of waste in general purpose x86 CPU where they\u2019ve got stuff that has to account for all possibilities, not just your deep learning jobs, not just your machine learning or your accelerator-enabled software,\u201d he said.\nBrett Newman, vice president of marketing and customer engagement for high-performance computing and AI at Plymouth, Mass.-based Microway, said most of his customers often take advantage of savings they can achieve in both capital costs and energy when moving workloads from the CPU to the GPU.\n\u201cThe most frequent outcome is really a blend. They\u2019ll say, \u2018Great, I\u2019m going to [use] some of the savings that I might have had through accelerated computing to [get] an overall improvement in performance. But I\u2019m also going to take the power and energy efficiency savings as well,\u2019\u201d he said.\nThis is a consistent theme Newman has seen ever since Nvidia pioneered GPU computing several years ago to accelerate scientific computing workloads.\nNow with many organizations developing generative AI applications to meet high industry demand, there is a greater need to squeeze out as much performance as possible from GPUs, he added.\n\u201cThey have this constant appetite for computing, and they\u2019ll take any computational horsepower advances they can get. Sometimes saving on the power budget is lovely, but sometimes they\u2019ll go, \u2018Great, I then want to run the next application that is more computationally hungry too,\u201d Newman said.\nIntel, AMD Ramp Up Competition With New AI Chips\nWhat Huang didn\u2019t mention during his SIGGRAPH keynote is that while Intel is trying to promote its CPUs for some AI workloads, the larger rival is making a major push to sell powerful AI chips that compete with Nvidia\u2019s GPUs. This includes the Gaudi deep learning processors from its Habana business and data center GPUs, the most powerful of which launched earlier this year.\nWith Nvidia\u2019s \u201cincredible products and road maps\u201d in mind, Newman said, he doesn\u2019t think Intel will become more competitive until the semiconductor giant merges its AI chip road maps and incorporates its Gaudi chip technology into future GPUs, starting with Falcon Shores in 2025.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of when things will come to market and what are they like when they do,\u201d he said.\nWhen it comes to Nvidia\u2019s other major rival, AMD, Newman believes the competing chip designer could \u201chave a lot of the right things at the right time\u201d when it launches its Instinct MI300 chips later this year.\n\u201cRight now, it feels like everyone wants a piece of the pie. And the pie is growing so much that there might be enough for everyone to have a really healthy businesses out of it,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The iPhone moment of AI, if you will, where all of the technologies of artificial intelligence came together in such a way that it is now possible for us to enjoy AI in so many different applications,\u201d he said.\nIt was only five years ago, Huang noted, that Nvidia demonstrated the chip designer\u2019s first capabilities in using GPUs to render ray-traced graphics in real time\u2014that is, graphics that realistically simulate the way light interacts with objects.\nSince then, Nvidia\u2019s definition of a GPU has expanded, going from a single graphics chip to eight powerful GPUs linked together in a server, according to Huang. The GPUs forming the larger GPU system are Nvidia\u2019s H100 chips, based on the company\u2019s Hopper architecture, that are in high demand due to their ability to run generative AI applications fast and efficiently.\nThe company has also made a large expansion into systems, software and cloud services over the past several years with products like the Nvidia DGX AI servers, the Nvidia AI Enterprise software suite and the Nvidia DGX Cloud AI supercomputing service.\n\u201cWe want to have the ability to not just do generative AI in the cloud, but to be able to do it literally everywhere: in the cloud, data centers, workstations or PCs. And we want to do this by making it possible for these really complicated stacks to run,\u201d he said.\nThe announcements Nvidia made around an updated Grace Hopper Superchip with extra high-bandwidth memory, the versatile L40S data center GPU and a new version of Nvidia AI Enterprise, among several other software updates, reinvigorated one executive at a top Nvidia channel partner.\n\u201cI love what Nvidia is doing. They keep progressively pushing the envelope in every area, and they\u2019re not resting on their laurels,\u201d said Andy Lin, CTO at Houston, Texas-based Mark III Systems.\nWhat follows are the most important things you need to know from the announcements Nvidia made at SIGGRAPH 2023, ranging from the updated Grace Hopper and the new L40S GPU to big updates for the Nvidia AI Enterpise and Nvidia Omniverse software platforms, plus more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia Reveals New Grace Hopper Superchip With 141GB Of HBM3e Memory\nA few months after beginning production for its Grace Hopper Superchip, Nvidia revealed a new version of the CPU-GPU hybrid chip that comes with a massive 141GB of HBM3e high-bandwidth memory, allowing it to run generative AI models 3.5 times larger than the original version.\nThe revamped GH200\u2019s memory is a significant upgrade over the 96GB HBM3 capacity of the original Grace Hopper, and it\u2019s the first processor to use HBM3e technology, which is 50 percent faster than the original Superchip\u2019s HBM3 format, according to Nvidia.\nLike the original GH200, this upcoming iteration comes with a 72-core Grace CPU based on Arm\u2019s Neoverse V2 architecture and a Hopper H100 GPU that are connected by a high-bandwidth NVLink chip-to-chip interconnect that runs at 900GB/s.\nIn his SIGGRAPH 2023 keynote, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said by connecting two revamped GH200s using an NVLink interconnect in a server, it turns the two chips into a \u201csuper-sized Superchip\u201d that has 144 CPU cores, 10TB/s of frame buffer bandwidth and 282GB of HBM3e memory.\nHuang promised that the revamped GH200 will enable massive cost savings for running inference on large AI models for live applications.\n\u201cYou could take just about any large language model you like and put it into this and it will inference like crazy. The inference cost of large language models will drop significantly because look how small this computer is. And you could scale this out in the world\u2019s data centers,\u201d he said.\nNvidia said systems with the revamped GH200 chip are expected to arrive in the second quarter of next year, adding that the Superchip is fully compatible with its MGX server specification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia Announces New L40S GPU For AI And 3-D Applications\nNvidia revealed a versatile data center GPU that can run AI training and inference workloads faster than its previous flagship A100 GPU in addition to demanding graphics and simulation applications.\nCalled the L40S, the GPU is based on Nvidia\u2019s Ada Lovelace architecture, and it comes with 48GB of memory, fourth-generation Tensor Cores and an FP8 Transformer Engine to provide more than 1.45 petaflops of \u201ctensor processing power,\u201d according to Nvidia.\nThese attributes help the processor deliver up to 20 percent faster inference performance and up to 70 percent faster training performance for generative AI models compared to the A100.\nFor high-fidelity visualization workloads like real-time rendering and 3-D content creation, the L40S takes advantage of 142 third-generation RT Cores to provide 212 teraflops of ray-tracing performance, which Nvidia said enables \u201cimmersive visual experiences and photorealistic content.\u201d\nThe L40S is also a workhorse when it comes to engineering and scientific simulation applications, thanks to its 18,176 CUDA cores, which gives the GPU nearly five times better single-precision floating-point (FP32) performance than the A100 for \u201ccomplex calculations and data-intensive analyses.\u201d\nThe L40S will be available starting this fall in systems based on Nvidia\u2019s OVX reference architecture from Asus, Dell Technologies, Gigabyte, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, Supermicro and other vendors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHugging Face Uses Nvidia DGX Cloud For New AI Training Service\nNvidia announced a new partnership with AI development platform Hugging Face that will allow the platform\u2019s developers to train and tune large language models on the Nvidia DGX Cloud platform.\nUsed by more than 15,000 organizations, Hugging Face will enable the capability through a new service called Training Cluster as a Service, which Nvidia said is meant to \u201csimplify the creation of new and custom generative AI models for the enterprise.\u201d\nThe GPU designer said Training Cluster as a Service will give Hugging Face\u2019s users \u201cone-click\u201d access to Nvidia\u2019s \u201cmulti-node AI supercomputing platform\u201d through DGX Cloud, which is currently expanding to cloud service providers after being made initially available on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\n\u201cWith Training Cluster as a Service, powered by DGX Cloud, companies will be able to leverage their unique data for Hugging Face to create uniquely efficient models in record time,\u201d Nvidia added.\nThe service is expected to launch in the \u201ccoming months.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia Launches Free AI Workbench Toolkit To Customize Generative AI Models\nNvidia revealed a free toolkit that will let developers create, test and customize pre-trained generative AI models on a PC or workstation and then scale it to any data center or cloud infrastructure.\nCalled Nvidia AI Workbench, the toolkit provides a \u201csimplified interface\u201d that eliminates the busywork of \u201chunting through multiple online repositories for the right framework, tools and containers\u201d that can bog down developers when fine-tuning AI models, according to Nvidia.\nThe toolkit simplifies AI model customization by giving developers easy access to enterprise-grade models, frameworks, software development kits and libraries from open-source repositories.\nNvidia said several AI infrastructure providers, including Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc., Lambda, Lenovo and Supermicro, plan to offer Nvidia AI Workbench in the latest generation of their multi-GPU-capable desktop workstations, mobile workstations and virtual workstations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia AI Enterprise 4.0 Comes With New LLM, Kubernetes Features\nNvidia is rolling out a new version of its Nvidia AI Enterprise software suite with new features for creating and customizing large language model applications and deploying AI models in Kubernetes containers.\nLaunched in 2021, Nvidia AI Enterprise gives organizations the AI frameworks, pre-trained models and tools they need, among other components, to develop and deploy AI applications.\nThe fresh features in Nvidia AI Enterprise 4.0 include Nvidia NeMo, the company\u2019s cloud-native framework for building, customizing and deploying large language models for a variety of generative AI use cases such as rendering images, videos and 3-D models from text prompts.\nThe new version will also include Nvidia Triton Management Service, which automates the process of deploying AI models through multiple Triton Inference Server instances in Kubernetes clusters to optimize performance and hardware utilization.\nAnother incoming feature is Nvidia Base Command Manager Essentials, which is cluster management software that helps organizations \u201cmaximize performance and utilization of AI servers across data center, multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud environments.\u201d\nNvidia AI Enterprise has been certified to run on Nvidia-certified systems, Nvidia DGX systems as well as major cloud platforms and newly announced Nvidia RTX workstations, according to the company.\nThe software suite has been integrated into services from ServiceNow, Snowflake and Dell Technologies as well as the partner marketplaces of Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. Integration is also coming to several MLOps tools, including Microsoft\u2019s Azure Machine Learning, ClearML, Domino Data Labs, Run:AI and Weight & Biases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia Reveals New RTX Workstation GPUs\nNvidia announced four new Nvidia RTX desktop GPUs that use the company\u2019s Ada Lovelace architecture to power heavy-duty applications for AI, graphics and real-time rendering.\nThe new GPUs consist of the RTX 5000, RTX 4500 and RTX 4000. They each include CUDA cores for computationally complex workloads like scientific simulations, third-generation RT cores for graphics-heavy workloads, and fourth-gen Tensor Cores for AI training and inference.\nThe RTX 5000 comes with 32GB of GDDR6 memory while the RTX 4500 has 24GB of GDDR6 memory and the RTX 4000 has 20GB of GDDR6 memory. They also come with support for high-resolution augmented reality and virtual reality devices.\nThe RTX 5000 is available now in desktop PCs from HP Inc. as well as distributors like Leadtek, PNY and Ryoya Electro. The RTX 4500 and RTX 4000 will be available this fall in systems from Boxx, Dell Technologies, HP and Lenovo as well as through global distributors.\nNvidia also announced that PC workstations with up to four RTX 6000 GPUs as well as its Nvidia AI Enterprise and Nvidia AI Omniverse Enterprise software will be available from system builders, including Boxx, Dell, HP and Lenovo, starting this fall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia Doubles Down On OpenUSD 3-D Framework With Omniverse Platform\nNvidia said it\u2019s bringing new features to its Omniverse 3-D application development platform to accelerate the \u201ccreation of virtual worlds and advanced workflows for industrial digitalization.\u201d\nWith Nvidia calling the new batch of features a \u201cmajor release,\u201d the platform will soon include Omniverse Kit Extension Registry, which makes it easier for developers to build custom apps by equipping them with a central repository for accessing, sharing and managing extensions.\nOmniverse will also receive new application and experience templates to help developers get started with Omniverse and OpenUSD, the open 3-D framework that lets Omniverse connect with other 3-D applications made by other organizations.\nNew rendering optimizations are coming to the platform, too, which will let Omniverse take advantage of enhancements in the latest Nvidia RTX GPUs. These optimizations include the integration of Nvidia\u2019s AI-based upscaling technology, DLSS 3, into the Omniverse RTX Renderer as well as a new AI denoiser for enabling \u201creal-time 4K path tracing of massive industrial scenes.\u201d\nThe new release of Omniverse will also receive new extended reality developer tools and updates to applications such as Omniverse USD Composer, which lets users create large-scale, OpenUSD-based scenes, and Omniverse Audio2Face, which creates facial animations and gestures from audio.\nIn addition to the new features, Nvidia said it was rolling out a \u201cbroad range of frameworks, resources and services for developers and companies to accelerate the adoption\u201d of OpenUSD, which stands for Universal Scene Description. It also announced new Omniverse Cloud APIs to help developers \u201cseamlessly implement and deploy OpenUSD pipelines and applications.\u201d\n\u201cJust as HTML ignited a major computing revolution of the 2D internet, OpenUSD will spark the era of collaborative 3D and industrial digitalization,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The results covering the May-July period exceeded Nvidia\u2019s projections for astronomical sales growth propelled by the company\u2019s specialized chips \u2014 key components that help power different forms of artificial intelligence, such as Open AI\u2019s popular ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Bard chatbots.\u201cThis is a new computing platform, if you will, a new computing transition that is happening,\u201d Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Wednesday during a conference call with analysts. Nvidia\u2019s revenue for its fiscal second quarter doubled from the same time last year to $13.51 billion, culminating in a profit of $6.2 billion, or $2.48 per share, more than nine times more than the company made a year ago. Both figures were well above the projections of analysts polled by FactSet Research.\n\nAnd the momentum is still building. The Santa Clara, California, company predicted its revenue for its August-October quarter will total $16 billion, nearly tripling its sales from the same time last year. Analysts had been anticipating $12.6 billion in revenue for that period encompassing Nvidia\u2019s fiscal third quarter, according to FactSet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                            RELATED COVERAGE\n                        \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrench publishers and authors sue Meta over copyright works used in AI training\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI pioneers who channeled \u2018hedonistic\u2019 machines win computer science\u2019s top prize\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChip Ganassi Racing partners with OpenAI in first motorsports venture for AI company\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s stock price surged 6% in extended trading after the numbers came out. The shares already have more than tripled so far this year, a run-up that has boosted Nvidia\u2019s market value to $1.2 trillion \u2014 a threshold that thrust the company into the tech industry\u2019s elite. If stock rises similarly during Thursday\u2019s regular trading session, it will mark yet another record high for Nvidia\u2019s shares and boost the company\u2019s market value by another $75 billion or so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther stalwarts that are currently or have been recently valued at $1 trillion or above are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google\u2019s corporate parent Alphabet. \n\nNow all those tech giants as well as a long line of other firms are snapping up Nvidia chips as they wade deeper into AI \u2014 a movement that\u2019s enabling cars to drive by themselves, and automating the creation of stories, art and music.Nvidia has carved out an early lead in the hardware and software needed in the AI-focused shift, partly because Huang began to nudge the company into what was then seen as a still half-baked technology more than a decade ago. While others were still debating the merits of AI, Huang already was looking at ways that Nvidia chipsets known as graphics processing units might be tweaked for AI-related applications to expand beyond their early inroads in video gaming.By 2018, Huang was convinced that AI would trigger a tectonic shift in technology similar to Apple\u2019s 2007 introduction of the iPhone igniting a mobile computing revolution. That conclusion led Huang into what resulted in what he calls a \u201cbet-the-company moment.\u201d At the time Huang doubled down on AI, Nvidia\u2019s market value stood at about $120 billion.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say it was worth it to bet the company\u201d on AI, Huang, 60, said during a presentation earlier this month.Huang\u2019s foresight gave Nvidia a head start in designing software to complement its chips tailored for AI applications, creating \u201ca moat\u201d that other major chipmakers such as Intel and AMD are having trouble getting around during a period of intense demand that is expected to continue into next year, said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Nvidia is increasingly pitching a Lego-like combination of GPUs, memory chips and more conventional processing chips enclosed in a big package. In a demonstration earlier this month, Huang showed one such room-sized structure, joking about how it might look if delivered to a doorstep by Amazon.\u201cEverybody else is trying to catch them now that they see the opportunity is there.\u201d Rasgon said.Huang\u2019s vision has prompted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives to hail him as \u201cthe Godfather of AI,\u201d and established him as one of the world\u2019s wealthiest people with an estimated fortune of $42 billion.\n\nWhile Ives still sees plenty of upside in Nvidia\u2019s future growth and stock price, other market observers believe investors are getting carried away.\u201cThis level of hype is dangerous as it could lead investors to assume that these stocks are a silver bullet to build long-term wealth \u2014 and they are not, at least not on their own,\u201d warned Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group.___O\u2019Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMICHAEL LIEDTKE\n\n\n                Liedtke has been covering technology and wide range of other business topics for The Associated Press since the turn of the century.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        twitter\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        mailto\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATT O\u2019BRIEN\n\n\n                O\u2019Brien covers the business of technology and artificial intelligence for The Associated Press.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        mailto\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                            Most read\n                        \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump administration deports hundreds of immigrants even as a judge orders their removals be stopped\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Danish Viking blood is boiling.\u2019 Danes boycott US goods with fervor as others in Europe do so too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFDA staff return to crowded offices, broken equipment and missing chairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge questions Trump administration on whether it ignored order to turn around deportation flights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomeland Security says professor deported to Lebanon with US visa supported Hezbollah leader\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

One partner says the channel changes reflect Nvidia\u2019s increased focus on selling software and cloud services in the channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s Alvin Da Costa\nNvidia has split its global channel chief role into two, moving the GPU giant\u2019s top channel leader to manage relationships with global systems integrators and service delivery partners while tapping another executive to handle its remaining partners.\nAlvin Da Costa was vice president of Nvidia\u2019s global partner organization until June, when he became vice president of a newly formed group, the global consulting organization. As the new group\u2019s leader, Da Costa is now chiefly focused on relationships with global systems integrators (GSIs) like Deloitte, Infosys, WiPro and Capgemini as well as the global expansion of service delivery partners like Quantiphi, Slalom Consulting and Data Monsters, he said.\n[Related: Nvidia \u2018Doubling Down\u2019 On Partners With DGX Cloud Service]\n\n\nid\nunit-1659132512259\n\n\ntype\nSponsored post\n\n\nDarrin Neil Chen, formerly the head of worldwide channels for Nvidia\u2019s networking business, is taking over relationships with Nvidia\u2019s remaining partners, which includes solution providers like World Wide Technology and systems integrators like Mark III Systems. As the new vice president of go-to-market and operations for global partners, Chen is also now in charge of the Nvidia Partner Network program.\nCraig Weinstein, Nvidia\u2019s North America channel chief, will continue to report directly to Paul Bommarito, vice president of Americas enterprise sales, according to Da Costa. On the channel side, however, Weinstein will work more closely with Chen instead of Da Costa.\nThe role changes were made as Nvidia views partners as a critical way to sell its growing portfolio of components, systems, software and services for AI and other accelerated computing workloads, which has allowed the company to transform from a GPU designer to a \u201cfull-stack computing company.\u201d\nIn an exclusive interview with CRN last week, Da Costa said he moved into the new role because he wanted to focus on Nvidia\u2019s growing number of GSI and service delivery partners.\n\u201cWe were able to significantly grow it to the point where now I\u2019m building a brand-new organization around it because we see the potential with them as well,\u201d he said.\nDa Costa said because of the partner growth, it made sense to divide responsibilities between him, Chen and Geoff Fancher, who has led global distribution since 2017.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is we decided is to balance out the workload\u2014it makes it easier to have three leaders as opposed to me doing everything,\u201d he said.\nDa Costa said Nvidia\u2019s broader set of partners can benefit from the company\u2019s expanding relationships with service delivery partners because a solution provider or systems integrator can subcontract a service delivery partner to fill gaps in services they may have for Nvidia customer deals.\n\u201cSo, for example, WWT may be a very large partner that gets into a very specific deal but needs help on [Large Language Model] services. Well, they may contract Quantiphi to help them because they\u2019re a very niche player with LLM services,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd same thing with our GSIs. When you have a very large GSI, they can subcontract to one of these smaller service partners to help them with an implementation. So it actually benefits the whole channel across the board,\u201d he added.\nNvidia Hunts For New Cloud-Focused Partners Amid Broader Investments\nNvidia made the organizational changes as it continues to \u201cinvest in all partner types,\u201d which have grown \u201csignificantly over the last three years,\u201d according to Da Costa. These investments have resulted in the company expanding its partner-facing teams.\n\u201cWe\u2019re growing our programs team. We have some head count there. We\u2019re adding people to our operations team\u201d because the company wants to make it easier for partners to do business with Nvidia, he said. \u201cAnd then we\u2019re growing the services organization as well, both from the GSI side as well as the [service delivery partner] side.\u201d\nThe company declined to share any figures illustrating partner growth.\nOne area where Nvidia is looking to recruit partners are companies that are focused on providing IT services around cloud computing infrastructure, according to Da Costa. The company plans to identify recruits in this area by looking at who is doing significant work with major cloud service providers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with companies like [Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure] to find out what are the top service partners that they would typically work with that are maybe more cloud-specific, so we\u2019re going to be looking at on-boarding some new ones as well,\u201d he said.\nDa Costa credited Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang for giving the company\u2019s partner organizations the resources they need to grow with the channel.\n\u201cJensen has been a very big advocate of partners, and he\u2019s really giving us the latitude to make our partners profitable, to make them successful,\u201d he said.\nNvidia\u2019s partner efforts have come a long way since the company hired veteran channel executives like Da Costa and Weinstein several years ago and started the Nvidia Partner Network program, Da Costa added.\n\u201cNvidia is really a channel company,\u201d he said.\nNvidia\u2019s Channel Changes Reflect Growing Software, Cloud Focus\nNvidia has made a major push in recent years into data center software for hybrid cloud environments. This includes Nvidia AI Enterprise, which equips organizations with the software they need to develop and run AI applications, and Nvidia Omniverse, which does the same but for 3-D internet applications.\nMore recently, the company released the DGX Cloud supercomputing service, which gives enterprises quick access to the tools and GPU-powered infrastructure to create and run AI applications for a monthly cost starting at $36,999. The service is available on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, and it will eventually expand to Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and other cloud service providers.\nAn executive at a top Nvidia service delivery partner told CRN that the organizational changes reflect the fact that the GPU designer is increasingly focused on selling software and cloud services as a full-stack computing company\u2014and doing so with partners represents a \u201cwhole different motion.\u201d\nThis is a big change from when the Nvidia partner ecosystem was mostly focused on \u201cdelivering value-added infrastructure and services to customers at the hardware and infrastructure layer,\u201d said Asif Hasan, co-founder at Marlborough, Mass.-based Quantiphi, which won Nvidia\u2019s Service Delivery Partner of the Year award for the second time in a row earlier this year.\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s at an application layer, which really needs deep industry expertise to be able to understand the problems that customers are having to solve for,\u201d he said.\nThis focus on the application layer requires partners like Quantiphi to provide \u201cadvisory, application-level engineering and machine learning-level engineering services in addition to all of the hardware and infrastructure services that\u201d other partners have historically provided, Hasan added.\nAs a result of Nvidia\u2019s growing investments in software and services, Quantiphi\u2019s business with the company has grown roughly six times over 18 to 24 months, according to the executive.\nMore than half of the revenue Quantiphi makes through Nvidia is around Large Language Models, Hasan said. Other significant areas where the company makes money are around Nvidia\u2019s software development kits for speech-to-text and text-to-speech applications as well as industry-specific SDKs like Nvidia Clara for drug discovery and MONAI for AI-assisted radiology imaging.\nThe main way Quantiphi makes money through these services and SDKs is the Nvidia AI Enterprise software suite, for which the chip designer charges thousands of dollars per GPU for a subscription or perpetual license in addition to hourly consumption-based pricing for cloud marketplaces.\nQuantiphi also makes money through Nvidia Omniverse, which charges hundreds to thousands of dollars per user based on the user type and subscription length.\nAll of these services drive consumption of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, whether they\u2019re being purchased in a server or rented through a cloud instance, which can help boost Quantiphi\u2019s business too.\n\u201cThe entry point of most of our end customers is more from an industry application standpoint, but that also has an effect on the number of GPUs that are being consumed in various scenarios, and we get attribution, regardless of whether that\u2019s happening in the cloud or on-premises,\u201d Hasan said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They are expected to be delivered by the end of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 Nvidia\n\n\n\nKaust already owns at least 200 Nvidia A100s, and is building the Shaheen III supercomputer featuring 700 Grace Hoppers, for the end of the year.The UAE has secured 'thousands' of Nvidia GPUs, and has developed its own open-source large language model, Falcon, at the state-owned Technology Innovation Institute in Masdar City, Abu Dhabi. That model was trained on 384 A100 chips.UAE-based tech company G42, which has state ties, last month announced a ~$900 million deal with Cerebras for AI supercomputers based on its unique chip architecture, built in the US.Earlier this month, it was revealed that Chinese tech giants are looking to buy $5 billion in Nvidia chips. However, due to export restrictions, the local companies can only acquire pared-back variants of Nvidia's chips, including the A800 and H800.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in The Compute, Storage & Networking Channel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Week 2025 - Client Guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17 Dec 2024\n\n\n\n\nNetherlands opens ChipNL Competence Centre to boost semiconductor innovation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nSoftware and hardware co-design: Optimizing the next generation of compute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in Middle East\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDCD>Connect | Compute MENA - Sponsorship Brochure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25 Sep 2024\n\n\n\n\nOoredoo secures $552m financing for data center expansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nMENA's next growth frontiers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\n\nUAE\n\n\nNvidia H100 Hopper\n\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\n\nH100\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\nKAUST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

Companies are going to extreme lengths to make do with shortages of GPUs, the chips at the heart of generative AI programs.A Nvidia Corp.

Please also consider subscribing to WIREDAround 11 am Eastern on weekdays, as Europe prepares to sign off, the US East Coast hits the midday slog, and Silicon Valley fires up, Tel Aviv-based startup Astria\u2019s AI image generator is as busy as ever. The company doesn\u2019t profit much from this burst of activity, however.Companies like Astria that are developing AI technologies use graphics processors (GPUs) to train software that learns patterns in photos and other media. The chips also handle inference, or the harnessing of those lessons to generate content in response to user prompts. But the global rush to integrate AI into every app and program, combined with lingering manufacturing challenges dating back to early in the pandemic, have put GPUs in short supply.That supply crunch means that at peak times the ideal GPUs at Astria\u2019s main cloud computing vendor (Amazon Web Services), which the startup needs to generate images for its clients, are at full capacity, and the company has to use more powerful\u2014and more expensive\u2014GPUs to get the job done. Costs quickly multiply. \u201cIt\u2019s just like, how much more will you pay?\u201d says Astria\u2019s founder, Alon Burg, who jokes that he wonders whether investing in shares in Nvidia, the world\u2019s largest maker of GPUs, would be more lucrative than pursuing his startup. Astria charges its customers in a way that balances out those expensive peaks, but it is still spending more than desired. \u201cI would love to reduce costs and recruit a few more engineers,\u201d Burg says.There is no immediate end in sight for the GPU supply crunch. The market leader, Nvidia, which makes up about 60 to 70 percent of the global supply of AI server chips, announced yesterday that it sold a record $10.3 billion worth of data center GPUs in the second quarter, up 171 percent from a year ago, and that sales should outpace expectations again in the current quarter. \u201cOur demand is tremendous,\u201d CEO Jensen Huang told analysts on an earnings call. Global spending on AI-focused chips is expected to hit $53 billion this year and to more than double over the next four years, according to market researcher Gartner.The ongoing shortages mean that companies are having to innovate to maintain access to the resources they need. Some are pooling cash to ensure that they won\u2019t be leaving users in the lurch. Everywhere, engineering terms like \u201coptimization\u201d and \u201csmaller model size\u201d are in vogue as companies try to cut their GPU needs, and investors this year have bet hundreds of millions of dollars on startups whose software helps companies make do with the GPUs they\u2019ve got. One of those startups, Modular, has received inquiries from over 30,000 potential customers since launching in May, according to its cofounder and president, Tim Davis. Adeptness at navigating the crunch over the next year could become a determinant of survival in the generative AI economy.\u201cWe live in a capacity-constrained world where we have to use creativity to wedge things together, mix things together, and balance things out,\u201d says Ben Van Roo, CEO of AI-based business writing aid Yurts. \u201cI refuse to spend a bunch of money on compute.\u201dCloud computing providers are very aware that their customers are struggling for capacity. Surging demand has \u201ccaught the industry off guard a bit,\u201d says Chetan Kapoor, a director of product management at AWS.The time needed to acquire and install new GPUs in their data centers have put the cloud giants behind, and the specific arrangements in highest demand also add stress. Whereas most applications can operate from processors loosely distributed across the world, the training of generative AI programs has tended to perform best when GPUs are physically clustered tightly together, sometimes 10,000 chips at a time. That ties up availability like never before.Kapoor says AWS\u2019 typical generative AI customer is accessing hundreds of GPUs. \u201cIf there\u2019s an ask from a particular customer that needs 1,000 GPUs tomorrow, that\u2019s going to take some time for us to slot them in,\u201d Kapoor says. \u201cBut if they are flexible, we can work it out.\u201dAWS has suggested clients adopt more expensive, customized services through its Bedrock offering, where chip needs are baked into the offering without clients having to worry. Or customers could try AWS\u2019 unique AI chips, Trainium and Inferentia, which have registered an unspecified uptick in adoption, Kapoor says. Retrofitting programs to operate on those chips instead of Nvidia options has traditionally been a chore, though Kapoor says moving to Trainium now takes as little as changing two lines of software code in some cases.Challenges abound elsewhere too. Google Cloud hasn\u2019t been able to keep up with demand for its homegrown GPU-equivalent, known as a TPU, according to an employee not authorized to speak to media. A spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud unit has dangled refunds to customers who aren\u2019t using GPUs they reserved, the Information reported in April. Microsoft declined to comment.Cloud companies would prefer that customers reserve capacity months to years out so those providers can better plan their own GPU purchases and installations. But startups, which generally have minimal cash and intermittent needs as they sort out their products, have been reluctant to commit, preferring buy-as-you-go plans. That has led to a surge in business for alternative cloud providers, such as Lambda Labs and CoreWeave, which have pulled in nearly $500 million from investors this year between them. Astria, the image generator startup, is among their customers.AWS isn\u2019t exactly happy about losing out to new market entrants, so it\u2019s considering additional options. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking through different solutions in the short- and the long-term to provide the experience our customers are looking for,\u201d Kapoor says, declining to elaborate.Shortages at the cloud vendors are cascading down to their clients, which include some big names in tech. Social media platform Pinterest is expanding its use of AI to better serve users and advertisers, according to chief technology officer Jeremy King. The company is considering using Amazon\u2019s new chips. \u201cWe need more GPUs, like everyone,\u201d King says. \u201cThe chip shortage is a real thing.\u201d\u00a0OpenAI, which develops ChatGPT and licenses the underlying technology to other companies, relies heavily on chips from Azure to provide its services. GPU shortages have forced OpenAI to set usage limits on the tools it sells. That\u2019s been unfortunate for clients, such as the company behind AI assistant Jamie, which summarizes audio from meetings using OpenAI technology. Jamie has delayed plans for a public launch by at least five months, partly because it wanted to perfect its system, but also because of usage limits, says Louis Morgner, a cofounder of the startup. The issue hasn\u2019t abated. \u201cWe\u2019re only a few weeks out before going public and will then need to monitor closely how well our system can scale, given the limitations of our service providers,\u201d Morgner says.\u00a0\u201cThe industry is seeing strong demand for GPUs,\u201d OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix says. \"We continue to work on ensuring our API customers have the capacity to meet their needs.\"At this point, any connection that can give a startup access to computing power is vital. Investors, friends, neighbors\u2014startup executives are drawing on a wide variety of relationships to get more AI firepower. Astria, for example, secured additional capacity at AWS with help from Emad Mostaque, CEO of Stability AI, which is a close partner of AWS and whose technology Astria builds upon.Bookkeeping startup Pilot, which uses OpenAI tech for some mundane data sorting, gained early access to GPT-4 after asking for aid from university friends, employees, and venture capitalists with connections to OpenAI. Whether those ties accelerated Pilot\u2019s move off a waiting list is unclear, but it now spends about $1,000 a month on OpenAI, and those connections could come in handy when it needs to increase its quota, CEO Waseem Daher says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take advantage of this [generative AI technology], someone else will, and it\u2019s powerful enough you don\u2019t want to risk that,\u201d Daher says. \u201cYou want to deliver the best results for your customers and stay on top of what\u2019s happening in the industry.\u201dAs well as battling to get access to more power, companies are trying to do less with more. Companies experimenting with generative AI are now obsessing about \u201coptimization\"\u2014making processing, with satisfactory results, possible on the most affordable GPUs. It\u2019s analogous to saving money by ditching an old, energy-guzzling fridge that\u2019s just storing a few drinks for a modern minifridge that can run on solar most of the time.\u201dCompanies are trying to write better instructions for how chips should process programming instructions, trying to reformat and limit the amount of data used to train AI systems and then strip the inference code down to the bare minimum needed to handle the task at hand. That means building out multiple, smaller systems\u2014perhaps one image generator that outputs animals and another that creates images of humans and switching between them depending on the user prompt.They are also scheduling processes that are not time-sensitive to run when GPU availability is highest and making compromises to balance speed with affordability.Speech-generating startup Resemble AI is content with taking a tenth of second longer to process a customer request on an older chip if it means spending a tenth of what higher-end options would command, with no noticeable difference in audio quality, says CEO Zohaib Ahmed. He\u2019s also willing to look beyond Lambda and CoreWeave as their terms become less palatable\u2014with encouragements to make longer-term commitments. CoreWeave declined to comment, and Lambda did not respond to a request for comment.Resemble turned to FluidStack, a tiny provider that welcomes one-week or one-month GPU reservations, and has recently joined San Francisco Compute Group, a consortium of startups jointly committing to buy and split GPU capacity. \u201cThe startup ecosystem is trying to get together and try to figure out \u2018How do we battle, how do we fight for compute?\u2019 Otherwise, it would be a really unfair game. Prices are just too high,\u201d Ahmed says.He gets a glimmer of hope about the shortages every Monday morning, he says. A sales representative at Lambda, the cloud provider, has been writing him, asking if Resemble wants to reserve any of Nvidia\u2019s newest chips, the H100. That there is availability is exciting, Ahmed says, but those chips have only been widely available since March, and it\u2019s just a matter of time before companies testing them perfect the code to go all-in on them. Nvidia will come out with its latest and greatest, the second-generation GH200, next year. Then the cycle of scarcity will start all over again.You Might Also Like \u2026In your inbox: Upgrade your life with WIRED-tested gearMusk takeover: DOGE\u2019s race to the bottomBig Story: The bust that took down Durov and upended TelegramWIRED\u2019s favorite \u2018buy it for life\u2019 gearEvent: Join us for WIRED Health on March 18 in LondonParesh Dave is a senior writer for WIRED, covering the inner workings of Big Tech companies.

This allows more time to work on hero 3D assets, which are the primary assets of a 3D scene that viewers will focus on. It makes a panoramic difference when creating compelling 3D visuals.\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to hyper-enabling 3D artists and collaborators \u2014 helping them build the immersive environments they envision faster than ever before and streamlining their content-creation workflows using NVIDIA Picasso,\u201d said Dade Orgeron, vice president of 3D innovation at Shutterstock.\nGenerating Photorealistic Environment Maps\nPreviously, artists needed to buy expensive 360-degree cameras to create backgrounds and environment maps from scratch, or choose from fixed options that may not precisely match their 3D scene.\nNow, users can simply provide a prompt \u2014 whether that\u2019s text or a reference image \u2014 and the 360 HDRi services built on Picasso will quickly generate panoramic images. Plus, thanks to generative AI, the custom environment map can automatically match the background image that\u2019s inputted as a prompt.\nUsers can then customize the maps and quickly iterate on ideas until they achieve the vision they want.\nCollaboration to Boost 3D World-Building\nAutodesk, a provider of 3D software and tools for creators in media and entertainment, is focused on giving artists the creative freedom to inspire and delight audiences worldwide.\nEnabling artists to trade mundane tasks for unbridled creativity, Autodesk will integrate generative AI content-creation services \u2014 developed using foundation models in Picasso \u2014 with its popular 3D software Maya.\n\nSupercharging Autodesk customer workflows with AI allows artists to focus on creating \u2014 and to ultimately produce content faster.\nGenerative AI Model Foundry\nPicasso is part of NVIDIA AI Foundations, which advances enterprise-level generative AI for text, visual content and even biology.\nThe foundry will also adopt new NVIDIA research to generate physics-based rendering materials from text and image prompts, demonstrated at SIGGRAPH\u2019s Real-Time Live competition. This will enable content providers to create 3D services, software and tools that enhance and expedite the simulation of diverse physical materials, such as tiles, metals and wood \u2014 complete with texture-mapping techniques, including normal, roughness and ambient occlusion.\n\nPicasso runs on the NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud platform-as-a-service and is accessible via a serverless application programming interface that content and service providers like Shutterstock can easily connect to their websites and applications.\nLearn about the latest advances in generative AI, graphics and more by joining NVIDIA at SIGGRAPH, running through Thursday, Aug. 10.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AI | Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | Omniverse | Rendering | SIGGRAPH 2023 | Simulation and Design | Universal Scene Description \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Find out more about our reviews policy.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve got complicated feelings about the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, and testing it for this review has really stirred the pot. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s a bad graphics card, as it offers up decent native performance and a DLSS 3 boost where available in compatible games. However, while it\u2019s a comfy 1080p GPU, I\u2019m still salty about the price, and the fact it only wields 8GB VRAM is partly what keeps it from being a go-to midrange PC solution.\u00a0That might sound like I'm being a little unfair on the RTX 4060 Ti, but hear me out before you reach for your pitchforks. In fact, I\u2019ll confuse things by saying that this souped up variant is almost one of the best graphics cards out there for 1080p gaming. However, the fact it costs $100 more than the vanilla GeForce RTX 4060 makes it incredibly hard to recommend to most players, as while it can boost fps further than its lower powered sibling, I\u2019m not fully convinced it offers enough to justify the extra cost for everyone.To some, $399 might not sound like a lot for the RTX 4060 Ti, but that $100 difference is a big deal if you\u2019re on a tight budget. It could affect whether you invest in other vital parts for your build, like a new SSD or some more RAM to meet Starfield system requirements. Getting nitty gritty with pricing is essential when you\u2019re building or maintaining an entry-level/mid-range gaming PC, and while the card\u2019s performance holds up, it probably won\u2019t revolutionize your experience.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti review: \"I'd happily buy this 4K GPU for the right price\"\n\n\n\n\nPNY RTX 5080 OC review: \"this GPU is for the next-gen overclockers\"\n\n\n\nToday's best PNY GeForce RTX 4060 Ti deals \u00a3435.87ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: Future / Phil Hayton)\u00a0SpecsAt a glance, the RTX 4060 Ti specs look fairly similar to the non-Ti version. Both cards feature 8GB GDDR6 VRAM and a 128 bit memory bus. The main difference relates to Nvidia\u2019s choice of chip, as the souped up model is armed with an AD106 GPU rather than a AD107. That former option packs 4,352 CUDA cores, 136 Tensor cores, and 34, which is a substantial uplift over and above the vanilla RTX 4060.\u00a0Swipe to scroll horizontallyNvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti specsPrice$399GPUAD106CUDA cores4,352Tensor cores136RT cores 34Base clock2,310MHzBoost clock 2,535MHzVRAM8GB GDDR6Memory bus128-bitAs for power, the RTX 4060 Ti comes with a higher 160W TDP, and a 400W PSU is recommended. Chances are you\u2019ll end up using something beefier than that, but it\u2019s worth keeping in mind if you\u2019re on the hunt for a lightweight GPU for a smaller build. On that note, the 4060 Ti opts to use a traditional 8-pin connector rather than the new 16-pin socket paired with a dongle, something that really helps when it comes to tight cable management.\u00a0It\u2019s worth noting that there is now a 16GB version, but the model I\u2019m testing for review is the 8GB PNY GeForce RTX 4060 Ti. Just like with most Nvidia cards in 2023, there\u2019s no Founder\u2019s Edition, so all available models are produced by a board partner. That\u2019s not by any means a bad thing, as these savvy manufacturers know a thing or two about custom cooling, and PNY is no exception.\u00a0(Image credit: Future / Phil Hayton)Design\u00a0Normally I have lots of say when it comes to graphics card aesthetics, but PNY opts for an extremely subtle approach with its RTX 4060 Ti design. The card wears a minimalist plastic shroud and metal backplate, brandished with bold white text on the top and sides. There are prettier versions out there, like a XLR8 Gaming Verto model that's clad with RGB, so the company is less copping out on the design front and more maintaining a subtle option for builders looking to keep things stealthy.\u00a0FeaturesLooks aside, the PNY RTX 4060 Ti is armed with a dual fan cooling system, and it feels more appropriate than triple fan alternatives. I\u2019ll get onto thermals in a little bit, but the GPU maker has seemingly struck a good balance between card size cooling efficiency. Not that this card is remotely large compared to Nvidia\u2019s monstrous high end trio, but I appreciate companies keeping entry-level and midrange cards on the dinky side.Round the back, you\u2019ll find three DisplayPorts and one HDMI, just like with most other new-gen GPUs. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot recently about how the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT and XTX features a USB-C port, and it\u2019s something I\u2019d like to see in lower spec cards in the future. I guess I view these cards as being well suited to smaller ITX builds, and using less chonky cables sort of makes sense.\u00a0(Image credit: Future / Phil Hayton)PerformanceI\u2019m not disappointed with the RTX 4060 Ti on the performance side of things, and benchmark results sort of line up with my initial expectations. My tests effectively confirm that it\u2019s a 1080p card for players who don\u2019t want to remotely compromise on settings, with additional DLSS 3 superpowers transforming it into a makeshift 1440p solution. However, the same technically goes for the non-Ti version, and the frame rate gaps on display aren\u2019t the completely deciding factor I\u2019d hoped they\u2019d be.\u00a0Swipe to scroll horizontallyNvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti benchmarksGame1080p1440p1440p + Ray Tracing (DLSS 3 on)Cyberpunk 207795fps59fps87fpsHitman 3105fps99fps91fpsReturnal98fps70fps117fpsShadow of the Tomb Raider141fps112fps-Total War: Warhammer 3104fps67fps-To kick things off, let's home in on Cyberpunk 2077 benchmarks, as the ravenous RPG piles on enough pressure to make things interesting. Without AI upscaling assistance, the RTX 4060 Ti can pump out 95fps on average at 1080p, a 25% increase compared to the vanilla RTX 4060. DLSS 3 ramps that figure up to 161fps, which is good news for anyone rocking one of the best gaming monitors with a higher refresh rate than 144Hz. \u00a0Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti scoresOpenCL: 134,909\nVulkan: 124,740\nTime spy: 12,273\nFirestrike: 26,285That gap sadly isn\u2019t consistent across all of our benchmarks, as Hitman squeezes 105fps at 1080p out of the RTX 4060 Ti compared to 100fps when paired with the non-Ti card. A pretty minor increase, but DLSS enhanced results place more distance between the two cards, which is likely linked to the increase in Tensor cores.\u00a0Shadow of the Tomb Raider is another game that provided weirdly close benchmarks, as there\u2019s only 10fps of a difference between the RTX 4060 Ti and RTX 4060 at 1080p. I\u2019ve got a sneaking suspicion that Lara\u2019s adventure would benefit from a bit more VRAM headroom, but I can\u2019t prove that for sure since I\u2019ve not tested the 16GB model. I experienced even more shenanigans while testing Returnal, as for whatever reason, I was only able to boost fps by around two frames. Perhaps there\u2019s something funky going on under the hood of the PS5 port, but switching on DLSS 3 weirdly produces the difference I was expecting.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)I typically use Total War: Wahammer 3 as a native performance indicator, as the RTS romp lacks any sort of AI upscaling support. It\u2019s also just pretty demanding when played at higher resolutions, and highlights any GPU shortcomings effectively. At 1440p, the RTX 4060 Ti manages to pull off a respectable 67fps average, leaving the non-Ti behind in the sub-60fps dirt. If the idea of double digit frame rates repulses you, stepping things back to 1080p will hike things above 100fps, but don\u2019t expect next-generation visuals if you choose to do so.When it comes to ray tracing performance, I\u2019m actually fairly impressed with the RTX 4060 Ti. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it won\u2019t fearlessly take on 4K workloads with fancy lighting enabled, but if you\u2019re willing to embrace DLSS 3, you\u2019re looking at a decent 1440p experience with frame rates comfortably above 60fps. I should probably reiterate that this card is designed with 1080p in mind, and dialing back will provide a native boost, but it\u2019s nice to know where to draw the line in terms of performance.If you\u2019re wondering how RTX 4060 Ti thermals hold up, I\u2019m pleased to report that PNY\u2019s card understands the assignment. Even while stressing the GPU out with my chaotic Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 run, temperatures rarely creeped above 60\u00b0C, and the same applies to the above benchmark tests. That\u2019ll hopefully provide some confidence to builders looking to squeeze this model into a dinky case, and I can see it providing decent temps as part of a mini-ITX setup.\u00a0It\u2019s safe to say the RTX 4060 Ti packs more of a performance punch than RTX 4060, but the above benchmark inconsistencies are a little baffling. Your mileage may vary depending on your choice of game, and it\u2019s worth noting that the non-Ti used for comparison is a factor overclocked MSI model. Nevertheless, I\u2019m used to seeing wider gaps between GPU tiers, and it makes deciding between the two cards a bit more complicated.(Image credit: Future / Phil Hayton)Should you buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti?\u00a0If you\u2019re looking to boost PC performance as much as possible for under $400, the RTX 4060 Ti is your go-to Nvidia option. That said, it faces stiff competition from both the AMD Radeon RX 7600 and Intel\u2019s Arc A770, especially since the latter offers 16GB VRAM for the same price. Sure, Nvidia\u2019s card still has the performance edge, and DLSS 3 offers serious frame boosting magic tricks, but the fact it doesn't completely blow its rivals out of the water prevents it from being a default option for mid range gaming PCs in 2023.\u00a0Still, the RTX 4060 Ti is a great 1080p GPU that\u2019ll serve as a great upgrade if you\u2019re rocking an older card, and PNY\u2019s version pairs effective cooling with decent build quality. You\u2019ll have to look elsewhere if you\u2019re looking for something flashier, but if you\u2019re happy with subtlety, you\u2019ll be able to grab this model for MSRP.Today's best PNY GeForce RTX 4060 Ti deals \u00a3435.87ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesHow I tested the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti\u00a0For two weeks, I used the RTX 4060 Ti in place of my usual graphics card for carrying out work duties and playing PC games.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I kickstarted my relationship with technology by jamming a Hot Wheels double-decker bus into my parent\u2019s VCR, but we all have to start somewhere. I even somehow managed to become a walking, talking buyer\u2019s guide at my teenage supermarket job, which helped me accept my career fate. So, rather than try to realise my musician dreams, or see out my University degree, I started running my own retro pop culture site and writing about video games and tech for the likes of TechRadar, The Daily Star, and the BBC before eventually ending up with a job covering graphics card shenanigans at PCGamesN. Now, I\u2019m your friendly neighbourhood Hardware Editor at GamesRadar, and it\u2019s my job to make sure you can kick butt in all your favourite games using the best gaming hardware, whether you\u2019re a sucker for handhelds like the Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch or a hardcore gaming PC enthusiast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti review: \"I'd happily buy this 4K GPU for the right price\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPNY RTX 5080 OC review: \"this GPU is for the next-gen overclockers\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5080 review: \"the 4K GPU I'd aim for this generation\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5070 review: \"far from a RTX 4090 rival, but I\u2019d still call it a solid 4K GPU\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been using the RTX 5070 to play a bunch of games early, and it might be the console killing GPU I've been waiting for\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTired of seeing RTX 5070 Ti out of stock signs?

As a testament to this outlook, Nvidia will buy back $25 billion of shares\u2014which happen to be worth triple what they were just before the generative AI craze kicked off.\n\"A new computing era has begun,\" said Huang breathlessly in an Nvidia press release announcing the company's financial results, which include a quarterly revenue of $13.51 billion, up 101 percent from a year ago and 88 percent from the previous quarter. \"Companies worldwide are transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI.\"\nFor those just tuning in, Nvidia enjoys what Reuters calls a \"near monopoly\" on hardware that accelerates the training and deployment of neural networks that power today's generative AI models\u2014and a 60\u201370 percent AI server market share. In particular, its data center GPU lines are exceptionally good at performing billions of the matrix multiplications necessary to run neural networks due to their parallel architecture. In this way, hardware architectures that originated as video game graphics accelerators now power the generative AI boom.\nNvidia's most popular AI hardware products currently include A100 and H100 data center GPUs, and Nvidia has also combined the H100 and a CPU into a package called the GH200 \"Grace Hopper\" chipset that powers Nvidia's line of computer systems. These are not consumer-grade gaming GPUs like the GeForce RTX 4090\u2014The Verge reports that the H100 chip sells for roughly $40,000\u2014and they can execute a great deal more calculations every second.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemand for GPUs in AI applications is huge, and Nvidia's second-quarter data center revenue ($10.32 billion) dwarfed its consumer gaming revenue ($2.49 billion). According to reports from March, OpenAI's popular AI assistant ChatGPT was projected to utilize as many as 30,000 Nvidia GPUs to run, although exact numbers have not been released by the company. Microsoft is also utilizing data centers full of \"tens of thousands\" of GPUs to power its implementations of OpenAI's technology, which it is currently baking into Microsoft Office and Windows 11.\n\u201cThis is not a one-quarter thing\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia's GH200 \"Grace Hopper\" AI superchip.\n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                          Nvidia\n                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Nvidia's GH200 \"Grace Hopper\" AI superchip.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Nvidia\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nNvidia's market dominance has left competitors like AMD rushing to catch up. But at the moment, Nvidia's lead seems almost untouchable. In May, Nvidia became the first $1 trillion chip company.\nHuang's move to buy back stock when it is more expensive than ever is risky, but it shows his confidence in Nvidia's continued success. Demand for its chips has given Nvidia the money needed to pull it off: The firm reported its adjusted gross margins (a financial metric that measures a company's profitability after accounting for the cost of goods sold) almost doubled to 71.2 percent in its second quarter. Reuters notes that most semiconductor companies have gross margins between 50 and 60 percent.\n\nHuang told Reuters in an interview that two key things are driving Nvidia's current success: a growing transition from data centers built around CPUs to those built around Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs), and the rising use of generative AI systems such as ChatGPT.\n\"These two fundamental trends are what's behind everything that we're seeing, and we're about a quarter into it,\" he told Reuters. \"It's hard to say how many quarters are ahead of us, but this fundamental shift is not going to end. This is not a one-quarter thing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case of the billion-dollar FOMO\nOf course, with every boom there is the chance of a bust. Every bubble eventually pops\u2014and will Nvidia get caught in the middle of it? Reuters says that some analysts don't see unlimited demand for Nvidia's GPU chips. The news agency quotes Dylan Patel of SemiAnalysis as saying that many tech companies are riding the wave of AI hype, speculatively purchasing Nvidia GPUs before figuring out how they can actually make money off of generative AI. Like a billion-dollar case of FOMO.\n\"They must overinvest in GPUs or risk missing the boat,\" Patel told Reuters. \"At some point the true use cases will shake out, and many of these players will stop investing, though others will likely continue accelerating investment.\"\nThen there's another potential financial snag ahead: product shortages. Reuters says that Huang thinks the biggest risk Nvidia faces is securing supplies necessary to produce its expensive server hardware. The company's biggest sales success this quarter was its HGX system, a supercomputer built around its H100 GPUs that includes many parts that need to be sourced individually.\n\"We're getting great cooperation from our supply chain,\" Huang told Reuters in an interview. \"And it's a complicated supply chain. People think it's a GPU chip. But it's a very complicated GPU system. It's 70 pounds. It's 35,000 components. It's $200,000.\"\nIn addition, the H100 chips themselves have become difficult to source. Currently, demand for high-powered GPUs far exceeds supply, potentially putting a bottleneck on the pace of AI innovation\u2014but also potentially inspiring new techniques to make the most of GPU power currently available.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Nvidia\u2019s new monster CPU+GPU chip may power the next gen of AI chatbots\n          \n\n            It takes a lot of computing power to pretend to be human.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Nvidia\u2019s flagship AI chip reportedly up to 4.5x faster than the previous champ\n          \n\n            Upcoming \"Hopper\" GPU broke records in its MLPerf debut, according to Nvidia.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            How ChatGPT turned generative AI into an \u201canything tool\u201d\n          \n\n            Until recently, AI models were specialized tools.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. R. Scott Raynovich is the Founder and Chief Analyst at Futuriom.comFollow AuthorAug 24, 2023, 01:11pm EDTShareSaveCommentIf you\u2019re a technology enthusiast or investor, it was impossible to avoid Wednesday\u2019s Nvidia news, which was everywhere: The cloud infrastructure technology company\u2019s blowout earnings and forecast for its fiscal second quarter was fueled by market-dominating chips and systems that run artificial intelligence infrastructure, as it exceeded its revenue forecast by $1.4 billion.\n\n\u201cYou're seeing the data centers around the world are taking that capital spend and focusing it on the two most important trends of computing today, accelerated computing and generative AI,\u201d said CEO Jensen Huang on the conference call.\n\nTAIPEI, TAIWAN - 2023/06/01: Jensen Huang, President of NVIDIA at supermicro keynote presentation ... [+] during the COMPUTEX 2023. (Photo by Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\nThe company raised its guidance for the year, issuing an eye-popping forecast that fiscal third-quarter revenue will be about $16 billion, a mere $3.4 billion or so higher than the $12.61 billion that the analyst consensus forecast. That guidance indicates 170% growth from the year-earlier period.\n\n\nAs you read in the media at large, the story has largely been pinned to Nvidia\u2019s dominance in graphics processing units, the building blocks of generative AI. Nvidia enjoys a near monopoly on high-powered chips for AI, including its A100 and H100 chips, at least until leading competitor AMD starts shipping its more competitive chips later this year. Currently, Nvidia has a huge backlog and can\u2019t even keep up with demand\n\nBut there\u2019s something larger going on here: Nvidia\u2019s dominance across the AI stack \u2014 including software, memory, storage and networking. Its executives pointedly attributed the growth to selling entire systems \u2013 such as the HGX \u2013 that are built on Nvidia GPUs but also are integrated with powerful networking and software.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\n\u201cData center compute revenue nearly tripled year on year driven primarily by accelerating demand for cloud from cloud service providers and large consumer internet companies for our HGX platform, the engine of generative and large language models,\u201d said Colette Kress, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Nvidia, on the conference call.\n\nThe Full Stack Makes Nvidia Stickier\nIt\u2019s not just about GPUs. AI systems are sophisticated supercomputing platforms that must be networked together, optimized with software and use thousands of components. To optimize an AI system, engineers must take a \u201cfull stack\u201d approach.\n\n\nNvidia has the lead not only in chips but also across the stack, including important networking technology from Mellanox, which it acquired in 2019, as well as key software optimization components.\nJust to give you the sense of scale: A single HGX A100 system has 1.3 terabytes of GPU memory and 2 terabytes/second of memory bandwidth. The storage handles 492 of SSDs and external networking capacity is 400 gigabits/s.The Nvidia HGX system includes an entire hardware and software stack for AI computing. Nvidia\nDon\u2019t expect Nvidia to stop extending the AI stack. It\u2019s been steadily making key acquisitions targeting AI systems to build HGX. In 2022, it acquired Excelero for block storage systems and Bright Computing to drive high performance compute clusters. In February, Nvidia acquired OmniML, an AI software company designed to enable machine-learning models to run on any device.\nWhile the larger world seems to be focused on Nvidia\u2019s lead in GPUs, it\u2019s really about the full stack, even coming down to extensive software libraries, which Nvidia executives pointed out on the conference call.\n\u201cSo, this runtime called Nvidia AI Enterprise has something like 4,500 software packages, software libraries and has something like 10,000 dependencies among each other,\u201d explained Huang on the call. \u201cAnd that runtime is, as I mentioned, continuously updated and optimized for our install base for our stack. And that's just one example of what it would take to get accelerated computing to work that the number of code combinations and type of application combinations is really quite insane.\u201d\nNetwork Is the Next Battle\nIt\u2019s hard to see anybody putting together the full stack in a way that Nvidia has. The networking front has gotten more interesting lately, with important competitors such as Arista Networks getting an AI bump as hyperscalers increase their networking needs to connect AI servers.\nArista Networks has also been AI investor favorite in 2023, deriving networking growth from the AI boom. In reporting its second quarter fiscal 2023 earnings earlier this month, Arista reported 39% year-over-year growth, fueled by demand from hyperscalers such as Microsoft and Meta. One of its growth drivers is upgrades to higher bandwidth systems to drive AI workloads, said Arista executives.\n\u201cThe AI opportunity is exciting,\u201d said Arista CEO Jayshree Ullal. \u201cAs our largest cloud customers review their classic cloud and AI networking plans, Arista is adapting to these changes, thereby doubling down on our investments in AI.\u201d\nPossibly feeling a little left out, Cisco Systems played up AI wares on its earnings conference call a week ago. Cisco is releasing upgraded Ethernet switches with a new line of Cisco Silicon One ASICs designed to compete with AI networking systems based on Nvidia\u2019s InfiniBand. Cisco, with rival Arista, is part of the Ultra Ethernet Consortium.\nBut so far, Cisco hasn\u2019t been seen as big an AI play by investors. For example, Cisco\u2019s year-to-date gain is 17%, while Nvidia is up 225% and Arista is up 51%. And neither Arista nor Cisco have GPUs and full-stack integrations.\nWhen Will NVIDIA Dominance Be Challenged?\nThe bottom line is Nvidia has built an AI system business in the fastest growing market in cloud. Generative AI companies that want to build processing facilities don\u2019t have much choice at this point \u2013 they can either rent space in the public clouds, which have built their own infrastructure and in some cases their own AI chips, or they can buy Nvidia systems and processors. Nvidia has been ahead of this trend but now everybody is chasing it.\nWith Arista and Cisco coming after Nvidia in AI networking, it\u2019s clear Nvidia is going to be challenged on a number of fronts. But for now, the Nvidia frenzy you see is likely to remain for at least the rest of the year. AMD\u2019s new AI chip, the MI300X, won\u2019t be out for at least another quarter, so Nvidia will continue to cash in. The other closest competitors are the cloud companies themselves \u2013 Amazon and Google \u2013 which have designed their own chips for AI, having correctly foreseen the possible chip shortage. The networking competitors have pieces of the puzzle \u2014 but they don\u2019t have the full system with software optimization.\nWhat may be underestimated is the deep strategic thought and planning that Nvidia has put into its entire systems, from the networking interconnects to the software components. Competitors have a lot of work to do if they want to knock Nvidia off the top of the AI infrastructure hill.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Goran Vuksic is the brain behind a project to build a real-world pit droid, a type of Star Wars bot that repairs and maintains podracers which zoom across the much-loved film series.\nThe edge AI Jedi used an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit as the brain of the droid itself. The devkit enables the bot, which is a little less than four feet tall and has a simple webcam for eyes, to identify and move its head toward objects.\nVuksic \u2014 originally from Croatia and now based in Malm\u00f6, Sweden \u2014 recently traveled with the pit droid across Belgium and the Netherlands to several tech conferences. He presented to hundreds of people on computer vision and AI, using the droid as an engaging real-world demo.\nThe pit droid\u2019s first look at the world.\nA self-described Star Wars fanatic, he\u2019s upgrading the droid\u2019s capabilities in his free time, when not engrossed in his work as an engineering manager at a Copenhagen-based company. He\u2019s also co-founder and chief technology officer of syntheticAIdata, a member of the NVIDIA Inception program for cutting-edge startups.\nThe company, which creates vision AI models with cost-effective synthetic data, uses a connector to the NVIDIA Omniverse platform for building and operating 3D tools and applications.\nAbout the Maker\nNamed a Jetson AI Specialist by NVIDIA and an AI \u201cMost Valuable Professional\u201d by Microsoft, Vuksic got started with artificial intelligence and IT about a decade ago when working for a startup that classified tattoos with vision AI.\nSince then, he\u2019s worked as an engineering and technical manager, among other roles, developing IT strategies and solutions for various companies.\nRobotics has always interested him, as he was a huge sci-fi fan growing up.\n\u201cWatching Star Wars and other films, I imagined how robots might be able to see and do stuff in the real world,\u201d said Vuksic, also a member of the NVIDIA Developer Program.\nNow, he\u2019s enabling just that with the pit droid project powered by the NVIDIA Jetson platform, which the developer has used since the launch of its first product nearly a decade ago.\nVuksic reads to the pit droid.\nApart from tinkering with computers and bots, Vuksic enjoys playing the bass guitar in a band with his friends.\nHis Inspiration\nVuksic built the pit droid for both fun and educational purposes.\nAs a frequent speaker at tech conferences, he takes the pit droid on stage to engage with his audience, demonstrate how it works and inspire others to build something similar, he said.\nVuksic, his startup co-founder Sherry List and the pit droid present at the Techorama conference in Antwerp, Belgium.\n\u201cWe live in a connected world \u2014 all the things around us are exchanging data and becoming more and more automated,\u201d he added. \u201cI think this is super exciting, and we\u2019ll likely have even more robots to help humans with tasks.\u201d\nUsing the NVIDIA Jetson platform, Vuksic is at the forefront of robotics innovation, along with an ecosystem of developers using edge AI.\nHis Jetson Project\nVuksic\u2019s pit droid project, which took him four months, began with 3D printing its body parts and putting them all together.\nHe then equipped the bot with the Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit as the brain in its head, which can move in all directions thanks to two motors.\nVuksic places an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit in the pit droid\u2019s head.\nThe Jetson Orin Nano enables real-time processing of the camera feed. \u201cIt\u2019s truly, truly amazing to have this processing power in such a small box that fits in the droid\u2019s head,\u201d said Vuksic.\nHe also uses Microsoft Azure to process the data in the cloud for object-detection training.\n\u201cMy favorite part of the project was definitely connecting it to the Jetson Orin Nano, which made it easy to run the AI and make the droid move according to what it sees,\u201d said Vuksic, who wrote a step-by-step technical guide to building the bot, so others can try it themselves.\n\u201cThe most challenging part was traveling with the droid \u2014 there was a bit of explanation necessary when I was passing security and opened my bag which contained the robot in parts,\u201d the developer mused. \u201cI said, \u2018This is just my big toy!\u2019\u201d\nLearn more about the NVIDIA Jetson platform.\n\n\nCategories: Inner Geek | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | Developer Program | Embedded Computing |

We also announced Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project, a community remaster project of Valve\u2019s Half-Life 2, one of the highest-rated games of all time.\nThis week\u2019s In the NVIDIA Studio installment also features digital artist Diyor Makhmudov\u2019s 3D work, inspired by the extraordinary gaming franchise The Witcher.\nReallusion software released an update to the iClone Omniverse Connector, including real-time synchronization of projects and enhanced import functionality for OpenUSD, enabling quicker, more efficient workflows. Learn more in the latest edition of the Into the Omniverse series.\nFinally, calling all video editors to sign up for the premiere DaVinci Resolve event \u2014 ResolveCon \u2014 in Portland, Oregon, from Aug. 25-27. In-person attendees can win giveaways, including new GeForce RTX GPUs, while virtual attendees can view tutorials livestreamed by In the NVIDIA Studio artist Casey Faris.\nNext-Level Graphical Fidelity With DLSS 3.5\u00a0\nNVIDIA DLSS 3.5 adds Ray Reconstruction, which improves ray-traced image quality for all GeForce RTX GPUs by replacing hand-tuned denoisers with an NVIDIA supercomputer-trained AI network that generates higher-quality pixels in between sampled rays.\nSeeing is believing \u2014 watch the Tech Talk with NVIDIA Vice President of Applied Deep Learning Research Bryan Catanzaro to learn how DLSS 3.5 works.\n\nCreative apps with ray-traced renderers face a wide variety of content that is difficult for traditional denoisers to handle, as they require hand-tuning for every scene. As a result, content previews return suboptimal image quality. With DLSS 3.5, the AI neural network recognizes a wide variety of scenes, producing high-quality images during preview and before committing hours to a final render.\nD5 Render and Chaos Vantage, two popular professional-grade 3D apps for architects and designers, feature real-time preview modes with ray tracing. With DLSS 3.5, the AI neural network replaces the denoisers, inferring and producing higher-quality previews while building and iterating.\nDLSS 3.5 will improve image quality in D5 Render.\nPopular creative apps Chaos Vantage, D5 Render and NVIDIA Omniverse, as well as popular gaming titles Alan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty and Portal with RTX, are all adding support for NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 this fall.\n\nDevelopers will be able to seamlessly integrate DLSS 3.5 with the new Streamline SDK coming soon. Learn more about DLSS 3.5.\nHalf-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project\nHalf-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project is being developed by four of Half-Life 2\u2019s top mod teams, now known as Orbifold Studios.\nHalf-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project.\nUsing the latest version of RTX Remix, Orbifold Studios is rebuilding materials with physically based rendering properties, adding extra geometric detail with Valve\u2019s Hammer editor and using the full range of NVIDIA technologies, including NVIDIA DLSS, NVIDIA RTX IO and NVIDIA Reflex, to breathe new life into the critically acclaimed title.\nAs with Portal with RTX, a high-fidelity reimagining of Valve\u2019s timeless classic, and Portal: Prelude RTX, built by community modders, nearly every asset in Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project is being reconstructed in high fidelity and with full ray tracing (otherwise known as path tracing, enabling advanced rendering techniques. Compared to the original, some assets feature 20x the geometric detail.\nHalf-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project is early in development and is a community effort looking to galvanize talented modders and artists everywhere. To join the project, apply via the Orbifold Studios website.\nEat. Sleep. Game. Create. Repeat.\nAlready building 3D scenes in immaculate detail, 19-year-old digital creator and 3D lighting artist Diyorbek Makhmudov has the savvy skills of an industry veteran and a bright future ahead.\n\u2018Tavern\u2019 inspired by The Witcher 3.\nMakhmudov has always had a deep-rooted passion for gaming, gaining inspiration from the 3D worlds of his favorite games. Most notably, The Witcher franchise has fueled him to create 3D worlds that showcase his own signature look and feel.\n\u2018Calm\u2019 inspired by The Witcher 3.\nUnlike many content creators featured In the NVIDIA Studio, Makhmudov doesn\u2019t like to bring his own life experience into the creative process, enjoying the escapism offered by world-building.\n\u201cI like to immerse myself in another universe,\u201d said Makhmudov. \u201cI don\u2019t like to express my feelings, thoughts or emotions in my creations.\u201d\n\u2018Tavern\u2019 inspired by The Witcher 3.\nMakhmudov follows standard 3D creative workflow practices: gathering reference material, prepping materials, shaping environments and tinkering with materials, textures and colors. But it\u2019s in 3D creation where he really shines.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/week71-tavern-scene-movement-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nMakhmudov uses his preferred 3D app \u2014 Cinema 4D \u2014 to achieve smooth interactivity while working with complex 3D models thanks to the NVIDIA GPU-accelerated viewport. It\u2019s powered by a GeForce RTX 3090 graphics card, which offers considerable increases in efficiency while fueling creativity.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/week71-fast-rendering-09-19-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nIn the video above, Makhmudov is able to move within the scene, tinkering while the scene renders in real time.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/week71-cinema-4d-animations-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nCinema 4D also supports several popular GPU-accelerated renderers such as Chaos V-Ray, OTOY OctaneRender and Maxon\u2019s Redshift. This flexibility allows Makhmudov to use whichever best suits his needs.\nToo many great rendering choices.\n\u201cRedshift is fast, has a good light-linking system and I have almost full control over everything,\u201d said Makhmudov. He prefers OctaneRender for exporting ultra-realistic renders quickly. The built-in Cinema 4D render is also a speedy option. The only thing he can\u2019t do is work on a CPU alone because, to quote Makhmudov, \u201cIt\u2019s very slow.\u201d\nPerfectly lit.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhen you do personal work, it pushes you more to achieve a good result,\u201d said Makhmudov. \u201cAs a bonus, that big portfolio will be a major advantage in your job search.\u201d\n3D artist Diyor Makhmudov.\nCheck out Makhmudov on ArtStation.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

This marked the first time a company had allowed public access to their model for scrutiny.\u201d\nThis week\u2019s challenge is a key step in the evolution of AI, thanks to the leading role played by the hacker community \u2014 with its ethos of skepticism, independence and transparency \u2014 in creating and field testing emerging security standards.\nNVIDIA\u2019s technologies are fundamental to AI, and NVIDIA was there at the beginning of the generative AI revolution. In 2016, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang hand-delivered to OpenAI the first NVIDIA DGX AI supercomputer \u2014 the engine behind the large language model breakthrough powering ChatGPT.\nNVIDIA DGX systems, originally used as an AI research instrument, are now running 24/7 at businesses across the world to refine data and process AI.\nManagement consultancy McKinsey estimates generative AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy across 63 use cases.\nThis makes safety\u00a0 \u2014 and trust \u2014 an industry-wide concern.\nThat\u2019s why NVIDIA employees are engaging with attendees at both last week\u2019s Black Hat conference for security professionals and this week\u2019s DEF CON gathering.\nAt Black Hat, NVIDIA hosted a two-day training session on using machine learning and a briefing on the risks of poisoning web-scale training datasets. It also participated in a panel discussion on the potential benefits of AI for security.\nAt DEF CON, NVIDIA is sponsoring a talk on the risks of breaking into baseboard management controllers. These specialized service processors monitor the physical state of a computer, network server or other hardware devices.\nAnd through the Generative Red Team Challenge, part of the AI Village Prompt Detective workshop, thousands of DEF CON participants will be able to demonstrate prompt injection, attempt to elicit unethical behaviors and test other techniques to obtain inappropriate responses.\nModels built by Anthropic, Cohere, Google, Hugging Face, Meta, NVIDIA, OpenAI and Stability, with participation from Microsoft, will be tested on an evaluation platform developed by Scale AI.\nAs a result, everyone gets smarter.\n\u201cWe\u2019re fostering the exchange of ideas and information while simultaneously addressing risks and opportunities,\u201d said Rumman Chowdhury, a member of AI Village\u2019s leadership team and co-founder of Humane Intelligence, the nonprofit designing the challenges. \u201cThe hacker community is exposed to different ideas, and community partners gain new skills that position them for the future.\u201d\nReleased in April as open-source software, NeMo Guardrails can help developers guide generative AI applications to create impressive text responses that can stay on track \u2014 ensuring intelligent, LLM-powered applications are accurate, appropriate, on topic and secure.\nTo ensure transparency and the ability to put the technology to work across many environments, NeMo Guardrails \u2014 the product of several years of research \u2014 is open source, with much of the NeMo conversational AI framework already available as open-source code on GitHub, contributing to the developer community\u2019s tremendous energy and work on AI safety.\nEngaging with the DEF CON community builds on this, enabling NVIDIA to share what it has learned with NeMo Guardrails and to, in turn, learn from the community.\nOrganizers of the event \u2014 which include SeedAI, Humane Intelligence and AI Village \u2014 plan to analyze the data and publish their findings, including processes and learnings, to help other organizations conduct similar exercises.\nLast week, organizers also issued a call for research proposals and received several proposals from leading researchers within the first 24 hours.\n\u201cSince this is the first instance of a live hacking event of a generative AI system at scale, we will be learning together,\u201d Chowdhury said. \u201cThe ability to replicate this exercise and put AI testing into the hands of thousands is key to its success.\u201d\nThe Generative Red Team Challenge will take place in the AI Village at DEF CON 31 from Aug. 10-13, at Caesar\u2019s Forum in Las Vegas.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: CorporateTags: Events | NVIDIA NeMo | Trustworthy AI \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

A campus caf\u00e9 served up diner-style food in tribute to the company\u2019s origins at a nearby Denny\u2019s. And Huang fielded remote questions from China, Israel and Poland. A movie night featuring Jurassic Park \u2014 released the year NVIDIA was founded, 1993 \u2014 capped the week.\nQ&A time during Jensen Huang\u2019s Global Intern Talk\nInterns around the world are finishing their summer internships. Zachary Susskind, a Ph.D. student studying computer engineering at the University of Austin, returned to build on last summer\u2019s work as he completes his degree.\n\u201cThe cool thing about being a returning intern is being able to see the long-term impacts of work you did in previous years,\u201d said Susskind, who\u2019s working with NVIDIA\u2019s architecture research group.\nReal-World Assignments\nInterns work on real-world assignments. Each has a mentor who provides the support, knowledge and expertise needed to help them navigate projects and ensure they take time for professional growth opportunities.\n\u201cEven as an intern, you can touch upon real projects immediately,\u201d said Efsane Soyer, a returning intern who recently graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, with a degree in electrical engineering and computer science.\nEfsane Soyer, Zachary Susskind, Selina Martinez, left to right\nInterns Return\nAs Susskind notes, if you plan to return to NVIDIA as an intern, \u201cdon\u2019t feel like you need to do the same thing! I\u2019ve gotten a lot of value in moving between teams as my skills and interests have developed.\u201d\nNVIDIA\u2019s University Recruiting team carefully plots out a summer packed with career workshops, lunch-and-learn events, a lecture series featuring NVIDIA luminaries, volunteer events, mentorship circles and open houses with various NVIDIA teams \u2014 all of which prepare interns to sharpen their career goals.\nCapping the summer is an annual Intern Project Showcase, this year called \u201cFive Minutes on Fire.\u201d During the event, interns are given a tight window to showcase their projects to managers, mentors and colleagues \u2014 all judged by recently hired new college grads. The prize: an NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPU.\nSome Fun, Too\nBut it\u2019s not all work as an intern at NVIDIA.\nThere\u2019s time for popcorn mixers, Jenga competitions and end-of-summer happy hours. At other times of the year, interns gather to watch the GTC keynote, learn paper-cutting for Lunar New Year and celebrate holidays around the world.\nNVIDIA\u2019s Intern Ambassador Program, now in its sixth season, also helps keep interns connected. The 20 intern envoys plan and host community events for others to enjoy amid busy work weeks.\nUniversity Recruiting hosted a mixer in early June.\nInternships can last from a dozen weeks to several years. Regardless, interns are encouraged to immerse themselves in NVIDIA\u2019s culture, such as volunteering for an Inspire 365 event.\nSelina Martinez, a senior at the University of Southern California studying computer engineering and computer science and a returning intern on the embedded software team, encourages interns to maximize their experience.\n\u201cBe fearless. You\u2019re here for a limited amount of time,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to talk to your manager about your interests. Don\u2019t be afraid to set up coffee chats, even if you have to cold email people. Don\u2019t be afraid to do what you really want to do and voice it to people.\u201d\nLearn more about our intern program and NVIDIA life, culture and careers.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | NVIDIA Life \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Now he\u2019s putting generative AI to work, creating content for hundreds of companies.\nBorn and raised in Syria, Alshikh spoke no English, but he was fluent in software, a talent that served him well when he arrived at college in Lebanon.\n\u201cThe first day they gave me a stack of textbooks, each one a thousand pages thick, and all of it in English,\u201d he recalled.\nSo, he wrote a program \u2014 a crude but effective statistical classifier that summarized the books \u2014 then he studied the summaries.\nFrom Concept to Company\nIn 2014, he shared his story with May Habib, an entrepreneur he met while working in Dubai. They agreed to create a startup that could help marketing departments \u2014 which are always pressured to do more with less \u2014 use machine learning to quickly create copy for their web pages, blogs, ads and more.\n\u201cInitially, the tech was not there, until transformer models were announced \u2014 that was something we could build on,\u201d said Alshikh, the startup\u2019s CTO.\nWriter co-founders Habib, CEO, and Alshikh, CTO.\n\u201cWe found a few engineers and spent almost six months building our first model, a neural network that barely worked and had about 128 million parameters,\u201d an often-used measure of an AI model\u2019s capability.\nAlong the way, the young company won some business, changed its name to Writer and connected with NVIDIA.\nA Startup Accelerated\n\u201cOnce we got introduced to NVIDIA NeMo, we were able to build industrial-strength models with three, then 20 and now 40 billion parameters, and we\u2019re still scaling,\u201d he said.\nNeMo is an application framework that helps companies curate their training datasets, build and customize large language models (LLMs), and run them in production at scale. Organizations everywhere from Korea to Sweden are using it to customize LLMs for their local languages and industries.\n\u201cBefore NeMo, it took us four and a half months to build a new billion-parameter model. Now we can do it in 16 days \u2014 this is mind blowing,\u201d Alshikh said.\nModels Make Opportunities\nIn the first six months of this year, the startup\u2019s team of fewer than 20 AI engineers used NeMo to develop 10 models, each with 30 billion parameters or more.\nThat translates into big opportunities. Hundreds of businesses now use Writer\u2019s models that NeMo customized for finance, healthcare, retail and other vertical markets.\nWriter\u2019s Recap tool creates written summaries from audio recordings of an interview or event.\nThe startup\u2019s customer list includes household names like Deloitte, L\u2019Oreal, Intuit, Uber and many Fortune 500 companies.\nWriter\u2019s success with NeMo is just the start of the story. Dozens of other companies have already downloaded NeMo.\nThe software will be available soon for anyone to use. It\u2019s part of NVIDIA AI Enterprise, full-stack software optimized to accelerate generative AI workloads and backed by enterprise-grade support, security and application programming interface stability.\nWriter offers a full-stack platform for enterprise users.\nA Trillion API Calls a Month\nSome customers run Writer\u2019s models on their own systems or cloud services. Others ask Writer to host the models, or they use Writer\u2019s API.\n\u201cOur cloud infrastructure, managed basically by two people, hosts a trillion API calls a month \u2014 we\u2019re generating 90,000 words a second,\u201d Alshikh said. \u201cWe\u2019re delivering high-quality models that compete with products from companies with larger teams and bigger budgets.\u201d\nNVIDIA NeMo supports an end-to-end flow for generative AI from data curation to inference.\nWriter uses the Triton Inference Server that\u2019s packaged with NeMo to run models in production for its customers.

Such capabilities owe their prescience in large part to gains from GPUs in AI inference performance over the last decade, he said.\nGains in single-GPU performance are just part of a larger story that includes million-x advances in scaling to data-center-sized supercomputers.\nResearch Delivers 100 TOPS/Watt\nResearchers are readying the next wave of advances. Dally described a test chip that demonstrated nearly 100 tera operations per watt on an LLM.\nThe experiment showed an energy-efficient way to further accelerate the transformer models used in generative AI. It applied four-bit arithmetic, one of several simplified numeric approaches that promise future gains.\nBill Dally\nLooking further out, Dally discussed ways to speed calculations and save energy using logarithmic math, an approach NVIDIA detailed in a 2021 patent.\nTailoring Hardware for AI\nHe explored a half dozen other techniques for tailoring hardware to specific AI tasks, often by defining new data types or operations.\nDally described ways to simplify neural networks, pruning synapses and neurons in an approach called structural sparsity, first adopted in NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not done with sparsity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to do something with activations and can have greater sparsity in weights as well.\u201d\nResearchers need to design hardware and software in tandem, making careful decisions on where to spend precious energy, he said. Memory and communications circuits, for instance, need to minimize data movements.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fun time to be a computer engineer because we\u2019re enabling this huge revolution in AI, and we haven\u2019t even fully realized yet how big a revolution it will be,\u201d Dally said.\nMore Flexible Networks\nIn a separate talk, Kevin Deierling, NVIDIA\u2019s vice president of networking, described the unique flexibility of NVIDIA BlueField DPUs and NVIDIA Spectrum networking switches for allocating resources based on changing network traffic or user rules.\nThe chips\u2019 ability to dynamically shift hardware acceleration pipelines in seconds enables load balancing with maximum throughput and gives core networks a new level of adaptability. That\u2019s especially useful for defending against cybersecurity threats.\n\u201cToday with generative AI workloads and cybersecurity, everything is dynamic, things are changing constantly,\u201d Deierling said. \u201cSo we\u2019re moving to runtime programmability and resources we can change on the fly,\u201d\nIn addition, NVIDIA and Rice University researchers are developing ways users can take advantage of the runtime flexibility using the popular P4 programming language.\nGrace Leads Server CPUs\nA talk by Arm on its Neoverse V2 cores included an update on the performance of the NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip, the first processor implementing them.\nTests show that, at the same power, Grace systems deliver up to 2x more throughput than current x86 servers across a variety of CPU workloads. In addition, Arm\u2019s SystemReady Program certifies that Grace systems will run existing Arm operating systems, containers and applications with no modification.\nGrace gives data center operators a choice to deliver more performance or use less power.\nGrace uses an ultra-fast fabric to connect 72 Arm Neoverse V2 cores in a single die, then a version of NVLink connects two of those dies in a package, delivering 900 GB/s of bandwidth. It\u2019s the first data center CPU to use server-class LPDDR5X memory, delivering 50% more memory bandwidth at similar cost but one-eighth the power of typical server memory.\nHot Chips kicked off Aug. 27 with a full day of tutorials, including talks from NVIDIA experts on AI inference and protocols for chip-to-chip interconnects, and runs through today.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AI | ResearchTags: Artificial Intelligence | Events | Hardware | Machine Learning | NVIDIA A100 | NVIDIA BlueField | NVIDIA Research \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It was the main driving force.\u201d\nIn the face of outside resistance, Sirazitdinova pursued a career in computer science. Fascinated with the internet, she taught herself to code when she was 11 and was soon building websites for fun.\nHer interest in computer science flourished in school, and she won a scholarship to pursue German language studies abroad in Germany. After completing her diploma back home, she returned to Germany and earned a Ph.D. in computer vision from Rhine-Westphalia Technical University of Aachen.\n\nFurthering a Lifelong Passion for Learning at NVIDIA\nComing from a computer vision background, it was natural for Sirazitdinova to start working in AI. Today, as a Munich-based senior deep learning data scientist at NVIDIA, she helps key NVIDIA customers solve their challenges with NVIDIA AI technology. It requires a blend of both strong technical and people skills.\nIn her customer-facing role, her knowledge needs to be both broad and deep. Drawing on her passion for learning, Sirazitdinova keeps up with the latest research, especially with new developments in generative AI. She supports customers through every stage of their AI journey, from design of training and inference systems, algorithm design and model optimization, all the way to production deployment. Customers from various industries ask all kinds of questions \u2014 about infrastructure planning, hardware, software, mathematics, whatever \u2014 and she needs to be able to answer them all.\nSirazitdinova has been able to directly influence NVIDIA\u2019s products by working with product teams, and contributing code to libraries including NVIDIA Triton, an open-source inference-serving software.\nSirazitdinova spoke about NVIDIA\u2019s approach to synthetic data generation at the Nordic Synthetic Data Conference in Copenhagen, in August 2022.\nInspiring the Next Generation\nSirazitdinova thinks of work as a hobby that she loves, and in her free time she prepares educational talks about new technologies. She hopes to inspire more women to speak publicly about technology, and start believing that they can do it.\n\u201cWhen a whole society is telling you, \u2018you are not good for that, because you are a girl,\u2019 it\u2019s not hard to start believing it,\u201d she said, speaking about her early years. \u201cI want young women entering tech to believe in themselves, and ask for help. Like we say at NVIDIA: no one fails alone.\u201d\nThe NVIDIA office in Munich recently hosted local schoolgirls as a part of \u201cGirls Day,\u201d a day in Germany for young girls to explore potential career paths. As a member of NVIDIA\u2019s EMEA Women in Technology community resource group, Sirazitdinova spoke to them about AI and building a career in technology.\nAlthough she grew up in a world where everyone told her she couldn\u2019t do it \u2014 today, she\u2019s telling girls that they can.\nLearn more about NVIDIA life, culture and careers. \n\n\nCategories: Corporate | NVIDIA Life \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It enables WPP to work on launch campaigns earlier in the design process, making iterations faster and less costly.\n\nUnifying Asset Pipelines With Omniverse Cloud\nUsing Omniverse Cloud, WPP\u2019s teams can connect their own pipeline of OpenUSD-enabled design and content creation tools such as Autodesk Maya and Adobe Substance 3D Painter to develop a new configurator for the DENZA N7. With a unified asset pipeline in Omniverse, WPP\u2019s teams of artists can iterate and edit in real time a path-traced view of the full engineering dataset of the DENZA N7 \u2014 ensuring the virtual car accurately represents the physical car.\nTraditional car configurators require hundreds of thousands of images to be prerendered to represent all possible options and variants. OpenUSD makes it possible for WPP to create a digital twin of the car that includes all possible variants in one single asset. No prerendered images are required.\nIn parallel, WPP\u2019s environmental artists create fully interactive, live 3D virtual sets. These can start with a scan of a real-world environment, such as those WPP captures with their robot dog, or tap into generative AI tools from providers such as Shutterstock to instantly generate 360-degree HDRi backgrounds to maximize opportunity for personalization.\nShutterstock is using NVIDIA Edify (formerly NVIDIA Picasso) \u2014 a multimodal architecture for visual content generation \u2014 to\u00a0 develop a variety of generative AI services to accelerate 3D workflows. At SIGGRAPH, Shutterstock announced the first offering of these new services \u2013 360 HDRi \u2013 to create photorealistic HDR environment maps to relight a scene. With this feature, artists can rapidly create custom environments that fit their needs.\nOne-Click Publish to GDN\nOnce the 3D experience is complete, with just one click, WPP can publish it to Graphics Delivery Network (GDN), part of NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud. GDN is a network of data centers built to serve real-time, high-fidelity 3D content to nearly any web device, enabling interactive experiences in the dealer showroom as well as on consumers\u2019 mobile devices.\nThis eliminates the tedious process of manually packaging, deploying, hosting and managing the experience themselves. If updates are needed, just like with the initial deployment, WPP can publish them with a single click.\nCTA: Learn more about Omniverse Cloud and GDN.\n\n\nCategories: Driving | Pro GraphicsTags: Omniverse Enterprise | SIGGRAPH 2023 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

While easing XR use, AIO headsets have modest compute and rendering power that can limit the graphics quality of streaming experiences.\nNVIDIA is enabling more enterprises and developers to adopt high-quality XR with its CloudXR Suite. Built to greatly simplify streaming, CloudXR enables anyone with an AIO headset or mobile XR device to experience high-fidelity, immersive environments from any location.\nCloudXR Suite combines the power of NVIDIA RTX GPUs and NVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstation (vWS) software to stream high-fidelity XR applications to Android and iOS devices. By dynamically adjusting to network conditions, CloudXR maximizes image quality and frame rates to power next-level, wireless augmented-reality and virtual-reality experiences.\nWith CloudXR, enterprises can gain the flexibility to effectively orchestrate and scale XR workloads, and developers can use the advanced platform to create custom XR products for their users. The suite offers high-quality streaming across both public and private networks.\nEricsson and VMware are among the first companies to use CloudXR.\nTaking XR Workflows to the Next Level\nCloudXR Suite offers performance that\u2019s comparable to tethered VR experiences.\nIt comprises three components, including several updates:\n\nCloudXR Essentials, the suite\u2019s underlying streaming layer, brings new improvements such as 5G L4S optimizations, QoS algorithms and enhanced logging tools. Essentials also includes the SteamVR plug-in, along with sample clients and a new server-side application programming interface.\nCloudXR Server Extensions improves server-side interfaces with a source-code addition to the Monado OpenXR runtime. The new CloudXR Server API contained in CloudXR Essentials and the OpenXR API represent the gateway to scaling XR distribution for orchestration partners.\nCloudXR Client Extensions include as a first offering a CloudXR plug-in built for the Unity Editor. This lets developers build custom CloudXR client applications using already-familiar Unity development tools. Plus, Unity app developers can more easily build applications with branded custom interfaces and lobbies before connecting to their CloudXR streaming server using the plug-in.\n\n\nTeams can tap into the power of NVIDIA RTX GPUs to achieve ultimate graphics performance on mobile devices. Enterprises can scale to data center and edge networks, and stream to concurrent users with NVIDIA RTX vWS software.\nIn addition, users can stream stunning XR content from any OpenVR or OpenXR application at the edge using high-bandwidth, low-latency 5G signals.\nPartners Experience Enterprise-Grade XR Streaming\nOrganizations across industries use XR streaming to advance their workflows.\nTo provide optimal streaming performance, NVIDIA is working with leading companies like Ericsson to implement low-latency, low-loss scalable throughput (L4S) in NVIDIA CloudXR. L4S helps reduce lag in interactive, cloud-based video streaming, so CloudXR users will be able to experience photorealistic XR environments on high-bandwidth, low-latency networks.\n\u201cAt Ericsson, we believe innovations like L4S are fundamental building blocks to enable latency-critical applications,\u201d said Sibel Tombaz, head of product line for 5G Radio Access Network at Ericsson. \u201cAs a key part of Ericsson\u2019s Time-Critical Communication capabilities, L4S will significantly improve user experience for use-cases like cloud gaming, and its great news that NVIDIA is making L4S a production element of CloudXR. We\u2019re excited to be working with NVIDIA to further enhance the XR experience for enterprises, developers and consumers.\nMore professionals can elevate XR streaming from the cloud with VMware Workspace ONE XR Hub, which includes an integration of CloudXR.\nWorkspace ONE XR Hub enhances user experiences with VR headsets through advanced authentication and customization options. Combined with the streaming capabilities of CloudXR, Workspace ONE XR Hub allows teams across industries to quickly, securely access complex immersive environments using AIO headsets.\n\u201cWith this new integration, access to high-fidelity immersive experiences is even easier because streaming lets users tap into the power of RTX GPUs from anywhere,\u201d said Matt Coppinger, director of product management for end-user computing at VMware. \u201cWorkspace ONE XR Hub and CloudXR will allow our customers to stream rich XR content, and more teams can boost productivity and integrate realistic, virtual experiences into their workflows.\u201d\nAvailability\nCloudXR Suite will be available to download soon, so users can stream a wide range of XR applications over the network without worrying about demanding graphics requirements.\nFor example, independent software vendors (ISVs) can create a single, high-quality version of their application that\u2019s built to take advantage of powerful GPUs. And with CloudXR streaming, ISVs can target users with mobile XR devices.\nMobile-device manufacturers can also offer their ISV partners and end users access to high-performance GPU acceleration for unparalleled graphics experiences.\nIn addition, cloud service providers, orchestrators and system integrators can extend their GPU services with interactive graphics to support next-generation XR applications.\nLearn more about NVIDIA CloudXR Suite.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | 5G | CloudXR | NVIDIA RTX | SIGGRAPH 2023 | Virtual Reality \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

which generates human-like responses to user queries within seconds - was trained using 10,000 of Nvidia's graphics processing units clustered together in a supercomputer belonging to Microsoft.AI products are expected to dramatically change how we use computers and the role they play in our lives.Is AI a threat to the world of fabric design?Zoom denies training AI on calls without consentAI: Experts propose guidelines for safe developmentNvidia: The chip maker that became an AI superpowerChip firm briefly worth $1 trillion amid AI boomArtificial intelligenceNvidiaRelatedJazz great Herbie Hancock on playing with Miles Davis, AI, and why the piano makes him cry13 hrs agoCultureMarket alters application rules after AI complaints1 day agoEnglandAI offers 'generational opportunity' for schools2 days agoStoke & StaffordshireMore27 Feb 2025Nvidia says AI chip sales strong despite DeepSeek fearsBoss Jensen Huang responds to concerns about an AI bubble sparked by Chinese firm DeepSeek. 27 Feb 202528 Jan 2025US tech stocks steady after DeepSeek AI app shockDeepSeek's claim that its model was made at a fraction of the cost of its rivals has rocked the AI industry.28 Jan 2025Business7 Jan 2025Nvidia unveils robot ambitions and powerful new gaming chipsThe announcement was part of Mr Huang's address at CES, an annual technology show in Las Vegas.7 Jan 2025Business9 Dec 2024Nvidia targeted by China in new chip war probeThe investigation follows a US decision to further restrict sales to chip equipment makers in China.9 Dec 2024Business29 Aug 2024AI chip giant Nvidia shares fall despite record salesThe California-based technology giant has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom.29 Aug 2024BusinessBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.

These GPUs bring unprecedented performance to all kinds of AI applications with their Transformer Engine \u2014 purpose-built to accelerate LLMs.\nAvailability of the A3 instances comes on the heels of NVIDIA being named Google Cloud\u2019s Generative AI Partner of the Year \u2014 an award that recognizes the companies\u2019 deep and ongoing collaboration to accelerate generative AI on Google Cloud.\nThe joint effort takes multiple forms, from infrastructure design to extensive software enablement, to make it easier to build and deploy AI applications on the Google Cloud platform.\nAt the Google Cloud Next conference, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang joined Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian for the event keynote to celebrate the general availability of NVIDIA H100 GPU-powered A3 instances and speak about how Google is using NVIDIA H100 and A100 GPUs for internal research and inference in its DeepMind and other divisions.\nDuring the discussion, Huang pointed to the deeper levels of collaboration that enabled NVIDIA GPU acceleration for the PaxML framework for creating massive LLMs. This Jax-based machine learning framework is purpose-built to train large-scale models, allowing advanced and fully configurable experimentation and parallelization.\nPaxML has been used by Google to build internal models, including DeepMind as well as research projects, and will use NVIDIA GPUs. The companies also announced that PaxML is available immediately on the NVIDIA NGC container registry.\nGenerative AI Startups Abound\nToday, there are over a thousand generative AI startups building next-generation applications, many using NVIDIA technology on Google Cloud. Some notable ones include Writer and Runway.\nWriter uses transformer-based LLMs to enable marketing teams to quickly create copy for web pages, blogs, ads and more. To do this, the company harnesses NVIDIA NeMo, an application framework from\u00a0 NVIDIA AI Enterprise that helps companies curate their training datasets, build and customize LLMs, and run them in production at scale.\n\nUsing NeMo optimizations, Writer developers have gone from working with models with hundreds of millions of parameters to 40-billion parameter models. The startup\u2019s customer list includes household names like Deloitte, L\u2019Oreal, Intuit, Uber and many other Fortune 500 companies.\nRunway uses AI to generate videos in any style. The AI model imitates specific styles prompted by given images or through a text prompt. Users can also use the model to create new video content using existing footage. This flexibility enables filmmakers and content creators to explore and design videos in a whole new way.\n\nGoogle Cloud was the first CSP to bring the NVIDIA L4 GPU to the cloud. In addition, the companies have collaborated to enable Google\u2019s Dataproc service to leverage the RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark to provide significant performance boosts for ETL, available today with Dataproc on the Google Compute Engine and soon for Serverless Dataproc.\nThe companies have also made NVIDIA AI Enterprise available on Google Cloud Marketplace and integrated NVIDIA acceleration software into the Vertex AI development environment.\nFind more details about NVIDIA GPU instances on Google Cloud and how NVIDIA is powering generative AI, and see how organizations are running their mission-critical enterprise applications with NVIDIA NeMo on the GPU-accelerated Google Cloud.\nSign up for generative AI news to stay up to date on the latest breakthroughs, developments and technologies. \n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Data Center | SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA NeMo \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Maxine will also expand features for video editing, enabling teams to reach new heights in video communication.\nPlus, an NVIDIA Research demo at this week\u2019s SIGGRAPH conference displays how AI can take video conferencing to the next level with 3D features.\nNVIDIA Maxine Features Expand to Video Editing\nWireless connectivity has enabled people to join virtual meetings from more locations than ever. Typically, audio and video quality are heavily impacted when a caller is on the move or in a location with poor connectivity.\nAdvanced, real-time Maxine features \u2014 such as Background Noise Removal, Super Resolution and Eye Contact \u2014 allow remote users to enhance interpersonal communication experiences.\nIn addition, Maxine can now be used for video editing. NVIDIA partners are transforming this professional workflow with the same Maxine features that elevate video conferencing. The goal when editing a video, whether a sales pitch or a webinar, is to engage the broadest audience possible. Using Maxine, professionals can tap into AI features that enhance audio and video signals.\nWith Maxine, a spokesperson can look away from the screen to reference notes or a script while their gaze remains as if looking directly into the camera. Users can also film videos in low resolution and enhance the quality later. Plus, Maxine lets people record videos in several different languages and export the video in English.\nMaxine features to be released in early access this year include:\n\nInterpreter: Translates from simplified Chinese, Russian, French, German and Spanish to English while animating the user\u2019s image to show them speaking English.\nVoice Font: Enables users to apply characteristics of a speaker\u2019s voice and map it to the audio output.\nAudio Super Resolution: Improves audio quality by increasing the temporal resolution of the audio signal and extending bandwidth. It currently supports upsampling from 8,000Hz to 16,000Hz as well as from 16,000Hz to 48,000Hz. This feature is also updated with more than 50% reduction in latency and up to 2x better throughput.\nMaxine Client: Brings the AI capabilities of Maxine\u2019s microservices to video-conferencing sessions on PCs. The application is optimized for low-latency streaming and will use the cloud for all of its GPU compute requirements. Thin Client will be available on Windows this fall, with additional OS support to follow.\n\nMaxine can be deployed in the cloud, on premises or at the edge, meaning quality communication can be accessible from nearly anywhere.\nTaking Video Conferencing to New Heights\nMany partners and customers are experiencing high-quality video conferencing and editing with Maxine. Two features of Maxine \u2014 Eye Contact and Live Portrait \u2014 are now available in production releases on the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform. Eye Contact simulates direct eye contact with the camera by estimating and aligning the user\u2019s gaze with the camera. And Live Portrait animates a person\u2019s portrait photo through their live video feed.\nSoftware company Descript aims to make video a staple of every communicator\u2019s toolkit, alongside docs and slides. With NVIDIA Maxine, professionals and beginners who use Descript can access AI features that improve their video-content workflows.\n\u201cWith the NVIDIA Maxine Eye Contact feature, users no longer have to worry about memorizing scripts or doing tedious video retakes,\u201d said Jay LeBoeuf, head of business and corporate development at Descript. \u201cThey can maintain a perfect on-screen presence while nailing their script every time.\u201d\nReincubate\u2019s Camo app aims to broaden access to great video by taking advantage of the hardware and devices people already own. It does this by giving users greater control over their image and by implementing a powerful, efficient processing pipeline for video effects and transformation. Using technologies enabled by NVIDIA Maxine, Camo can offer users an easier way to achieve incredible video creation.\n\u201cIntegrating NVIDIA Maxine into Camo couldn\u2019t have been easier, and it\u2019s enabled us to get high\u00a0performance from users\u2019 RTX GPUs right out of the box,\u201d said Aidan Fitzpatrick, founder and CEO of Reincubate. \u201cWith Maxine, the team\u2019s been able to move faster and with more confidence.\u201d\nQuicklink\u2019s Cre8 is a powerful video production platform for creating professional, on-brand productions, virtual and hybrid live events. The user-friendly interface combines an intuitive design with all the tools needed to build, edit and customize a professional-looking production. Cre8 incorporates NVIDIA Maxine technology to maximize productivity and the quality of video productions, offering complete control to the operator.\n\u201cQuicklink Cre8 now offers the most advanced video production platform on the planet,\u201d said Richard Rees, CEO of Quicklink. \u201cWith NVIDIA Maxine, we were able to add advanced features, including Auto Framing, Video Noise Removal, Noise and Echo Cancellation, and Eye Contact Simulation.\u201d\nLos Angeles-based company gemelo.ai provides a platform for creating AI twins that can scale a user\u2019s voice, content and interactions. Using Maxine\u2019s Live Portrait feature, the gemelo.ai team can unlock new opportunities for scaled, personalized content and one-on-one interactions.\n\u201cThe realism of Live Portrait has been a game-changer, unlocking new realms of potential for our AI twins,\u201d said Paul Jaski, CEO of gemelo.ai. \u201cOur customers can now design and deploy incredibly realistic digital twins with the superpowers of unlimited scalability in content production and interaction across apps, websites and mixed-reality experiences.\u201d\nNVIDIA Research Shows How 3D Video Enhances Immersive Communication\nIn addition to powering the advanced features of Maxine, NVIDIA AI enhances video communication with 3D. NVIDIA Research recently published a paper demonstrating how AI could power a 3D video-conferencing system with minimal capture equipment.\n3D telepresence systems are typically expensive, require a large space or production studio, and use high-bandwidth, volumetric video streaming \u2014 all of which limits the technology\u2019s accessibility. NVIDIA Research shared a new method, which runs on a novel VisionTransformer-based encoder, that takes 2D video input from a standard webcam and turns it into a 3D video representation. Instead of requiring 3D data to be passed back and forth between the participants in a conference, AI enables bandwidth requirements for the call to stay the same as for a 2D conference.\nThe technology takes a user\u2019s 2D video and automatically creates a 3D representation called a neural radiance field, or NeRF, using volumetric rendering. As a result, participants can stream 2D videos, like they would for traditional video conferencing, while decoding high-quality 3D representations that can be rendered in real time. And with Maxine\u2019s Live Portrait, users can bring their portraits to life in 3D.\nAI-mediated 3D video conferencing could significantly reduce the cost for 3D capture, provide a high-fidelity 3D representation, accommodate photorealistic or stylized avatars, and enable mutual eye contact in video conferencing. Related research projects show how AI can help elevate communications and virtual interactions, as well as inform future NVIDIA technologies for video conferencing.\nSee the system in action below. SIGGRAPH attendees can visit the Emerging Technologies booth, where groups will be able to simultaneously view the live demo on a 3D display designed by New York-based company Looking Glass.\n\nAvailability\nLearn more about NVIDIA Maxine, which is now available on NVIDIA AI Enterprise.\nAnd see more of the research behind the 3D video conference project. \nFeatured image courtesy of NVIDIA Research.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA Maxine | NVIDIA Research | SIGGRAPH 2023 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We\u2019re also deep-diving on new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU features, technologies and resources and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.\nAs beautiful and extraordinary as art forms can be, it can be easy to forget the simple joy and comforting escapism that content creation can provide for artists across creative fields.\nJanice K. Lee, a.k.a Janice.Journal \u2014 the subject of this week\u2019s In the NVIDIA Studio installment \u2014 is a TikTok sensation using AI to accelerate her creative process, find inspiration and automate repetitive tasks.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/week72-nvidia-bts-video-1280w-2.mp4\n\u00a0\nAlso this week, NVIDIA Studio technology is powering some of the most popular mobile and desktop apps \u2014 driving creative workflows of both aspiring artists and creative professionals.\nTikTok and CapCut, Powered by NVIDIA and the Cloud\nWeek by week, AI becomes more ubiquitous within content creation.\nTake the popular social media app TikTok. All of its mobile app features, including AI Green Screen, are accelerated by GeForce RTX GPUs in the cloud. Other parts of TikTok creator workflows are also accelerated \u2014 Descript AI, a popular generative AI-powered video editing app, runs 50% faster on the latest NVIDIA L4 Tensor Core GPUs versus T4 Tensor Core GPUs.\nCapCut, the most widely used video editor by TikTok users, enables Simultaneous Scene Encoding, a functionality that sends independent groups of scenes to an NVIDIA Encoder (NVENC), contributing to shorter video export times without affecting image quality. This technology performs over 2x faster on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 graphics cards versus on Apple\u2019s M2 Ultra.\nTests were conducted by CapCut using CapCut v2.2.0 (beta) on desktops equipped with GeForce RTX 4090 to export 180s 4K 60fps H.264 video. Video exporting was accelerated.\nAdvanced users can move footage to their preferred desktop video editing app using native GPU-acceleration and RTX technology. This includes AV1 dual encoders (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti graphics cards or higher required) for 40% better video quality for livestreamers, while video editors can slash export times nearly in half.\nJanice.Journal Gets AI Art Blanche\nJanice.Journal, a self-taught 3D creator, was motivated to learn new art skills as a way to cope with her busy schedule.\n\u201cI was going through a tough time during my junior year of college with classes and clubs,\u201d she said. \u201cWith no time to hang out with friends or decompress, my only source of comfort was learning something new every night for 20 minutes.\u201d\nHer passion for 3D creation quickly became evident. While Janice.Journal does consulting work during the day, she deep-dives into 3D creation at night, creating stunning scenes and tutorials to help other artists get started.\nOne of her recent projects involved using the free NVIDIA Canvas beta app, which uses AI to interpret basic lines and shapes, translating them into realistic landscape images and textures.\n\nIn the above video, Janice.Journal aimed to create the \u201cEighth Wonder of the World,\u201d a giant arch inspired by the natural sandstone formations in Arches National Park in Utah.\n\u201cI wanted to create something that looked familiar enough where you could conceive to see it on \u2018National Geographic\u2019 but would still seem fantastical, awe-inspiring and simultaneously make the viewer question if it was real or fake,\u201d said Janice.Journal.\nNVIDIA Canvas AI-assisted painting.\nUsing Canvas\u2019s 20 material brushes and nine style images, each with 10 variations, Janice.Journal got to work.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/week72-canvas-video-part-1-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nShe said she \u201cgot a bit carried away\u201d on Canvas, resulting in an incredible masterpiece.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/week72-canvas-video-part-2-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nJanice.Journal then had the option to export her painting into either a PNG or layered PSD file format to import into graphic design apps like Adobe Photoshop.\n\u201cThe Eighth Wonder of the World.\u201d\nCanvas is especially useful for concept artists looking to rapidly explore new ideas and for architects aiming to quickly draft backdrops and environments for buildings. With Canvas, Janice.Journal could rapidly paint a landscape without having to search for hours for the perfect stock photo, saving her valuable time to hone her 3D skills instead.\n\u201cI\u2019m still blown away trying it out for myself,\u201d said Janice.Journal. \u201cSeeing my simple drawings turn into fully HD images is wild \u2014 it really reminds me that the future is now.\u201d\nDownload NVIDIA Canvas, free for NVIDIA GeForce RTX graphics cards owners.\nA Better Blender Render With AI\nJanice.Journal\u2019s portfolio features bright, vibrant visuals with a soft touch. Her 3D scene \u201cGameboy\u201d features two levels \u2014 no, not gaming levels, but living quarters built into a Gameboy, bringing to life every child\u2019s dream.\nWould you love to live here?\nMost artists start with a rough physical sketch to get concepts on paper, then move to Blender to block out basic shapes and sculpt models in finer detail.\nAI shines at this point in the workflow. Janice.Journal\u2019s GeForce RTX 3090 GPU-powered system unlocks Blender\u2019s Cycles RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in the viewport, reducing noise and improving interactivity in the viewport for fluid movement with photorealistic visuals.\nWork-in-progress \u2018Gameboy\u2019 render.\n\u201cSimply put, GPU acceleration and AI allow me to see renders in real time as they process modeling, lighting and the entire environment, enabling a preview as if I were to hit \u2018render\u2019 right away,\u201d said Janice.Journal. \u201cIt makes life 10 times easier for me.\u201d\nJanice.Journal has also been experimenting with AI-generated images as a way to brainstorm concepts and push creative boundaries \u2014 in her opinion, the most optimal use of AI.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/week72-gameboy-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nOnce everything has been modeled, Janice.Journal adds textures by playing around in Blender, applying clay shaders or displacement modifiers for \u201cbumpier\u201d textures.

These generative AI business solutions will span multiple use cases, including automated coding, self-configuration, workflow automation and industry-specific insights. Ultimately, Deloitte aims to democratize the usage and application of generative AI across enterprise systems and significantly enhance human potential.\nAs part of their expanded strategic alliance to unlock the value of generative AI across enterprise software platforms, Deloitte and NVIDIA will establish an Ambassador AI program to help clients advance their AI journey using NVIDIA AI Foundations and NVIDIA NeMo\u2122 LLM software.\n\u201cEnterprises everywhere are looking to generative AI to transform their business,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cWe are deepening our strategic alliance with Deloitte by combining NVIDIA\u2019s generative AI technologies with their extensive industry expertise and service offerings to establish the AI Ambassador program, which will provide enterprises a faster route to adoption.\u201d\nDeloitte\u2019s AI services, talent and industry proficiency draws on the power, performance, and scalability offered with NVIDIA DGX\u2122 AI supercomputing and NVIDIA DGX Cloud.\nDeloitte solutions and services cover almost every industry and domain, including areas such as enterprise software packages, tax, regulatory advice, and sector-specific use cases. Built on NVIDIA AI Foundations and NVIDIA NeMo LLM software, the new applications will leverage Deloitte\u2019s services and Generative AI Market Incubator to rapidly deploy proofs of concept, set up AI factories and help clients accelerate their enterprise transformation efforts. Clients benefit from the breadth and depth of AI capabilities and experience that span Deloitte\u2019s businesses and industry-leading audit and assurance, tax and legal, consulting, risk advisory, and financial advisory services.\nTo take full advantage of the promise of generative AI, enterprises must be able to harness internal knowledge and proprietary data, and use that to reduce costs, increase productivity, accelerate innovation, and identify new revenue streams and growth areas. Deloitte will leverage NVIDIA AI platforms and tools to engineer custom-built, proprietary LLMs designed to help clients reinvent the way they do business and uncover new growth opportunities that were previously unfathomable.\nIn addition to its work with clients, Deloitte is infusing generative AI tools and capabilities across its organization to help its professionals become more productive and leveraging NVIDIA AI platforms to transform the way it delivers services to clients. Over 500 Deloitte AI specialists have completed NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute training. Additionally, Deloitte is increasing AI fluency and educating the next generation of AI professionals via the Deloitte AI Academy, as well as investing more than $2 billion in global technology learning and development initiatives to boost skills in key technology areas, including AI.\nThe expanded alliance with NVIDIA comes on the heels of several AI announcements from Deloitte, including the launch of Quartz AI, a suite of AI service offerings built on NVIDIA platforms, and the introduction of Deloitte\u2019s Generative AI practice. The practice works in conjunction with the Deloitte AI Institute, which supports the responsible growth and development of AI through engaged conversations and market perspectives. As generative AI evolves, commercial use is impacted by trust considerations such as emerging ethical, legal and policy norms. Deloitte is committed to the safe and responsible use of generative AI, guided by its Trustworthy AI\u2122 framework which helps users create necessary safeguards and mitigate risks during product development and operation.\nLearn more about Deloitte\u2019s collaboration with NVIDIA here.\nAbout Deloitte\nDeloitte provides industry-leading audit, consulting, tax and advisory services to many of the world\u2019s most admired brands, including nearly 90% of the Fortune 500\u00ae and more than 7,000 private companies.

That means it can help companies meet goals for net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide.\nA new benchmark shows that the RAPIDS Accelerator can reduce a company\u2019s carbon footprint by as much as 80% while delivering 5x average speedups and 4x reductions in computing costs.\nThat\u2019s a big win many can enjoy. Thousands of companies, including 80% of the Fortune 500, use Apache Spark to analyze their growing mountains of data.\nIn fact, if every Apache Spark user adopted the RAPIDS Accelerator, they could collectively reduce carbon dioxide emissions by a whopping 7.8 metric tons a year \u2014 or the amount of emissions a car produces on 878 gallons of gas. It\u2019s a great example of how green computing can advance the fight against climate change.\nA Challenge for Humankind\nMore than 70 countries have set a net-zero target for greenhouse gas emissions, according to the United Nations. It describes the transition to net-zero as \u201cone of the greatest challenges humankind has faced.\u201d\nCompanies are getting on board, too.\nFor example, NVIDIA is working with a large financial services company to test Apache Spark for real-time fraud protection. The company hopes to lower its carbon footprint with accelerated computing so it can align with groups like the Net-Zero Banking Alliance.\nOne of the world\u2019s largest AI supercomputers validated the energy efficiency of accelerated computing in May.\nAcross four popular scientific applications, the Perlmutter system at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) reported energy efficiency gains of 5x on average, thanks to NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. An application for weather forecasting logged speed-ups of 9.8x compared to CPUs.\nNERSC apps got efficiency gains with accelerated computing.\nAT&T Dials Up RAPIDS Accelerator\nOrganizations like AT&T, Adobe and the Internal Revenue Service have already discovered the performance and cost benefits of the RAPIDS Accelerator.\nIn a test last year, AT&T processed a month\u2019s worth of mobile data \u2014 2.8 trillion rows of information \u2014 in just five hours. That\u2019s 3.3x faster at 60% lower cost than any prior test.\n\u201cIt was a \u2018wow\u2019 moment because on CPU clusters, it takes more than 48 hours to process just seven days of data \u2014 in the past, we had the data but couldn\u2019t use it because it took such a long time to process it,\u201d said Abhay Dabholkar, an AI architect at AT&T, in a blog.\n\u201cWe recommend that if a job is taking too long and you have a lot of data, turn on GPUs \u2014 with Spark, the same code that runs on CPUs runs on GPUs,\u201d he added.\nAdobe Speeds Services\nAdobe used accelerated computing on its Intelligent Services platform, which helps marketing teams speed analytics with AI.\nIt found that, using the RAPIDS Accelerator, a single NVIDIA GPU node could outperform a 16-node CPU cluster by 33% while slashing computing costs by 70%.\nIn a separate test, GPU-accelerated RAPIDS libraries trained an AI model 7x faster, saving 90% of the cost of running the same job on CPUs.\n\u201cThis is an amazing cost savings and speed-up,\u201d said Lei Zhang, a machine learning engineer at Adobe in a talk at GTC (free with registration).\n20x Gains on Spark\nCPUs weren\u2019t powerful enough to ingest the 3+ terabyte dataset it needed to analyze, so the IRS turned to the RAPIDS Accelerator.\nA Spark cluster of GPU-powered servers processed the load and opened the door to tackling even bigger datasets.\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently implementing this integration and already seeing over 20x speed improvements at half the cost for our data engineering and data science workflows,\u201d said Joe Ansaldi, technical branch chief of the research and applied analytics and statistics division at the IRS, in a blog.\nHow to Get Started\nPerformance speedups and cost savings vary across workloads. That\u2019s why NVIDIA offers an accelerated Spark analysis tool.\nThe tool shows users what the RAPIDS Accelerator can deliver on their applications without any code changes. It also helps users tune GPU acceleration to get the best results on their workloads.\nOnce the RAPIDS Accelerator is boosting the bottom line, companies can calculate their energy savings and report their progress in protecting the planet.\nLearn more in this solution brief. And watch the video below to see how the Cloudera Data Platform delivered a 44x speedup with the RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark.\n\n\n\nCategories: Accelerated Analytics | Data CenterTags: Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Customer Stories | Data Science | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA A100 | RAPIDS | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Editor\u2019s note: The name of NVIDIA Picasso was updated to NVIDIA Edify, which is part of NVIDIA AI Foundry, in September 2024. All references to the name have been updated in this blog.\nNVIDIA researchers won the Best in Show award at SIGGRAPH\u2019s Real-Time Live event with a demo of generative AI models that can help artists rapidly iterate on 3D scenes.\nThe research demo showcases how artists can use text or image prompts to generate custom textured materials \u2014 such as fabric, wood and stone \u2014 faster and with finer creative control. These capabilities will be coming to NVIDIA Edify, allowing enterprises, software creators and service providers to create custom generative AI models for materials, developed using their own fully licensed data.\nThis set of AI models will facilitate iterative creating and editing of materials, enabling companies to offer new tools that\u2019ll help artists rapidly refine a 3D object\u2019s appearance until they achieve the desired result.\nIn the demo, NVIDIA researchers experiment with a living-room scene, like an interior designer assisted by AI might do in any 3D rendering application. In this case, researchers use NVIDIA Omniverse USD Composer \u2014 a reference application for scene assembly and composition using Universal Scene Description, known as OpenUSD \u2014 to add a brick-textured wall, to create and modify fabric choices for the sofa and throw pillows, and to incorporate an abstract animal design in a specific area of the wall.\n\nGenerative AI Enables Iterative Design\u00a0\nThe Real-Time Live demo combines several optimized AI models \u2014 a palette of tools that developers using AI Foundry will be able to customize and integrate into creative applications for artists.\nOnce integrated into creative applications, these features will allow artists to enter a brief text prompt to generate materials \u2014 such as a brick or a mosaic pattern \u2014 that are tileable, meaning they can be seamlessly replicated over a surface of any size. Or, they can import a reference image, such as a swatch of flannel fabric, and apply it to any object in the virtual scene.\nAn AI editing tool lets artists modify a specific area of the material they\u2019re working on, such as the center of a coffee table texture.\nThe AI-generated materials support physics-based rendering, responding realistically to changes in the scene\u2019s lighting. They include normal, roughness and ambient occlusion maps \u2014 features that are critical to creating and fine-tuning materials for photorealistic 3D scenes.\nWhen accelerated on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs, materials can be generated in near real time, and can be upscaled in the background, achieving up to 4K resolution while creators continue to refine other parts of the scene.\nAcross creative industries \u2014 including architecture, game development and interior design \u2014 these capabilities could help artists quickly explore ideas and experiment with different aesthetic styles to create multiple versions of a scene.\nA game developer, for example, could use these generative AI features to speed up the process of designing an open world environment or creating a character\u2019s wardrobe. An architect could experiment with different styles of building facades in various lighting environments.\nBuild Generative AI Services With NVIDIA Edify\nThese capabilities for physics-based material generation will be made available in NVIDIA Edify, a multimodal architecture for developing visual generative AI models for image, 3D, 360 HDRi, PBR materials, and video.\nEdify enables content providers to develop generative AI models and services trained on fully licensed, rights-reserved data. It\u2019s part of NVIDIA AI Foundations, a set of model-making services that advance generative AI across text, visual content and biology.\nAt today\u2019s SIGGRAPH keynote, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang also announced a new Edify feature to generate photorealistic 360 HDRi environment maps to light 3D scenes using simple text or image prompts.\nResearch on Display at SIGGRAPH\u2019s Real-Time Live\u00a0\nReal-Time Live is one of the most anticipated events at SIGGRAPH. This year, the showcase featured more than a dozen jury-reviewed projects, including those from teams at Roblox, the University of Utah and Metaphysic, a member of the NVIDIA Inception program for cutting-edge startups.\nAt the event, NVIDIA researchers presented this interactive materials research live, including a demo of the super resolution tool.\nLearn about the latest advances in generative AI, graphics and more by joining NVIDIA at SIGGRAPH, running through Thursday, Aug. 10.\n\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AI | Pro Graphics | ResearchTags: 3D | Artificial Intelligence | Omniverse | Rendering | SIGGRAPH 2023 | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

ChatUSD is fine-tuned using USD functions and Python-USD code snippets from NVIDIA.\nRunUSD \u2014 a cloud API that translates OpenUSD files into fully path-traced rendered images by checking compatibility of the uploaded files against versions of OpenUSD releases, and generating renders with Omniverse Cloud. A demo of the API is currently available for developers in the NVIDIA OpenUSD Developer Program.\nDeepSearch \u2014 an LLM agent enabling fast semantic search through massive databases of untagged assets.\nUSD-GDN Publisher \u2014 a one-click service that enables enterprises and software makers to publish high-fidelity, OpenUSD-based experiences to the Omniverse Cloud Graphics Delivery Network (GDN) from an Omniverse-based application such as USD Composer, as well as stream in real time to web browsers and mobile devices.\n\nEvolving OpenUSD Functionality \r\nOpenUSD was invented to better connect film and animation pipelines. Industrial applications \u2014 such as building interoperable manufacturing design pipelines, creating physically accurate real-time digital twins of factories, or training and validating autonomous vehicles \u2014 require different demands of the 3D framework.\nTo enable these highly complex industrial and perception AI workloads, NVIDIA is developing NVIDIA Omniverse, the OpenUSD-native software platform for developing applications, as well as technologies that include geospatial data models, metrics assembly and simulation-ready, or SimReady, specifications for OpenUSD.\nGeospatial data models for OpenUSD let users develop simulations and calculations for true-to-reality digital twins of factories, warehouses, cities and even Earth. For extreme-scale projects, it accounts for the planet\u2019s curvature to ensure the simulations are physically accurate.\nIndustrial applications combine datasets from many tools and sources, each represented in different units. NVIDIA is developing a metrics assembly for OpenUSD that enables users to combine diverse datasets with complete accuracy.\nNVIDIA is also developing a structure for new SimReady 3D models. These will include true-to-reality material and physical properties, which are critical to accurately training autonomous robots and vehicles. For example, an autonomous robot tasked with sorting packages needs to be trained in simulation on 3D packages that move and react to physical contact just as they would in the real world.\nGet early access to OpenUSD services, resources and tools through the NVIDIA OpenUSD Developer Program. This includes two new fully distributable OpenUSD sample scenes built by NVIDIA designers and artists \u2014 called Da Vinci\u2019s Workshop and Riverfront Tower.\nLearn more about OpenUSD, its ecosystem of connections, AOUSD and the NVIDIA Omniverse platform.

Many companies are already working with NVIDIA to pioneer this future.\nFrom Skyscrapers to Sports Cars\nOpenUSD is the foundation of NVIDIA Omniverse, a development platform for connecting and building 3D tools and applications. Omniverse is helping companies like Heavy.AI, Kroger and Siemens build and test physically accurate simulations of factories, retail locations, skyscrapers, sports cars and more.\nFor IKEA, OpenUSD represents \u201ca nonproprietary standard format to author and store 3D content to connect our value chain even closer, and develop home furnishing solutions to a lower price,\u201d Martin Enthed, an innovation manager at IKEA, said in a press release the alliance issued today.\n\u201cBy joining the alliance, we\u2019re demonstrating our dedication to the advantages that OpenUSD provides our clients when linking with cloud-based platforms, including Nexus, Hexagon\u2019s manufacturing platform, HxDR, Hexagon\u2019s digital reality platform, and NVIDIA Omniverse to build innovative solutions in their industries,\u201d said Burkhard Boeckem, CTO of Hexagon.\nThe Origins of OpenUSD\nPixar started work on USD in 2012 as a 3D foundation for its feature films, offering interoperability across data and workflows. The company made this powerful, multifaceted technology open source four years later, so anyone can use OpenUSD and contribute to its development.\nA breakdown of a scene from Pixar\u2019s \u201cCoco\u201d contrasted with the final image. USD was instrumental in creating the film\u2019s complex world. \u00a9 Disney/Pixar\nOpenUSD supports the requirements of building virtual worlds \u2014 like geometry, cameras, lights and materials. It also includes features necessary for scaling to large, complex datasets, and it\u2019s tremendously extensible, enabling the technology to be adapted to workflows beyond visual effects.\nDiagram of OpenUSD that demonstrates it\u2019s power as a technology for large scale, industrial workflows.\nOne unique capability of OpenUSD is its layering system, which lets users collaborate in real time without stepping on each other\u2019s toes. For example, one artist can model a scene while others create the lighting for it.\nForging a Shared Standard\nAs its first priority, the alliance will develop a specification that describes the core functionality of OpenUSD. That\u2019ll provide a recipe tool builders can implement, encouraging adoption of the open standard across the widest possible array of use cases.\nThe alliance will operate as part of the Joint Development Foundation (JDF), a branch of the Linux Foundation. The JDF provides a path to turn written specifications into industry standards suitable for adoption by globally respected groups like the International Organization for Standardization, or the ISO.\nFrom OpenUSD to Omniverse\nNVIDIA has a deep commitment to OpenUSD and working with ecosystem partners to accelerate the framework\u2019s evolution and adoption across industries.\nAt last year\u2019s SIGGRAPH, NVIDIA detailed a multiyear roadmap of contributions it\u2019s making to enable OpenUSD use in architecture, engineering, manufacturing and more. An update on these plans will be presented by NVIDIA as part of the alliance at this year\u2019s conference on computer graphics.\nHelp Build the 3D Future\nCollaboration is key to the alliance and evolution of OpenUSD.\nTo get involved or learn more, attend NVIDIA\u2019s keynote, OpenUSD day, hands-on labs and other showfloor activities at SIGGRAPH, running Aug. 6-10.\nThe Alliance for OpenUSD also will host a keynote panel session at the Academy Software Foundation\u2019s Open Source Days 2023.\nFor more information on the Alliance for OpenUSD (AOUSD), visit the webpage, and follow @AllianceOpenUSD on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn.\nFor a deeper dive on OpenUSD:\n\nCheck out our USD resources page.\nWatch a video series on getting started with OpenUSD.\nTake a course on using OpenUSD in 3D workflows.\nAnd watch a webinar about building applications with NVIDIA Omniverse.\n\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | Creators | Digital Twin | Events | Media and Entertainment | Omniverse | Retail | SIGGRAPH 2023 | Simulation and Design | Universal Scene Description \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

With ACE, generic NPCs can be turned into interactive characters capable of striking up a conversation, or giving you local knowledge that leads to new quests.\nAt COMPUTEX 2023, we showed our ACE Kairos demo, featuring Jin the ramen shop owner, rendered in Unreal Engine 5 with RTX ON. In the months since, our team has continued to evolve ACE. Our newest advancement is the inclusion of NVIDIA NeMo SteerLM, a new technique that enables developers to customize the personality of NPCs for more emotive, realistic and memorable interactions.\nMost LLMs are designed to provide only ideal responses, free of personality or emotion, as you can see by interacting with chat bots. With the SteerLM technique, however, LLMs are trained to provide responses aligned with particular attributes, ranging from humor to creativity, to toxicity, all of which can be quickly configured through simple sliders. Take a look in our latest NVIDIA Kairos demo:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, responses vary significantly as attributes are adjusted, and using NVIDIA NeMo SteerLM, attributes can be further modified, and new models, personalities and attributes can be added, removed or trained, enabling the creation of the perfect interactable NPC for a specific scene or location.\nEmotional response isn\u2019t the only use case that the SteerLM technique enables for games. With the SteerLM technique, developers can enable multiple characters with a single LLM by infusing personality attributes into the SteerLM model. Additionally, developers can create faction attributes to align responses to the in-game story - allowing the character to be dynamically influenced by a changing open world.\u00a0\nIn the demo above, we also used ElevenLabs\u2019 TTS voice for Jin. With ACE, developers can bring their own components to the ACE pipeline, enabling a wide range of options and models.\u00a0\nThe SteerLM technique helps turn polite chat bots into emotive characters that will enable developers to create more immersive and realistic games. We can\u2019t wait to show you our next ACE breakthroughs, so be sure to bookmark GeForce.com for future updates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Depending on user needs, systems can be configured with NVIDIA AI Enterprise or Omniverse Enterprise to power a breadth of demanding generative AI and graphics-intensive workloads.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise 4.0, announced separately today, now includes NVIDIA NeMo\u2122, an end-to-end framework for building and customizing foundation models for generative AI, NVIDIA RAPIDS\u2122 libraries for data science, as well as frameworks, pretrained models and tools for building common enterprise AI use cases, including recommenders, virtual assistants and cybersecurity solutions.\nOmniverse Enterprise is a platform for industrial digitalization that enables teams to develop interoperable 3D workflows and OpenUSD applications. As an OpenUSD-native platform, Omniverse enables globally distributed teams to collaborate on full-design-fidelity datasets from hundreds of 3D applications.\n\u201cYurts provides a full-stack generative AI solution aligning with multiple form factors, deployment models and budgets of our customers. We\u2019ve achieved this by leveraging LLMs for various natural language processing tasks and incorporating the RTX 6000 Ada. From private data centers to workstation-sized solutions that fit under a desk, Yurts remains committed to scaling our platform and offering alongside NVIDIA,\u201d said Jason Schnitzer, chief technology officer at Yurts.\nWorkstation users can also take advantage of the new NVIDIA AI Workbench, available soon in early access, which provides developers with a unified, easy-to-use\u00a0toolkit for creating, fine-tuning and running generative AI models with just a few clicks. Users of any skill level can quickly create, test and customize pretrained generative AI models on a PC or workstation and then scale them to virtually any data center, public cloud or NVIDIA DGX Cloud.\nNext-Generation RTX Technology\r\nThe new NVIDIA RTX 5000, RTX 4500 and RTX 4000 desktop GPUs feature the latest NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture technologies, including:\n\nNVIDIA CUDA\u00ae cores: Up to 2x the single-precision floating point throughput compared to the previous generation.\nThird-generation RT Cores: Up to 2x the throughput of the previous generation with the ability to concurrently run ray tracing with either shading or denoising capabilities.\nFourth-generation Tensor Cores: Up to 2x faster AI training performance than the previous generation with expanded support for the FP8 data format.\nDLSS 3: New levels of realism and interactivity for real-time graphics with the power of AI.\nLarger GPU memory: The RTX 4000 provides 20GB of GDDR6 memory; the RTX 4500 offers 24GB of GDDR6 memory; and the RTX 5000 boasts 32GB of GDDR6 memory \u2014 all supporting error-code correction for error-free computing with large 3D models, rendered images, simulations and AI datasets.\nExtended-reality capabilities: Support for high-resolution augmented-reality and virtual-reality devices to deliver the high-performance graphics required for creating stunning AR, VR and mixed-reality content.\n\n\u201cThe NVIDIA RTX 5000 Ada GPU demonstrates NVIDIA\u2019s impressive generational performance improvements \u2014 it has significantly increased our efficiency in creating stereo panoramas using Enscape,\u201d said Dan Stine, director of design technology at architectural firm Lake|Flato. \u201cWith the performance boost and large frame buffer of RTX 5000 GPUs, our large, complex models look great in virtual reality, which gives our clients a more comfortable and contextual experience.\u201d\nAvailability\nRTX workstations featuring up to four RTX 6000 Ada GPUs, NVIDIA AI Enterprise and NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise will be available from system builders starting in the fall.\nThe new NVIDIA RTX 5000 GPU is now available and shipping from HP and through global distribution partners such as Leadtek, PNY and Ryoyo Electro starting today. The NVIDIA RTX 4500 and RTX 4000 GPUs will be available in the fall from BOXX, Dell Technologies, HP and Lenovo and through global distribution partners.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

DLSS is coming to more AAA blockbusters; emotion is being added to AI-powered non-playable characters (NPCs); Xbox Game Pass titles are coming to the GeForce NOW cloud-gaming service; and upgrades to GeForce NOW servers are underway.\nDLSS 3.5 Introduces Ray Reconstruction\nThe biggest news? The introduction of Ray Reconstruction in DLSS 3.5, a groundbreaking feature that elevates ray-traced image quality for all GeForce RTX GPUs, outclassing traditional hand-tuned denoisers with an AI network trained by an NVIDIA supercomputer.\nThe result improves lighting effects like reflections, global illumination, and shadows to create a more immersive, realistic gaming experience.\nDenoising is used in ray-traced computer graphics to fill in missing pixels to more efficiently composite a final image. NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 is trained on 5x more training data than DLSS 3, so it can recognize different ray-traced effects and make smarter decisions about when to use temporal and spatial data.\nDLSS, first released in February 2019, has gotten a number of major upgrades improving both image quality and performance.\nRay Reconstruction is now included as part of DLSS 3.5, which offers a suite of AI rendering technologies powered by Tensor Cores on GeForce RTX GPUs for faster frame rates, better image quality, and great responsiveness.\nDLSS 3.5 includes Ray Reconstruction, Super Resolution, Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing and Frame Generation.\n\nNVIDIA announced that upcoming blockbusters Alan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty and Portal with RTX will use NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 this fall.\nDLSS 3.5 also improves image quality in real-time 3D creator applications and allows 3D creator professionals to showcase a higher-quality image without spending minutes or hours for the final render.\nRay Reconstruction will be included in upcoming releases of D5 Render, Chaos Vantage and NVIDIA Omniverse, a development platform for connecting and building 3D tools and applications.\nDLSS is now featured in over 330 games and apps. And this fall\u2019s biggest blockbusters will launch with DLSS 3, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, PAYDAY 3 and Fortnite.\nNVIDIA Reflex Comes to More Games\nIn addition, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, PAYDAY 3, Alan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty and more will launch with NVIDIA Reflex, which reduces system latency so gamers\u2019 actions occur quicker, providing a competitive edge in multiplayer matches and making single-player titles more responsive and enjoyable.\nAnd Reflex is already increasing gamers\u2019 competitiveness in the latest editions of wildly popular franchises, with APEX Legends Season 18 and Overwatch 2 Invasion.\nNVIDIA Reflex is now used by over 50 million players each month. It\u2019s available in 9 of the top 10 competitive shooters, including the Counter-Strike 2 beta, and is activated by 90% of GeForce gamers in over 70 supported titles.\nHalf-Life 2 RTX, An RTX Remix Community Project\nHalf-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project is an in-development community remaster of one of the highest-rated games of all time, Valve\u2019s Half-Life 2.\u00a0 Being developed by four of Half-Life 2\u2019s top mod teams using RTX Remix, Half-Life 2 RTX will feature full ray tracing, DLSS 3, Reflex and RTX IO.\n\nAI-Powered NPCs Get More Emotion With NeMo SteerLM\nBringing more AI to gaming, NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) introduces NeMo SteerLM. This new training technique enables developers to customize the personality of NPCs for more emotive, realistic, and memorable interactions.\nACE is a custom AI model foundry that aims to bring intelligence to NPCs through AI-powered natural language interactions.\n\nNew Games, New SuperPODS Come to GeForce NOW\nGeForce NOW also gets new games as Ultimate members connect to more powerful servers.\nNVIDIA announced GeForce RTX 4080 SuperPODs are now fully deployed throughout North America and Europe, bringing exclusive access to RTX 4080-class servers to Ultimate members.\nThose servers will be kept plenty busy.\nComing soon, GeForce NOW members can stream AAA titles Alan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty DLC, PAYDAY 3 and Party Animals at launch from the cloud gaming service.\nAs part of NVIDIA and Microsoft\u2019s collaboration to bring more choice to gamers, Microsoft Store integration will be added to GeForce NOW in the coming days.\nMembers will soon be able to stream over ten supported Xbox PC Game Pass titles at GeForce RTX 4080 quality across devices of their choice. More games from Xbox\u2019s PC Game Pass library will be added to GeForce NOW on a regular basis.\nHead to the cloud and stream new titles joining later this week, including DOOM 2016 from Bethesda.\nSee DLSS 3.5 in Action at Gamescom\nDLSS 3.5 is being demonstrated in NVIDIA\u2019s booth (hall 2.1, booth A10) at Gamescom in Cologne, Germany, August 23-27.\n\n\nCategories: GamingTags: GeForce | GeForce NOW | GPU | NVIDIA DLSS | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA RTX | Omniverse | Ray Tracing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Accessed through a simplified interface running on a local system, it allows developers to customize models from popular repositories like Hugging Face, GitHub and NVIDIA NGC\u2122 using custom data. The models can then be shared easily across multiple platforms.\n\u201cEnterprises around the world are racing to find the right infrastructure and build generative AI models and applications,\u201d said Manuvir Das, vice president of enterprise computing at NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA AI Workbench provides a simplified path for cross-organizational teams to create the AI-based applications that are increasingly becoming essential in modern business.\u201d\nA New Era for AI Developers\r\nWhile hundreds of thousands of pretrained models are now available, customizing them with the many open-source tools can require hunting through multiple online repositories for the right framework, tools and containers, and employing the right skills to customize a model for a specific use case.\nWith NVIDIA AI Workbench, developers can customize and run generative AI in just a few clicks. It allows them to pull together all necessary enterprise-grade models, frameworks, software development kits and libraries from open-source repositories and the NVIDIA AI platform into a unified developer toolkit.\n\r\nLeading AI infrastructure providers \u2014 including Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc., Lambda, Lenovo and Supermicro \u2014 are embracing AI Workbench for its ability to augment their latest generation of multi-GPU-capable desktop workstations, high-end mobile workstations and virtual workstations.\nDevelopers with a Windows or Linux-based NVIDIA RTX\u2122 PC or workstation will also be able to initiate, test and fine-tune enterprise-grade generative AI projects on their local RTX systems, and easily access data center and cloud computing resources to scale as needed.\nNew NVIDIA AI Enterprise 4.0 Software Advances AI Deployment \r\nTo further accelerate the adoption of generative AI, NVIDIA announced the latest version of its enterprise software platform, NVIDIA AI Enterprise 4.0. It gives businesses the tools needed to adopt generative AI, while also offering the security and API stability required for reliable production deployments.\nNewly supported software and tools in NVIDIA AI Enterprise that help streamline generative AI deployment include:\n\nNVIDIA NeMo\u2122, a cloud-native framework to build, customize and deploy large language models. With NeMo, NVIDIA AI Enterprise provides end-to-end support for creating and customizing LLM applications.\nNVIDIA Triton\u2122 Management Service, which helps automate and optimize production deployments. It allows enterprises to automatically deploy multiple NVIDIA Triton Inference Server instances in Kubernetes with model orchestration for efficient operation of scalable AI.\nNVIDIA Base Command Manager Essentials cluster management software, which helps enterprises maximize performance and utilization of AI servers across data center, multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud environments.\n\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise software \u2014 which lets users build and run NVIDIA AI-enabled solutions across the cloud, data center and edge \u2014 is certified to run on mainstream NVIDIA-Certified Systems\u2122, NVIDIA DGX systems, all major cloud platforms and newly announced NVIDIA RTX workstations.\nLeading software companies ServiceNow and Snowflake, as well as infrastructure provider Dell Technologies, which offers Dell Generative AI Solutions, recently announced they are collaborating with NVIDIA to enable new generative AI solutions and services on their platforms. The integration of NVIDIA AI Enterprise 4.0 and NVIDIA NeMo provides a foundation for production-ready generative AI for customers.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise 4.0 will be integrated into partner marketplaces, including\u00a0AWS Marketplace,\u00a0Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, as well as through NVIDIA cloud partner Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\nAdditionally, MLOps providers, including Azure Machine Learning, ClearML, Domino Data Lab, Run:AI, and Weights & Biases, are adding seamless integration with the NVIDIA AI platform to simplify production-grade generative AI model development.\nBroad Partner Support\r\n\u201cDell Technologies and NVIDIA are committed to helping enterprises build purpose-built AI models to access the immense opportunity of generative AI.

Then, we turned the tools over to community modders who remastered Portal: Prelude. Today, we\u2019re unveiling Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project, the in-development community remaster of one of the highest-rated games of all time, Valve\u2019s Half-Life 2.\nHalf-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project is being developed by four of Half-Life 2\u2019s top mod teams, now working together under the banner of Orbifold Studios. Using the latest version of RTX Remix, the modders are rebuilding materials with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) properties, adding extra geometric detail via Valve\u2019s Hammer editor, and leveraging NVIDIA technologies including full ray tracing, DLSS 3, Reflex, and RTX IO to deliver a fantastic experience for GeForce RTX gamers. Take a first look in the announce trailer for Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with the Portal projects, almost every asset is being reconstructed in high fidelity, and full ray tracing (otherwise known as path tracing) is being leveraged to bring cutting-edge graphics to Half-Life 2. In Half-Life 2 RTX, average world textures have 8X the pixels, and assets like the suit feature 20X the geometric detail of the original game. You can now see the fabric weavings around the joints of the suit, and the interplay of plastics and metals that compose the chest, leg, and arm pieces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\nEvery light source bounces around the scene and casts realistic shadows, making Kleiner\u2019s Lab feel like a real place. Orange vats cast light that illuminate dark corners in a vibrant glow, while the liquid inside refracts the entire world through it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\nProps are transformed with full ray tracing, like the magnification lens on Kleiner\u2019s desk, which used shaders in 2004 to depict a low resolution reflection of the world. Now, the magnifying glass contains a curved lens that realistically refracts light and bends every reflection, heightening immersion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\nAnd with remastered PBR materials and textures that interact naturally with these effects, creatures like the Headcrab \u201cLamarr\u201d have never looked better, pointing to how this 20 year-old classic can look like a modern game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\nHalf-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project is early in development and is a community effort looking to galvanize talented modders and artists everywhere. If you are interested in joining the project, and have significant experience with creating mods or 3D art, we encourage you to apply via the Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\nFor more information and the latest news on Half-Life 2 RTX stay tuned to GeForce.com.\nPortal with RTX Upgrades To NVIDIA DLSS 3.5\nThe recently released Portal: Prelude RTX used a new version of NVIDIA RTX Remix that improved performance and the quality of path tracing for older graphics cards. Later this Fall, we\u2019re bringing those optimizations and enhancements to Portal with RTX, alongside an upgrade to NVIDIA DLSS 3.5, which introduces a new feature called Ray Reconstruction that uses AI to improve ray tracing image quality.\nIn Portal with RTX, textures are enhanced as Ray Reconstruction intelligently accumulates engine data and information across multiple frames to produce a more accurate and clear image. With existing rendering techniques, full ray tracing could struggle to resolve multiple photons of light bouncing against thin materials, like metal fences, or highly reflective surfaces. This could cause excessive shimmering on thin surfaces and light instability or \u201cboiling\u201d on reflective walls. But with DLSS 3.5\u2019s Ray Reconstruction technology, each fence appears stable no matter how much light is illuminating the thinnest of its meshes.\nLights and reflections update faster and more accurately, too and each crevice in every room is lit with clarity, making the test chambers of Aperture Laboratories look as they would in the real world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about DLSS 3.5 and Ray Reconstruction here, and head to our DLSS Games Article to see how Alan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, and creative apps are leveraging Ray Reconstruction to further improve image quality.\nWant To Make Your Own RTX Remix Remaster?

NVIDIA DLSS, one of our first major AI algorithms, was introduced five years ago and boosts performance using neural rendering, made possible by the Tensor Cores inside each GeForce RTX GPU.\nSince its initial release, the AI models behind DLSS have kept learning, leading to even better results and new innovations that further multiply performance:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, we advance rendering technology once more with the introduction of NVIDIA DLSS 3.5, featuring Ray Reconstruction, a new AI model that creates higher quality ray-traced images for intensive ray-traced games and apps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch our Tech Talk with VP of Applied Deep Learning Research, Bryan Catanzaro to learn how DLSS 3.5 works\nAlan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, Portal with RTX, Chaos Vantage, D5 Render, and NVIDIA Omniverse are all adding support for NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 this fall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the benefits for yourself in this exclusive new look at Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, rendered with DLSS 3.5 and Full Ray Tracing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Thanks to DLSS 3.5\u2019s smart technology, fuelled by AI rendering power, you can experience Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty\u2019s newest location Dogtown at its very best \u2014 with sharper images, more accurate lighting, and the highest frame rates possible.\" - Jakub Knapik, VP of Art, Global Art Director, CD PROJEKT RED\nTo appreciate the benefits of Ray Reconstruction, let\u2019s look at how ray tracing works.\nFirst, a game engine generates the geometry and materials of a scene, all of which have physically based attributes that affect their appearance and how light interacts with them. A sample of rays are then shot from the camera\u2019s viewpoint, determining the properties of light sources in a scene and how light reacts when it hits materials. For instance, if rays strike a mirror, reflections are generated.\nHowever, shooting rays for every pixel on your screen is too computationally demanding, even for offline renderers that calculate scenes over the course of several minutes or hours. So instead, ray samples must be used - these fire a handful of rays at various points across the scene for a representative sample of the scene\u2019s lighting, reflectivity and shadowing.\nThe output is a noisy, speckled image with gaps, good enough to ascertain how the scene should look when ray-traced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo fill-in the missing pixels that weren\u2019t ray-traced, hand-tuned denoisers use two different methods, temporally accumulating pixels across multiple frames, and spatially interpolating them to blend neighboring pixels together. Through this process, the noisy raw output is converted into a ray-traced image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese denoisers are manually-tuned and processed for each type of ray-traced lighting present in a scene, adding complexity and cost to the development process, and reducing the frame rate in highly ray-traced games where multiple denoisers operate simultaneously to maximize image quality.\nEach hand-tuned denoiser accumulates pixels from multiple frames to increase detail, in effect stealing rays from the past, but at the risk of introducing ghosting, removing dynamic effects, and reducing the quality of others. It also interpolates neighboring pixels, and blends this information together, but at the risk of blending away too much detailed information, or not blending enough and creating non-uniform lighting effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpscaling is the last stage of the ray-traced lighting pipeline, and is key to experiencing the most detailed and demanding games at fast frame rates. But with denoising removing or decreasing the quality of effects, the limitations of hand-tuned denoisers are amplified, removing fine detail (referred to as high-frequency information) that upscalers use to output a crisp, clean image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe solution: NVIDIA DLSS 3.5. Our newest innovation, Ray Reconstruction, is part of an enhanced AI-powered neural renderer that improves ray-traced image quality for all GeForce RTX GPUs by replacing hand-tuned denoisers with an NVIDIA supercomputer-trained AI network that generates higher-quality pixels in between sampled rays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrained with 5X more data than DLSS 3, DLSS 3.5 recognizes different ray-traced effects to make smarter decisions about using temporal and spatial data, and to retain high frequency information for superior-quality upscaling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrained using offline-rendered images, which require far more computational power than can be delivered during a real-time game, Ray Reconstruction recognizes lighting patterns from training data, such as that of global illumination or ambient occlusion, and recreates it in-game as you play. The results are superior to using hand-tuned denoisers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Portal with RTX, with DLSS OFF, the denoiser struggles with spatial interpolation, where it\u2019s not blending enough pixels, creating a blotchy effect. Additionally, it\u2019s not accumulating enough good pixels from previous frames, and the result is a boiling effect in the light. With DLSS 3.5, it recognizes certain patterns associated with reflections and keeps the image stable, accumulating accurate pixels while blending neighboring pixels to generate high quality reflections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following scene from Cyberpunk 2077, the inaccurate headlight illumination which surrounds the car is a result of the hand-tuned denoiser pulling in inaccurate lighting effects from previous frames. DLSS 3.5 accurately generates lighting, so you can make out the beam of the headlights, and see light reflect on the curb in front of the car.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe streets of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Night City are filled with reflections from rotating billboards and neon lights. By activating DLSS 3.5, their quality and clarity is vastly improved city wide:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreative applications have a wide variety of content that are difficult for traditional denoisers as they require hand-tuning per scene. As a result, when previewing content you get suboptimal image quality. With DLSS 3.5, the AI neural network is able to recognize a wide variety of scenes, producing high quality images during preview and before committing hours to a final render. D5 Render, an industry-leading app for architects and designers, will be available with DLSS 3.5 this fall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe integration of DLSS Ray Reconstruction with D5 Render marks our third technical collaboration with NVIDIA, following DLSS SR and FG, which further enhances the image quality of D5 Render's real-time rendering capabilities. We look forward to exploring more possibilities with NVIDIA in the future.\u201d - Jessie Huang, VP, Head of Marketing, D5 Render\nWith DLSS 3.5, we\u2019re delivering a faster, better experience as a free upgrade, building upon the much-loved enhancements already available in your favorite games.\nThanks to RTX, you effectively have the power of 2 computers in your PC or laptop - the first, an NVIDIA supercomputer that trains the DLSS AI model with billions of data points, to boost performance and image quality. And the second, your GeForce RTX graphics card, with dedicated tensor cores to execute the AI model in real-time, plus specialized RT Cores, innovations such as Shader Execution Reordering, and the raw power of each RTX GPU, delivering best-in-class ray tracing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Cyberpunk 2077, the beautiful full ray tracing delivered by the Overdrive Mode could not be achieved smoothly without the power of AI. DLSS Super Resolution (SR), reconstructs the 4K image from a lower resolution input, delivering a dramatic performance boost and great image quality.\u00a0\nTo further increase performance in the most demanding, action-packed moments, we enable DLSS Frame Generation (FG) on GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, which analyzes sequential frames to create additional frames to further increase smoothness.\nAnd now, NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 further improves image quality for ray-traced effects by replacing multiple hand-tuned denoisers with Ray Reconstruction (RR).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining Super Resolution, Frame Generation and Ray Reconstruction, DLSS 3.5 multiplies Cyberpunk 2077 frame rates by a total of 5X compared to native 4K DLSS OFF rendering.\u00a0\nNote that games with multiple ray-traced effects may have several denoisers that are replaced by the single Ray Reconstruction neural network. In these cases, Ray Reconstruction can also offer a performance boost. In titles with less intensive ray tracing and fewer denoisers, Ray Reconstruction improves image quality though may have a slight performance cost.\nGeForce RTX 40 Series users can combine Super Resolution and Frame Generation with Ray Reconstruction for breathtaking performance and image quality, while GeForce RTX 20 and 30 Series users can add Ray Reconstruction to their AI-powered arsenal alongside Super Resolution and DLAA.\nRay Reconstruction is a new option for developers to improve image quality for their ray-traced titles and is offered as part of DLSS 3.5. Rasterized games featuring DLSS 3.5 also include our latest updates to Super Resolution and DLAA, but will not benefit from Ray Reconstruction due to the lack of ray-traced effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 3.5 Arrives This Fall In Leading Games & Apps\nNVIDIA DLSS 3.5 will be available this fall in Alan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, Portal with RTX, Chaos Vantage, D5 Render, and NVIDIA Omniverse. Head to our Gamescom 2023 RTX Games and Apps announcement article to learn more about the integration of DLSS 3.5 in each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive years ago we started a revolutionary journey: to redefine graphics with neural rendering and artificial intelligence. DLSS has come a long way, and today DLSS ON is the best way to play. The most immersive and realistic experiences now rely on the power of AI, yet AI\u2019s transformative impact on graphics is just getting started, and we can\u2019t wait to see where we\u2019ll be five years from now.\nIn the meantime, enhance your experience by using NVIDIA DLSS in over 330 released games and apps.

But \u201cwhile we were reinventing computer graphics with artificial intelligence, we were reinventing the GPU altogether for artificial intelligence,\u201d Huang said.\nThe result: increasingly powerful systems such as the NVIDIA HGX H100, which harnesses eight GPUs\u00a0 \u2014 and a total of 1 trillion transistors \u2014 that offer dramatic acceleration over CPU-based systems.\n\u201cThis is the reason why the world\u2019s data centers are rapidly transitioning to accelerated computing,\u201d Huang told the audience. \u201cThe more you buy, the more you save.\u201d\nTo continue AI\u2019s momentum, NVIDIA created the Grace Hopper Superchip, the NVIDIA GH200, which combines a 72-core Grace CPU with a Hopper GPU, and which went into full production in May.\nHuang announced that NVIDIA GH200, which is already in production, will be complemented with an additional version with cutting-edge HBM3e memory.\nHe followed up on that by announcing the next-generation GH200 Grace Hopper superchip platform with the ability to connect multiple GPUs for exceptional performance and easily scalable server design.\nBuilt to handle the world\u2019s most complex generative workloads, spanning large language models, recommender systems and vector databases, the new platform will be available in a wide range of configurations.\nThe dual configuration \u2014 which delivers up to 3.5x more memory capacity and 3x more bandwidth than the current generation offering \u2014 comprises a single server with 144 Arm Neoverse cores, eight petaflops of AI performance, and 282GB of the latest HBM3e memory technology.\nLeading system manufacturers are expected to deliver systems based on the platform in the second quarter of 2024.\nA packed house at the SIGGRAPH professional graphics conference attended NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s keynote address.\nNVIDIA AI Workbench Speeds Adoption of Custom Generative AI\nTo speed custom adoption of generative AI for the world\u2019s enterprises, Huang announced NVIDIA AI Workbench. It provides developers with a unified, easy-to-use toolkit to quickly create, test and fine-tune generative AI models on a PC or workstation \u2014 then scale them to virtually any data center, public cloud or NVIDIA DGX Cloud.\nAI Workbench removes the complexity of getting started with an enterprise AI project. Accessed through a simplified interface running on a local system, it allows developers to fine-tune models from popular repositories such as Hugging Face, GitHub and NGC using custom data. The models can then be shared easily across multiple platforms.\nWhile hundreds of thousands of pretrained models are now available, customizing them with the many open-source tools available can be challenging and time consuming.\n\u201cIn order to democratize this ability, we have to make it possible to run pretty much everywhere,\u201d Huang said.\nWith AI Workbench, developers can customize and run generative AI in just a few clicks. It allows them to pull together all necessary enterprise-grade models, frameworks, software development kits and libraries into a unified developer workspace.\n\u201cEverybody can do this,\u201d Huang said.\nLeading AI infrastructure providers \u2014 including Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc., Lambda, Lenovo and Supermicro \u2014 are embracing AI Workbench for its ability to bring enterprise generative AI capability to wherever developers want to work \u2014 including a local device.\nHuang also announced a partnership between NVIDIA and startup Hugging Face, which has 2 million users, that will put generative AI supercomputing at the fingertips of millions of developers building large language models and other advanced AI applications.\nDevelopers will be able to access NVIDIA DGX Cloud AI supercomputing within the Hugging Face platform to train and tune advanced AI models.\n\u201cThis is going to be a brand new service to connect the world\u2019s largest AI community to the world\u2019s best training and infrastructure,\u201d Huang said.\nIn a video, Huang showed how AI Workbench and ChatUSD bring it all together: allowing a user to start a project on a GeForce RTX 4090 laptop and scale, seamlessly to a workstation, or the data center\u00a0 as it grows more complex.\nUsing Jupyter Notebook, a user can prompt the model to generate a picture of Toy Jensen in space. When the model provides a result that doesn\u2019t work, because it\u2019s never seen Toy Jensen, the user can fine-tune the model with eight images of Toy Jensen and then prompt it again to get a correct result.\nThen with AI Workbench, the new model can be deployed to an enterprise application.\nNew NVIDIA Enterprise 4.0 Software Advances AI Deployment\nIn a further step to accelerate the adoption of generative AI, NVIDIA announced the latest version of its enterprise software suite, NVIDIA AI Enterprise 4.0.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise gives businesses access to the tools needed to adopt generative AI, while also offering the security and API stability required for large-scale enterprise deployments.\nMajor Omniverse Release Converges Generative AI, OpenUSD for Industrial Digitalization\nOffering new foundation applications and services for developers and industrial enterprises to optimize and enhance their 3D pipelines with the OpenUSD framework and generative AI, Huang announced a major release of NVIDIA Omniverse, an OpenUSD-native development platform for building, simulating, and collaborating across tools and virtual worlds.\nHe also announced NVIDIA\u2019s contributions to OpenUSD, the framework and universal interchange for describing, simulating and collaborating across 3D tools. \n\nUpdates to the Omniverse platform include advancements to Omniverse Kit \u2014 the engine for developing native OpenUSD applications and extensions \u2014 as well as to the NVIDIA Omniverse Audio2Face foundation app and spatial-computing capabilities.\nCesium, Convai, Move AI, SideFX Houdini and Wonder Dynamics are now connected to Omniverse via OpenUSD.\nAnd expanding their collaboration across Adobe Substance 3D, generative AI and OpenUSD initiatives, Adobe and NVIDIA announced plans to make Adobe Firefly \u2014 Adobe\u2019s family of creative generative AI models \u2014 available as APIs in Omniverse.\nOmniverse users can now build content, experiences and applications that are compatible with other OpenUSD-based spatial computing platforms such as ARKit and RealityKit.\n\nHuang announced a broad range of frameworks, resources and services for developers and companies to accelerate the adoption of Universal Scene Description, known as OpenUSD, including contributions such as geospatial data models, metrics assembly and simulation-ready, or SimReady, specifications for OpenUSD.\n\nHuang also announced four new Omniverse Cloud APIs built by NVIDIA for developers to more seamlessly implement and deploy OpenUSD pipelines and applications.\n\nChatUSD \u2014 Assisting developers and artists working with OpenUSD data and scenes, ChatUSD is a large language model (LLM) agent for generating Python-USD code scripts from text and answering USD knowledge questions.\nRunUSD \u2014 a cloud API that translates OpenUSD files into fully path-traced rendered images by checking compatibility of the uploaded files against versions of OpenUSD releases, and generating renders with Omniverse Cloud.\nDeepSearch \u2014 an LLM agent enabling fast semantic search through massive databases of untagged assets.\nUSD-GDN Publisher \u2014 a one-click service that enables enterprises and software makers to publish high-fidelity, OpenUSD-based experiences to the Omniverse Cloud Graphics Delivery Network (GDN) from an Omniverse-based application such as USD Composer, as well as stream in real time to web browsers and mobile devices.\n\nThese contributions are an evolution of last week\u2019s announcement of NVIDIA\u2019s co-founding of the Alliance for OpenUSD along with Pixar, Adobe, Apple and Autodesk.\nPowerful New Desktop Systems, Servers\nProviding more computing power for all of this, Huang said NVIDIA and global workstation manufacturers are announcing powerful new RTX workstations for development and content creation in the age of generative AI and digitization.\nThe systems, including those from BOXX, Dell Technologies, HP and Lenovo, are based on NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Generation GPUs and incorporate NVIDIA AI Enterprise and NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise software.\nSeparately, NVIDIA released three new desktop workstation Ada Generation GPUs \u2014 the NVIDIA RTX 5000, RTX 4500 and RTX 4000 \u2014 to deliver the latest AI, graphics and real-time rendering technology to professionals worldwide.\nHuang also detailed how, together with global data center system manufacturers, NVIDIA is continuing to supercharge generative AI and industrial digitization with new NVIDIA OVX featuring the new NVIDIA L40S GPU, a powerful, universal data center processor design.\nThe powerful new systems will accelerate the most compute-intensive, complex applications, including AI training and inference, 3D design and visualization, video processing and industrial digitalization with the NVIDIA Omniverse platform.\nNVIDIA Research Bringing New Capabilities\nMore innovations are coming, thanks to NVIDIA Research.\nAt the show\u2019s Real Time Live Event, NVIDIA researchers will demonstrate a generative AI workflow that helps artists rapidly

This high-speed, coherent technology gives the GPU full access to the CPU memory, providing a combined 1.2TB of fast memory when in dual configuration.\nHBM3e memory, which is 50% faster than current HBM3, delivers a total of 10TB/sec of combined bandwidth, allowing the new platform to run models 3.5x larger than the previous version, while improving performance with 3x faster memory bandwidth.\nGrowing Demand for Grace Hopper\r\nLeading manufacturers are already offering systems based on the previously announced Grace Hopper Superchip. To drive broad adoption of the technology, the next-generation Grace Hopper Superchip platform with HBM3e is fully compatible with the NVIDIA MGX\u2122 server specification unveiled at COMPUTEX earlier this year. With MGX, any system manufacturer can quickly and cost-effectively add Grace Hopper into over 100 server variations.\nAvailability\r\nLeading system manufacturers are expected to deliver systems based on the platform in Q2 of calendar year 2024.\nWatch Huang\u2019s SIGGRAPH keynote address on demand to learn more about Grace Hopper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company\u2019s invention of the\u00a0GPU\u00a0in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling industrial digitalization across markets. NVIDIA is now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.

From the Wall Street Journal:\n\n  Chip maker Nvidia said revenue in its recently completed quarter more than doubled from a year ago, setting a new company record, and projected that surging interest in artificial intelligence is propelling its business faster than expected. Nvidia is at the heart of the boom in artificial intelligence that made it a $1 trillion company this year, and it is forecasting growth that outpaces even the most bullish analyst projections.\n  Nvidia\u2019s stock, already the top performer in the S&P 500 this year, rose 7.5% following the results, which would be about $87 billion in market value. The company said revenue more than doubled in its fiscal second quarter to about $13.5 billion, far ahead of Wall Street forecasts in a FactSet survey. Even more strikingly, it said revenue in its current quarter would be around $16 billion, besting expectations by about $3.5 billion. Net profit for the company\u2019s second quarter was $6.19 billion, also surpassing forecasts.\n  The results show a wave of investment in artificial intelligence that began late last year with the arrival of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT language-generation tool is gaining steam as companies and governments seek to harness its power in business and everyday life. Many companies see AI as indispensable to their future growth and are making large investments in computing infrastructure to support it.\n\nNow the big question on everyone\u2019s mind is if Nvidia is the new Cisco:\n\nI don\u2019t think so, at least in terms of the near-term: there are some fundamental differences between Nvidia and Cisco that are worth teasing out. The bigger question is the long term, and here the comparison might be more apt.\nNvidia and Cisco\nThe first difference between Nvidia and Cisco is in the above charts: Nvidia already went through a crash, thanks to the double whammy of Ethereum moving to proof-of-stake and the COVID cliff in terms of PC sales; both left Nvidia with huge amounts of inventory it had to write-off over the second half of last year. The bright spot for Nvidia was the steady growth of data center revenue, thanks to the increase of machine learning workloads; I included this chart in that Article last fall:\n\n\n\nWhat has happened over the last two quarters is that data center revenue is devouring the rest of the company; here is an updated version of that same chart:\n\nHere is Nvidia\u2019s revenue mix:\n\nThis dramatic shift in Nvidia\u2019s business provides some interesting contrasts to Cisco\u2019s dot-com run-up. First, here was Cisco\u2019s revenue, gross profit, net profit, and stock price in the ten years starting from its 1993 IPO:\n\nHere is Nvidia\u2019s last ten years:\n\nThe first thing to note is the extent to which Nvidia\u2019s crash last year looks similar to Cisco\u2019s dot-com crash: in both cases steady but steep revenue increases initially outpaced the stock price, which eventually overshot just a few quarters before big inventory write-downs led to big decreases in profitability (score one for crypto optimists hopeful that the current doldrums are simply their own dot-com hangover).\nCisco, though, didn\u2019t have a second act, unlike this data center explosion. What is notable is the extent to which Nvidia\u2019s revenue increase is matching the slope of the stock price increase (obviously this is inexact given the different axis); it seems likely that the stock will overshoot revenue growth soon enough, but it hasn\u2019t really happened yet. It\u2019s also worth noting how much more disciplined Nvidia appears to be in terms of below-the-line costs: its net profit is moving in concert with its revenue, unlike Cisco in the 90s; I suspect this is a function of Nvidia being a much larger and more mature company.\nAnother difference is the nature of Nvidia\u2019s customers: over 50% of the company\u2019s Q2 revenue came from the large cloud service providers, followed by large consumer Internet companies (i.e. Meta). This category does, of course, include the startups that once might have purchased Cisco routers and Sun servers directly, and now rent capacity (if they can get it); cloud providers, though, monetize their hardware immediately, which is good for Nvidia.\nStill, there is an important difference from other cloud workloads: previously a new company or line of business only ramped their cloud utilization with usage, which ought to correlate to customer acquisition, if not revenue. Model training, though, is an up-front cost, not dissimilar to the cost needed to buy those Sun servers and Cisco routers in the dot-com era; that is cloud revenue that has a much higher likelihood of disappearing if the company in question doesn\u2019t find a market.\nThis point is relevant to Nvidia given that training is the part of AI where the company is the most dominant, thanks to both its software ecosystem and the ability to operate huge fleet of Nvidia chips as a single GPU; inference is where Nvidia will first see challenges, and that is also the area of AI that is correlated with usage, and thus more durable from a cloud provider perspective.\nThose points about a software ecosystem and hardware scalability are also the biggest reason why Nvidia is different than Cisco. Nvidia has a moat in both, along with a substantial manufacturing advantage thanks to its upfront payments to TSMC over the last several years to secure its own 4nm line (and having the good fortune of asking for more scale at a time when TSMC\u2019s other sources of high performance computing revenue are in a slump). There is certainly a massive incentive for both the cloud providers and large Internet companies to bridge Nvidia\u2019s moats \u2014 see AWS\u2019s investments in its own chips, for example, or Meta\u2019s development of and support for PyTorch \u2014 but right now Nvidia has a big lead and the frenzy inspired by ChatGPT is only deepening their install base, with all of the positive ecosystem effects that entails.\nGPU Demand\nThe biggest challenge facing Nvidia is the one that is ultimately out of their control: what does the final market look like?\nGo back to the dot-com era, and the era that proceeded it. The advent of computing, first in the form of mainframes and then the PC, digitized information, making it endlessly duplicable. Then came the Internet which made the marginal cost of distributing that content go to zero (with the caveat that most people had very low bandwidth). This was an obvious business opportunity that plenty of startups jumped all over, even as telecom companies took on the bandwidth problem; Cisco was the beneficiary of both.\nThe missing element, though, was demand: consistent consumer demand for Internet applications only started to arrive with the advent of broadband connections in the 2000s (thanks in part to a buildout that bankrupted said telecom companies), and then exploded with smartphones a decade later, which made the Internet accessible anytime, anywhere. It was demand that made the router business as big as dot-com investors thought it might be, although by then Cisco had a host of competitors, including large cloud providers who built (and open-sourced) their own.\nThere are lots of potential starting points to choose for AI: machine learning has obviously been a thing for a while, or you might point to the 2017 invention of the transformer; the release of GPT-3 in 2020 was perhaps akin to the release of the Mosaic web browser, which would make ChatGPT the Netscape IPO. One way to categorize this emergence is to characterize training as being akin to digitization in the previous era, and creation \u2014\u00a0i.e. inference \u2014 as akin to distribution. Once again there are obvious business opportunities that arise from combining the two, and once again startups are jumping all over them, along with the big incumbents.\nHowever you want to make the analogy, what is important to note is that the missing element is the same: demand. ChatGPT took the world by storm, and the use of AI for writing code is both proliferating widely and is extremely high leverage. Every SaaS company in tech, meanwhile, is hard at work at an AI strategy, for the benefit of their sales team if nothing else. That is no small thing, and the exploration and implementation of those strategies will use up a lot of Nvidia GPUs over the next few years. The ultimate question, though, is how much of this AI stuff is actually used, and that is ultimately out of Nvidia\u2019s control.\nMy best guess is that the next several years will be occupied building out the most obvious use cases, particularly in the enterprise; the analogy here is to the 2000s build-out of the web. The question, though, is what will be the analogy to mobile (and the cloud), which exploded demand and led to one of the most profitable decades tech has ever seen? The answer may be an already discarded fad: the metaverse.\nA GPU Overhang and the Metaverse\nIn April 2022, when Dall-E 2 came out, I wrote DALL-E, the Metaverse, and Zero Marginal Content, and highlighted three trends:\n\nFirst, the gaming industry was increasingly about a few AAA games, small indie titles, and the huge sea of mobile; the limiting factor in further development was the astronomical cost of developing high quality assets.\nSecond, social media succeeded by virtue of making content creation free, because users created the content of their own volition.\nThird, TikTok pointed to a future where every individual not only had their own feed, but also where the provenance of that content didn\u2019t matter.\n\nAI is how those three trends might intersect:\n\n  What is fascinating about DALL-E is that it points to a future where these three trends can be combined. DALL-E, at the end of the day, is ultimately a product of human-generated content, just like its GPT-3 cousin. The latter, of course, is about text, while DALL-E is about images. Notice, though, that progression from text to images; it follows that machine learning-generated video is next. This will likely take several years, of course; video is a much more difficult problem, and responsive 3D environments more difficult yet, but this is a path the industry has trod before:\n\nGame developers pushed the limits on text, then images, then video, then 3D\nSocial media drives content creation costs to zero first on text, then images, then video\nMachine learning models can now create text and images for zero marginal cost\n\n  In the very long run this points to a metaverse vision that is much less deterministic than your typical video game, yet much richer than what is generated on social media. Imagine environments that are not drawn by artists but rather created by AI: this not only increases the possibilities, but crucially, decreases the costs.\n\nI wrote in the conclusion:\n\n  Machine learning generated content is just the next step beyond TikTok: instead of pulling content from anywhere on the network, GPT and DALL-E and other similar models generate new content from content, at zero marginal cost. This is how the economics of the metaverse will ultimately make sense: virtual worlds need virtual content created at virtually zero cost, fully customizable to the individual.\n\nZero marginal cost is, I should note, aspirational at this point: inference is expensive, both in terms of power and also in terms of the need to pay off all of that money that is showing up on Nvidia\u2019s earnings. It\u2019s possible to imagine a scenario a few years down the line, though, where Nvidia has deployed countless ever more powerful GPUs, and inspired massive competition such that the world\u2019s supply of GPU power far exceeds demand, driving the marginal costs down to the cost of energy (which hopefully will have become cheaper as well); suddenly the idea of making virtual environments on demand won\u2019t seem so far-fetched, opening up entirely new end-user experiences that explode demand in the way that mobile once did.\nThe GPU Age\nThe challenge for Nvidia is that this future isn\u2019t particularly investable; indeed, the idea assumes a capacity overhang at some point, which is not great for the stock price! That, though, is how technology advances, and even if a cliff eventually comes, there is a lot of money to be made in the meantime.\nThat noted, the biggest short-term question I have is around Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s insistence that the current wave of demand is in fact the dawn of what he calls accelerated computing; from the Nvidia earnings call:\n\n  I\u2019m reluctant to guess about the future and so I\u2019ll answer the question from the first principle of computer science perspective. It is recognized for some time now that\u2026using general purpose computing at scale is no longer the best way to go forward. It\u2019s too energy costly, it\u2019s too expensive, and the performance of the applications are too slow. And finally, the world has a new way of doing it. It\u2019s called accelerated computing and what kicked it into turbocharge is generative AI. But accelerated computing could be used for all kinds of different applications that\u2019s already in the data center. And by using it, you offload the CPUs. You save a ton of money in order of magnitude, in cost and order of magnitude and energy and the throughput is higher and that\u2019s what the industry is really responding to.\n  Going forward, the best way to invest in the data center is to divert the capital investment from general purpose computing and focus it on generative AI and accelerated computing. Generative AI provides a new way of generating productivity, a new way of generating new services to offer to your customers, and accelerated computing helps you save money and save power. And the number of applications is, well, tons. Lots of developers, lots of applications, lots of libraries. It\u2019s ready to be deployed.\n  And so I think the data centers around the world recognize this, that this is the best way to deploy resources, deploy capital going forward for data centers. This is true for the world\u2019s clouds and you\u2019re seeing a whole crop of new GPU-specialized cloud service providers. One of the famous ones is CoreWeave and they\u2019re doing incredibly well. But you\u2019re seeing the regional GPU specialist service providers all over the world now. And it\u2019s because they all recognize the same thing, that the best way to invest their capital going forward is to put it into accelerated computing and generative AI.\n\nMy interpretation of Huang\u2019s outlook is that all of these GPUs will be used for a lot of the same activities that are currently run on CPUs; that is certainly a bullish view for Nvidia, because it means the capacity overhang that may come from pursuing generative AI will be back-filled by current cloud computing workloads. And, to be fair, Huang has a point about the power and space limitations of current architectures.\nThat noted, I\u2019m skeptical: humans \u2014 and companies \u2014 are lazy, and not only are CPU-based applications easier to develop, they are also mostly already built. I have a hard time seeing what companies are going to go through the time and effort to port things that already run on CPUs to GPUs; at the end of the day, the applications that run in a cloud are determined by customers who provide the demand for cloud resources, not cloud providers looking to optimize FLOP/rack.\nIf GPUs are going to be as big of a market as Nvidia\u2019s investors hope it will be, it will be because applications that are only possible with GPUs generate the demand to make it so. I\u2019m confident that time will come; what I, nor Huang, nor anyone else can be sure of is when that time will arrive.\nI wrote a follow-up to this Article in this Daily Update.\nShareFacebookTwitterLinkedInEmail\n\n\n\nGet notified about new Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease verify your email address to proceed.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelatedNvidia In the ValleyDateMonday, September 26, 2022Nvidia\u2019s Integration DreamsDateTuesday, September 15, 2020Nvidia Waves and MoatsDateTuesday, March 19, 2024\n\u2190Disney\u2019s Taylor Swift Era\nThe Rise and Fall of ESPN\u2019s Leverage\u2192\n\n\nSearch\n\nStratechery Plus\nUpdates\n\n\nIntel\u2019s New CEO, Reevaluating Gelsinger, Lip-Bu Tan and Cadence\nTuesday, March 18, 2025\n\nMetallica on Vision Pro, Non-Immersive Immersive Video, Ping and AI\nMonday, March 17, 2025\n\nAn Interview with Tailscale Co-Founder and CEO Avery Pennarun\nThursday, March 13, 2025\n\n\nView All\n\n\n\nStratechery Plus\nPodcasts\n\nA 2021 Redraft: Cade\u2019s Revival, Mobley\u2019s Ascent, Redrafting Multiple Jalens, Sengun Four Years Later, and MoreGreatest Of All Talk | Mar 18A 2021 Redraft: Cade\u2019s Revival, Mobley\u2019s Ascent, Redrafting Multiple Jalens, Sengun Four Years Later, and MoreApple's PreciousnessDithering | Mar 18Apple's Preciousness(Preview) Should Apple Buy Perplexity?, What Apple Could Learn from IBM, Vision Pro and Its VaporwareSharp Tech | Mar 17(Preview) Should Apple Buy Perplexity?, What Apple Could Learn from IBM, Vision Pro and Its Vaporware\n\n\nStratechery Plus\nInterviews\n\n\nAn Interview with Tailscale Co-Founder and CEO Avery Pennarun\nThursday, March 13, 2025\n\nAn Interview with Michael Nathanson About the Streaming Endgame\nThursday, March 6, 2025\n\nAn Interview with Benedict Evans About AI Unknowns\nThursday, February 27, 2025\n\n\nView All\n\n\nMore by Ben Thompson\nYear in Review\nThe most popular and most important posts on Stratechery by year.\n\nView All\n\nAll Articles\nExplore all free articles on Stratechery.\n\nView All\n\nAll Content\nExplore all posts on Stratechery.\n\nView All\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStratechery Plus\nUpdateS\n\n\nIntel\u2019s New CEO, Reevaluating Gelsinger, Lip-Bu Tan and Cadence\nTuesday, March 18, 2025\n\nMetallica on Vision Pro, Non-Immersive Immersive Video, Ping and AI\nMonday, March 17, 2025\n\nAn Interview with Tailscale Co-Founder and CEO Avery Pennarun\nThursday, March 13, 2025\n\n\nView All\n\n\n\n\nStratechery Plus\nPodcasts\n\nA 2021 Redraft: Cade\u2019s Revival, Mobley\u2019s Ascent, Redrafting Multiple Jalens, Sengun Four Years Later, and MoreGreatest Of All Talk | Mar 18A 2021 Redraft: Cade\u2019s Revival, Mobley\u2019s Ascent, Redrafting Multiple Jalens, Sengun Four Years Later, and MoreApple's PreciousnessDithering | Mar 18Apple's Preciousness(Preview) Should Apple Buy Perplexity?, What Apple Could Learn from IBM, Vision Pro and Its VaporwareSharptech | Mar 17(Preview) Should Apple Buy Perplexity?, What Apple Could Learn from IBM, Vision Pro and Its Vaporware\n\n\nStratechery Plus\nInterviews\n\n\nAn Interview with Tailscale Co-Founder and CEO Avery Pennarun\nThursday, March 13, 2025\n\nAn Interview with Michael Nathanson About the Streaming Endgame\nThursday, March 6, 2025\n\nAn Interview with Benedict Evans About AI Unknowns\nThursday, February 27, 2025\n\n\nView All\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Stratechery LLC 2025 | Terms of Service | Privacy Policy\nProudly powered by WordPress.

The company has made huge strides in GPU/CPU technology, as well as AI technology and its applications, making it an exciting company to watch in financials. NVIDIA is reporting on its Q2 2024 earnings results today and with it will come a conference call discussing the results, as well as future business and expectations. If you want to listen in on that call, we have the details here.\nListen to the NVIDIA\u2019s Q2 2024 earnings call\n\nNVIDIA will go live with its Q2 2024 earnings call on August 23, 2023, at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET. It\u2019s accessible via NVIDIA\u2019s Investor Relations website, but requires users to log in with a Q4 account that asks for name and company. If you don\u2019t want to do that, Shacknews will be livestreaming the call on the Shacknews Twitch channel and you can simply listen to the call via our livestream above or on Twitch.\nAhead of NVIDIA\u2019s Q2 2024 financial results release, estimates have already come out from Wall Street and Whisper Number.

NVIDIA has been having an enormously successful year, and it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s slowing down anytime soon. For its Q2 2024 financial results, NVIDIA was able to post a huge beat over both revenue and earnings-per-share estimates for the quarter.\nNVIDIA posted its Q2 2024 earnings results on its Investor Relations website on August 23, 2023. The company overperformed vastly over any and all expectations set for it for this quarter. Wall Street called for an estimate of $11.2 billion USD in revenue from NVIDA for Q2 2024, but the company put up $13.5 billion. It similarly crushed EPS estimates. Wall Street called for an EPS of $2.09 per share while Whisper Number called for $2.13 per share. Instead, NVIDIA put up $2.70 per share, blowing both estimates out of the water to say the least.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) stock was up massively in after-hours trading on the back of its Q2 2024 earnings results.\n\nThere were a number of fascinating stats in NVIDIA\u2019s Q2 2024 results as well. It\u2019s revenue was up over 101 percent year-over-year from Q2 2023. Meanwhile, it was up 88 percent from NVIDIA\u2019s previous quarter in Q1 2024. NVIDIA went on to share that GAAP earnings per diluted share ended up at $2.48 per share, up a phenomenal 854 percent year-over-year and 202 percent over the previous quarter. Even Non-GAAP earning per diluted share were up 429 percent year-over-year.\nSafe to say, NVIDIA didn\u2019t just have a winning Q2 2024, but a rather outstanding one at that. It will remain to be seen if the company can maintain this level of momentum through the year, but the company seems confident. Following this quarter, NVIDIA forecasted revenue guidance above analyst expectation for Q3 2024. Stay tuned for more fiscal reporting as companies continue to share quarterly earnings results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTJ Denzer\nSenior News Editor\n\n\n\nTJ Denzer is a player and writer with a passion for games that has dominated a lifetime.

As AI technologies continue to captivate markets, Nvidia\u2019s unprecedented rise stands as a testament to its pivotal role in shaping the future.\nEven though Nvidia\u2019s ascent in 2023 has been nothing short of impressive, the stock\u2019s journey from its initial public offering (IPO) is even more striking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Picks for you\n  \n\n\n\n                  Here\u2019s why Bitcoin\u2019s pullback is a buy signal and not a bear market warning\n              \n1 hour ago\n\n\n\n                  Economist says the real Trump trade is ditching U.S. stocks for foreign markets\n              \n4 hours ago\n\n\n\n                  How Dogecoin could trigger next market crash, according to commodity strategist\n              \n7 hours ago\n\n\n\n                  Legal expert warns Ripple v.

Nvidia\u2019s shares debuted more than 24 years ago at just $12 apiece, and now, the stock trades at over $492 after printing another record high on Wednesday, August 30.\nNVDA 212,000% price surge since 1999 IPO. Source: Gurgavin\nThis means that if one invested $10,000 in NVDA at its IPO, this investment would today be worth a whopping $19.5 million, according to calculations disclosed by stock trader Gurgavin.\u00a0\nDuring this awe-inspiring ride of over 2 decades, NVDA dropped more than 50% 12 times and plummeted 90% twice, Gurgavin added.\nNvidia stock price analysis\nAt the time of publication on August 31, shares of Nvidia were standing at a new historical high of $492.64, after climbing an additional 1% on Wednesday.\nNVDA 1-day price chart.

Since its launch in January 2022, we\u2019ve unpacked a number of features on Brokerage that helps you to become a better, smarter investor.\u00a0\nHere are some Syfe Brokerage features that you may not know about, which you can use to buff up your investment game!\n1. Fractional Trading\n\n\nTrade starting with any amount that you\u2019re comfortable with. By starting out with small capital to invest, you can own a fraction of a share, and still get your hands on your favorite stocks even though you might not be able to buy a whole share.\u00a0\nAs an example, one share of NVDA (as of 3rd Aug 2023) is priced at around US$465. With fractional trading, you can buy $100 or even $1 worth of a NVDA stock \u2013 you can set aside however much you want to invest as a whole and customise the amount to each trade. This allows you to build a diversified portfolio with baskets of stocks regardless of how much capital you have without having to purchase whole shares.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re looking to invest regularly, fractional trading also complements a DCA strategy. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re looking to invest $1,000 into the previous NVDA stock every month, fractional trading will help you to execute 2.15 shares of the stock. Without fractional trading, you would only be able to buy 2 shares with the intended amount, leaving $70 uninvested.\u00a0\u00a0\nWith fractional trading, you\u2019re able to put your every dollar to work, which means you do not have to wait until you accumulate certain sums to invest.\u00a0\n2. Recurring Buy\n\n\nInvest on autopilot with recurring buy. The feature allows you to schedule buy orders at any dollar value or share count, and set frequencies as often as you like, whether that\u2019s monthly, weekly or even daily.\nIf you are looking to invest $500 monthly in AAPL stocks as part of your DCA strategy. You can do so in three simple steps: add in amount, select your desired frequency and slide to review.\u00a0\nBy investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals regardless of how the stock market is performing, you get to ride out market volatilities or average the cost of your AAPL investments over time. In the long run, this may mean that you actually pay less than a lump-sum purchase (possibly at a higher cost price of share, depending on the market conditions).\u00a0\nBonus Tip: You can also set a standing instruction from your bank account to deposit money automatically into your Syfe Trade account regularly, for a seamless DCA investing experience.\n3. Stock Price Alerts\n\n\nTime your trades better by setting price alerts on your favourite stocks.\u00a0\u00a0\nKnow when to take advantage of that \u2018buy low\u2019, \u2018sell high\u2019 motto. Set target price or average cost alerts to be notified of stock price changes and decide when to buy/sell stocks.\u00a0\nIf you own a stock and are looking to profit, you can set your target price as a percentage (ex: +10%) or a fixed price ($215), the app will shoot you an alert once the market price hits your target.\nIf you\u2019re looking to DCA on a particular stock long term and average the cost on your positions, you could also do the same with average cost alerts.\nThis means that you can keep up to date with the latest stock movements without having to constantly monitor the stock market. You can add, edit or stop these alerts at any time.\n4. Discover\n\n\nBrowse through stocks by popularity, curated themes and sectors to gain inspiration on what to invest in. Enjoy the convenience of our in-app Wall Street insights readily at your fingertips, allowing you to easily access rating prices, average analyst price target, forward earning estimates and history.\nAdditionally, our latest feature, Peer Picks, also lets you peek into how similar Syfe investors invest! View the most popular assets amongst other like-minded investors, based on your demographics, risk appetite, investment behaviour and interests. You also get to discover which other assets are popular amongst your peers to be dollar-cost averaging (DCA) into.\nKeep an eye out on these features on our app, and use it the next time together with your trades! All of the features above are applicable across SG and US stock exchanges (with the exception of fractional which is only available for US) to level up your investment strategy with these features.\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\nFacebookTwitterLinkedin\n\n Previous articleWeekly Market Wrap | 29 July 2023Next articleWeekly Market Wrap | 5 August 2023 Syfe Singapore  \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingaporeHONG KONGAUSTRALIASyfe Pte.

Thomson ReutersNvidia's forward earnings valuation plungesAt that price, Nvidia shares are trading at the equivalent of around 33 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, according to Refinitiv data. That forward PE compares to over 46 a week ago, and it is now at its lowest since December 2022.Nvidia's stock has more than tripled this year amid soaring demand for its top-of-the-line processors used to power generative AI technologies that can read and write in human-like ways.        Price/earnings ratios help investors gauge the value of companies, but relying on analysts' estimates of future earnings creates uncertainty.        \"Any time you use a forward-looking thing that involves an estimate in a very new market and very uncertain economic environment, I think at a minimum you have to take it with a pretty huge grain of salt,\" warned Ross Mayfield, an investment strategy analyst at Baird.Benchmark Research analyst Cody Acree has a \"buy\" rating on Nvidia but pointed to the company's reliance on Taiwanese chip foundry TSMC 2330, which also serves Apple AAPL and other big customers, as a factor that could keep Nvidia from selling as many of its high-end chips as it would like. \"It's not just demand, but what they can actually deliver,\" Acree said.In its report last week, Nvidia, with a stock market value of $1.14 trillion, also said it would buy back $25 billion of its shares, suggesting chief executive Jensen Huang views them as undervalued, even after gaining 220% year to date.Following its report, analysts on average expect Nvidia's revenue for the fiscal year ending in January 2024 to reach $53 billion, nearly double the previous year, according to Refinitiv data. The company's net income is seen quintupling to over $22 billion in the same fiscal year before reaching $35 billion the following year.Reuters\u00a9 Copyright Thomson Reuters 2023.

The Nvidia RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark is a game-changer by cutting both costs and carbon emissions by up to 80%.\u00a0\nApache Spark is a software used by thousands of companies, including the world\u2019s largest ones to speed up data analytics.\u00a0\nNvidia RAPIDS Accelerator\u2019s ability to both improve analytics performance and energy efficiency can help businesses meet their net zero emissions. This innovative solution holds the promise of substantial carbon reductions for corporations and enterprises using Apache Spark.\nIncreasing Speed, Reducing Costs and Emissions with Green Computing\nNot only can the RAPIDS Accelerator cut a company\u2019s carbon emissions by as much as 80%, but it can also deliver 5x faster and cost 4x less on a GPU-accelerated Apache Spark. That means 80% of Fortune 500 companies using Apache Spark can collectively reduce their emissions significantly.\nAccording to its creator Nvidia, each Spark user adopting the accelerator software can reduce a total of 7.8 metric tons of CO2 a year. To put that into perspective, it\u2019s the same as how much a car emits in burning 878 gallons of oil.\u00a0\nThus, Nvidia\u2019s RAPIDS Accelerator is a breakthrough in how green computing can help in the fight against climate change.\u00a0\n\nWhat is Green Computing?\nGreen computing is also called sustainable computing or green information technology (IT), spanning supply chains, from raw materials to recycling. It refers to the practice of maximizing energy efficiency while minimizing the environmental impact of computer chips, systems, and software.\u00a0\nIn their lifecycle, green computing enables tasks through computers to be done for the least energy use possible. Efficiency is usually measured by performance per watt.\u00a0\nThe energy efficiency of computers is crucial because the growing demand for electricity is one of the major culprits of global warming. Though data centers are responsible for only 1% or 200 terawatt-hours of electricity use each year, their growth demands attention.\u00a0\nIn fact, industry estimates show that electricity use can go up to 13% by 2030 while the share of global carbon emissions would be 6% for the same year.\u00a0\nChart Source: Fintechcircle.com\nThis is where green computers can offer a solution as \u201cenergy efficiency is a full-stack issue, from the software down to the chips\u201d, says an Nvidia engineer. Indeed, innovations in green computing resonate at every level across the industry with Nvidia taking center stage.\u00a0\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s data centers themselves are responsible for 63% of the company\u2019s energy use, according to its recent annual report (FY2023).\u00a0\n\n\nThe company aims to reduce its own Scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with a 1.5C global temperature rise. For its Scope 3 emissions, Nvidia is engaging suppliers accounting for at least 67% of its supply chain emissions. The end goal is to influence them to also adopt science-based carbon reduction targets.\n\nTo address the growing emissions of its data centers, labs, and offices, as shown in the table above, Nvidia focuses on efficient operations and sourcing renewable energy. By getting its entire electricity supply from renewable sources, the company can reduce its Scope 2 market-based emissions by 100% by January 2025.\u00a0\nIn its latest report, Nvidia managed to increase energy use from renewables by 44%, a 6% jump from previous year. As the IT expert continues to expand its operations, data centers emissions are also growing rapidly. The company will address this through the use of renewable energy, more efficiency, and its own accelerated green computing.\nGreen Computers for Net Zero\nIn a world where more than 70 countries strive to reach net zero emissions, green or accelerated computing emerges as a vital tool in this global challenge.\n\n\n\n\nMajor industry leaders like Nvidia are working with companies in various sectors to show the technology\u2019s benefits and potential.\u00a0\nFor example, the computer chip expert works with a renowned financial services company to test its application for real-time fraud protection. The financier aims to cut its carbon emission with accelerated computing so that it aligns with the Net-Zero Banking Alliance.\u00a0\nMoreover, Nvidia reported that a large AI supercomputer confirmed the energy efficiency of its green computing tech in May.\n\nNotably, across 4 popular applications, the Perlmutter supercomputer at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) demonstrated remarkable energy efficiency gains of 5x on average with Nvidia A100 Tensor Core GPUs.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNERSC apps got efficiency gains with accelerated computing.\nIn fact, a weather forecasting application recorded acceleration of almost 10x compared to regular CPUs. These results are proof that green or accelerated computing is powerful in diverse applications.\u00a0\nRemarkable Testimonies for Accelerated Computing\nOther notable testaments of the Nvidia RAPIDS Accelerator came from Adobe, IRS, and AT&T. They all have tested and harnessed the powerful ability and potential of this green computing and information technology. They have experienced accelerated speeds, cost reduction, and remarkable AI model training gains.\u00a0\nFor instance, AT&T was able to process 2.8 trillion rows of mobile data information for only 5 hours \u2013 over 3x faster at 60% reduced cost than any previous test.\u00a0\nAccording to the company\u2019s AI architect, it would take over 48 hours to process only 7 days of data on CPU clusters. Compared that to the 5-hour result for Nvidia\u2019s accelerator which involved a month\u2019s worth of data.\u00a0\nSo the AI expert suggested that:\n\u201c\u2026 if a job is taking too long and you have a lot of data, turn on GPUs \u2014 with Spark, the same code that runs on CPUs runs on GPUs.\u201d\nAdobe also tried Nvidia\u2019s green computing tech on its Intelligent Services platform, a tool helping marketers speed analytics using AI. They discovered that a single Nvidia GPU node can beat a 16-node CPU cluster by 33% while decreasing computing costs by 70% with the help of RAPIDS Accelerator.\u00a0\nAdobe\u2019s engineers also found out that the same green computing trained an AI model 7x faster than running on CPUs. That represents a 90% cost reduction in training AI models.\u00a0\nTo validate the gains of Nvidia\u2019s sustainable computing, the IRS reported a 20x speed improvement by using GPU-powered computers. And that\u2019s half the cost of doing it on CPUs.\u00a0\nThe IRS test analyzed over a 3 terabyte dataset, which the accelerated Spark cluster successfully processed.\u00a0\nNvidia further eases adoption by offering an accelerated Spark analysis tool, allowing users to explore the benefits without code changes and tailor GPU acceleration to their specific workloads.\nAs companies tread the path towards sustainability, the fusion of accelerated green computing and initiatives for climate becomes a crucial force. By integrating sustainable technology, like Nvidia\u2019s RAPIDS Accelerator, into their operations, companies can drive profitability, speed up processes, and reduce carbon emissions, contributing to a greener future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\nAI (Artificial Intelligence)  \n\nWhy Geothermal is the Hot Ticket to Low-Carbon Data Centers?\n\n\nMarch 17, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Credits  \n\nChina Revives Its Carbon Credit Market: Price Swings & Future Outlook\n\n\nMarch 17, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Credits  \n\nUEC Reports Stellar $49.8M Revenue as Net-Zero Uranium Strategy Gains Momentum\n\n\nMarch 14, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI (Artificial Intelligence)  \n\nMeta, Google, and Amazon Join Global Pledge to Triple Nuclear Energy by 2050\n\n\nMarch 14, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimate Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nAI (Artificial Intelligence)  \n\nWhy Geothermal is the Hot Ticket to Low-Carbon Data Centers?\n\n\nMarch 17, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Credits  \n\nChina Revives Its Carbon Credit Market: Price Swings & Future Outlook\n\n\nMarch 17, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Credits  \n\nUEC Reports Stellar $49.8M Revenue as Net-Zero Uranium Strategy Gains Momentum\n\n\nMarch 14, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI (Artificial Intelligence)  \n\nMeta, Google, and Amazon Join Global Pledge to Triple Nuclear Energy by 2050\n\n\nMarch 14, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast\nChange\nYTD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLATEST CARBON NEWS\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Credits\nCarney Scraps Carbon Tax\u2014Can Canada Reduce Emissions Without It?\n\n\nMarch 18, 2025 \n\nOn March 14, 2025, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced the end of Canada\u2019s federal consumer carbon tax, effective April 1.

            "response": "Dell & NVIDIA Deliver Full-Stack Generative AI DesignsSubscribe To NewslettersDell Technologies & NVIDIA Collaborate On Full-Stack Generative AI SolutionsBySteve McDowellFollowShareSaveCommentInnovationCloudDell Technologies & NVIDIA Collaborate On Full-Stack Generative AI SolutionsBySteve McDowell, Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Chief Analyst & CEO, NAND Research. Follow AuthorAug 06, 2023, 05:15pm EDTShareSaveCommentDell TechnologiesSOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\nBuilding an IT infrastructure for deep learning and artificial intelligence is daunting. The technologies and practices used in deploying AI workloads are very different from traditional enterprise IT applications. This can force IT practitioners to use new, if not unfamiliar skills, which brings a degree of risk to an IT project.\n\n\nGenerative AI, in particular, is placing new demands on IT teams across nearly every industry. The GPUs required for generative AI are expensive and power-hungry, and you may need many. Aligning storage to keep those data-hungry GPUs fed requires adopting new technologies, such as NVIDIA's GPUDirect, that enable applications to transfer data from primary storage directly into the GPU\u2019s memory. The software stack looks unlike nearly anything else in enterprise IT. The list goes on and on.\n\nDell Technologies and NVIDIA are working together to reduce the complexity of building and deploying infrastructure for Generative AI. The two companies announced Project Helix earlier this year at Dell Technologies World, which Dell described as delivering full-stack solutions with technical expertise and pre-built tools based on Dell and NVIDIA infrastructure and software.\n\n\nDell and NVIDIA have announced the first concrete elements resulting from Project Helix. The companies are delivering validated designs for inference systems based on NVIDIA accelerators and software, a professional services offering to help enterprises embrace generative AI, and a new Dell Precision workstation for AI development.\n\nGenerative AI Validated Designs\nValidated designs allow IT organizations to take a recipe-driven approach to building infrastructure. Dell has a long history of enabling rapid technology adoption with validated designs, including Dell validated designs for analytics, HPC, and ORAN, among many others. Now Dell has a set of validated designs for generative AI inference.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nDell and NVIDIA co-engineered the Dell Validated Design for Generative AI, providing a blueprint for building infrastructure for generative AI inference. The validated design is a range of pre-tested, proven configurations based on Dell PowerEdge servers combined with the appropriate NVIDIA accelerators.\n\nDell's Validated Design for Generative AI with NVIDIA is available globally through traditional Dell channels. Dell also makes systems based on the validated design available through its APEX as-a-service offering.\n\n\nServers & Storage\nThe blueprint for generative AI provides a choice of server, either the Dell PowerEdge XE8640, PowerEdge XE9680 or PowerEdge R760xa. All of these servers are based on the latest generation Intel Xeon processor. Given AMD's success in this space, it's surprising that there doesn't seem to be an AMD option. The servers in the validated designs support between four and eight NVIDIA Hopper H100 GPUs connected with NVIDIA's NVLink technology.Dell Validated Design Options for GenAIDell Technologies\nThe storage options are broader than the server offerings. Dell is supporting its PowerScale filter and ECS object storage. Both systems support NVIDIA\u2019s GPUDirect for increased performance and decreased latency when serving data to the GPUs within the cluster.\nBased on NVIDIA\u2019s Enterprise AI Software Stack\nWhile generative AI is hardware intensive, it's the software stack that makes the difference. Each Dell validated design for generative AI relies heavily on NVIDIA's enterprise AI stack. This includes the following NVIDIA software elements:\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise provides an end-to-end, cloud-native suite of AI and data analytics software.\n\n\nTriton Inference Server for standardizing and accelerating AI model deployment and execution in production environments.\nTriton Model Analyzer analyzes AI models to identify potential deployment issues, including latency and sufficiency of the hardware.\nFaster Transformer technology, for optimized language processing.\nNVIDIA NeMo Framework for building, customizing, and deploying generative AI models with billions of parameters.\nCluster Manager manages the provisioning and operation of AI nodes with an AI cluster.\n\nDell/NVIDIA Validated Reference Design Dell Technologies\nDell Precision AI Workstation\nDell's Precision Workstations have long been popular with data scientists and AI researchers. As part of its recent announcement, Dell announced new Dell Precision AI Workstations.\nThe new workstations arrive with a mix of models based on AMD Threadripper and Intel Xeon processors and are equipped with up to four NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs. The new workstation models will be available through the usual Dell sales channels in August.\nProfessional Services for AI\nProfessional Services has always been central to Dell's overall customer experience. The company offers services across a broad range of spaces, including cloud adoption, APEX, big data, business resiliency, and several digital transformation specialties. Dell has extended its services offerings to now include generative AI.\nDell's professional services team works directly with its customers across the full lifecycle of an AI implementation. This includes working with the customer to create a generative AI strategy that identifies high-value use cases and following through with full-stack implementation services. Post-deployment, Dell professional services can stay involved to ensure operational efficiency, provide managed services, and even handle staff training.\nAnalyst\u2019s Take\nAI is everywhere. It\u2019s nearly impossible to go a day without hearing about yet another way generative AI will change how enterprises operate. It\u2019s not all hype; generative AI is disruptive. Generative AI will impact business processes and is already changing how enterprises think about digital transformation. More critically, AI is changing how IT practitioners think about infrastructure.\nGiven the constant bombardment of AI-focused news, it's easy to forget how new the technology really is. The industry is still figuring out best practices. None of this technology is commodity. Any IT organization with a generative AI project will struggle with the cost and complexity of the solution, and anything that mitigates that is a benefit.\nI've always been a fan of Dell's validated designs, and I really like the new options for generative AI. Following Dell and NVIDIA's blueprints removes much of the risk in building and deploying infrastructure for generative AI. Engaging Dell\u2019s professional services team to help removes even more risk, coming as close as you can get to guaranteeing success. Anything that simplifies life for an IT practitioner, as Dell\u2019s new offerings do, is goodness.\nDisclosure: Steve McDowell is an industry analyst, and NAND Research an industry analyst firm, that engages in, or has engaged in, research, analysis, and advisory services with many technology companies, which may include those mentioned in this article.

By promoting greater interoperability of 3D tools and data, the alliance will enable developers and content creators to describe, compose, and simulate large-scale 3D projects and build an ever-widening range of 3D-enabled products and services.\n\nCreated by Pixar Animation Studios, OpenUSD is a high-performance 3D scene description technology that offers robust interoperability across tools, data, and workflows. Already known for its ability to collaboratively capture artistic expression and streamline cinematic content production, OpenUSD\u2019s power and flexibility make it an ideal content platform to embrace the needs of new industries and applications.\n\nThe alliance will develop written specifications detailing the features of OpenUSD. This will enable greater compatibility and wider adoption, integration, and implementation, and allows inclusion by other standards bodies into their specifications. The Linux Foundation\u2019s JDF was chosen to house the project, as it will enable open, efficient, and effective development of OpenUSD specifications, while providing a path to recognition through the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\n\nAOUSD will also provide the primary forum for the collaborative definition of enhancements to the technology by the greater industry. The alliance invites a broad range of companies and organizations to join and participate in shaping the future of OpenUSD.\n\n\u201cUniversal Scene Description was invented at Pixar and is the technological foundation of our state-of-the-art animation pipeline,\u201d said Steve May, Chief Technology Officer at Pixar and Chairperson of AOUSD. \u201cOpenUSD is based on years of research and application in Pixar filmmaking. We open-sourced the project in 2016, and the influence of OpenUSD now expands beyond film, visual effects, and animation and into other industries that increasingly rely on 3D data for media interchange. With the announcement of AOUSD, we signal the exciting next step: the continued evolution of OpenUSD as a technology and its position as an international standard.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt Adobe, we believe in providing artists a set of flexible and powerful solutions running on a variety of devices,\u201d said Guido Quaroni, Senior Director of Engineering, 3D&I at Adobe. \u201cLeveraging a common 3D data representation during the creative process multiplies the value brought by each package and device. OpenUSD was created to be one of these \u2018multipliers\u2019 and we are excited to see a diverse group of companies joining together to support this innovative and open technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cOpenUSD will help accelerate the next generation of AR experiences, from artistic creation to content delivery, and produce an ever-widening array of spatial computing applications,\u201d said Mike Rockwell, Apple\u2019s vice president of the Vision Products Group. \u201cApple has been an active contributor to the development of USD, and it is an essential technology for the groundbreaking visionOS platform, as well as the new Reality Composer Pro developer tool. We look forward to fostering its growth into a broadly adopted standard.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re building CG worlds or digital twins or looking ahead to the 3D web, content creators need a cohesive way to collaborate and share data across tools, services, and platforms,\u201d said Gordon Bradley, Fellow, Media & Entertainment, Autodesk. \u201cAutodesk is excited to support the Alliance for OpenUSD as it drives 3D interoperability for visual effects, animation, and beyond, and supports our vision to help customers design and make a better world.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cOpenUSD gives 3D developers, artists, and designers the complete foundation to tackle large-scale industrial, digital content creation, and simulation workloads with broad multi-app interoperability,\u201d said Guy Martin, Director of Open Source and Standards at NVIDIA. \u201cThis alliance is a unique opportunity to accelerate OpenUSD collaboration globally by building formal standards across industries and initiatives to realize 3D worlds and industrial digitalization.\u201d\n\nAOUSD steering committee members will be speaking at both the Academy Software Foundation\u2019s Open Source Days on Aug. 6 and at the SIGGRAPH conference at the Autodesk Vision Series on Aug. 8 at 1 p.m. PT in Room 404A.\n\nTo learn more about AOUSD and how to get involved, visit www.aousd.org.

And the next Game Pass title to join the cloud at launch is Sea of Stars, part of 13 new games this week.\nKeep an eye on GFN Thursday to see the next Microsoft titles joining the cloud this month, including Quake II, Gears Tactics and Halo Infinite.\u00a0\nPlus, NVIDIA has worked with Google to give Chromebook owners a new offer that includes three free months of a GeForce NOW Priority membership. GeForce NOW cloud gaming \u200cgoes perfectly together with Chromebooks, which provide up to 1,600p resolution and 120Hz+ displays.\nParty Hard in the Cloud\nThe cloud is about to get wild.\nMake painfully great memories with friends in Party Animals, a hilarious, physics-based party brawler from Recreate Games and Source Technology. Fight friends as adorable puppies, mischievous kittens, magical unicorns or other fuzzy creatures or terrorize them as fearsome sharks and ferocious dinosaurs to be the last one standing.\nBattle it out by picking up an assortment of weapons to get an edge over others or punch, toss, jump, kick and headbutt others in the brawl. Bring the action across multiple game modes \u2014 each requires a different strategy to win.\nGet fierce for party game night, whether playing with friends locally on the couch or across devices online. Party Animals joins the cloud at launch on Thursday, Sept. 21.\nWork Hard, Play Hard\nShiny new GeForce NOW offers for Chromebook owners.\nOne of the best ways to stream games from GeForce NOW is with the new Cloud Gaming Chromebooks, which feature screens that display beautiful scenes at up to 1,600p and 120Hz+.\nChromebook gamers can jump right into 100+ free-to-play titles and over 1,600 hit games, like Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, Remnant II, supported games from the Xbox PC Game Pass library and more. GeForce NOW Priority members can also explore the worlds of Cyberpunk 2077, Control and other titles with RTX ON, and Ultimate members can level up and access new NVIDIA technologies like DLSS 3.5 in upcoming games like Alan Wake 2 and Portal with RTX. Compete online with ultra-low latency and other features perfect for playing.\nStarting today, Google and NVIDIA are offering all Chromebook owners three free months of a GeForce NOW Priority membership to get gamers started. And those interested in leveling up to an Ultimate membership, the highest-performing tier, are already able to get three free months of a GeForce NOW Ultimate membership with the purchase of a Cloud Gaming Chromebook. Find more details on how to redeem the offer in Google\u2019s Keyword blog or on the Chromebooks Perks page.\nNew Games as Far as the Eye Can Sea\nTime to sea the stars from the cloud.\nNew games come with each GFN Thursday, and this week\u2019s batch includes Sea of Stars from Sabotage Studio. A retro-inspired role-playing game drawing from classics like Chrono Trigger, it features a vibrant world, a dynamic combat system and a story of cosmic proportions. Play as two Children of the Solstice, who combine the powers of the sun and moon to perform Eclipse Magic, the only force capable of fending off the monstrous creations of an evil alchemist known as the Fleshmancer. Sea of Stars is now available for members to stream from the cloud via Game Pass or Steam.\nCheck out the list of 13 new games joining this week:\n\nSea of Stars (New release on Xbox and Steam, Aug. 28)\nUntamed Tactics (New release on Steam, Aug. 28)\nTrine 5: A Clockwork Conspiracy (New release on Steam, Aug. 31)\nDeep Rock Galactic (Xbox)\nHITMAN \u2013 World of Assassination (Xbox)\nKing\u2019s Bounty: The Legend (Epic Games Store)\nLittle Big Workshop (Epic Games Store)\nNARAKA: BLADEPOINT \u00a0(Xbox)\nPortal: Prelude with RTX (Steam)\nRailway Empire 2 (Epic Games Store)\nShadowrun Returns (Xbox)\nSnake Pass (Epic Games Store)\nSTORY OF SEASONS: Friends of Mineral Town (Epic Games Store)\n\nAnd here\u2019s a peek at what September will look like:\n\nChants of Sennaar (New release on Steam, Sept. 5)\nSYNCED (New release on Steam, Sept. 7)\nDeceit 2 (New release on Steam, Sept. 14)\nThe Crew Motorfest (New release on Ubisoft, Sept. 14)\nAd Infinitum (New release on Steam, Sept. 14)\nParty Animals (New release on Steam, Sept. 20)\nWarhaven (New release on Steam, Sept. 20)\nPAYDAY 3 (New release on Xbox, Steam and Epic Games Store, Sept. 21)\nCyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty (New release on Steam, Epic Games Store and GOG, Sept. 25)\nPaleo Pines (New release on Steam, Sept. 26)\nInfinity Strash: DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai (New release on Steam, Sept. 28)\nWildmender (New release on Steam, Sept. 28)\nBroforce (Steam)\nDeath in the Water 2 (Steam)\nDeceive Inc.

Log in.\n\n\n\nNvidia is selling a huge number of very expensive GPUs.Jensen Huang expects these chips and other AI data center upgrades to cost $1 trillion over 4 years.Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta\u00a0will probably pay quite a lot of this bill.Nvidia is selling boatloads of GPUs. Great!\n\nSomeone has to pay for these incredibly expensive chips. Not so good.Nvidia's CEO just put a price tag on this, and it's a shocker. Late on Wednesday, Jensen Huang predicted $1 trillion will be spent in 4 years on upgrading data centers for AI (GPUs being a big part of that). He even broke it down to the annual cost.\n\n\"There's about $1 trillion worth of data centers, call it, a quarter of a trillion dollars of capital spend each year,\" he said.A lot of that bill will probably be paid by the leading cloud providers (aka hyperscalers) and other big tech companies, who are falling over themselves to dive into the generative AI race.As I mentioned in July, tech giants are supposed to be spending less. With Nvidia sales surging, both things can't be happening at once. These are the hyperscale cloud providers: Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. Then there's Meta, which is leaning into generative AI hard with Llama 2 and other AI models. How much cash do they have? Is it enough?\n\nAs of June 30, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta had about $334 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The total AI data center bill is $250 billion in the next year and then $750 billion over the following 3 years, according to Nvidia. That's some tough math. Amazon and Meta look the most exposed here: Amazon has $41 billion in cash and Meta has $64 billion.These big tech companies will generate more cash in the coming years. However, this concern was on show during the Nvidia conference call on Wednesday.\"Jensen, the question for you is, when we look at the overall hyperscaler spending, that pie is not really growing that much,\" Vivek Arya , an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, asked the Nvidia CEO. \"So, what is giving you the confidence that they can continue to carve out more of that pie for generative AI? Just give us your sense of how sustainable is this demand as we look over the next one to two years.\"\n\nThe CEO kind of skipped the question. He's enthusiastic. Who can blame him? Here's what he said, according to a transcript of the call from Sentieo:\"The world has something along the lines of about $1 trillion worth of data centers installed in the cloud and enterprise and otherwise. And that trillion dollars of data centers is in the process of transitioning into accelerated computing and generative AI. We're seeing two simultaneous platform shifts at the same time. One is accelerated computing, and the reason for that is because it's the most cost-effective, most energy-effective, and the most performant way of doing computing now. And so, what you're seeing, all of a sudden enabled by generative AI, enabled by accelerated computing, generative AI came along. And this incredible application now gives everyone two reasons to transition, to do a platform shift from general purpose computing, the classical way of doing computing, to this new way of doing computing, accelerated computing.\"There's about $1 trillion worth of data centers, call it, a quarter of a trillion dollars of capital spend each year. You're seeing the data centers around the world are taking that capital spend and focusing it on the two most important trends of computing today, accelerated computing and generative AI. And so, I think this is not a near-term thing. This is a long-term industry transition, and we're seeing these two platform shifts happening at the same time.\"\n\nI asked the big tech companies on Thursday how much of this $250 billion annual bill they plan to pay. Meta pointed me to recent comments from Mark Zuckerberg and other top executives about the company's spending plans.\"Investments that we've made over the years in AI, including the billions of dollars we've spent on AI infrastructure, are clearly paying off across our ranking and recommendation systems and improving engagement and monetization,\" Zuck said.CFO Susan Li said Meta expects capex to be $27 billion to $30 billion this year. In 2024, that will rise as the company builds newly designed data centers and invests more in servers \"for both AI workloads to support all of the AI work that we've talked about across the core AI ranking, recommendation work along with the next-gen AI efforts.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\nGenerative AI\n \nMore \n\n\n\n\nCloud Computing\n\n\nAmazon\n\n\nAWS\n\n\nMicrosoft\n\n\nGoogle\n\n\nMeta\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider\n      subscribers.

The company's Q2 earnings per share was $2.70 beating estimates of $2.08. The chipmaker also said it expects third quarter revenue to be about $16 billion (plus or minus 2%) versus estimates of just $12.59 billion.Story continuesDon't miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Long & Short Newsletter today.

This sentiment, coupled with increasingly AI mainstream reach with the likes of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, spilled over onto AI-related cryptocurrencies, sending them soaring, even though they've fallen back over the summer along with the rest of the market.Nvidia's shares rose more than 7% in U.S. after-hours trading after gaining about 3% during the regular session.

Salesforce (CRM), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), the Ashton Kutcher-founded Sound Ventures, and various other investors are driving the latest capital infusion in a $235 million series D funding round for Hugging Face \u2014 the open-source AI technology unicorn now valued at $4.5 billion. (And yes, it is named after an emoji.)  \"We're super excited about this round,\" Hugging Face CEO Cl\u00e9ment Delangue told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). \"It\u2019s kind of like a great validation for Hugging Face, but also for open source AI as a whole. We're going to use this money to really double down on the team \u2014 hire more great people \u2014 and really double down on our investments in open-source AI and collaboration features of our platform.\" Hugging Face currently touts 500,000 language learning models, 250,000 datasets, and 50,000 organizations on the platform.   Hugging Face raised $235 million in series D funding at a $4.5 billion valuation. (Photo: Hugging Face)   While currently still private, Delangue said he is keen on listing the company's public equity on the Nasdaq when time comes, especially since selling the growth story to investors could prove easier once margins are proven to be sustainable. Semiconductor companies led generative AI-related equity market price action early, and now datasets are gaining traction as generative AI prompts every business to consider where it can increase productivity and create profit producing customer connections. An extremely significant stamp of approval, both large-cap and mega-cap companies who have benefitted the most from early AI demand are participants in this round of funding for Hugging Face. \"I think we\u2019ve validated last year that there was massive usage for generative AI,\" Delangue said. \"This year, we\u2019re validating that there\u2019s massive revenue for generative AI \u2014 with Nvidia, with the announcement of Hugging Face and others \u2014 and hopefully next year, we are going to validate that there\u2019s margins for generative AI too. So it\u2019s a very exciting kind of maturing cycle for generative AI.\" Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy Dashboard   More Info  Recommended Stories   We\u02bcre unable to load stories right now. \n\n\n  Copyright \u00a9 2025 Yahoo.

Two letters: AI. See, Nvidia's GPU hardware is especially well-suited to machine learning tasks that power generative AI models like ChatGPT and Midjourney. So as the AI boom has accelerated, demand for Nvidia silicon has likewise shot into the stratosphere, returning record-breaking profits to the company even as its consumer GPU sales have lagged.The fact that AMD and Intel are as far behind Nvidia as they are has effectively given Nvidia a monopoly on AI chips, at least until all the stock of Nvidia silicon is bought up and industry giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have to look to less-efficient alternatives for compute power.These two diverging trends clearly point to a new future for Nvidia, one that relies much less on consumer GPUs, and I wouldn't be surprised if Nvidia exits the consumer graphics card market entirely in the next decade.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Nvidia slows production of its consumer Lovelace GPUs to focus on Hopper(Image credit: Nvidia)Last week, news came down that Nvidia had essentially put its Lovelace GPUs on ice, which shouldn't surprise anyone considering that there is still a lot of stock of Nvidia graphics cards out there, with a lot of cards even getting some pretty great graphics card deals from retailers \u2014 something that was unheard of last generation.With sales of its GPUs falling way below expectations and retailers apparently ticked off that they now have plenty of GPU stock taking up warehouse space, slowing production of new consumer GPU stock doesn't make much sense.But there's something else at play here, according to the news reports. Specifically, Nvidia was pivoting itself towards producing more Hopper chips instead, and these are the chips that power datacenters and generative AI networks and models that power ChatGPT, Midjourney, and others.\u00a0These are the chips that are in demand right now, and with companies like Google and Amazon coming in with deep pockets and an essentially insatiable need for more advanced GPUs, Nvidia can effectively name its price.Unfortunately for gamers, unlike the cryptobubble (which produced nothing of real value), generative AI actually makes stuff. Useful stuff. The kind of stuff that can save businesses a lot of time and expense, so the generative AI boom we're seeing now is much more likely to be enduring in the long term as everyone expects demand for these models to only increase from here.Will Nvidia eventually pivot to AI hardware entirely?I've said a number of times now that with the rise of generative AI, the Nvidia GeForce GPU is likely in its final few generations. Usually I get bewildered looks when I do, and I totally understand that. Graphics card sales make up more than 80% of Nvidia's revenue, with most of those being consumer graphics cards. How do you just pivot away from not just your core business model, but your core product?Well, it's not hard to fathom if you have shareholders, and Nvidia has millions of them that its board is answerable to. In a world of scarce silicon and essentially insatiable demand for AI dedicated hardware in the next decade (with significantly higher price premiums per silicon chip that Nvidia can charge), it would be corporate malpractice for Nvidia to continue to make consumer graphics cards its core product.The market pressure on Nvidia to shift its focus away from gamers and dedicate its limited volume of silicon to feeding the AI datacenter demand from Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and a few other trillion-dollar companies will become irresistable.\u00a0(Image credit: Nvidia)That is where the maximum profit is, and the market will demand that Nvidia leverage its industrial advantage to bring in the greatest return to investors as possible. And that's not in making gamer gear, I hate to say.Whether Nvidia likes it or not, whether we like it or not, Nvidia will soon become an AI-first company, with a vestigial gaming division that is primarily if not overwhelmingly dominated by its cloud gaming service GeForce Now (which is also a faster growing profit segment than producing gaming GPUs for desktops and laptops).How many generations of GeForce graphics cards do we have left? If we get an RTX 7000-series, I'd be shocked. Orders for 5000-series silicon are already being negotiated most likely, and work on chip design for 6000-series GPUs is probably also well underway at this point, so the inertia might win the day there, but that's no guarantee.But beyond that, it's hard to argue in favor of producing a gaming graphics card with a profit margin of 10% to 20% when a Hopper chip could possibly net you a profit of 40% to 50%, and you can sell them in bulk to datacenter customers.\u00a0There's only so many silicon wafers that can be produced by TSMC, Samsung, or Intel, and Nvidia isn't going to be their only customer. So if Nvidia can only buy a set amount of silicon, it will need to maximize the profit it makes on each one, and gaming graphics cards for individual sale isn't where you'll find it.\u00a0If we do ever see a 7000-series GPU, it will be as a cloud service option, not something you can buy on the store shelf. If we get an RTX 5000 series and RTX 6000 series, they probably won't be getting the love and attention from Team Green that its past generations have gotten, so how good will they really be in the end? Who knows.\u00a0It's not all doom and gloom for gamers though.Gamers will still have options(Image credit: AMD)Nvidia GeForce cards might be an endangered species in the future, but if you're worried that AI will spell the death knell for PC gaming, fear not.\u00a0AMD only just introduced AI accelerators to its RDNA 3 graphics cards, so it is so far behind Nvidia in terms of AI hardware that it's not likely to catch up any time soon, so its graphics hardware won't be in demand for the AI boom in the same way (though AI will still take a bite out of supply)Intel, meanwhile, has its own equivelent of tensor cores in its Arc GPUs known as XMX render engines, so you might think that they'd be competitive in the AI hardware space. But Intel's Arc GPUs are still on their first generation, and while Intel XeSS really does show how powerful its hardware XMX engines can be, it's still not as good as Nvidia's, so if anything it will be a distant second.\u00a0Plus, Intel also has an entire datacenter division that is absolutely massive, so it doesn't need Arc GPUs to compete with Nvidia. Further development of Intel Xeon can do that. Intel also has its own foundries, so it's not limited by how many silicon wafers TSMC can produce. If it wants to make graphics cards and datacenter chips, it absolutely can and will do that.In the end, it strikes me as inevitable that by the end of the decade, Nvidia will have transitioned to making AI chips full-time, with its GeForce brand side-stepping into cloud gaming where GeForce graphics tiers will continue, but with far fewer consumer graphics cards (if any). That's just where the money is going to be, and if Nvidia doesn't make that pivot, a shareholder revolt might force the issue.In its place, the current AMD vs Nvidia rivalry in GPUs will transition into an AMD vs Intel one, similar to how it is with the best processors, with both trying to get their own piece of the AI pie through their datacenter divisions and largely failing to dislodge Nvidia.I could say that all of this should be taken with a grain of salt, that its speculating on technology in seven years time (which might as well be a geological epoch given the advance of things), and all of that is true.\u00a0But in the end, whatever 2030 looks like will be radically different from how things look today, thanks to AI. That much I can guarantee, and Nvidia will be a radically different company when all is said and done.\n\n\nJohn LoefflerSocial Links NavigationComponents EditorJohn (He/Him) is the Components Editor here at TechRadar and he is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY.

We\u2019re also deep diving on new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.\nThe start of a new school year is an ideal time for students to upgrade their content creation, gaming and educational capabilities by picking up an NVIDIA Studio laptop, powered by GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards.\nMarmoset Toolbag \u2014 a fully fledged 3D art production tool \u2014 just released version 4.06, a free update for Toolbag 4 users. It extends support of the OpenUSD file format and adds NVIDIA Omniverse compatibility, NVIDIA DLSS capability, AI OptiX denoising and speedups in rendering and baking \u2014 all RTX-accelerated.\nFinally, this week In the NVIDIA Studio, popular influencer JiffyVFX talks about his viral video series, Doors to Realities, which garnered over 1.2 million views.\nCreate, Game, Study\nGeForce and NVIDIA Studio RTX 40 Series laptops use the power of AI to accelerate content creation, gaming and study apps.\nGeForce RTX 40 Series laptops deliver the ultimate performance for creative projects. Creators can quickly render 3D models and edit up to 8K HDR RAW videos to bring ideas to life \u2014 fast. The NVIDIA Studio platform supercharges over 110 creative apps and includes exclusive access to tools like the NVIDIA Broadcast app for enhanced creation, collaboration and remote learning. NVIDIA Studio Drivers provide maximum stability and lightning-fast performance for the most popular creative apps.\nGamers equipped with GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs have access to ray tracing-powered realistic and immersive graphics, a quantum leap in performance with the AI-powered DLSS 3, and the lowest latency and best system responsiveness for the ultimate competitive advantage.\nFor students in engineering, architecture, computer science and other STEM fields, Studio laptops can accelerate dozens of apps, aiding in the creation of smoother 3D design and modeling, faster AI training and simulation and more accurate machine learning models.\nFifth-generation Max-Q technologies use AI to optimize laptop performance, power and acoustics for peak efficiency. This enables thinner and lighter designs and a 70% improved battery life suited to serving student and creator needs alike. And DLSS is now optimized for laptops, giving creators incredible 3D rendering performance with DLSS 3 optical multi-frame generation and super resolution in Omniverse and D5 Render, as well as in hit games like Cyberpunk 2077.\nGet the latest and greatest deals on Studio laptops today.\nMarmoset Toolbag 4.06 Adds OpenUSD\nContent exported from Toolbag to Universal Scene Description (known as OpenUSD) is now fully compatible with the Omniverse ecosystem.\nThe OpenUSD format delivers the notable advantages of preserving physically accurate material, mesh and lighting properties, even as content travels between 3D apps such as Blender, Marmoset and Unreal Engine.\nConsistent mesh and lighting properties across 3D apps and NVIDIA Omniverse.\nRTX GPU-accelerated OptiX denoising is also available for smooth, interactive ray tracing in the viewport. Artists can now navigate in full quality without visual artifacts and performance disruptions.\nToolbag also integrated NVIDIA DLSS, which renders the viewport at a reduced resolution and uses sophisticated AI-based technology to upscale images, improving performance while minimizing reductions in image quality. This works especially well with high-DPI displays and is a great tool for maintaining smooth performance while working on full resolution with more complex scenes.\nMore frames, better performance \u2014 that\u2019s NVIDIA DLSS.\nRTX GPU-accelerated rendering gives a 2x improvement in render times and a 4x improvement in baking. DirectX 12 migration delivers an additional 25% increase in rendering and baking performance.\nLearn more about Toolbag 4.06.

JiffyVFX, never has to look far for inspiration.\nInfluencer JiffyVFX.\n\u201cVarious films, shows, comic book characters, artists and musicians inspire me,\u201d said Luke. \u201cBut I\u2019d say the biggest inspirational factor is watching other artists\u2019 works and their behind the scenes content \u2014 I\u2019m forever watching tutorials and breakdown videos on YouTube of how other artists create their content.\u201d\n\u201cNVIDIA GPUs are just top-of-the-line. The support, the performance, the quality. I\u2019ve always used NVIDIA GPUs for my creative workstations over the years, and I will continue to use them for years to come.\u201d \u2014 JiffyVFX\n\nLuke\u2019s Doors to Realities series began with a simple idea: put the planet Earth outside a bedroom window using the Video Copilot\u2019s Orb plug-in for Adobe After Effects.\n\u201cI began seeing people post collages or montages of different aesthetics \u2014 things like cyberpunk, art deco, neo-noir, retro-futurism \u2014 wondering what it would look like to transport to one of those worlds through a portal or a door of some sort,\u201d said Luke. \u201cWhat would a first-person perspective of that look like?\u201d\nMore recently, Luke created a Japan-themed Doors to Realities video aided by his ASUS Zenbook Pro 14 Studio laptop, powered by a GeForce RTX 4070 GPU.\nLuke used 3D modeling to create the environment featured in the video. He previously used Unreal Engine for the first two installments of the series, but this time, he experimented with Kitbash 3D\u2019s Cargo app for a one-click import into Blender. It was a game-changer \u2014 finding and uploading models into Blender was never so speedy and efficient.\nModeling aided by AI in Blender.\nHis GeForce graphics card enabled RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in the viewport for interactive, photorealistic rendering.\u00a0When the final renders were ready, Luke added the Doors to Realities template into an Adobe After Effects project with the clip already masked and ready to go. There, he added glow effects, one of over 30+ GPU-accelerated key effects, with keyframes set up from previous videos.\n\u201cThe fact that I was able to work in rendered mode in real time on a device as small and portable as the Zenbook was mind blowing.\u201d \u2014 JiffyVFX\n\n\u201cAll I had to do was plop the render in, copy and paste the glow effects with their intensity keyframes and then hit render again,\u201d said Luke.\nFinally, Luke added music and background sounds like bird chirping, a river stream and the sound of leaves subtly blowing in the wind.\nThe Studio laptop not only enhances Luke\u2019s content creation experience but also boosts the efficiency of his workflow. \u201cHigh frame rates, DLSS 3 and ray tracing \u2014 what\u2019s not to love?\u201d said Luke.\nHe encourages other creators to push forward and continue experimenting.\n\u201cNever. Stop. Creating!\u201d said Luke. \u201cNever stop learning! The only way to improve is to keep pushing yourself and the limits of what you can do.\u201d\nContent creator JiffyVFX.\nCheck out JiffyVFX on TikTok.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is raking in nearly 1,000% (about 823%) in profit percentage for each H100 GPU accelerator it sells, according to estimates made in a recent social media post from Barron's senior writer Tae Kim. In dollar terms, that means that Nvidia's street-price of around $25,000 to $30,000 for each of these High Performance Computing (HPC) accelerators (for the least-expensive PCIe version) more than covers the estimated $3,320 cost per chip and peripheral (in-board) components. As surfers will tell you, there's nothing quite like riding a wave with zero other boards on sight.Kim cites the $3,320 estimated cost for each H100 chip as coming from financial consulting firm Raymond James. It's unclear how deep that cost analysis goes, however: if it's a matter of pure manufacturing cost (averaging the price-per-wafer and other components while taking yields into account), then there's still a significant expense margin for Nvidia to cover with each of its sales.\u00a0Product development takes time and resources; and considering the engineers and other participants within the product development lifecycle for a product such as H100, Nvidia's R&D costs also have to be taken into account before a final, average product development cost can be reached. According to Glassdoor, Nvidia's average salary for an electronics hardware engineer sits at around $202,000 per year. And that's for a single engineer - it's likely development of chips such as the H100 require thousands of hours from a number of specialized workers. All of that too has to be taken into account.Even so, it can't be denied that there are advantages at being the poster company for AI acceleration workloads. By all accounts, Nvidia GPUs are flying off the shelves without even getting personal with the racks they're piled on. This article in particular looks to be the ultimate playground for anyone trying to understand exactly what the logistics behind the AI HPC boom means. What that actually translates to, however, is that it seems that orders for Nvidia's AI-accelerating products are already sold through until 2024. And with expectations of the AI accelerator market being worth around $150 billion by 2027, there's seemingly nothing else in the future but green.And of course, that boom is better for some than others: due to the exploding interest in AI servers compared to more traditional HPC installations, DDR5 manufacturers have had to revise their expectations on how much the new memory products will penetrate the market. It's now expected that DDR5 adoption will only hit parity with DDR4 by 3Q 2024.\u00a0The company is reaping the benefits of having built its infrastructure and product stack on the back of its tooling and bets on AI as the next big thing.But budgets everywhere tend to have limits, and there's also the matter of opportunity cost: investing into AI acceleration at its current prices will lock some players' doors to investments in other spaces, or limit how much risks they can take in pursuing less-safe research and development venues.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.When all is said and done, Nvidia's bottom line as buoyed by its AI chip sales could now cover inane amounts of leather jackets.

I can when properly modivaited afford a 1600 dollar card (me and the wife both have 4090s). But my nieces and nephews we play with run much cheaper cards (gtx 1080, rtx 2060 etc for them).

It\u2019s one of the first deployments of intelligent video analytics at scale in an Indian airport.\nGreenery in BLR\u2019s newest terminal.\nIndustry.AI increases the safety and efficiency of the terminal\u2019s operations by using vision AI and object detection to track abandoned baggage, flag long passenger queues and alert security teams of potential issues, among other use cases.\nBy identifying congestion points and anticipating delays with vision AI, staff can proactively redirect passengers to less crowded areas or provide signals to open additional checkpoints, reducing wait times and enhancing passenger experiences.\n\u201cDeploying vision AI at this scale is a first for us,\u201d said George Fanthome, chief information officer at BLR\u2019s parent company. \u201cBy adopting such advanced deep learning technologies, we strive to be one of the best airports in the world and provide our customers the best experience.\u201d\nSmarter, Safer Airport Operations\nThe Industry.AI platform connects more than 500 live camera feeds across the BLR terminal to vision AI technologies that can accomplish nearly a dozen tasks in real time.\nFor one, the platform can detect when luggage or a purse is left unattended.\nIt also helps to manage passenger queues at terminal entries, check-in counters, security check lanes and other areas. Airport staff can be trained to proactively perform tasks based on historical data of passenger movement collected by the AI platform.\n\u201cOur platform speeds up passenger flow during peak hours of operation by alerting airport staff about longer-than-optimal lines,\u201d said Tejpreet Chopra, CEO of Industry.AI. \u201cThis is done through a dashboard with a real-time visual and sensor feed that allows the airport staff to respond to the situation in the shortest possible time.\u201d\nUnauthorized people and vehicles in the airport can also be tracked and alerted to the platform\u2019s users in real time for enhanced security. In addition, Industry.AI detects speed violations made by vehicles outside the terminal, helping to manage safe transportation around the travel hub.\nAI helps manage transportation inside and outside of BLR.\nIndustry.AI uses the NVIDIA TAO Toolkit and A100 Tensor Core GPUs to train its AI models. For AI inference, the company taps NVIDIA Triton Inference Server and A30 Tensor Core GPUs.\nAnd with the NVIDIA DeepStream software development kit for AI-powered video analytics, along with technical expertise from NVIDIA \u2014 a benefit of being a member of the NVIDIA Inception program for cutting-edge startups \u2014 Industry.AI built and deployed the BLR solution in just three months.\n\u201cNVIDIA Metropolis enabled us to develop our vision AI applications more cost-effectively and bring them to market faster,\u201d Chopra said.\nLooking forward, Industry.AI plans to deploy NVIDIA-powered accelerated computing and vision AI technologies across BLR\u2019s other terminals and at additional airports, too.\n\u201cBLR\u2019s focus on adopting advanced AI technologies sets a new benchmark for passenger experience at airports,\u201d Chopra said.\nLearn more about the NVIDIA Metropolis platform and how it\u2019s used to build smarter, safer airports.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | Customer Stories | DeepStream | GPU | Inception | Machine Learning | Metropolis | Smart Spaces | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The company brought in $13.5 billion for the quarter, up 101% over the prior year, and well over its $11 billion guidance. That\u2019s certainly something to get excited about.\nNvidia is benefiting from being a company in the right place at the right time, where its GPU chips are in high demand to run large language models and other AI-fueled workloads. That in turn is driving Nvidia\u2019s astonishing growth this quarter. (It\u2019s worth noting that the company set the groundwork for its current success some time ago.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bData center compute revenue nearly tripled year on year, driven primarily by accelerating demand for cloud from cloud service providers and large consumer internet companies for our HGX platform, the engine of generative and large language models,\u201d Colette Kress, Nvidia\u2019s executive vice president and chief financial officer, said in the post-earnings report call with analysts.\nThis kind of growth brings to mind the heady days of cloud stocks, some of which soared during the pandemic lockdown as companies accelerated their usage of SaaS to keep their workers connected. Zoom, in particular, took off with five quarters of absolutely astonishing growth during that time.\nZoom\u2019s pandemic fueled growth. Image Credits: TechCrunch\nToday, even double-digit growth is long gone. For its most recent report earlier this month, Zoom reported revenue of $1.138 billion, up 3.6% over the prior year. That follows five straight quarters of single-digit growth, the last three in the low single digits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCould Zoom possibly be a cautionary tale for a company like Nvidia riding the generative AI wave? And perhaps more importantly, will this drive unreasonable investor expectations about future performance as it did with Zoom?\nData center demand isn\u2019t going anywhere\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that Nvidia\u2019s biggest growth area is in the data center and that web scalers are still building at a rapid pace with plans to add over 300 new data centers in the coming years, per a Synergy Research report from March 2022.\n\n\u201cThe future looks bright for hyperscale operators, with double-digit annual growth in total revenues supported in large part by cloud revenues that will be growing in the 20\u201330% per year range. This in turn will drive strong growth in capex generally and in data center spending specifically,\u201d said John Dinsdale, a chief analyst at Synergy Research Group, in a statement about the report.\nAt least some percentage of this spending will surely be devoted to resources for running AI workloads, and Nvidia should benefit from that, CEO Jensen Huang told analysts on Wednesday. In fact, he believes that his company\u2019s expansive growth is much more than a flash in the pan.\n\u201cThere\u2019s about $1 trillion worth of data centers, call it, a quarter of a trillion dollars of capital spend each year. You\u2019re seeing that data centers around the world are taking that capital spend and focusing it on the two most important trends of computing today: accelerated computing and generative AI,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAnd so I think this is not a near-term thing. This is a long-term industry transition, and we\u2019re seeing these two platform shifts happening at the same time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf he\u2019s right, perhaps the company can sustain this level of growth, but history suggests that what goes up must eventually come down.\nBusiness gravity\nIf Zoom is any indication, some businesses that see rapid growth for one reason or another can hold on to that revenue in the future. While it\u2019s certainly less exciting for investors that Zoom\u2019s growth rate has sharply moderated in recent quarters, it\u2019s also true that Zoom has continued to grow. That means it has retained all its prior scale and then some.\nBut software is not hardware. Zoom makes for a good historical example that rapid growth often becomes slower growth later on, but hardware companies have it harder than their digital cousins. (In Zoom\u2019s case, it appears to have undergone a demand pull forward instead of a long-term change to its growth rates.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did Zoom manage to continue growing after a period of outsized customer acquisition? One key element of software in the modern business context is that existing customers tend to spend more over time. This native growth, called net retention or similar by SaaS wonks, helps ensure that software companies rarely see their top line decline. Sure, growth can slow as it becomes harder to land new accounts and upsells become rarer, but an actually falling revenue line item is rare for software companies today.\nNvidia\u2019s history shows how different things are for hardware companies. For example, in the first quarter of 2023, the company reported revenues of $7.19 billion, a figure that was 13% lower than its year-ago result. Nvidia then went on to utterly crush the second quarter.\nTherefore when we consider slowing software growth \u2014 Snowflake\u2019s falling, if still impressive, net retention numbers, for example \u2014 the analogy only extends so far into the world of making and selling chips. We cannot expect Nvidia to follow a Zoom-like trajectory, in other words.\nBut if hardware revenue is more chaotic than software incomes, how can Nvidia capitalize on its present-day demand spike and profit bump, ensuring that it levers the moment as best it can? Simply enough: It can invest its outsized scale that it is enjoying today in future incomes and future shareholder contentment. Both should help it defend its valuation in the future, and both are underway.\nOn the R&D side, Nvidia spent $2.04 billion in the second quarter on research and development. That\u2019s up from $1.82 billion in the year-ago quarter. Thus far in 2023, the company has spent $3.92 billion on R&D, up from $3.44 billion in the first half of last year. That\u2019s a big investment in near-term product competitiveness and long-term product ascendancy; Nvidia is using its gains to help build more, better and faster chips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second area where Nvidia could invest its present-day demand boom is by making its shares more valuable individually. It is doing so by repurchasing its own equity. Sure, Nvidia is buying at a pretty high price today, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be slowing it down. As the company wrote in its most recent shareholder earnings letter (emphasis added):\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2024, NVIDIA returned $3.38 billion to shareholders in the form of 7.5 million shares repurchased for $3.28 billion, and cash dividends. As of the end of the second quarter, the company had $3.95 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization. On August 21, 2023, the Board of Directors approved an additional $25.00 billion in share repurchases, without expiration. NVIDIA plans to continue share repurchases this fiscal year.\nThat $25 billion is a massive sum for any company. And by approving that level of spend, Nvidia is working to ensure that future profits will be spread across fewer shares, boosting per-share profitability and therefore value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there have been supply chain issues for chip companies in particular in recent years, the company insists that they can keep up with demand in the coming quarters. \u201cRegarding our supply, yes, we do expect to continue ramping our supply over the next quarter, as well as into next fiscal year,\u201d Kress told analysts.\nThere is little that Nvidia can do to control the economy, or even fully influence market demand for its chips. (The company has shown that by building chips like the H100, it can bolster demand, but I don\u2019t think that anyone considers Nvidia entirely in control of its market\u2019s destiny.) But it can invest in its future and in its shareholders. And it is doing so.\nKeep an eye on Nvidia\u2019s Q3 2023 R&D spend and how much it changes from its Q2 levels. If we see an even bigger figure there, we\u2019ll know that the company is not resting on its present laurels.\n\n\nTopics\n\nAI, EC Enterprise, EC Market Analysis, EC News Analysis, Enterprise, GPUS, Jensen Huang, nvidia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRon Miller\t\n\n\n\nEnterprise Reporter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRon Miller was an enterprise reporter at TechCrunch.\nPreviously, he was a long-time Contributing Editor at EContent Magazine.

We raise our fair value estimate to $480 from $300 and lift our Uncertainty Rating to Very High. We are now much more optimistic about the rise of AI workloads and how Nvidia\u2019s wide moat should cement itself as an AI chip leader.\nBased on the results, guidance, and supply expansion at key partners like TSMC, we forecast that Nvidia\u2019s data center, or DC, business, which includes AI graphics processors, will generate $41 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024 (ending January). This compares with $15 billion a year ago and only $3 billion just four years ago.\nWe could be wrong, but we see little evidence that these GPU orders are up-front spending or a one-time build. Based on our estimates of capital expenditures at leading cloud providers, manufacturing expansion at TSMC, and management forecasts, we anticipate further growth of $60 billion in DC revenue in fiscal 2025, rising to $100 billion in fiscal 2028. Such growth might be unprecedented in large-cap tech, but we foresee all types of enterprises investing in AI. Similarly, all cloud providers will need to offer Nvidia\u2019s GPUs to allow them to train AI models, while Nvidia is making the right moves to capture AI inference workloads and branch out into networking and software.\nNvidia\u2019s near-term results support our long-term optimism. In the July quarter, total revenue was $13.5 billion, up 88% sequentially, up 101% year over year, and well past guidance of $11 billion that was eye-popping when provided to investors in May. DC revenue was $10.3 billion, up 141% sequentially and 171% year over year. We have little doubt that Nvidia will sell every GPU it can secure from TSMC in the quarters ahead.\nWhy Nvidia Will Continue to Dominate AI\nNvidia (NVDA) has a wide economic moat, thanks to its clear leadership in graphics processing units, or GPUs, hardware and software tools needed to enable the exponentially growing market around artificial intelligence. In the long run, we expect tech titans to strive to find second-sources or in-house solutions to diversify away from Nvidia in AI, but most likely, these efforts will chip away at, but not supplant, Nvidia\u2019s AI dominance.\nNvidia\u2019s GPUs specifically handle parallel processing workloads, using many cores to efficiently process data at the same time. In contrast, central processing units, or CPUs, such as Intel\u2019s processors for PCs and servers, or Apple\u2019s processors for its Macs and iPhones, process the data of \u201c0s and 1s\u201d in a serial fashion. The wheelhouse of GPUs has been the gaming market, and Nvidia\u2019s GPU graphics cards have long been considered best of breed. More recently, cryptocurrency miners found the need for parallel processing GPUs, leading to a boom-and-bust cycle for Nvidia.\nMore important, parallel processing has emerged as a near-requirement to accelerate AI workloads. Nvidia took an early lead in AI GPU hardware, but more important, developed a proprietary software platform, Cuda, and these tools allow AI developers to build their models with Nvidia. We believe Nvidia not only has a hardware lead, but benefits from high customer switching costs around Cuda, making it unlikely for another GPU vendor to emerge as a leader in AI training.\nWe think Nvidia\u2019s prospects will be tied to the AI market, for better or worse, for quite some time. We expect leading cloud vendors to continue to invest in in-house semis (with Google and Amazon leading the way), while CPU titans AMD and Intel are working on GPUs and AI accelerators for the data center. However, we view Nvidia\u2019s GPUs and Cuda as the industry leaders, and the firm\u2019s massive valuation will hinge on whether, and for how long, the company can stay ahead of the rest of the pack.\nNvidia Has a Wide Economic Moat\nWe assign Nvidia a wide economic moat rating, thanks to intangible assets around its graphics processing units and, increasingly, switching costs around its proprietary software, such as its Cuda platform for AI tools, which enables developers to use Nvidia\u2019s GPUs to build AI models.\nNvidia was an early leader and designer of GPUs, which were originally developed to offload graphic processing tasks on PCs and gaming consoles. Nvidia has emerged as the clear market share leader in discrete GPUs (over 80% share, per Mercury Research). We attribute Nvidia\u2019s leadership to intangible assets associated with GPU design, as well as the associated software, frameworks, and tools required by developers to work with these GPUs. Recent introductions, such as ray-tracing technology and the use of AI tensor cores in gaming applications, are signs, in our view, that Nvidia has not lost its GPU leadership in any way. A quick scan of GPU pricing in both gaming and data center shows that Nvidia\u2019s average selling prices can often be twice as high as those from its closest competitor, AMD.\nMeanwhile, we don\u2019t foresee any emerging companies as becoming a third relevant player in the GPU market outside of Nvidia or AMD. Even Intel, the chip industry behemoth, has struggled for many years in trying to build a high-end GPU that would be adopted by gaming enthusiasts, and its next effort for a discrete GPU is slated to launch in 2025. We do see integrated GPU functionality within many of Intel\u2019s PC processors, as well as portions of Apple\u2019s and Qualcomm\u2019s system-on-chip solutions in smartphones, but we perceive these integrated solutions as \u201cgood enough\u201d for nongamers, but not on par with high end GPU needs.\nBeyond Nvidia\u2019s AI prowess today, which we believe is exceptionally strong, we think the company is making the proper moves to widen its moat even further. Nvidia\u2019s software efforts with Cuda remain impressive, while Nvidia is also expanding into networking solutions, most notably with its acquisition of Mellanox. We don\u2019t want to discount Nvidia\u2019s know-how here either. Many AI models don\u2019t run on solo GPUs, but rather a connected system of many GPUs running in tandem. Nvidia\u2019s proprietary NVLink products do a good job of connecting Nvidia GPUs together to run these larger models.\n\n\nSaoT iWFFXY aJiEUd EkiQp kDoEjAD RvOMyO uPCMy pgN wlsIk FCzQp Paw tzS YJTm nu oeN NT mBIYK p wfd FnLzG gYRj j hwTA MiFHDJ OfEaOE LHClvsQ Tt tQvUL jOfTGOW YbBkcL OVud nkSH fKOO CUL W bpcDf V IbqG P IPcqyH hBH FqFwsXA Xdtc d DnfD Q YHY Ps SNqSa h hY TO vGS bgWQqL MvTD VzGt ryF CSl NKq ParDYIZ mbcQO fTEDhm tSllS srOx LrGDI IyHvPjC EW bTOmFT bcDcA Zqm h yHL HGAJZ BLe LqY GbOUzy esz l nez uNJEY BCOfsVB UBbg c SR vvGlX kXj gpvAr l Z GJk Gi a wg ccspz sySm xHibMpk EIhNl VlZf Jy Yy DFrNn izGq uV nVrujl kQLyxB HcLj NzM G dkT z IGXNEg WvW roPGca owjUrQ SsztQ lm OD zXeM eFfmz MPk\n\nTo view this article, become a Morningstar Member.\nRegister For Free\n\nAlready a member?Log In.\r\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAGS\n\n\n\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\nEARNINGS\nMORNINGSTAR EQUITY RESEARCH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Related Articles \n\n\n\n Most Popular \n\n\n\n Recent Articles \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaidu Earnings: Cloud Business Slow To Recover in the Near Term\nDespite the mixed results this quarter, we still like Baidu.\n\n\n\n3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy\nUndervalued stocks in Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s portfolio, as well as its latest buys and sel...\n\n\n\nCNOOC Earnings: Excellent Cost Control Underpins Profit\nWe raise the firm's fair value estimate.\n\n\n\nDisney's Prospects - the Morningstar View\nNealy a year since Bob Iger returned as chief executive, we think Disney shares are undervalue...\n\n\n\nFidelity's Rules to Identify Winners from the 'AI Stack'\nIs the AI rally here to stay and will it broaden to benefit even more players? \n\n...Search the Article Archive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian High-Yield Bonds Rebound Strongly in 2024, but Caution Prevails for 2025\nAsian high-yield bonds staged a remarkable comeback in 2024, delivering an impressive 15% return ...\n\n\n\nMarkets Brief: If Tesla Stock is Falling, Why Is It Still Expensive?\nPlus: Earnings season, inflation and Amazon.\n\n\n\n6 Undervalued US Stocks That Just Raised Dividends\nPlus 37 more stocks under Morningstar\u2019s coverage with big dividend increases.\n\n\n\nAfter Earnings, Is Apple Stock a Buy, a Sell, or Fairly Valued?\nWith iPhone sales slowing down but high services revenue, here\u2019s what we thought of Apple\u2019s stock.\n\n\n\nShopify Earnings: Positive Demand Trends Continue Across All Products and Geographies\nWe\u2019ve raised our fair value estimate of Shopify stock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n        About Author\r\n    \n\n\n\nBrian Colello, CPA \r\n\t\u00a0Brian Colello, CPA is a senior stock analyst with Morningstar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  About Us                                                     Our Story                                                                                             Company Website                                                                                             Our Signature Methodologies                                                                                             Career                                                   Connect With Us                                                     Global Contacts                                                                                             Advertising Opportunities                                                   Get Help                                                     FAQ                                                                                            Ask Us                                                \n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2025 Morningstar Asia Ltd.

This is why NVIDIA has made a number of commitments to reach its sustainable goals.\u00a0\u201cAccelerated computing is now the most sustainable way to advance computing.NVIDIA invented accelerated computing two decades ago to solve problems that normalcomputers can\u2019t,\u201d says Jensen Huang, CEO and Co-Founder, NVIDIA. \u201cThrough full-stack invention from chips, systems, networking and acceleration libraries, to refactoring applications, we can supercharge them at far better energy efficiency than traditional CPU computing. Acceleration is the best way to reclaim power and achieve sustainability and net zero.\u201dNVIDIA\u2019s corporate social responsibilityTo ensure the business is reaching its sustainability targets, NVIDIA conducts annual assessments of its corporate responsibility impacts, analysing its social and environmental effects, for example, by evaluating stakeholder expectations, market trends and risks.What\u2019s more, NVIDIA\u2019s H100 GPUs, based on its latest Hopper architecture, are 26x more energy efficient than CPUs when measured across inferencing benchmarks and the business has been credited to power the most efficient supercomputer on the November 2022 Green500 list. Also, making strides towards renewable energy, NVIDIA plans to purchase or generate enough renewable energy to match 100% of its global electricity usage.\u00a0Many of these goals have been structured around frameworks such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG), to help guide NVIDIA\u2019s sustainable contributions and business priorities.\u00a0How is NVIDIA prioritising DEI?The business has a dedicated drive to diversity, equity and inclusion, particularly by attracting talent attraction, recruitment, and retention. To achieve this, the business has dedicated recruiters assisting women and members of the Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, and veteran communities through the interview process.It also offers a competitive wage and pay parity. \u201cWe ensure strong pay for all employeesthrough an annual review of peer compensation in the markets we operate in and annual adjustments to employee compensation,\u201d the business states. \u201cEmployees are providedwith both cash and equity compensation. Equity compensation is provided through restricted stock units (RSUs) that vest over time and provide value aligned with our stockprice. We believe RSUs promote retention and align with stockholder interests.Cash compensation adjustments are determined based on market compensationgrowth and individual performance.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, NVIDIA also boosts promotion parity, stating that 14% of its workforce were promoted, with women being promoted at an approximately equal rate to men, 13.9% compared to 14.2%.*************************************************For more insights into Sustainability - check out the latest edition of\u00a0Sustainability Magazine\u00a0and be sure to follow us on\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0& TwitterOther magazines that may be of interest -\u00a0EV Magazine\u00a0|\u00a0Energy DigitalPlease also check out our upcoming event -\u00a0Sustainability LIVE\u00a0in London at the BDC on Sept 6/7th 2023*********************************************BizClik\u00a0is a global provider of B2B digital media platforms that cover 'Executive Communities' for CEO's, CFO's, CMO's, Sustainability Leaders, Procurement & Supply Chain Leaders, Technology & AI Leaders, Cyber Leaders, FinTech & InsurTech Leaders as well as covering industries such as Manufacturing, Mining, Energy, EV, Construction, Healthcare + Food & Drink.BizClik, based in London, Dubai & New York offers services such as Content Creation, Advertising & Sponsorship Solutions, Webinars & Events.NVIDIAtechnologyAI techShareRead full article hereClick here LatestDigital MagazineRead Now RelatedContentWorkiva Joins Sustainability LIVE Singapore as New SponsorTech & AIVodafone & Ericsson: Harnessing AI for 5G Energy EfficiencyTech & AIAWS' Fellowship to Support New Climate TechnologiesTech & AICognizant: How Can Technology Support a Circular Economy?Tech & AIFeatured ArticlesAmazon: How AI is a Workplace Sustainability Game-ChangerAI-based tools built on AWS are supporting Amazon\u2019s Climate Pledge commitment, helping the tech giant conserve water & improve energy efficiency worldwide\u2026How IBM is Ramping Up Renewables to Power its Data CentresClean Energy Capital is planning for a solar development around 500 metres from IBM's Hursley site, which includes a data centre\u2026Need For Sustainable Speed: Oracle & Red Bull's F1 AdvancesOracle Red Bull Racing leverages new OCI Compute shapes to increase simulation speed for race strategy decisions amid expanding AI implementation\u2026This Week's Top 5 Stories in SustainabilitySustainabilityEY: How Businesses Can Navigate Reporting Post-EU OmnibusNet ZeroLEGO Group: Growing Profits & Reducing Environmental ImpactESGQ&A: The NHS\u2019 Alexandra Hammond on Sustainable ProcurementHow Could the North Sea Ship Crash Impact the Environment?ABB: How to Achieve the Clean Industrial Deal's GoalsNetflix: The Sustainability Lessons from Toxic TownBank of America and BlackRock Remove DEI Terms From ReportsSustainability Magazine connects the leading sustainability and ESG executives of the world's largest brands.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia this week\u00a0posted\u00a0its all-time-record revenue of $13.5 billion as sales of its gaming hardware exceeded expectations, while sales of its compute GPUs for data centers exceeded $10.3 billion \u2014 more than double the previous quarter \u2014 and demonstrated the roaring success of the company's A100 and H100 processors for artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing applications (HPC).\n\n\"A new computing era has begun,\" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia. \"Companies worldwide are transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI.\"(Image credit: Nvidia)Nvidia's revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 reached $13.51 billion, marking a 101% rise from the previous year and an 88% jump from the previous quarter.\u00a0Gaming revenue grew by 22% year-over-year, driven by demand for the GeForce RTX 40-series GPUs after inventory stabilization and the launch of multiple new offerings, including GeForce RTX 4060 and GeForce RTX 4070 class cards.\n\nBut sales of datacenter GPUs in Q2 FY2024 was Nvidia's major triumph. It hit $10.323 billion, growing 171% year-over-year, and exceeded the datacenter revenue of AMD and Intel combined. Nvidia's datacenter revenue saw significant growth driven by demand from cloud service providers. Nvidia's HGX platforms based on the Ampere and Hopper GPU architectures were particularly sought after, especially for the development of large language models and generative AI. Additionally, the expansion of InfiniBand infrastructure, which supports the HGX platform, and the strong performance of the Hopper-based compute GPUs for HPC, further boosted the revenue.\n\n\"During the quarter, major cloud service providers announced massive Nvidia H100 AI infrastructures,\" said Huang. \"Leading enterprise IT system and software providers announced partnerships to bring Nvidia AI to every industry. The race is on to adopt generative AI.\"\n\nOther Nvidia businesses also performed very well. Professional visualization (ProViz) revenue declined 24% year-over-year but rose 28% quarter-over-quarter, influenced by enterprise workstation demand and new Nvidia RTX products. Automotive revenue increased 15% annually, boosted by autonomous platform sales, but dropped 15% quarterly due to reduced auto demand, notably in China.\n\nOver the past few months we have heard rumors that Nvidia's compute GPUs are sold out for quarters to come. Given the ongoing generative AI craze and demand for appropriate hardware, we're not surprised, but since the sources of the information were unofficial, we took the data with a grain of salt.\n\nBut Nvidia seems to be extremely optimistic about its future. The company expects its revenue in Q3 FY2024 to be $16 billion\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02% and gross margins to be between 71.5% to 72.5%.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (33)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

But I'm expecting that to not happen.\n\nI really want to upgrade my 1070 ti and was close to pulling the trigger on the 6950 xt yesterday for $600 but I'm hoping for something that draws a bit less power.

For a runner-up, you might consider Midjourney or Anthropic's Claude, a high-performing competitor to ChatGPT.Whether any of those players will figure out how to effectively monetize that buzz is widely debated. But in the meantime, someone has to supply the hardware to run all that viral generative AI \u2014 and for now, that's where the money is.Enter the Nvidia Corporation, a newly trillion dollar company that's making so much dough off its gangbusters AI chips that its revenue has more than doubled from last year, quickly becoming the undisputed backbone of the AI industry.Per its latest quarterly earnings report, Nvidia's revenue now sits at a hefty $13.5 billion, and the spike in its profits is even more unbelievable: a\u00a0nine times\u00a0increase in net income year-over-year, shooting up to $6.2 billion.In other words, there's no question that AI is a gold rush \u2014 and regardless of whether any of the prospectors hit pay dirt, it's currently Nvidia that's selling shovels.That's a surprising twist. If you've heard of Nvidia in years past, it was more than likely for its gaming hardware. Now, selling parts to PC gamers accounts for only a modest portion of its colossal revenue.\u00a0That reality has been quietly shifting for a while. Before AI took the tech sector by storm over the past year, the first hint of Nvidia's strange new trajectory was arguably cryptocurrency. As Bitcoin and its ilk swelled in value over the past decade or so, aficionados quickly discovered that the company's graphics processing units (GPUs), long adept at summoning virtual worlds in a home computer, were powerful engines to mine crypto.Predictably, they started to open huge server farms that devoured electricity, filtered it through GPUs, and churned out digital assets \u2014 sometimes tearing apart communities and leaving environmental destruction in their wake. Nvidia's leadership seemed nonplussed by the phenomenon, with the company's chief technology officer Michael Kagan saying earlier this year that the tech \"doesn't bring anything useful for society.\"But \"AI does,\" he told The Guardian. \"With ChatGPT, everybody can now create his own machine, his own program: you just tell it what to do, and it will.\"So far, time is bearing out that thesis, at least financially. This quarter, Nvidia's AI hardware division took in a record $10.3 billion in revenue \u2014 over three quarters of its total sales, vastly outperforming crypto or gaming.The company's success has arguably been a long time coming. Either through good luck or good planning, Nvidia got a healthy head start in AI hardware over its competition.\"We had the good wisdom to go put the whole company behind it,\" Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said in an interview with CNBC\u00a0in March. \"We saw early on, about a decade or so ago, that this way of doing software could change everything,\" he added. \"Every chip that we made was focused on artificial intelligence.\"In 2006, still a juggernaut of gaming hardware, it released CUDA, a parallel computing platform that allowed power-hungry AI models to run on Nvidia GPUs far faster than those of its competition. Suddenly, developing AI became a lot cheaper, and a lot faster.It took more than 15 years for the results generated by AI to catch up, but when they did, there was no arguing with results.Today, Nvidia's flagship AI product is the H100 GPU, and pretty much everyone with their fingers in the generative AI pie wants to get their hands on as many as possible. And if not the H100, currently in short supply, then its predecessor the A100.Notable customers include Microsoft, which reportedly spent north of several hundreds of millions of dollars buying thousands of A100 chips for OpenAI, as part of its $1 billion partnership with the then-startup in 2019. It was because of that investment \u2014 and Nvidia's hardware \u2014 that OpenAI was able to build ChatGPT.\u00a0In fact, the hype has become so profound that entire countries are snapping up the chips: the Financial Times\u00a0reported earlier this month that Saudi Arabia had bought 3,000 H100s, selling for up to $40,000 apiece, with the United Arab Emirates vacuuming up thousands more.And so is everyone else. According to one estimate, Nvidia has now cornered up to 95 percent of the AI GPU market.Needless to say, many are vying for Nvidia's throne. Other computer hardware heavyweights like AMD and Intel are currently dumping billions of dollars into developing their own machine learning processors. So are Google and Amazon. Even Microsoft, in the hopes of weaning off the GPU giant's pricey hardware, is reportedly creating an in-house AI chip.Perhaps its competitors see an opening in Nvidia's lagging output. The H100, which only shipped last September, is still expected to be sold out through 2024, and to satiate the AI industry's voracious appetite, Nvidia allegedly plans to triple the production of it going forward.At any rate, Nvidia's absolute bonanza of a year shows few signs of stopping in the near future. By its own projections, it's is set to steamroll into the next quarter with a steep climb in revenue to $16 billion. And that's striking \u2014 for all the headspinning hype\u00a0around AI's capabilities, the source of the go-to muscle behind the technology has remained unchanged.More on: Google\u2019s Search AI Says Slavery Was Good, ActuallyShare This ArticleRead This NextAI Label MakerAll AI-Generated Material Must Be Labeled Online, China AnnouncesCloud on the HorizonVoice Actor for Aloy in \"Horizon\" Games Creeped Out by AI Version of Her CharacterIt's So JoeverOpenAI Says It\u2019s \"Over\" If It Can\u2019t Steal All Your Copyrighted WorkBoneheadedStudy Finds That AI Search Engines Are Wrong an Astounding Proportion of the TimePondering the OrbOpenAI Shares Image of Mysterious Black OrbMore on Artificial IntelligenceDesirable OutcomesMar 17, 5:16 PM EDT on futurismUsers Cheer as Microsoft Accidentally Removes Hated AI Feature From Windows 11Gaslight GirlbossMar 16, 10:30 AM EDT on futurismNew AI Gadget Records Your Entire Life and Then Lies to You About What HappenedEye in the SkyMar 15, 6:45 AM EDT on futurismNASA Caught Purchasing Controversial AI Surveillance SoftwareREAD MORE STORIES ABOUT / Artificial IntelligenceKeep up.Subscribe to our daily newsletter to keep in touch with the subjects shaping our future.I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its User Agreement and Privacy PolicySubscribe+Social+NewsletterTopicsAbout UsEditorial StandardsContact UsDISCLAIMER(S)Privacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsDMCA PolicyArticles may contain affiliate links which enable us to share in the revenue of any purchases made.Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of Service.\u00a9 Recurrent Ventures Inc, All Rights Reserved."

But other companies, including Google, Microsoft and Amazon, want a piece of the action.https://p.dw.com/p/4VkoHNvidia chips are used to build and run AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPTImage: Andre M. Chang/Zuma Wire/picture allianceAdvertisementSemiconductors already occupy a pivotal place at the center of the global economy, but the rise of artificial intelligence is cementing it. The latest indicator was the stunning financial report posted by Nvidia, a world-leading chipmaker, on August 24.\nShares in the Silicon Valley company hit an all-time high, after its revenue doubled year-on-year in the second quarter of 2023 to $13.5 billion (\u20ac12.5 billion), smashing analyst expectations.\nThe reason for Nvidia's boom? The firm specializes in the kinds of chips needed for various forms of artificial intelligence technology. Nvidia's stunning success is directly tied to the artificial intelligence craze that\u00a0has gripped the tech world ever since the launch of ChatGPT, a chatbot, last November.\nMarket analysts have said Nvidia is \"uniquely positioned\" to capitalize. \"Its chips are distinctively capable of performing in ways that allow AI models to be trained using them,\" Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, told DW.\nThe success of ChatGPT has heralded a new age for artificial intelligenceImage: Harun Ozalp/AA/picture alliance\nFinancial commentator Susannah Streeter agrees. \"Being an early beneficiary of a megatrend is an enviable and rare opportunity, and Nvidia has a front seat on the AI juggernaut,\" she told DW.\nAI's 'iPhone moment'\nAlthough artificial intelligence has been around for many decades, the sudden and profound impact of ChatGPT dramatically changed the dynamic, according to Nvidia's CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang.\nHuang said earlier this year that artificial intelligence was \"having its iPhone moment,\"\u00a0referring to how Apple's iPhone transformed the tech sector.\n\"I think we were all surprised by how effective ChatGPT was in both its ease of use as well as incredible capability,\" he said at an Nvidia developer conference in March. \"Almost immediately after the ripples of ChatGPT around the world, cloud service providers and software vendors in all these different industries started to ask the question, what does it mean to them?\"\nFor Nvidia, it means mega business. Since the start of 2023, the company's share price has increased by around 220%. It now has a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion.\nLund-Yates said the company was\u00a0already performing \"streets away\" from expectations and pointed\u00a0to the huge, increasing demand for Nvidia's products as an indication that its rise is going to continue. \"Nvidia's H100 chip, where demand is far outpacing supply, is currently selling for double its original price in the tens of thousands,\" she said.\nFounded in 1993, Nvidia is far from an overnight success. For much of its history it was focused on video games. It developed a reputation for building graphic cards that could produce ever more advanced and stylish computer game graphics.\nSemiconductors are central to the future of artificial intelligence modelsImage: Robert Michael/dpa/picture alliance\n\"Their original use for graphics on video games was repurposed for AI at an early stage in the demand boom, and that's a very tough situation to replicate for other firms,\" said Lund-Yates.\nOver the past 15 years, Nvidia has become the main provider of high-performance chips for artificial intelligence. It now holds around 80% of the global market for such chips.\nIt has also invested in two areas that\u00a0are key to artificial intelligence: advanced networking and software. Advanced networking allows chips to be used in multiple ways at once while CUDA, Nvidia's AI software platform, has proven popular.\nBig beasts loom\nNvidia's gold-plated place at the top of the artificial intelligence tree means it is likely to continue to benefit from the surge in interest in the sector.\n\"Companies don't want to be left behind in the AI revolution, and even though times are tighter, they are ring-fencing budgets to invest in future AI capabilities, even though the full possibilities of the tech is still hard to map,\" said Streeter, who expects demand for Nvidia's products to grow and grow.\nAlthough it remains far from clear how the current wave of interest in artificial intelligence will ultimately develop, other companies are keen to cash in as well. Semiconductor designers and makers are the most obvious potential beneficiaries of\u00a0a sustained boom.\nEarlier this month, semiconductor firm AMD announced it was planning to release its own artificial intelligence chips, known as MI300, by the end of 2023. The chips are designed to compete with Nvidia's H100 chips.\nThen there are several smaller players such as Cerebras and SambaNova who are hoping to develop the next big thing in artificial intelligence chip technology.\nMicrosoft is among the tech majors looking to build their own AI chipsImage: Andy Wong/AP/picture alliance\nIt's certainly not just smaller startups who are hoping to get a slice of the pie currently being enjoyed by Nvidia. Tech behemoths Google, Amazon and Microsoft are all racing to develop their own artificial intelligence chips.\nThis week, Google announced a slew of new artificial intelligence investments, including details of its own new custom-built chips.\nEarlier this year, US media reports said Microsoft was working on its own AI chips to avoid being too reliant on Nvidia. Internal Microsoft documents, released during a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit against the firm in 2022, said Microsoft was working on a \"first-class silicon chip to underpin our cloud and AI efforts.\"\nMeanwhile, Amazon has made no secret of its attempts to develop AI chips. \"I think that we're in a better position than anybody else on Earth to supply the capacity that our customers collectively are going to want,\" Amazon Web Services CEO Adam Selipsky told CNBC in June.\n\"There is the potential for others to catch up and gain a big slice of the market,\" said Streeter.\nShe also pointed to other potential challenges, such as huge demand putting a strain on Nvidia's supply chains. That, as well as the intense rivalry between the US and China on semiconductors, could lead to some volatility in the years ahead.\nFor now though, Nvidia is better placed than any other firm to ride the wave.\nEdited by: Ashutosh Pandey\nArthur Sullivan Reporter and senior editor focused on global economic stories with a geopolitical angle.@drumloman86Send us your feedbackYour feedbackAdvertisementSkip next section Explore moreExplore moreIs ChatGPT getting dumber?Is ChatGPT getting dumber?You may be wondering whether AIs like ChatGPT will get too smart for humans.

The gap between the two solutions is vast, and on Tuesday, the company finally unveiled new products that fill it.\nNVIDIA's Ada Lovelace-based RTX-series professional graphics cards \u2014 the workstation-oriented RTX 4000 20GB, RTX 4500 24GB, RTX 5000 32GB, and the datacenter-bound L40S \u2014 graphics are designed for demanding graphics and artificial intelligence workloads, such as computer-aided design, digital content creation, real-time rendering, and basic simulations that are fine with FP32 precision. The new graphics solutions complement NVIDIA's Ada Lovelace-based workstation boards that have been announced: the midrange RTX 4000 SFF and the ultra-high-end RTX 6000 Ada. Meanwhile, NVIDIA's previous-generation offerings will continue to serve entry-level workstations based on its Ampere and Turing architectures.\nNow, let us cover the new graphics boards in more detail.\n\nNVIDIA's\u00a0RTX 4000 20GB\u00a0is\u00a0powered by the AD104\u00a0graphics processor\u00a0with 6,144 CUDA cores\u00a0that\u00a0promises\u00a0a peak performance of 26.7 FP32 TFLOPS, which is considerably higher than 19.2 FP32 TFLOPS delivered by the RTX 4000 SFF that features the same GPU with the same configuration albeit working at lower clocks and therefore consuming up to 130W. Unlike the small form-factor board, this uses\u00a0a full-height PCB but\u00a0a single-slot cooling\u00a0system. The novelty is\u00a0slated for a September release\u00a0with an MSRP of\u00a0$1,250.\n\nThe more powerful Ada Lovelace-based workstation board is called the\u00a0RTX 4500,\u00a0and it uses\u00a0the AD104 GPU with 7,680 CUDA cores to deliver a compute performance of up\u00a0to 39.6 FP32 TFLOPS\u00a0at up to 210W.\u00a0The board\u00a0employs a dual-slot cooling system and will be available for $2,250\u00a0sometime\u00a0in\u00a0October.\n\nFinally, NVIDIA is introducing its RTX 5000 professional graphics card that\u00a0utilizes the AD102 graphics processor with 12,800 CUDA cores\u00a0(i.e., a very significant cut down)\u00a0to achieve a compute performance of 65.3 FP32 TFLOPS\u00a0at 250W. This board is set to hit the market now for $4,000, which is significantly lower compared to $6,800 for NVIDIA's flagship RTX 6000 Ada product.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Ada Lovelace Professional Graphics Cards\n\n\n\u00a0\nRTX 4000 SFF\nRTX 4000\nRTX 4500\nRTX 5000\nRTX 6000\nL40S Ada\n\n\nGPU\nAD104\nAD104\nAD104\nAD102\nAD102\nAD102\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n6,144\n6,144\n7,680\n1,2800\n1,8176\n1,8176\n\n\nMemory\n20 GB\n24 GB\n32 GB\n48 GB\n\n\nPower\n70W\n130W\n210W\n250W\n300W\n?\n\n\nCooling\ndual-slot, blower\nsingle-slot, blower\ndual-slot, blower\npassive\n\n\nMSRP\n$1,250\n$1,250\n$2,250\n$4,000\n$6,800\n?\n\n\n\nNVIDIA's latest\u00a0ProViz\u00a0graphics boards are set to be integrated into the upcoming\u00a0workstation\u00a0lineups\u00a0of renowned companies, including Boxx, Dell, HP, Lambda, and Lenovo. Additionally,\u00a0the graphics cards\u00a0will be available for purchase\u00a0from select graphics card makers like Leadtek, PNY, and Ryoyo, as well as major resellers like Arrow and Ingram. Meanwhile, there will be an Ada Lovelace professional graphics board that will unlikely be available separately.\n\nCatering to the needs of professionals\u00a0using\u00a0remote workstations, NVIDIA is launching the L40S Ada datacenter card.\u00a0The board carries\u00a0the AD102\u00a0graphics processor\u00a0with\u00a018,176\u00a0active\u00a0CUDA cores, delivering a staggering 91.6 FP32 TFLOPS\u00a0performance.\u00a0The product is initially set for NVIDIA's OVX servers\u00a0that can be used to enable cloud AI and virtual desktop infrastructure. Still, it is reasonable to expect other AI and VDI infrastructure makers to adopt the L40S Ada board. Interestingly, despite being a data center-oriented product with passive cooling, the L40S Ada includes display outputs, making it suitable for workstations given adequate airflow\u00a0inside\u00a0or an attached blower.\u00a0NVIDIA does not publish the pricing of its OVX machine or the L40S Ada card.\n\"OVX systems with NVIDIA L40S GPUs accelerate AI, graphics, and video processing workloads and meet the demanding performance requirements of an ever-increasing set of complex and diverse applications,\" said Bob Pette, vice president of professional visualization at NVIDIA\n\n\n                Source:\n                NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n2 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nTheinsanegamerN - Wednesday, August 9, 2023 - link\nI just want some RTX 4000 SFF cards to hit ebay like the a2000 did, so I can finally upgrade my media PC. \n\n\n\nNextGen_Gamer - Wednesday, August 9, 2023 - link\nCorrection for article: commas are in the incorrect place on the CUDA Core counts for the AD102 cards in the chart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

While I don\u2019t think this is a cause for great alarm or concern, it definitely isn\u2019t the type of thing you want to hear on the heels of Snapdragon 7c+ Gen 3 Chromebooks also getting canned last week.  Alas, that\u2019s where we are, and I\u2019ve known about it for over a week or so at this point.  The handful of Chromebooks in development with NVIDIA GPUs inside are no longer being worked on and \u2013 for the time being, at least \u2013 won\u2019t be seeing the light of day.\nI knew I ran the risk of getting scooped on this one, but I just didn\u2019t want to put out such negative news about another group of Chromebooks getting cancelled in such close proximity.  In reality, these decisions were likely made months ago and the cleanup is just now beginning, but the sad truth is we won\u2019t get to see what the eventual combo of a discrete GPU-enabled Chromebook and a finished Borealis (Steam on Chromebooks) project would look like.  And for that reason, I\u2019m a bit bummed.\nXremove ads\n\n\n\nvia the Chromium Gerrit\nI don\u2019t have to get into great detail to explain this one: it\u2019s quite clear from the language in that commit above.  As we discussed with the Snapdragon 7c+ Gen 3 devices (based on the \u2018Herobrine\u2019 board), we\u2019re seeing the same, simple discontinuation of both \u2018Hades\u2019 and \u2018Agah\u2019 in the Chromium Repositories as of the end of July.  There\u2019s no mixed language or hopeful translations of this message.  Instead, it is quite plain that these boards are toast.\nWe talked about \u2018Agah\u2019 as our main point of proof that NVIDIA GPUs were on the way to at least a couple Chromebooks, and we referenced \u2018Agah\u2019 again when we discovered \u2018Hades\u2019.  It was a device copied directly from \u2018Agah\u2019 and had much of the same references to NVIDIA GPUs, and it really seemed like a small family of devices was being built that would one day introduce dGPU-equipped Chromebooks with Steam installed right out of the gate.  At least that was the plan, anyway.\nFeatured Videos\n \n\nXremove ads\n\n\n\nVia the Chromium Gerrit\nBut not all things work out like we want.  While I\u2019d love to think that maybe a different GPU (perhaps an AMD one) was in the works for a couple Chromebooks, that doesn\u2019t seem to be happening at this point, either.  What happened and where things went sideways could remain a mystery, but we\u2019ve at least reached out to our contacts at Google to see what\u2019s going on with both the Snapdragon 7c+ Gen 3 Chromebooks and these NVIDIA GPU-equipped ones.  \nIn my hopeful nature, I\u2019m wondering if the path forward for this sort of thing isn\u2019t support for external USB Type-C GPUs in the future.  I\u2019m not certain any ChromeOS device can even leverage one of these units right now, but if that became an option down the road, it would be a far simpler solution than building what would surely be a handful of expensive, niche devices with big GPUs on board.
