The tech stock opened the year at $210.00, and reached its new all time high of $504.60 today, Nov. 20.Nvidia has been the darling of the artificial intelligence craze, spiking almost $100 after their earnings announcement in May 2023. The stock has rallied almost $100 this month alone, and there are big expectations for the stock this earnings season. I was shocked to see just how much the EPS and revenue figures have increased compared to last quarter.The current EPS expectation of $3.39 is over 50% higher than the previous quarter's expectation of $2.07 per share.The current revenue expectation of $16.11 billion is also almost 50% higher than the previous quarter's expectation of $11.09 billion. Just staggering numbers from the chip maker, and it seems as though they'll need to exceed these numbers yet again and post a strong guidance for next year if they want to keep this stock price sky high.The stock price's expected move through this week based on current implied volatility is +-$37.64, which is just over 7% of the current stock price. This is a pretty large expected move for such a high-priced stock. This weekly expected move makes up over 50% of the expected move through the January 2024 monthly cycle, so there is a lot of market movement expected from this earnings announcement alone.Bullish on NVDA stock for earningsIt's no surprise to see NVDA going straight to the moon after the surge of AI demand, and the expectation is that earnings will be very impressive this quarter. If that rings true, and they announce strong expectations for things to continue into next year, we could see little bearish resistance and the stock move higher.Bearish on NVDA stock for earningsInterestingly enough, it seems there is a lot of fear for downside movement this earnings quarter. At the end of the day, a massive increase in EPS and revenue expectations puts pressure on the company to deliver and paint a positive light. If they miss at all, or exhibit weak guidance for future quarters, we could easily see \"profit taking\" and long positions closed, which could put downside pressure on the stock.There is still some turbulence in the sales relationship with China, which NVDA is closely tied to. This adds a layer of complexity to things, but negative political press is usually not good for single name equities regardless of who they are or what they produce. If there is shakiness on the earnings call, we could see the stock move lower.Tune in to Options Trading Concepts Live at 11 a.m. CDT on Nov. 21 for a full options strategy breakdown for NVDA stock ahead of earnings after the close!Mike Butler,\u00a0tastylive director of market intelligence, has been in the markets and trading for a decade.

Colette Kress: Thanks, Simona. Q3 was another record quarter. Revenue of $18.1 billion was up 34% sequentially and up more than 200% year-on-year and well above our outlook for $16 billion. Starting with Data Center. The continued ramp of the NVIDIA HGX platform based on our Hopper Tensor Core GPU architecture, along with InfiniBand end-to-end networking, drove record revenue of $14.5 billion, up 41% sequentially and up 279% year-on-year. NVIDIA HGX with InfiniBand together are essentially the reference architecture for AI supercomputers and data center infrastructures. Some of the most exciting generative AI applications are built and run on NVIDIA, including Adobe Firefly, ChatGPT, Microsoft 365 Copilot, CoAssist, now assist with ServiceNow and Zoom AI Companion.   Story Continues Our Data Center compute revenue quadrupled from last year and networking revenue nearly tripled. Investments in infrastructure for training and inferencing large language models, deep learning, recommender systems and generative AI applications is fueling strong broad-based demand for NVIDIA accelerated computing. Inferencing is now a major workload for NVIDIA AI computing. Consumer Internet companies and enterprises drove exceptional sequential growth in Q3, comprising approximately half of our Data Center revenue and outpacing total growth. Companies like Meta are in full production with deep learning, recommender systems and also investing in generative AI to help advertisers optimize images and text. Most major consumer Internet companies are racing to ramp up generative AI deployment.The enterprise wave of AI adoption is now beginning. Enterprise software companies such as Adobe, Databricks, Snowflake and ServiceNow are adding AI copilots and the systems to their platforms. And broader enterprises are developing custom AI for vertical industry applications such as Tesla in autonomous driving. Cloud service providers drove roughly the other half of our Data Center revenue in the quarter. Demand was strong from all hyperscale CSPs, as well as from a broadening set of GPU-specialized CSPs globally that are rapidly growing to address the new market opportunities in AI. NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU instances are now generally available in virtually every cloud with instances in high demand. We have significantly increased supply every quarter this year to meet strong demand and expect to continue to do so next year.We will also have a broader and faster product launch cadence to meet the growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. Towards the end of the quarter, the U.S. government announced a new set of export control regulations for China and other markets, including Vietnam and certain countries in the Middle East. These regulations require licenses for the export of a number of our products, including our Hopper and Ampere 100 and 800 series and several others. Our sales to China and other affected destinations derived from products that are now subject to licensing requirements have consistently contributed approximately 20% to 25% of Data Center revenue over the past few quarters. We expect that our sales to these destinations will decline significantly in the fourth quarter.So we believe will be more than offset by strong growth in other regions. The U.S. government designed the regulation to allow the U.S. industry to provide data center compute products to markets worldwide, including China. Continuing to compete worldwide as the regulations encourage, promotes U.S. technology leadership, spurs economic growth and supports U.S. jobs. For the highest performance levels, the government requires licenses. For lower performance levels, the government requires a streamlined prior notification process. And for products even lower performance levels, the government does not require any notice at all. Following the government's clear guidelines, we are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer compliance solutions for each regulatory category, including products for which the U.S. government does not wish to have advance notice before each shipment.We are working with some customers in China and the Middle East to pursue licenses from the U.S. government. It is too early to know whether these will be granted for any significant amount of revenue. Many countries are awakening to the need to invest in sovereign AI infrastructure to support economic growth and industrial innovation. With investments in domestic compute capacity, nations can use their own data to train LLMs and support their local generative AI ecosystems. For example, we are working with India's government and largest tech companies including Infosys, Reliance and Tata to boost their sovereign AI infrastructure. And French private cloud provider, Scaleway, is building a regional AI cloud based on NVIDIA H100 InfiniBand and NVIDIA's AI Enterprise software to fuel advancement across France and Europe.National investment in compute capacity is a new economic imperative and serving the sovereign AI infrastructure market represents a multi-billion dollar opportunity over the next few years. From a product perspective, the vast majority of revenue in Q3 was driven by the NVIDIA HGX platform based on our Hopper GPU architecture with lower contribution from the prior generation Ampere GPU architecture. The new L40S GPU built for industry standard servers began to ship, supporting training and inference workloads across a variety of consumers. This was also the first revenue quarter of our GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, which combines our ARM-based Grace CPU with a Hopper GPU. Grace and Grace Hopper are ramping into a new multi-billion dollar product line.Grace Hopper instances are now available at GPU specialized cloud providers, and coming soon to Oracle Cloud. Grace Hopper is also getting significant traction with supercomputing customers. Initial shipments to Los Alamos National Lab and the Swiss National Supercomputing Center took place in the third quarter. The UK government announced it will build one of the world's fastest AI supercomputers called Isambard-AI with almost 5,500 Grace Hopper Superchips. German supercomputing center, Julich, also announced that it will build its next-generation AI supercomputer with close to 24,000 Grace Hopper Superchips and Quantum-2 InfiniBand, making it the world's most powerful AI supercomputer with over 90 exaflops of AI performance. All-in, we estimate that the combined AI compute capacity of all the supercomputers built on Grace Hopper across the U.S., Europe and Japan next year will exceed 200 exaflops with more wins to come.  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.  Inference is contributing significantly to our data center demand, as AI is now in full production for deep learning, recommenders, chatbots, copilots and text to image generation and this is just the beginning. NVIDIA AI offers the best inference performance and versatility, and thus the lower power and cost of ownership. We are also driving a fast cost reduction curve. With the release of TensorRT-LLM, we now achieved more than 2x the inference performance for half the cost of inferencing LLMs on NVIDIA GPUs. We also announced the latest member of the Hopper family, the H200, which will be the first GPU to offer HBM3e, faster, larger memory to further accelerate generative AI and LLMs. It moves inference speed up to another 2x compared to H100 GPUs for running LLMs like Norma2 (ph).Combined, TensorRT-LLM and H200, increased performance or reduced cost by 4x in just one year. With our customers changing their stack, this is a benefit of CUDA and our architecture compatibility. Compared to the A100, H200 delivers an 18x performance increase for inferencing models like GPT-3, allowing customers to move to larger models and with no increase in latency. Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud will be among the first CSPs to offer H200-based instances starting next year. At last week's Microsoft Ignite, we deepened and expanded our collaboration with Microsoft across the entire stock. We introduced an AI foundry service for the development and tuning of custom generative AI enterprise applications running on Azure.Customers can bring their domain knowledge and proprietary data and we help them build their AI models using our AI expertise and software stock in our DGX cloud, all with enterprise grade security and support. SAP and Amdocs are the first customers of the NVIDIA AI foundry service on Microsoft Azure. In addition, Microsoft will launch new confidential computing instances based on the H100. The H100 remains the top performing and most versatile platform for AI training and by a wide margin, as shown in the latest MLPerf industry benchmark results. Our training cluster included more than 10,000 H100 GPUs or 3x more than in June, reflecting very efficient scaling. Efficient scaling is a key requirement in generative AI, because LLMs are growing by an order of magnitude every year.Microsoft Azure achieved similar results on a nearly identical cluster, demonstrating the efficiency of NVIDIA AI in public cloud deployments. Networking now exceeds a $10 billion annualized revenue run rate. Strong growth was driven by exceptional demand for InfiniBand, which grew fivefold year-on-year. InfiniBand is critical to gaining the scale and performance needed for training LLMs. Microsoft made this very point last week, highlighting that Azure uses over 29,000 miles of InfiniBand cabling, enough to circle the globe. We are expanding NVIDIA networking into the Ethernet space. Our new Spectrum-X end-to-end Ethernet offering with technologies, purpose built for AI, will be available in Q1 next year. With support from leading OEMs, including Dell, HPE and Lenovo.Spectrum-X can achieve 1.6x higher networking performance for AI communication compared to traditional Ethernet offerings. Let me also provide an update on our software and services offerings, where we are starting to see excellent adoption. We are on track to exit the year at an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion for our recurring software, support and services offerings. We see two primary opportunities for growth over the intermediate term with our DGX cloud service and with our NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, each reflects the growth of enterprise AI training and enterprise AI inference, respectively. Our latest DGX cloud customer announcement was this morning as part of an AI research collaboration with Gentech, the biotechnology pioneer also plans to use our BioNeMo LLM framework to help accelerate and optimize their AI drug discovery platform.We now have enterprise AI partnership with Adobe, Dropbox, Getty, SAP, ServiceNow, Snowflake and others to come. Okay. Moving to Gaming. Gaming revenue of $2.86 billion was up 15% sequentially and up more than 80% year-on-year with strong demand in the important back-to-school shopping season with NVIDIA RTX ray tracing and AI technology now available at price points as low as $299. We entered the holidays with the best-ever line-up for gamers and creators. Gaming has doubled relative to pre-COVID levels even against the backdrop of lackluster PC market performance. This reflects the significant value we've brought to the gaming ecosystem with innovations like RTX and DLSS. The number of games and applications supporting these technologies has exploded in that period, driving upgrades and attracting new buyers.The RTX ecosystem continues to grow. There are now over 475 RTX-enabled games and applications. Generative AI is quickly emerging as the new pillar app for high performance PCs. NVIDIA RTX GPUs to find the most performance AI PCs and workstations. We just released TensorRT-LLM for Windows, which speeds on-device LLM inference up by 4x. With an installed base of over 100 million, NVIDIA RTX is the natural platform for AI application developers. Finally, our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service continues to build momentum. Its library of PC games surpassed 1,700 titles, including the launches of Alan Wake 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty and Starfield. Moving to the Pro Vis. Revenue of $416 million was up 10% sequentially and up 108% year-on year.NVIDIA RTX is the workstation platform of choice for professional design, engineering and simulation use cases and AI is emerging as a powerful demand driver. Early applications include inference for AI imaging in healthcare and edge AI in smart spaces and the public sector. We launched a new line of desktop workstations based on NVIDIA RTX Ada Lovelace generation GPUs and ConnectX, SmartNICs offering up to 2x the AI processing ray tracing and graphics performance of the previous generations. These powerful new workstations are optimized for AI workloads such as fine tune AI models, training smaller models and running inference locally. We continue to make progress on Omniverse, our software platform for designing, building and operating 3D virtual worlds.Mercedes-Benz is using Omniverse powered digital twins to plan, design, build and operate its manufacturing and assembly facilities, helping it increase efficiency and reduce defects. Oxxon (ph) is also incorporating Omniverse into its manufacturing process, including end-to-end simulation for the entire robotics and automation pipeline, saving time and cost. We announced two new Omniverse Cloud services for automotive digitalization available on Microsoft Azure, a virtual factory simulation engine and autonomous vehicle simulation engine. Moving to Automotive. Revenue was $261 million, up 3% sequentially and up 4% year-on year, primarily driven by continued growth in self-driving platforms based on NVIDIA DRIVE Orin SOC and the ramp of AI cockpit solutions with global OEM customers.We extended our automotive partnership of Foxconn to include NVIDIA DRIVE for our next-generation automotive SOC. Foxconn has become the ODM for EVs. Our partnership provides Foxconn with a standard AV sensor and computing platform for their customers to easily build a state-of-an-art safe and secure software defined car. Now we're going to move to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin expanded to 74% and non-GAAP gross margin to 75%, driven by higher Data Center sales and lower net inventory reserve, including a 1 percentage point benefit from the release of previously reserved inventory related to the Ampere GPU architecture products. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 12% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 10%, primarily reflecting increased compensation and benefits.Let me turn to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Total revenue is expected to be $20 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect strong sequential growth to be driven by Data Center, with continued strong demand for both compute and networking. Gaming will likely decline sequentially as it is now more aligned with notebook seasonality. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.5% and 75.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $3.17 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $200 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 15%, plus or minus 1% excluding any discrete items.Further financial information are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We will attend the UBS Global Technology Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona, on November 28; the Wells Fargo TMT Summit in Rancho Palos Verdes, California on November 29; the Arete Virtual Tech Conference on December 7; and the J.P. Morgan Health Care Conference in San Francisco on January 8. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 is scheduled for Wednesday, February 21.

One of the groundbreaking innovations making it possible is a relatively new term: SuperNIC.\u00a0\nWhat Is a SuperNIC?\nSuperNIC is a new class of network accelerators designed to supercharge hyperscale AI workloads in Ethernet-based clouds. It provides lightning-fast network connectivity for GPU-to-GPU communication, achieving speeds reaching 400Gb/s using remote direct memory access (RDMA) over converged Ethernet (RoCE) technology. \u00a0\nSuperNICs combine the following unique attributes:\u00a0\n\nHigh-speed packet reordering, featured when combined with an NVIDIA network switch, ensure that data packets are received and processed in the same order they were originally transmitted. This maintains the sequential integrity of the data flow.\u00a0\nAdvanced congestion control using real-time telemetry data and network-aware algorithms to manage and prevent congestion in AI networks.\u00a0\nProgrammable compute on the input/output (I/O) path to enable customization and extensibility of network infrastructure in AI cloud data centers.\u00a0\nPower-efficient, low-profile design to efficiently accommodate AI workloads within constrained power budgets.\u00a0\nFull-stack AI optimization, including compute, networking, storage, system software, communication libraries and application frameworks.\u00a0\n\nNVIDIA recently unveiled the world\u2019s first SuperNIC tailored for AI computing, based on the BlueField-3 networking platform. It\u2019s a part of the NVIDIA Spectrum-X platform, where it integrates seamlessly with the Spectrum-4 Ethernet switch system.\u00a0\u00a0\nTogether, the NVIDIA BlueField-3 SuperNIC and Spectrum-4 switch system form the foundation of an accelerated computing fabric specifically designed to optimize AI workloads. Spectrum-X consistently delivers high network efficiency levels, outperforming traditional Ethernet environments.\u00a0\n\u201cIn a world where AI is driving the next wave of technological innovation, the BlueField-3 SuperNIC is a vital cog in the machinery,\u201d said Yael Shenhav, vice president of DPU and NIC products at NVIDIA. \u201cSuperNICs ensure that your AI workloads are executed with efficiency and speed, making them foundational components for enabling the future of AI computing.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Evolving Landscape of AI and Networking\u00a0\nThe AI field is undergoing a seismic shift, thanks to the advent of generative AI and large language models. These powerful technologies have unlocked new possibilities, enabling computers to handle new tasks.\u00a0\u00a0\nAI success relies heavily on GPU-accelerated computing to process mountains of data, train large AI models, and enable real-time inference. This new compute power has opened new possibilities, but it has also challenged Ethernet cloud networks.\u00a0\nTraditional Ethernet, the technology that underpins internet infrastructure, was conceived to offer broad compatibility and connect loosely coupled applications. It wasn\u2019t designed to handle the demanding computational needs of modern AI workloads, which involve tightly coupled parallel processing, rapid data transfers and unique communication patterns \u2014 all of which demand optimized network connectivity.\u00a0\u00a0\nFoundational network interface cards (NICs) were designed for general-purpose computing, universal data transmission and interoperability. They were never designed to cope with the unique challenges posed by the computational intensity of AI workloads.\u00a0\u00a0\nStandard NICs lack the requisite features and capabilities for efficient data transfer, low latency and the deterministic performance crucial for AI tasks. SuperNICs, on the other hand, are purpose-built for modern AI workloads.\u00a0\nSuperNIC Advantages in AI Computing Environments\u00a0\nData processing units (DPUs) deliver a wealth of advanced features, offering high throughput, low-latency network connectivity and more. Since their introduction in 2020, DPUs have gained popularity in the realm of cloud computing, primarily due to their capacity to offload, accelerate and isolate data center infrastructure processing.\u00a0\nAlthough DPUs and SuperNICs share a range of features and capabilities, SuperNICs are uniquely optimized for accelerating networks for AI. The chart below shows how they compare:\u00a0\n \nDistributed AI training and inference communication flows depend heavily on network bandwidth availability for success. SuperNICs, distinguished by their sleek design, scale more effectively than DPUs, delivering an impressive 400Gb/s of network bandwidth per GPU.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe 1:1 ratio between GPUs and SuperNICs within a system can significantly enhance AI workload efficiency, leading to greater productivity and superior outcomes for enterprises.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe sole purpose of SuperNICs is to accelerate networking for AI cloud computing. Consequently, it achieves this goal using less computing power than a DPU, which requires substantial computational resources to offload applications from a host CPU.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe reduced computing requirements also translate to lower power consumption, which is especially crucial in systems containing up to eight SuperNICs.\u00a0\nAdditional distinguishing features of the SuperNIC include its dedicated AI networking capabilities. When tightly integrated with an AI-optimized NVIDIA Spectrum-4 switch, it offers adaptive routing, out-of-order packet handling and optimized congestion control. These advanced features are instrumental in accelerating Ethernet AI cloud environments.\u00a0\nRevolutionizing AI Cloud Computing\nThe NVIDIA BlueField-3 SuperNIC offers several benefits that make it key for AI-ready infrastructure:\u00a0\n\nPeak AI workload efficiency: The BlueField-3 SuperNIC is purpose-built for network-intensive, massively parallel computing, making it ideal for AI workloads. It ensures that AI tasks run efficiently \u2014 without bottlenecks.\u00a0\nConsistent and predictable performance: In multi-tenant data centers where numerous tasks are processed simultaneously, the BlueField-3 SuperNIC ensures that each job and tenant\u2019s performance is isolated, predictable and unaffected by other network activities.\u00a0\nSecure multi-tenant cloud infrastructure: Security is a top priority, especially in data centers handling sensitive information. The BlueField-3 SuperNIC maintains high security levels, enabling multiple tenants to coexist while keeping data and processing isolated.\u00a0\nExtensible network infrastructure: The BlueField-3 SuperNIC isn\u2019t limited in scope \u2014 it\u2019s highly flexible and adaptable to a myriad of other network infrastructure needs.\u00a0\nBroad server manufacturer support: The BlueField-3 SuperNIC fits seamlessly into most enterprise-class servers without excessive power consumption in data centers.\n\nLearn more about NVIDIA BlueField-3 SuperNICs, including how they integrate across NVIDIA\u2019s data center platforms, in the whitepaper: Next-Generation Networking for the Next Wave of AI.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Explainer | NetworkingTags: NVIDIA BlueField \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

On November 21, 2023, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) released its 8-K filing, announcing financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. The company reported a record-breaking revenue of $18.12 billion, which represents a staggering 206% increase compared to the same period last year and a 34% rise from the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The growth was primarily fueled by the company's Data Center segment, which alone contributed $14.51 billion in revenue, up 279% year-over-year. Financial Performance Overview NVIDIA's gross margin improved significantly, reaching 74.0% on a GAAP basis and 75.0% on a non-GAAP basis.

Operating expenses were managed effectively, with a 12% increase on a GAAP basis and a 10% increase on a non-GAAP basis compared to the previous quarter. This controlled growth in expenses, coupled with the substantial revenue increase, underscores NVIDIA's operational efficiency and ability to scale profitably.

And NVDA stock has the outsized returns and trillion-dollar market capitalization to prove it.\u00a0Latecomers might figure that the easy money in NVDA stock has already been made. But thanks to Nvidia's market dominance and first-mover advantage, Wall Street believes shares in the chipmaker powering the AI revolution have plenty of upside left.That's remarkable considering that Nvidia stock has more than tripled in value for the year-to-date through early November.\u00a0\n\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance\nBe a smarter, better informed investor.\n\n\nSave up to 74%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for Kiplinger\u2019s Free E-Newsletters\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.\n\n\n\n\nSign up\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, the maker of graphic processing units (GPUs) added roughly $800 billion in market capitalization in 2023 alone. To put that in perspective, competitor Intel (INTC), a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, has a market value of $160 billion. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a market cap of $180 billion.\u00a0In other words, NVDA's market value this year has expanded by the equivalent of five INTCs or four AMDs.\u00a0NVDA stock was up 211% for the year-to-date through November 6, pushing its market cap up to $1.12 trillion. If the idea is to buy low, then it's perhaps reasonable to assume that it's far too late to add Nvidia stock to your portfolio.\u00a0Most industry analysts, however, would beg to differ.Nvidia's iPhone moment?The world is suddenly awash in all sorts of AI wizardry, with more sites and tools and apps coming every day. And Nvidia's place in this ecosystem couldn't be more enviable. It's churning out a new generation of advanced chips to power the data centers tasked with making the calculations that conjure all this AI magic.Demand is so great for Nvidia's hardware that the company's second-quarter revenue more than doubled year-over-year to $13.5 billion. Analysts were looking for revenue of \"only\" $11.1 billion. For the full fiscal year, Wall Street expects the company to post revenue of more than $54 billion \u2013 a 100% increase over last year's revenue of $27 billion.\u00a0The key to the investment thesis on NVDA stock is that AI data centers will continue to have an almost insatiable need for Nvidia's products. Naturally, traders and investors could not be more elated. That's certainly understandable given what they see as historical precedent. As Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in an interview last spring, the company has been preparing for years to take advantage of the AI craze.\"I call it the iPhone moment,\u201d Huang told The Wall Street Journal, comparing NVDA's position in generative AI to the way Apple's (AAPL) iteration of the smartphone essentially ushered in a new era of tech. \"All the technology came together and helped everybody realize what an amazing product that can be and what capabilities it can have.\"Analysts: Nvidia stock is still a buyLong-time followers of Nvidia stock probably already know that it happens to be one of the best stocks of the past 30 years. Between 1990 and 2020, NVDA created $309.4 billion in wealth for shareholders, according to calculations by Hendrik Bessembinder, a finance professor at the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University. Indeed, NVDA stock was good for an annualized dollar-weighted return of almost 28% over that span.Nvidia stock has also generated stupendous wealth for anyone who picked it up a couple decades ago. If you put a mere $1,000 into Nvidia stock 20 years ago, you would have enjoyed an annualized return of almost 34%.\u00a0And now, even with shares having more than tripled in 2023, the Street is still pounding the table for Nvidia stock. Of the 53 analysts issuing opinions on NVDA surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence, 38 rate it at Strong Buy, 12 say Buy and three have it at Hold. That works out to a rare consensus recommendation of Strong Buy, with high conviction to boot.\u00a0As for where the Street thinks NVDA is headed, analysts' average price target stands at $641.37. That gives Nvidia stock implied upside of about 40% in the next 12 months or so.\u00a0The bottom line? Nvidia stock might be trading near record highs, but the Street says this rally is far from finished.

RevolutionThe company\u2019s C.E.O. bet it all on a new kind of chip. Now that Nvidia is one of the biggest companies in the world, what will he do next?By Stephen WittNovember 27, 2023FacebookXEmailPrintSave Story\u201cThere\u2019s a war going on out there in A.I., and Nvidia is the only arms dealer,\u201d a Wall Street analyst said.Illustration by Javier Ja\u00e9nSave this storySave this storySave this storySave this storyThe revelation that ChatGPT, the astonishing artificial-intelligence chatbot, had been trained on an Nvidia supercomputer spurred one of the largest single-day gains in stock-market history. When the Nasdaq opened on May 25, 2023, Nvidia\u2019s value increased by about two hundred billion dollars. A few months earlier, Jensen Huang, Nvidia\u2019s C.E.O., had informed investors that Nvidia had sold similar supercomputers to fifty of America\u2019s hundred largest companies. By the close of trading, Nvidia was the sixth most valuable corporation on earth, worth more than Walmart and ExxonMobil combined. Huang\u2019s business position can be compared to that of Samuel Brannan, the celebrated vender of prospecting supplies in San Francisco in the late eighteen-forties. \u201cThere\u2019s a war going on out there in A.I., and Nvidia is the only arms dealer,\u201d one Wall Street analyst said.Huang is a patient monopolist. He drafted the paperwork for Nvidia with two other people at a Denny\u2019s restaurant in San Jose, California, in 1993, and has run it ever since. At sixty, he is sarcastic and self-deprecating, with a Teddy-bear face and wispy gray hair. Nvidia\u2019s main product is its graphics-processing unit, a circuit board with a powerful microchip at its core. In the beginning, Nvidia sold these G.P.U.s to video gamers, but in 2006 Huang began marketing them to the supercomputing community as well. Then, in 2013, on the basis of promising research from the academic computer-science community, Huang bet Nvidia\u2019s future on artificial intelligence. A.I. had disappointed investors for decades, and Bryan Catanzaro, Nvidia\u2019s lead deep-learning researcher at the time, had doubts. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to fall into the same trap that the A.I. industry has had in the past,\u201d Catanzaro told me. \u201cBut, ten years plus down the road, he was right.\u201dIn the near future, A.I. is projected to generate movies on demand, provide tutelage to children, and teach cars to drive themselves. All of these advances will occur on Nvidia G.P.U.s, and Huang\u2019s stake in the company is now worth more than forty billion dollars.In September, I met Huang for breakfast at the Denny\u2019s where Nvidia was started. (The C.E.O. of Denny\u2019s was giving him a plaque, and a TV crew was in attendance.) Huang keeps up a semi-comic deadpan patter at all times. Chatting with our waitress, he ordered seven items, including a Super Bird sandwich and a chicken-fried steak. \u201cYou know, I used to be a dishwasher here,\u201d he told her. \u201cBut I worked hard! Like, really hard. So I got to be a busboy.\u201dHuang has a practical mind-set, dislikes speculation, and has never read a science-fiction novel. He reasons from first principles about what microchips can do today, then gambles with great conviction on what they will do tomorrow. \u201cI do everything I can not to go out of business,\u201d he said at breakfast. \u201cI do everything I can not to fail.\u201d Huang believes that the basic architecture of digital computing, little changed since it was introduced by I.B.M. in the early nineteen-sixties, is now being reconceptualized. \u201cDeep learning is not an algorithm,\u201d he said recently. \u201cDeep learning is a method. It\u2019s a new way of developing software.\u201d The evening before our breakfast, I\u2019d watched a video in which a robot, running this new kind of software, stared at its hands in seeming recognition, then sorted a collection of colored blocks. The video had given me chills; the obsolescence of my species seemed near. Huang, rolling a pancake around a sausage with his fingers, dismissed my concerns. \u201cI know how it works, so there\u2019s nothing there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s no different than how microwaves work.\u201d I pressed Huang\u2014an autonomous robot surely presents risks that a microwave oven does not. He responded that he has never worried about the technology, not once. \u201cAll it\u2019s doing is processing data,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many other things to worry about.\u201dIn May, hundreds of industry leaders endorsed a statement that equated the risk of runaway A.I. with that of nuclear war. Huang didn\u2019t sign it. Some economists have observed that the Industrial Revolution led to a relative decline in the global population of horses, and have wondered if A.I. might do the same to humans. \u201cHorses have limited career options,\u201d Huang said. \u201cFor example, horses can\u2019t type.\u201d As he finished eating, I expressed my concerns that, someday soon, I would feed my notes from our conversation into an intelligence engine, then watch as it produced structured, superior prose. Huang didn\u2019t dismiss this possibility, but he assured me that I had a few years before my John Henry moment. \u201cIt will come for the fiction writers first,\u201d he said. Then he tipped the waitress a thousand dollars, and stood up to accept his award.Huang was born in Taiwan in 1963, but when he was nine he and his older brother were sent as unaccompanied minors to the U.S. They landed in Tacoma, Washington, to live with an uncle, before being sent to the Oneida Baptist Institute, in Kentucky, which Huang\u2019s uncle believed was a prestigious boarding school. In fact, it was a religious reform academy. Huang was placed with a seventeen-year-old roommate. On their first night together, the older boy lifted his shirt to show Huang the numerous places where he\u2019d been stabbed in fights. \u201cEvery student smoked, and I think I was the only boy at the school without a pocketknife,\u201d Huang told me. His roommate was illiterate; in exchange for teaching him to read, Huang said, \u201che taught me how to bench-press. I ended up doing a hundred pushups every night before bed.\u201dAlthough Huang lived at the academy, he was too young to attend its classes, so he went to a nearby public school. There, he befriended Ben Bays, who lived with his five siblings in an old house with no running water. \u201cMost of the kids at the school were children of tobacco farmers,\u201d Bays said, \u201cor just poor kids living in the mouth of the holler.\u201d Huang arrived with the school year already in session, and Bays remembers the principal introducing an undersized Asian immigrant with long hair and heavily accented English. \u201cHe was a perfect target,\u201d Bays said.\u201cBut I use all of them!\u201dCartoon by Ali SolomonCopy link to cartoonCopy link to cartoonLink copiedShopShopHuang was relentlessly bullied. \u201cThe way you described Chinese people back then was \u2018Chinks,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Huang told me, with no apparent emotion. \u201cWe were called that every day.\u201d To get to school, Huang had to cross a rickety pedestrian footbridge over a river. \u201cThese swinging bridges, they were very high,\u201d Bays said. \u201cIt was old planks, and most of them were missing.\u201d Sometimes, when Huang was crossing the bridge, the local boys would grab the ropes and try to dislodge him. \u201cSomehow it never seemed to affect him,\u201d Bays said. \u201cHe just shook it off.\u201d By the end of the school year, Bays told me, Huang was leading those same kids on adventures into the woods. Bays recalled how carefully Huang stepped around the missing planks. \u201cActually, it looked like he was having fun,\u201d he said.Huang credits his time at Oneida with building resiliency. \u201cBack then, there wasn\u2019t a counsellor to talk to,\u201d he told me. \u201cBack then, you just had to toughen up and move on.\u201d In 2019, he donated a building to the school, and talked fondly of the (now gone) footbridge, neglecting to mention the bullies who had tried to toss him off it.After a couple of years, Huang\u2019s parents secured entry to the United States, settling in Oregon, and the brothers reunited with them. Huang excelled in high school, and was a nationally ranked table-tennis player. He belonged to the school\u2019s math, computer, and science clubs, skipped two grades, and graduated when he was sixteen. \u201cI did not have a girlfriend,\u201d he said.Huang attended Oregon State University, where he majored in electrical engineering. His lab partner in his introductory classes was Lori Mills, an earnest, nerdy undergraduate with curly brown hair. \u201cThere were, like, two hundred and fifty kids in electrical engineering, and maybe three girls,\u201d Huang told me. Competition broke out among the male undergraduates for Mills\u2019s attention, and Huang felt that he was at a disadvantage. \u201cI was the youngest kid in the class,\u201d he said. \u201cI looked like I was about twelve.\u201dEvery weekend, Huang would call Mills and pester her to do homework with him. \u201cI tried to impress her\u2014not with my looks, of course, but with my strong capability to complete homework,\u201d he said. Mills accepted, and, after six months of homework, Huang worked up the courage to ask her out on a date. She accepted that offer, too.Following graduation, Huang and Mills found work in Silicon Valley as microchip designers. (\u201cShe actually made more than me,\u201d Huang said.) The two got married, and within a few years Mills had left the workforce to bring up their children. By then, Huang was running his own division, and attending graduate school at Stanford by night. He founded Nvidia in 1993, with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, two veteran microchip designers. Although Huang, then thirty, was younger than Malachowsky and Priem, both felt that he was ready to be C.E.O. \u201cHe was a fast learner,\u201d Malachowsky said.Malachowsky and Priem were looking to design a graphics chip, which they hoped would make competitors, in Priem\u2019s words, \u201cgreen with envy.\u201d They called their company NVision, until they learned that the name was taken by a manufacturer of toilet paper. Huang suggested Nvidia, riffing on the Latin word invidia, meaning \u201cenvy.\u201d He selected the Denny\u2019s as a venue to organize the business because it was quieter than home and had cheap coffee\u2014and also because of his experience working for the restaurant chain in Oregon in the nineteen-eighties. \u201cI find that I think best when I\u2019m under adversity,\u201d Huang said. \u201cMy heart rate actually goes down. Anyone who\u2019s dealt with rush hour in a restaurant knows what I\u2019m talking about.\u201dHuang liked video games and thought that there was a market for better graphics chips. Instead of drawing pixels by hand, artists were starting to assemble three-dimensional polygons out of shapes known as \u201cprimitives,\u201d saving time and effort but requiring new chips. Nvidia\u2019s competitors\u2019 primitives used triangles, but Huang and his co-founders decided to use quadrilaterals instead. This was a mistake, and it nearly sank the company: soon after the release of Nvidia\u2019s first product, Microsoft announced that its graphics software would support only triangles.Short on money, Huang decided that his only hope was to use the conventional triangle approach and try to beat the competition to market. In 1996, he laid off more than half the hundred people working at Nvidia, then bet the company\u2019s remaining funds on a production run of untested microchips that he wasn\u2019t sure would work. \u201cIt was fifty-fifty,\u201d Huang told me, \u201cbut we were going out of business anyway.\u201dWhen the product, known as RIVA 128, hit stores, Nvidia had enough money to meet only one month of payroll. But the gamble paid off, and Nvidia sold a million RIVAs in four months. Huang encouraged his employees to continue shipping products with a sense of desperation, and for years to come he opened staff presentations with the words \u201cOur company is thirty days from going out of business.\u201d The phrase remains the unofficial corporate motto.At the center of Nvidia\u2019s headquarters, in Santa Clara, are two enormous buildings, each in the shape of a triangle with its corners trimmed. This shape is replicated in miniature throughout the building interiors, from the couches and the carpets to the splash guards in the urinals. Nvidia\u2019s \u201cspaceships,\u201d as employees call the two buildings, are cavernous and filled with light, but eerie, and mostly empty; post-Covid, only about a third of the workforce shows up on any given day. Employee demographics are \u201cdiverse,\u201d sort of\u2014I would guess, based on a visual survey of the cafeteria at lunchtime, that about a third of the staff is South Asian, a third is East Asian, and a third is white. The workers are overwhelmingly male.Even before the run-up in the stock price, employee surveys ranked Nvidia as one of America\u2019s best places to work. Each building has a bar at the top, with regular happy hours, and workers are encouraged to treat their offices as flexible spaces in which to eat, code, and socialize. Nevertheless, the buildings\u2019 interiors are immaculate\u2014Nvidia tracks employees throughout the day with video cameras and A.I. If an employee eats a meal at a conference table, the A.I. can dispatch a janitor within an hour to clean up. At Denny\u2019s, Huang told me to expect a world in which robots would fade into the background, like household appliances. \u201cIn the future, everything that moves will be autonomous,\u201d he said.The only people I saw at Nvidia who didn\u2019t look happy were the quality-control technicians. In windowless laboratories underneath the north-campus bar, pallid young men wearing earplugs and T-shirts pushed Nvidia\u2019s microchips to the brink of failure. The racket was unbearable, a constant whine of high-pitched fans trying to cool overheating silicon circuits. It is these chips which have made the A.I. revolution possible.In standard computer architecture, a microchip known as a \u201ccentral processing unit\u201d does most of the work. Coders create programs, and those programs bring mathematical problems to the C.P.U., which produces one solution at a time. For decades, the major manufacturer of C.P.U.s was Intel, and Intel has tried to force Nvidia out of existence several times. \u201cI don\u2019t go anywhere near Intel,\u201d Huang told me, describing their Tom and Jerry relationship. \u201cWhenever they come near us, I pick up my chips and run.\u201dNvidia has embraced an alternative approach. In 1999, the company, shortly after going public, introduced a graphics card called GeForce, which Dan Vivoli, the company\u2019s head of marketing, called a \u201cgraphics-processing unit.\u201d (\u201cWe invented the category so we could be the leader in it,\u201d Vivoli said.) Unlike general-purpose C.P.U.s, the G.P.U. breaks complex mathematical tasks apart into small calculations, then processes them all at once, in a method known as parallel computing. A C.P.U. functions like a delivery truck, dropping off one package at a time; a G.P.U. is more like a fleet of motorcycles spreading across a city.The GeForce line was a success. Its popularity was driven by the Quake video-game series, which used parallel computing to render monsters that players could shoot with a grenade launcher. (Quake II was released when I was a freshman in college, and cost me years of my life.) The Quake series also featured a \u201cdeathmatch\u201d mode for multiplayer combat, and PC gamers, looking to gain an edge, bought new GeForce cards every time they were upgraded. In 2000, Ian Buck, a graduate student studying computer graphics at Stanford, chained thirty-two GeForce cards together to play Quake using eight projectors. \u201cIt was the first gaming rig in 8K resolution, and it took up an entire wall,\u201d Buck told me. \u201cIt was beautiful.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t do it. They try to fill you up on breadsticks so that by the time you go into the therapist\u2019s office you feel horrible.\u201dCartoon by Drew DernavichCopy link to cartoonCopy link to cartoonLink copiedShopShopBuck wondered if the GeForce cards might be useful for tasks other than launching grenades at his friends. The cards came with a primitive programming tool called a shader. With a grant from DARPA, the Department of Defense\u2019s research arm, Buck hacked the shaders to access the parallel-computing circuits below, repurposing the GeForce into a low-budget supercomputer. Soon, Buck was working for Huang.Buck is intense and balding, and he radiates intelligence. He is a computer-science hot-rodder who has spent the past twenty years testing the limits of Nvidia chips. Human beings \u201cthink linearly. You give instructions to someone on how to get from here to Starbucks, and you give them individual steps,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t give them instructions on how to get to any Starbucks location from anywhere. It\u2019s just hard to think that way, in parallel.\u201dSince 2004, Buck has overseen the development of Nvidia\u2019s supercomputing software package, known as CUDA. Huang\u2019s vision was to enable CUDA to work on every GeForce card. \u201cWe were democratizing supercomputing,\u201d Huang said.As Buck developed the software, Nvidia\u2019s hardware team began allocating space on the microchips for supercomputing operations. The chips contained billions of electronic transistors, which routed electricity through labyrinthine circuits to complete calculations at extraordinary speed. Arjun Prabhu, Nvidia\u2019s lead chip engineer, compared microchip design to urban planning, with different zones of the chip dedicated to different tasks. As Tetris players do with falling blocks, Prabhu will sometimes see transistors in his sleep. \u201cI\u2019ve often had it where the best ideas happen on a Friday night, when I\u2019m literally dreaming about it,\u201d Prabhu said.When CUDA was released, in late 2006, Wall Street reacted with dismay. Huang was bringing supercomputing to the masses, but the masses had shown no indication that they wanted such a thing. \u201cThey were spending a fortune on this new chip architecture,\u201d Ben Gilbert, the co-host of \u201cAcquired,\u201d a popular Silicon Valley podcast, said. \u201cThey were spending many billions targeting an obscure corner of academic and scientific computing, which was not a large market at the time\u2014certainly less than the billions they were pouring in.\u201d Huang argued that the simple existence of CUDA would enlarge the supercomputing sector. This view was not widely held, and by the end of 2008 Nvidia\u2019s stock price had declined by seventy per cent.In speeches, Huang has cited a visit to the office of Ting-Wai Chiu, a professor of physics at National Taiwan University, as giving him confidence during this time. Chiu, seeking to simulate the evolution of matter following the Big Bang, had constructed a homemade supercomputer in a laboratory adjacent to his office. Huang arrived to find the lab littered with GeForce boxes and the computer cooled by oscillating desk fans. \u201cJensen is a visionary,\u201d Chiu told me. \u201cHe made my life\u2019s work possible.\u201dChiu was the model customer, but there weren\u2019t many like him. Downloads of CUDA hit a peak in 2009, then declined for three years. Board members worried that Nvidia\u2019s depressed stock price would make it a target for corporate raiders. \u201cWe did everything we could to protect the company against an activist shareholder who might come in and try to break it up,\u201d Jim Gaither, a longtime board member, told me. Dawn Hudson, a former N.F.L. marketing executive, joined the board in 2013. \u201cIt was a distinctly flat, stagnant company,\u201d she said.In marketing CUDA, Nvidia had sought a range of customers, including stock traders, oil prospectors, and molecular biologists. At one point, the company signed a deal with General Mills to simulate the thermal physics of cooking frozen pizza. One application that Nvidia spent little time thinking about was artificial intelligence. There didn\u2019t seem to be much of a market.At the beginning of the twenty-tens, A.I. was a neglected discipline. Progress in basic tasks such as image recognition and speech recognition had seen only halting progress. Within this unpopular academic field, an even less popular subfield solved problems using \u201cneural networks\u201d\u2014computing structures inspired by the human brain. Many computer scientists considered neural networks to be discredited. \u201cI was discouraged by my advisers from working on neural nets,\u201d Catanzaro, the deep-learning researcher, told me, \u201cbecause, at the time, they were considered to be outdated, and they didn\u2019t work.\u201dCatanzaro described the researchers who continued to work on neural nets as \u201cprophets in the wilderness.\u201d One of those prophets was Geoffrey Hinton, a professor at the University of Toronto. In 2009, Hinton\u2019s research group used Nvidia\u2019s CUDA platform to train a neural network to recognize human speech. He was surprised by the quality of the results, which he presented at a conference later that year. He then reached out to Nvidia. \u201cI sent an e-mail saying, \u2018Look, I just told a thousand machine-learning researchers they should go and buy Nvidia cards. Can you send me a free one?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Hinton told me. \u201cThey said no.\u201dDespite the snub, Hinton encouraged his students to use CUDA, including a Ukrainian-born prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of his named Alex Krizhevsky, who Hinton thought was perhaps the finest programmer he\u2019d ever met. In 2012, Krizhevsky and his research partner, Ilya Sutskever, working on a tight budget, bought two GeForce cards from Amazon. Krizhevsky then began training a visual-recognition neural network on Nvidia\u2019s parallel-computing platform, feeding it millions of images in a single week. \u201cHe had the two G.P.U. boards whirring in his bedroom,\u201d Hinton said. \u201cActually, it was his parents who paid for the quite considerable electricity costs.\u201dSutskever and Krizhevsky were astonished by the cards\u2019 capabilities. Earlier that year, researchers at Google had trained a neural net that identified videos of cats, an effort that required some sixteen thousand C.P.U.s. Sutskever and Krizhevsky had produced world-class results with just two Nvidia circuit boards. \u201cG.P.U.s showed up and it felt like a miracle,\u201d Sutskever told me.AlexNet, the neural network that Krizhevsky trained in his parents\u2019 house, can now be mentioned alongside the Wright Flyer and the Edison bulb. In 2012, Krizhevsky entered AlexNet into the annual ImageNet visual-recognition contest; neural networks were unpopular enough at the time that he was the only contestant to use this technique. AlexNet scored so well in the competition that the organizers initially wondered if Krizhevsky had somehow cheated. \u201cThat was a kind of Big Bang moment,\u201d Hinton said. \u201cThat was the paradigm shift.\u201dIn the decade since Krizhevsky\u2019s nine-page description of AlexNet\u2019s architecture was published, it has been cited more than a hundred thousand times, making it one of the most important papers in the history of computer science. (AlexNet correctly identified photographs of a scooter, a leopard, and a container ship, among other things.) Krizhevsky pioneered a number of important programming techniques, but his key finding was that a specialized G.P.U. could train neural networks up to a hundred times faster than a general-purpose C.P.U. \u201cTo do machine learning without CUDA would have just been too much trouble,\u201d Hinton said.Within a couple of years, every entrant in the ImageNet competition was using a neural network. By the mid-twenty-tens, neural networks trained on G.P.U.s were identifying images with ninety-six-per-cent accuracy, surpassing humans. Huang\u2019s ten-year crusade to democratize supercomputing had succeeded. \u201cThe fact that they can solve computer vision, which is completely unstructured, leads to the question \u2018What else can you teach it?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Huang said to me.The answer seemed to be: everything. Huang concluded that neural networks would revolutionize society, and that he could use CUDA to corner the market on the necessary hardware. He announced that he was once again betting the company. \u201cHe sent out an e-mail on Friday evening saying everything is going to deep learning, and that we were no longer a graphics company,\u201d Greg Estes, a vice-president at Nvidia, told me. \u201cBy Monday morning, we were an A.I. company. Literally, it was that fast.\u201d\u201cHey! No bootleg recordings of the show!\u201dCartoon by Pia Guerra and Ian BoothbyCopy link to cartoonCopy link to cartoonLink copiedShopShopAround the time Huang sent the e-mail, he approached Catanzaro, Nvidia\u2019s leading A.I. researcher, with a thought experiment. \u201cHe told me to imagine he\u2019d marched all eight thousand of Nvidia\u2019s employees into the parking lot,\u201d Catanzaro said. \u201cThen he told me I was free to select anyone from the parking lot to join my team.\u201dHuang rarely gives interviews, and tends to deflect attention from himself. \u201cI don\u2019t really think I\u2019ve done anything special here,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly my team.\u201d (\u201cHe\u2019s irreplaceable,\u201d the board member Jim Gaither told me.) \u201cI\u2019m not sure why I was selected to be the C.E.O.,\u201d Huang said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any particular drive.\u201d (\u201cHe was determined to run a business by the time he was thirty,\u201d his co-founder Chris Malachowsky told me.) \u201cI\u2019m not a great speaker, really, because I\u2019m quite introverted,\u201d Huang said. (\u201cHe\u2019s a great entertainer,\u201d his friend Ben Bays told me.) \u201cI only have one superpower\u2014homework,\u201d Huang said. (\u201cHe can master any subject over a weekend,\u201d Dwight Diercks, Nvidia\u2019s head of software, said.)Huang prefers an agile corporate structure, with no fixed divisions or hierarchy. Instead, employees submit a weekly list of the five most important things they are working on. Brevity is encouraged, as Huang surveys these e-mails late into the night. Wandering through Nvidia\u2019s giant campus, he often stops by the desks of junior employees and quizzes them on their work. A visit from Huang can turn a cubicle into an interrogation chamber. \u201cTypically, in Silicon Valley, you can get away with fudging it,\u201d the industry analyst Hans Mosesmann told me. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that with Jensen. He will kind of lose his temper.\u201dHuang communicates to his staff by writing hundreds of e-mails per day, often only a few words long. One executive compared the e-mails to haiku, another to ransom notes. Huang has also developed a set of management aphorisms that he refers to regularly. When scheduling, Huang asks employees to consider \u201cthe speed of light.\u201d This does not simply mean to move quickly; rather, employees are to consider the absolute fastest a task could conceivably be accomplished, then work backward toward an achievable goal. They are also encouraged to pursue the \u201czero-billion-dollar market.\u201d This refers to exploratory products, such as CUDA, which not only do not have competitors but don\u2019t even have obvious customers. (Huang sometimes reminded me of Kevin Costner\u2019s character in \u201cField of Dreams,\u201d who builds a baseball diamond in the middle of an Iowa cornfield, then waits for players and fans to arrive.)Perhaps Huang\u2019s most radical belief is that \u201cfailure must be shared.\u201d In the early two-thousands, Nvidia shipped a faulty graphics card with a loud, overactive fan. Instead of firing the card\u2019s product managers, Huang arranged a meeting in which the managers presented, to a few hundred people, every decision they had made that led to the fiasco. (Nvidia also distributed to the press a satirical video, starring the product managers, in which the card was repurposed as a leaf blower.) Presenting one\u2019s failures to an audience has become a beloved ritual at Nvidia, but such corporate struggle sessions are not for everyone. \u201cYou can kind of see right away who is going to last here and who is not,\u201d Diercks said. \u201cIf someone starts getting defensive, I know they\u2019re not going to make it.\u201dHuang\u2019s employees sometimes complain of his mercurial personality. \u201cIt\u2019s really about what\u2019s going on in my brain versus what\u2019s coming out of my mouth,\u201d Huang told me. \u201cWhen the mismatch is great, then it comes out as anger.\u201d Even when he\u2019s calm, Huang\u2019s intensity can be overwhelming. \u201cInteracting with him is kind of like sticking your finger in the electric socket,\u201d one employee said. Still, Nvidia has high employee retention. Jeff Fisher, who runs the company\u2019s consumer division, was one of the first employees. He\u2019s now extremely wealthy, but he continues to work. \u201cMany of us are financial volunteers at this point,\u201d Fisher said, \u201cbut we believe in the mission.\u201d Both of Huang\u2019s children pursued jobs in the hospitality industry when they were in their twenties; following years of paternal browbeating, they now have careers at Nvidia. Catanzaro at one point left for another company. A few years later, he returned. \u201cJensen is not an easy person to get along with all of the time,\u201d Catanzaro said. \u201cI\u2019ve been afraid of Jensen sometimes, but I also know that he loves me.\u201dAfter the success of AlexNet, venture capitalists began shovelling money at A.I. \u201cWe\u2019ve been investing in a lot of startups applying deep learning to many areas, and every single one effectively comes in building on Nvidia\u2019s platform,\u201d Marc Andreessen, of the firm Andreessen Horowitz, said in 2016. Around that time, Nvidia delivered its first dedicated A.I. supercomputer, the DGX-1, to a research group at OpenAI. Huang himself took the computer to OpenAI\u2019s offices; Elon Musk, then the chairman, opened the package with a box cutter.In 2017, researchers at Google introduced a new architecture for neural-net training called a transformer. The following year, researchers at OpenAI used Google\u2019s framework to build the first \u201cgenerative pre-trained transformer,\u201d or G.P.T. The G.P.T. models were trained on Nvidia supercomputers, absorbing an enormous corpus of text and learning how to make humanlike connections. In late 2022, after several versions, ChatGPT was released to the public.Since then, Nvidia has been overwhelmed with customer requests. The company\u2019s latest A.I.-training module, known as the DGX H100, is a three-hundred-and-seventy-pound metal box that can cost up to five hundred thousand dollars. It is currently on back order for months. The DGX H100 runs five times as fast as the hardware that trained ChatGPT, and could have trained AlexNet in less than a minute. Nvidia is projected to sell half a million of the devices by the end of the year.The more processing power one applies to a neural net, the more sophisticated its output becomes. For the most advanced A.I. models, Nvidia sells a rack of dozens of DGX H100s. If that isn\u2019t enough, Nvidia will arrange these computers like library stacks, filling a data center with tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of supercomputing equipment. There is no obvious limit to the A.I.\u2019s capabilities. \u201cIf you allow yourself to believe that an artificial neuron is like a biological neuron, then it\u2019s like you\u2019re training brains,\u201d Sutskever told me. \u201cThey should do everything we can do.\u201d I was initially skeptical of Sutskever\u2019s claim\u2014I hadn\u2019t learned to identify cats by looking at ten million reference images, and I hadn\u2019t learned to write by scanning the complete works of humanity. But the fossil record shows that the nervous system first developed several hundred million years ago, and has been growing more sophisticated ever since. \u201cThere have been a lot of living creatures on this earth for a long time that have learned a lot of things,\u201d Catanzaro said, \u201cand a lot of that is written down in physical structures in your brain.\u201dThe latest A.I.s have powers that surprise even their creators, and no one quite knows what they are capable of. (GPT-4, ChatGPT\u2019s successor, can transform a sketch on a napkin into a functioning Web site, and has scored in the eighty-eighth percentile on the LSAT.) In the next few years, Nvidia\u2019s hardware, by accelerating evolution to the speed of a computer-clock cycle, will train all manner of similar A.I. models. Some will manage investment portfolios; some will fly drones. Some will steal your likeness and reproduce it; some will mimic the voices of the dead. Some will act as brains for autonomous robots; some will create genetically tailored drugs. Some will write music; some will write poetry. If we aren\u2019t careful, someday soon, one will outsmart us.The gross profit margin on Nvidia\u2019s equipment approaches seventy per cent. This ratio attracts competition in the manner that chum attracts sharks. Google and Tesla are developing A.I.-training hardware, as are numerous startups. One of those startups is Cerebras, which makes a \u201cmega-chip\u201d the size of a dinner plate. \u201cThey\u2019re just extorting their customers, and nobody will say it out loud,\u201d Cerebras\u2019s C.E.O., Andrew Feldman, said of Nvidia. (Huang countered that a well-trained A.I. model can reduce customers\u2019 overhead in other business lines. \u201cThe more you buy, the more you save,\u201d he said.)Nvidia\u2019s fiercest rival is Advanced Micro Devices. Since 2014, A.M.D. has been run by Lisa Su, another gifted engineer who immigrated to the United States from Taiwan at a young age. In the years since Su became the head of the company, A.M.D.\u2019s stock price has risen thirtyfold, making her second only to Huang as the most successful semiconductor C.E.O. of this era. Su is also Huang\u2019s first cousin once removed.Huang told me that he didn\u2019t know Su growing up; he met her only after she was named C.E.O. \u201cShe\u2019s terrific,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not very competitive.\u201d (Nvidia employees can recite the relative market share of Nvidia\u2019s and A.M.D.\u2019s graphics cards from memory.) Their personalities are different: Su is reserved and stoic; Huang is temperamental and expressive. \u201cShe has a great poker face,\u201d Mosesmann, the industry analyst, said. \u201cJensen does not, although he\u2019d still find a way to beat you.\u201dSu likes to tail the incumbent, and wait for it to falter. Unlike Huang, she is not afraid to compete with Intel, and, in the past decade, A.M.D. has captured a large portion of Intel\u2019s C.P.U. business, a feat that analysts once regarded as impossible. Recently, Su has turned her attention to the A.I. market. \u201cJensen does not want to lose. He\u2019s a driven guy,\u201d Forrest Norrod, the executive overseeing A.M.D.\u2019s effort, said. \u201cBut we think we can compete with Nvidia.\u201dOn a gloomy Friday afternoon in September, I drove to an upscale resort overlooking the Pacific to watch Huang be publicly interviewed by Hao Ko, the lead architect of Nvidia\u2019s headquarters. I arrived early to find the two men facing the ocean, engaged in quiet conversation. They were dressed nearly identically, in black leather jackets, black jeans, and black shoes, although Ko was much taller. I was hoping to catch some candid statements about the future of computing; instead, I got a six-minute roast of Ko\u2019s wardrobe. \u201cLook at this guy!\u201d Huang said. \u201cHe\u2019s dressed just like me. He\u2019s copying me\u2014which is smart\u2014only his pants have too many pockets.\u201d Ko gave a nervous chuckle, and looked down at his designer jeans, which did have a few more zippered pockets than function would strictly demand. \u201cSimplify, man!\u201d Huang said, before turning to me. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s dressed like me. I taught this guy everything he knows.\u201d (Huang\u2019s wardrobe is widely imitated, and earlier this year he was featured in the Style section of the Times.)\u201cI\u2019m so happy to host you! Here\u2019s a spare towel and a guest room with no intuitive place to hang it.\u201dCartoon by Asher PerlmanCopy link to cartoonCopy link to cartoonLink copiedShopShopThe interview was sponsored by Gensler, one of the world\u2019s leading corporate-design firms, and there were several hundred architects in attendance. As the event approached, Huang increased the intensity of his shtick, cracking a series of weak jokes and rocking back and forth on his feet. Huang does dozens of speaking gigs a year, and had given a talk to a different audience earlier that day, but I realized that he was nervous. \u201cI hate public speaking,\u201d he said.Onstage, though, he seemed relaxed and confident. He explained that the skylights on the undulating roof of his headquarters were positioned to illuminate the building while blocking direct sunlight. To calculate the design, Huang had strapped Ko into a virtual-reality headset and then attached the headset to a rack of Nvidia G.P.U.s, so that Ko could track the flow of light. \u201cThis is the world\u2019s first building that needed a supercomputer to be possible,\u201d Huang said.Following the interview, Huang took questions from the audience, including one about the potential risks of A.I. \u201cThere\u2019s the doomsday A.I.s\u2014the A.I. that somehow jumped out of the computer and consumes tons and tons of information and learns all by itself, reshaping its attitude and sensibility, and starts making decisions on its own, including pressing buttons of all kinds,\u201d Huang said, pantomiming pressing the buttons in the air. The room grew very quiet. \u201cNo A.I. should be able to learn without a human in the loop,\u201d he said. One architect asked when A.I. might start to figure things out on its own. \u201cReasoning capability is two to three years out,\u201d Huang said. A low murmur went through the crowd.Afterward, I caught up with Ko. Like a lot of Huang\u2019s jokes, the crack about teaching Ko \u201ceverything he knows\u201d contained a pointed truth. Ko hadn\u2019t yet made partner at Gensler when Huang chose him for the Nvidia headquarters, bypassing Ko\u2019s boss. I asked Ko why Huang had done so. \u201cYou probably have heard stories,\u201d Ko said. \u201cHe can be very tough. He will undress you.\u201d Huang had no architecture experience, but he would often tell Ko that he was wrong about the building\u2019s design. \u201cI would say ninety per cent of architects would battle back,\u201d Ko said. \u201cI\u2019m more of a listener.\u201dKo recalled Huang challenging Nvidia\u2019s engineering staff on the speed of the V.R. headset. The headset originally took five hours to render design changes; at Huang\u2019s urging, the engineers got the speed down to ten seconds. \u201cHe was tough on them, but there was a logic to it,\u201d Ko said. \u201cIf the headset took five hours, I\u2019d probably settle on whatever shade of green looked adequate. If it took ten seconds, I\u2019d take the time to pick the best shade of green there was.\u201dThe buildings\u2019 design won several awards and made Ko\u2019s career. Still, Ko recalled his time on the project with mixed emotions. \u201cThe place was finished, it looks amazing, we\u2019re doing the tour, and he\u2019s questioning me about the placement of the water fountains,\u201d Ko said. \u201cHe was upset because they were next to the bathrooms! That\u2019s required by code, and this is a billion-dollar building! But he just couldn\u2019t let it go.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m never satisfied,\u201d Huang told me. \u201cNo matter what it is, I only see imperfections.\u201dI asked Huang if he was taking any gambles today that resemble the one he took twenty years ago. He responded immediately with a single word: \u201cOmniverse.\u201d Inspired by the V.R.-architecture gambit, the Omniverse is Nvidia\u2019s attempt to simulate the real world at an extraordinary level of fine-grained detail. Huang has described it as an \u201cindustrial metaverse.\u201dSince 2018, Nvidia\u2019s graphics cards have featured \u201cray-tracing,\u201d which simulates the way that light bounces off objects to create photorealistic effects. Inside a triangle of frosted glass in Nvidia\u2019s executive meeting center, a product-demo specialist showed me a three-dimensional rendering of a gleaming Japanese ramen shop. As the demo cycled through different points of view, light reflected off the metal counter and steam rose from a bubbling pot of broth. There was nothing to indicate that it wasn\u2019t real.The specialist then showed me \u201cDiane,\u201d a hyper-realistic digital avatar that speaks five languages. A powerful generative A.I. had studied millions of videos of people to create a composite entity. It was the imperfections that were most affecting\u2014Diane had blackheads on her nose and trace hairs on her upper lip. The only clue that Diane wasn\u2019t truly human was an uncanny shimmer in the whites of her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re working on that,\u201d the specialist said.Huang\u2019s vision is to unify Nvidia\u2019s computer-graphics research with its generative-A.I. research. As he sees it, image-generation A.I.s will soon be so sophisticated that they will be able to render three-dimensional, inhabitable worlds and populate them with realistic-seeming people. At the same time, language-processing A.I.s will be able to interpret voice commands immediately. (\u201cThe programming language of the future will be \u2018human,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Huang has said.) Once the technologies are united with ray-tracing, users will be able to speak whole universes into existence. Huang hopes to use such \u201cdigital twins\u201d of our own world to safely train robots and self-driving cars. Combined with V.R. technology, the Omniverse could also allow users to inhabit bespoke realities.I felt dizzy leaving the product demo. I thought of science fiction; I thought of the Book of Genesis. I sat on a triangular couch with the corners trimmed, and struggled to imagine the future that my daughter will inhabit. Nvidia executives were building the Manhattan Project of computer science, but when I questioned them about the wisdom of creating superhuman intelligence they looked at me as if I were questioning the utility of the washing machine. I had wondered aloud if an A.I. might someday kill someone. \u201cEh, electricity kills people every year,\u201d Catanzaro said. I wondered if it might eliminate art. \u201cIt will make art better!\u201d Diercks said. \u201cIt will make you much better at your job.\u201d I wondered if someday soon an A.I. might become self-aware. \u201cIn order for you to be a creature, you have to be conscious. You have to have some knowledge of self, right?\u201d Huang said. \u201cI don\u2019t know where that could happen.\u201d\u00a0\u2666Published in the print edition of the December 4, 2023, issue, with the headline \u201cThe Chosen Chip.\u201dNew Yorker FavoritesThe Vogue model who became a war photographer.Can reading make you happier?Sentenced to life for an accident miles away.Why walking helps us think.The perils of Pearl and Olga.The resurgent appeal of Stevie Nicks.Fiction by Lore Segal: \u201cLadies\u2019 Lunch\u201dSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker.Stephen Witt published \u201cHow Music Got Free\u201d in 2015.Read MoreLetter from SwedenZyn and the New Nicotine Gold RushWhite snus pouches were designed to help Swedish women quit cigarettes.

They will now be able to access BioNeMo to build or customize digital biology foundation models with proprietary data, scaling up model training and deployment using NVIDIA GPU-accelerated cloud servers on AWS.\nTechbio innovators including Alchemab Therapeutics, Basecamp Research, Character Biosciences, Evozyne, Etcembly and LabGenius are among the AWS users already using BioNeMo for generative AI-accelerated drug discovery and development. This collaboration gives them more ways to rapidly scale up cloud computing resources for developing generative AI models trained on biomolecular data.\nThis announcement extends NVIDIA\u2019s existing healthcare-focused offerings available on AWS \u2014 NVIDIA MONAI for medical imaging workflows and NVIDIA Parabricks for accelerated genomics.\nNew to AWS: NVIDIA BioNeMo Advances Generative AI for Drug Discovery\nBioNeMo is a domain-specific framework for digital biology generative AI, including pretrained large language models (LLMs), data loaders and optimized training recipes that can help advance computer-aided drug discovery by speeding target identification, protein structure prediction and drug candidate screening.\nDrug discovery teams can use their proprietary data to build or optimize models with BioNeMo and run them on cloud-based high performance computing clusters.\nOne of these models, ESM-2 \u2014 a powerful LLM that supports protein structure prediction \u2014\u00a0 achieves almost linear scaling on 256 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs. Researchers can scale to 512 H100 GPUs to complete training in a few days instead of a month, the training time published in the original paper.\nDevelopers can train ESM-2 at scale using checkpoints of 650 million or 3 billion parameters. Additional AI models supported in the BioNeMo training framework include small-molecule generative model MegaMolBART and protein sequence generation model ProtT5.\nBioNeMo\u2019s pretrained models and optimized training recipes \u2014 which are available using self-managed services like AWS ParallelCluster and Amazon ECS as well as integrated, managed services through NVIDIA DGX Cloud and Amazon SageMaker \u2014 can help R&D teams build foundation models that can explore more drug candidates, optimize wet lab experimentation and find promising clinical candidates faster.\nAlso Available on AWS: NVIDIA Clara for Medical Imaging and Genomics\nProject MONAI, cofounded and enterprise-supported by NVIDIA to support medical imaging workflows, has been downloaded more than 1.8 million times and is available for deployment on AWS. Developers can harness their proprietary healthcare datasets already stored on AWS cloud resources to rapidly annotate and build AI models for medical imaging.\nThese models, trained on NVIDIA GPU-powered Amazon EC2 instances, can be used for interactive annotation and fine-tuning for segmentation, classification, registration and detection tasks in medical imaging. Developers can also harness MRI image synthesis models available in MONAI to augment training datasets.\nTo accelerate genomics pipelines, Parabricks\u00a0enables variant calling on a whole human genome in around 15 minutes, compared to a day on a CPU-only system. On AWS, developers can quickly scale up to process large amounts of genomic data across multiple GPU nodes.\nMore than a dozen Parabricks workflows are available on AWS HealthOmics as Ready2Run workflows, which enable customers to easily run pre-built pipelines.\nGet started with NVIDIA Clara on AWS to accelerate AI workflows for drug discovery, genomics and medical imaging.\nSubscribe to NVIDIA healthcare news.\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | DGX Cloud | Genomics | Healthcare and Life Sciences | NVIDIA Clara | NVIDIA NeMo | Science | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In the cinematic campaign, Captain Price and Task Force 141 face off against the ultimate threat, the ultranationalist war criminal Vladimir Makarov, who\u2019s extending his grasp across the world, causing Task Force 141 to fight like never before. Once you\u2019ve dug into the action-packed single-player campaign, head online to defeat Zombies in an exciting open-world co-op experience that takes the Zombies mode everyone knows and loves to the next level. If you prefer Multiplayer, dip into the selection of Core Multiplayer maps from the 16 iconic launch maps of 2009\u2019s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 that are being brought over and modernized for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.\nIn each mode, GeForce gamers can accelerate frame rates with AI-powered DLSS, or maximize image quality with DLAA. And gameplay gets even more responsive thanks to the day-one inclusion of NVIDIA Reflex in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiply Performance With NVIDIA DLSS 3\nGeForce RTX 40 Series gamers can multiply performance in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III with NVIDIA DLSS 3, while all other GeForce RTX players can accelerate frame rates with DLSS 2. Powered by new hardware capabilities of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture used in GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, DLSS 3 generates entirely new high quality frames, rather than just pixels.\nThrough a process detailed in full in our NVIDIA DLSS 3 article, DLSS 3 combines DLSS Super Resolution technology and DLSS Frame Generation to reconstruct 7 out of every 8 of the displayed pixels, multiplying performance even in CPU bound scenarios.\nIn Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III\u2019s built-in benchmark, cranking all settings to max at 4K sees performance increase by 1.8X on average when activating DLSS 3, enabling max setting gameplay at over 100 FPS on the GeForce RTX 4070, and at up to 200 FPS on the GeForce RTX 4090:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEvery frame of action counts in Call of Duty. Once again, NVIDIA introduces major innovations with DLSS 3 Frame Generation. Along with DLSS Super Resolution and Reflex, it allows us to bring faster and smoother gameplay to the PC version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.\u201d - Marc-Alexandre Milot, Design Director, Beenox\u00a0\nAt 1440p, DLSS 3 boosts performance by 1.6X, enabling 100 FPS+ gameplay on the entire lineup of GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards, and up to 240 FPS gameplay on the GeForce RTX 4090:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 1080p, DLSS 3\u2019s 1.5X performance boost enables you to hit esports frame rates on all GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, and allows you to max out the highest refresh rate displays on the GeForce RTX 4090, which achieves a 300 FPS result:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn GeForce RTX 40 Series laptops, DLSS 3 increases performance by 1.6X at both 1080p and 1440p, enabling all owners to game at fast frame rates, and at up to 230 FPS on GeForce RTX 4090 laptops:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith such fast frame rates on so many GPUs, you may want to supercharge image quality with NVIDIA DLAA, an AI-based anti-aliasing mode that utilizes the same technology developed for DLSS. DLAA uses a native resolution image to maximize image quality, rather than boosting performance, and in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III DLAA can be combined with DLSS Frame Generation for the highest possible image quality, and excellent performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III System Requirements\nAs you can see above, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III runs particularly well on GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards, and is even faster when DLSS 3 is enabled. To get the rest of your system ready for the game, Activision has shared their system requirements for a range of experiences, from Minimum to Ultra:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake Gameplay Even More Responsive With Reflex\nReducing system latency allows you to unleash your skill in competitive multiplayer games, and other genres, too. Sometimes referred to as \u201csystem lag\u201d, system latency is the time it takes for an action to occur in-game, and can also affect how fast you see enemies, giving you additional time to shoot first.\nNVIDIA Reflex greatly reduces system latency, removing a major impediment to your competitiveness. Available in over 80 games, including 9 out of 10 of the most-played competitive shooters, Reflex is used by over 50 million users each month, and with there being no downsides to its use, it\u2019s a must-have for gamers wanting the most responsive experience possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex has helped GeForce gamers reduce system latency in Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Call of Duty: Vanguard, Modern Warfare, Modern Warfare II, and Call of Duty: Warzone\u2122. In Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Reflex reduces system latency by up to 28%.\nTogether with the high frame rates delivered by DLSS, competitive players receive the definitive experience on GeForce RTX 40 Series PCs and laptops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Game Ready For Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III By Installing Our New Driver\nGet your PC or laptop ready for the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III by heading to the Drivers tab of GeForce Experience or GeForce.com to download and install our brand new Game Ready Driver.\nGeForce Game Ready Drivers deliver the best experience for your favorite PC games. They\u2019re finely tuned in collaboration with developers and extensively tested across thousands of hardware configurations for maximum performance and reliability. Game Ready Drivers also allow you to optimize game settings in GeForce Experience with a single click, and empower you with the latest NVIDIA technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet The Definitive PC Experience With GeForce RTX\nThanks to DLSS 3, DLAA, Reflex and the unparalleled performance of GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, you\u2019ll have the definitive Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III PC experience on GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards and laptops.\nFor more on the performance of GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, head to GeForce.com, where you\u2019ll also find details about the newest integrations of our game-changing technologies in other blockbuster games and new indie releases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Image: NvidiaJacob Kastrenakes is The Verge\u2019s executive editor. He has covered tech, policy, and online creators for over a decade.Nvidia is introducing a new top-of-the-line chip for AI work, the HGX H200. The new GPU upgrades the wildly in demand H100 with 1.4x more memory bandwidth and 1.8x more memory capacity, improving its ability to handle intensive generative AI work.The big question is whether companies will be able to get their hands on the new chips or whether they\u2019ll be as supply constrained as the H100 \u2014 and Nvidia doesn\u2019t quite have an answer for that. The first H200 chips will be released in the second quarter of 2024, and Nvidia says it\u2019s working with \u201cglobal system manufacturers and cloud service providers\u201d to make them available. Nvidia spokesperson Kristin Uchiyama declined to comment on production numbers.The H200 appears to be substantially the same as the H100 outside of its memory. But the changes to its memory make for a meaningful upgrade. The new GPU is the first to use a new, faster memory spec called HBM3e. That brings the GPU\u2019s memory bandwidth to 4.8 terabytes per second, up from 3.35 terabytes per second on the H100, and its total memory capacity to 141GB up from the 80GB of its predecessor.\u201cThe integration of faster and more extensive HBM memory serves to accelerate performance across computationally demanding tasks including generative AI models and [high-performance computing] applications while optimizing GPU utilization and efficiency,\u201d Ian Buck, Nvidia\u2019s VP of high-performance computing products, said in a video presentation this morning.The H200 is also built to be compatible with the same systems that already support H100s. Nvidia says cloud providers won\u2019t need to make any changes as they add H200s into the mix. The cloud arms of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle will be among the first to offer the new GPUs next year.Once they launch, the new chips are sure to be expensive. Nvidia doesn\u2019t list how much they cost, but CNBC reports that the prior-generation H100s are estimated to sell for anywhere between $25,000 to $40,000 each, with thousands of them needed to operate at the highest levels. Uchiyama said pricing is set by Nvidia\u2019s partners.Nvidia\u2019s announcement comes as AI companies remain desperately on the hunt for its H100 chips. Nvidia\u2019s chips are seen as the best option for efficiently processing the huge quantities of data needed to train and operate generative image tools and large language models. The chips are valuable enough that companies are using them as collateral for loans. Who has H100s is the subject of Silicon Valley gossip, and startups have been working together just to share any access to them at all.Uchiyama said that the H200\u2019s debut won\u2019t impact production of the H100. \u201cYou\u2019ll see us add overall supply throughout the year and we are continuing to purchase supply for the long term,\u201d Uchiyama wrote in an email to The Verge.Next year is shaping up to be a more auspicious time for GPU buyers. In August, the Financial Times reported that Nvidia was planning to triple its production of the H100 in 2024. The goal was to produce up to 2 million of them next year, up from around 500,000 in 2023. But with generative AI just as explosive today as it was at the beginning of the year, the demand may only be greater \u2014 and that\u2019s before Nvidia threw an even hotter new chip in the mix.Update November 13th 4:35PM ET: Added additional information from Nvidia spokesperson Kristin Uchiyama.See More: AINewsNvidiaTechMore in this streamSee allNvidia\u2019s cute \u2018Digits\u2019 AI desktop is coming this summer with a new name and a big brotherUmar Shakir29 seconds agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleNvidia announces Blackwell Ultra GB300 and Vera Rubin, its next AI \u2018superchips\u2019Sean Hollister16 minutes agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleIntel is reportedly testing its 18A process again.Umar ShakirMar 3CommentsComment Icon BubbleMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Internationally renowned for research and teaching, UKB connects medical advancements with patient care. With NVIDIA CloudXR, UKB utilizes virtual environments to train surgeons and medical students, preparing them for procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Partner\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUKB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Use Case\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthcare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Technology\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA CloudXR, NVIDIA A40 GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    UKB Uses NVIDIA CloudXR and Medicalholodeck Solutions to Train Physicians\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery year, UKB treats around 420,000 outpatients, 50,000 inpatients as well as 40,000 emergency patients and has the third-highest case mix index (case severity) in Germany. To provide the best care for these patients, UKB has been exploring methods to better prepare their surgeons for various tasks and challenges.\nThis special demand for continuous, advanced training brought Dr. Jan Arensmeyer and Dr. Philipp Feodorovici to the world of extended reality (XR). The team at UKB was introduced to use cases of real-time image reconstruction using Medicalholodeck and streamed with NVIDIA CloudXR\u2122, which delivers high-fidelity, immersive XR experiences across 5G and Wi-Fi networks.\nThe implementation was carried out as part of UKB's Innovative Secure Medical Campus (ISMC) project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage courtesy of UKB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Elevating Precision of Medical Procedures with VR\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs surgeons at a leading medical facility, the medical team at UKB is tasked with performing a wide variety of complicated and challenging surgical procedures. In the field of thoracic surgery\u2014which operates on organs within the chest, including the heart, lungs and esophagus\u2014procedures demand immense precision and accuracy.\nPlanning for such surgeries in 3D has significant benefits. The combination of Medicalholodeck and CloudXR allows medical teams to reduce the amount of necessary hardware and expenses. Now the only hardware users require is their preferred VR headset and a stable internet connection.\nDr. Arensmeyer and Dr. Feodorovici integrated VR technology into their regular surgery lectures, where students were able to interact with recreations of complex medical images in a 3D virtual world.\nIncorporating VR into the training process allowed both experienced surgeons and students to better prepare for diverse challenges with high-performance visualization. Medicalholodeck\u2019s integration with CloudXR opens up a world of new possibilities while reducing costs at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Opening New Doors to the Surgical Field with Spatial Computing\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedicalholodeck uses integrated AI to reconstruct Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) images and videos \u2013 such as CT and MRI scans. A major benefit of this real-time reconstruction for surgeons is that they don\u2019t have to import or change the environment. Performing real-time reconstruction for large datasets requires immense GPU power. The team at UKB uses NVIDIA A40 GPUs in a Supermicro system configured and deployed with the support of NVIDIA ELITE partner SVA System Vertrieb Alexander GmbH to power the heavy VR workflows.\nWith CloudXR set up on the hospital\u2019s campus, all physicians train with the original data in a high-performance environment, with no latency. \u201cThis unique on-premise medical XR cloud solution is developed considering Germany\u2019s highest data security and data privacy standards,\u201d mentioned Dr. Feodorovici.\nSurgeons can easily connect with students from any place at any time, and they can teach techniques based on real patients' 3D data in a fully immersive virtual environment.\n\u201cFor real time surgical training, you need high-quality GPUs to be used for the immersive experience,\u201d said Dr. Arensmeyer. \u201cBy using CloudXR, we can get access to the highest fidelity environments, running on the highest quality A40 GPUs. And CloudXR allows little to no latency, which is critical because it helps surgeons be fully immersed in their virtual surgery.\u201d\nBy running Medicalholodeck from on-prem servers and streaming via CloudXR, surgeons around and off campus can collaboratively advance surgical planning virtually.\nUKB conducted a survey among 100 students enrolled in Thoracic surgery lectures and nearly 100 percent responded that they not only benefited from the technology but also had fun with the experience. Dr. Arensmeyer said, \u201cStudents are more likely to show higher retention rates and it encourages young students who are interested in the surgical roles to explore the field.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Medicalholodeck\u2019s platform and CloudXR, the team at UKB experienced many benefits, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull-Immersion Surgical Planning: For surgeons to thoroughly train through VR, they need a fully immersive surgery experience. With Medicalholodeck and CloudXR, they are allowed to plan the procedure as if they are performing on a real patient, thanks to having little to no latency in streaming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowerful GPU Support: With 6-8 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, the team at UKB is able to support the prominent demand for GPU performance when manipulating real-time medical imaging data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Learning Experience: The team at UKB learned that curricula that incorporate VR significantly helps students and young professionals to understand anatomy and the surgical approach better than conventional teaching methods and has the potential to increase retention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage courtesy of Medicalholodeck INC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state of North Rhine-Westphalia, which has the highest density of university hospitals in the country, is funding the project at UKB. Last year, the hospital received a grant of 17.5 million euros from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Innovation, Digitalization, and Energy of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia for the digitization lighthouse project, which is unique in Germany. The objective is to evaluate and compare \u200ctraditional methodologies of learning to trainings that incorporate XR.\nDr. Feodorovici stated that AI and XR will be vital in future surgeries and further mentioned his recent visit to Boston for a Cardiothoracic surgery conference. He presented UKB\u2019s use case of VR technology in teaching and surgery preparation and was met with an awed audience.\n\u201cEveryone sees this as the future of the medical training field,\u201d said Dr. Feodorovici, \u201cWith our partners Medicalholodeck and SVA we are currently working on trespassing the limits of VR to adopt the current CloudXR setup for mixed reality applications with the aim to improve even more collaborative preprocedural planning and enable surgical navigation\u201d.\nSince the solution uses DICOM format images, there's a much larger opportunity for XR to influence the medical standard of procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBy using CloudXR, we can get access to the highest fidelity environments, running on the highest quality A40 GPUs.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Jan Arensmeyer MD, UKB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Ready to Get Started?\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about NVIDIA\u2019s streaming XR solution, visit: www.nvidia.com/CloudXR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany Information\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nCompany Overview\n\n\nInvestors\n\n\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\n\n\nNVIDIA Foundation\n\n\nResearch\n\n\nCorporate Sustainability\n\n\nTechnologies\n\n\nCareers\n\n\n\n\nNews and Events\n\n\nNewsroom\n\n\nCompany Blog\n\n\nTechnical Blog\n\n\nWebinars\n\n\nStay Informed\n\n\nEvents Calendar\n\n\nGTC AI Conference\n\n\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n\n\n\n\nPopular Links\n\n\nDevelopers\n\n\nPartners\n\n\nExecutive Insights\n\n\nStartups and VCs\n\n\nNVIDIA Connect for ISVs\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\nTechnical Training\n\n\nTraining for IT Professionals\n\n\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow NVIDIA  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t           United States\n\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

When fully installed next year, it will pack 5,448 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips to deliver a whopping 21 exaflops of AI performance for researchers across the country and beyond.\nThe announcement was made at the AI Safety Summit, a gathering of over 100 global government and technology leaders, held in Bletchley Park, the site of the world\u2019s first digital programmable computer, which reflected the work of innovators like Alan Turing, considered the father of AI.\nAI \u201cwill bring a transformation as far-reaching as the industrial revolution, the coming of electricity or the birth of the internet,\u201d said British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in a speech last week about the event, designed to catalyze international collaboration.\nPropelling the Modern Economy\nLike one of Isambard Brunel\u2019s creations \u2014 the first propeller-driven, ocean-going iron ship \u2014 the AI technology running on his namesake is already driving countries forward.\nAI contributes more than \u00a33.7 billion to the U.K. economy and employs more than 50,000 people, said Michelle Donelan, the nation\u2019s Science, Innovation and Technology Secretary, in an earlier announcement about the system.\nThe investment in the so-called AI Research Resource in Bristol \u201cwill catalyze scientific discovery and keep the U.K. at the forefront of AI development,\u201d she said.\nLike AI itself, the system will be used across a wide range of organizations tapping the potential of machine learning to advance robotics, data analytics, drug discovery, climate research and more.\n\u201cIsambard-AI represents a huge leap forward for AI computational power in the U.K.,\u201d said Simon McIntosh-Smith, a Bristol professor and director of the Isambard National Research Facility. \u201cToday, Isambard-AI would rank within the top 10 fastest supercomputers in the world and, when in operation later in 2024, it will be one of the most powerful AI systems for open science anywhere.\u201d\nThe Next Manufacturing Revolution\nLike the industrial revolution, AI promises advances in manufacturing. That\u2019s one reason why Isambard-AI will be based at the National Composites Centre (NCC, pictured above) in the Bristol and Bath Science Park, one of the country\u2019s seven manufacturing research centers.\nThe U.K.\u2019s Frontier AI Taskforce, a research group leading a global effort on how frontier AI can be safely developed, will also be a major user of the system.\nHewlett Packard Enterprise, which is building Isambard-AI, is also collaborating with the University of Bristol on energy-efficiency plans that support net-zero carbon targets mandated by the British government.\nEnergy-Efficient HPC\nA second system coming next year to the NCC will show Arm\u2019s energy efficiency for non-accelerated high performance computing workloads.\nIsambard-3 will deliver an estimated 2.7 petaflops of FP64 peak performance and consume less than 270 kilowatts of power, ranking it among the world\u2019s three greenest non-accelerated supercomputers. That\u2019s because the system \u2014 part of a research alliance among universities of Bath, Bristol, Cardiff and Exeter \u2014 will sport 384 Arm-based NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchips to power medical and scientific research.\n\u201cIsambard-3\u2019s application performance efficiency of up to 6x its predecessor, which rivals many of the 50 fastest TOP500 systems, will provide scientists with a revolutionary new supercomputing platform to advance groundbreaking research,\u201d said Bristol\u2019s McIntosh-Smith, when the system was announced in March.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | Events | Hardware | High-Performance Computing | Industrial and Manufacturing | Machine Learning | NVIDIA in Europe | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

[+] 30, 2023. (Photo by Sam Yeh / AFP) (Photo by SAM YEH/AFP via Getty Images)AFP via Getty Images\nNvidia zoomed past growth expectations in its third quarter \u2014 tripling revenue, according to the Wall Street Journal. So why did the chip-maker\u2019s stock lose 1.7% in after-hours trading following its boffo earnings announcement?\n\n\nOne possible explanation: Investors anticipate this quarter is as good as it can get for Nvidia shares.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to the video communications company Zoom back in October 2020 \u2014 months after it reported 355% revenue growth for its fiscal quarter ending in August of that year. Since then, Zoom stock has lost 89% of its value and its revenue growth has slowed to 3%.\n\nPerhaps the analogy between videoconferencing during the Covid-19 pandemic and graphics processing unit chips during a generative AI boom is not a perfect fit. However, after Nvidia stock soared 249% this year as of November 21 \u2014 compared to the S&P 500\u2019s 19% jump \u2014 investors are beginning to wonder how long the company can keep exceeding such high growth expectations.\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s Outstanding 2023 Third Quarter Fiscal Performance\nThe general rule of stock market investing is to buy shares in companies you think will exceed investor expectations and raise guidance. The media is not unanimous on whether Nvidia did that.\nHere are the highlights of the graphics processing unit-maker\u2019s third quarter report, according to CNBC:\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of September 2023By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of September 2023By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\n\n\nQ3 revenue up 206% to $18.12 billion, nearly $2 billion more than analysts\u2019 consensus.\nQ3 adjusted earnings per share up 46% to $4.02 per share \u2014 65 cents per share more than the analyst consensus.\nQ4 revenue guidance of 231% growth to $20 billion \u2014 about $2 billion more than the analyst consensus, according to the Journal. To be sure, Nvidia\u2019s revenue guidance fell short of $21 billion \u2014 the highest such forecast, Bloomberg reported.\n\n\n\nInvestors may have taken issue with Nvidia\u2019s uncertainty about its China revenue. That\u2019s because the Biden administration imposed export controls preventing Nvidia from selling its fastest GPUs to China.\n\n\nIn October, the Commerce Department blocked Nvidia from selling China-specific chips it developed in 2022 until it had obtained a license from the department \u2014 jeopardizing about $5 billion of Chinese orders for chips to be delivered in 2024. the Journal noted.\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia told investors those export controls had no meaningful impact in the third quarter but could lower its long-term sales to China.\nThe company\u2019s China sales will \u201cdecline significantly\u201d in the fourth quarter, according to a shareholder letter from Nvidia CFO Colette Kress. She added, \"We do not have good visibility into the magnitude of that impact even over the long-term.\"\nTo be fair, Nvidia announced November 21 its progress in developing GPUs that could be sold in the Chinese market while complying the export controls. Analysts said the chip designer has developed \u201cthree chips for the Chinese market and plans to release them soon,\u201d according to Reuters.\nThose chips \u2014 while delivering \u201ca sharp reduction in overall performance\u201d \u2014 may appeal to Chinese customers while being more palatable to U.S. regulators,\" wrote Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon in a November investor note.\nNvidia is optimistic about its growth prospects. CEO Jensen Huang \u201cpushed back strongly\u201d in response to questions about whether the company\u2019s data center growth has peaked.\nHuang told investors Nvidia is adding more chip supply. The expanding adoption of AI hardware by software providers, governments and corporate customers gives him confidence GPU demand from \u201cdata centers can grow through 2025,\u201d Bloomberg reported.\nDoes Zoom Video\u2019s Sad Trajectory Presage Nvidia\u2019s?\nHow long can Nvidia keep growing faster than 200% a year? I do not know. However, I would be shocked if that growth rate continues for, say, the next five years.\nShould Nvidia one day report slower than expected revenue and lowered guidance, its stock will almost surely plunge.\nThat is what happened to Zoom \u2014 the videoconferencing provider\u2019s stock trades about where it was in April 2019 when the company went public at $65 a share.\nZoom\u2019s stock peaked at $559 in October 2020 \u2014 following a 355% surge in Zoom\u2019s revenue for fiscal second quarter 2021 (ending in July 2020). The shares have since lost 89% of its value.\nThe astounding growth was due to a \u201cusage surge during the work-from-home and school-at-home boom spurred by\u201d the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Investor\u2019s Business Daily.\nMy guess is slowing growth contributed to the decline in Zoom stock from that peak. Indeed in November 2020, Zoom forecast 300% growth for its fiscal year 2021 to $2.5 billion \u2014 very high but a noticeable slowdown from the 355% growth the company enjoyed in FY quarter ending in July 2020.\nGrowth at Zoom has since nearly flat lined. For the fiscal third quarter ending October 2023, Zoom revenue grew a mere 3% to $1.14 billion while earnings increased to $1.09 a share. Zoom predicted $1.13 billion in revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter \u2014 meeting investor expectations, noted IBD\nIBD\n.\nZoom expressed confidence in the company\u2019s performance. \u201cIn Q3, revenue came in ahead of guidance as we bolstered Zoom's all-in-one intelligent collaboration platform with advanced new capabilities like Zoom AI Companion and continued to evolve our customer and employee engagement solutions,\" CEO Eric Yuan said in a news release.\nZoom certainly is not Nvidia. As I learned from interviewing Yuan, he started the videoconferencing platform knowing it was entering a crowded market. He believed he could create a company that would delight employees and customers.\nDuring the pandemic, Zoom lived up to that promise and it benefited greatly from the resulting surge in demand for its services. As the pandemic ended, Zoom did not find a new growth curve.\nThis raises a fundamental question for Nvidia investors: Will the chip designer \u2014 which now dominates the AI GPU market \u2014 have built a new source of 200% growth after the current surge in demand for generative AI GPUs slows down?\nWhat\u2019s Next For Nvidia Stock?\nAnalysts do not see Nvidia slowing down in 2024.\n\u201cGPU demand continues to outpace supply as Gen AI adoption broadens across industry verticals,\u201d Raymond James\u2019 Srini Pajjuri and Jacob Silverman wrote in a November 20 note. They added, \u201cWe are not overly concerned about competition and expect NVDA to maintain >85% share in Gen AI accelerators even in 2024,\u201d CNBC reported.\nDespite competitive challenges, with its even-more advanced H2000 AI chips expected in 2024, Nvidia will maintain its hold on \u201cmore than 85% of the market for generative-AI chips next year,\u201d according to the Journal.\nIf the GPU designer can do a better job than Zoom did at creating a fast-growing future after the current generative AI demand boom slows down, investors may continue to benefit from owning Nvidia stock.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Photo credit: J. Harper/University of Florida\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new artificial intelligence computer program created by researchers at the University of Florida and NVIDIA can generate doctors\u2019 notes so well that two physicians couldn\u2019t tell the difference, according to an early study from both groups. \nIn this proof-of-concept study, physicians reviewed patient notes \u2014 some written by actual medical doctors while others were created by the new AI program \u2014 and the physicians identified the correct author only 49% of the time. \nA team of 19 researchers from NVIDIA\nand the University of Florida\nsaid their findings, published Nov. 16 in the Nature journal npj Digital Medicine, open the door for AI to support health care workers with groundbreaking efficiencies. \nThe researchers trained supercomputers to generate medical records based on a new model, GatorTronGPT, that functions similarly to ChatGPT. The free versions of GatorTron\u2122 models have more than 430,000 downloads from Hugging Face, an open-source AI website. GatorTron\u2122 models are the site\u2019s only models available for clinical research, according to the article\u2019s lead author Yonghui Wu, Ph.D., from the UF College of Medicine\u2019s department of health outcomes and biomedical informatics.\n\u201cIn health care, everyone is talking about these models. GatorTron\u2122 and GatorTronGPT are unique AI models that can power many aspects of medical research and health care. Yet, they require massive data and extensive computing power to build. We are grateful to have this supercomputer, HiPerGator, from NVIDIA to explore the potential of AI in health care,\u201d Wu said. \nUF alumnus and NVIDIA co-founder Chris Malachowsky is the namesake of UF\u2019s new Malachowsky Hall for Data Science & Information Technology. A public-private partnership between UF and NVIDIA helped to fund this $150 million structure. In 2021, UF upgraded its HiPerGator supercomputer\nto elite status with a multimillion-dollar infrastructure package from NVIDIA, the first at a university. \nFor this research, Wu and his colleagues developed a large language model that allows computers to mimic natural human language. These models work well with standard writing or conversations, but medical records bring additional hurdles, such as needing to protect patients\u2019 privacy and being highly technical. Digital medical records cannot be Googled or shared on Wikipedia. \nTo overcome these obstacles, the researchers stripped UF Health medical records of identifying information from 2 million patients while keeping 82 billion useful medical words. Combining this set with another dataset of 195 billion words, they trained the GatorTronGPT model to analyze the medical data with GPT-3 architecture, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer, a form of neural network architecture. That allowed GatorTronGPT to write clinical text similar to medical doctors\u2019 notes. \n\u201cThis GatorTronGPT model is one of the first major products from UF\u2019s initiative to incorporate AI across the university. We are so pleased with how the partnership with NVIDIA is already bearing fruit and setting the stage for the future of medicine,\u201d said Elizabeth Shenkman, Ph.D., a co-author and chair of UF\u2019s department of health outcomes and biomedical informatics. \nOf the many possible uses for a medical GPT, one idea involves replacing the tedium of documentation with notes recorded and transcribed by AI. Wu says that UF has an innovation center that is pursuing a commercial version of the software. \nFor an AI tool to reach such parity with human writing, programmers spend weeks programming supercomputers with clinical vocabulary and language usage based on billions upon billions of words. One resource providing the necessary clinical data is the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Network, coordinated at UF and representing many health care systems. \n\u201cIt\u2019s critical to have such massive amounts of UF Health clinical data not only available but ready for AI. Only a supercomputer could handle such a big dataset of 277 billion words. We are excited to implement GatorTron\u2122 and GatorTronGPT models to real-world health care at UF Health,\u201d said Jiang Bian, Ph.D., a co-author and UF Health\u2019s chief data scientist and chief research information officer.\nA cross-section of 14 UF and UF Health faculty contributed to this study, including researchers from Research Computing, Integrated Data Repository Research Services within the Clinical and Translational Science Institute, and from departments and divisions within the College of Medicine, including neurosurgery, endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism, cardiovascular medicine, and health outcomes and biomedical informatics. \nThe study was partially funded by grants from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute on Aging.\nHere are two paragraphs that reference two patient cases one written by a human and one created by GatorTronGPT \u2014 can you tell whether the author was machine or human? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first was written by a human physician at UF Health; the second was written by AI. \n\n\n\n\nCollege Quick Facts\n\nCollege of Medicine\nDean: Jennifer Hunt, MD, MEd, Interim\n\n\n\n\n                    $407M\n        \n\n          in total research and sponsored program funding\n        \n\n\n\n                    $169M\n        \n\n          in NIH research awards\n        \n\n\n\n                    28\n        \n\n          foundational science and clinical academic departments\n        \n\n\n\n                    3,000+\n        \n\n          learners and trainees pursuing MD, PA, MS or PhD degrees and completing residency, fellowship and postdoctoral training\n        \n\n\n\n                    10\n        \n\n          programs ranked in top 20 for NIH Funding (Blue Ridge Institute for Medical Research)\n        \n\n\n\n      Visit college\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      AI at UF\n  \n\n\n\n      Department of Health Outcomes & Biomedical Informatics\n  \n\n\n\n      College of Medicine\n  \n\n\n\n      University of Florida\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      About the author\n    \n\n\n\n\n        Jim W.

Second, the \u201cadoption of AI in different industries,\u201d as generative AI spreads throughout the world, Huang explained.\n\u201cSo the types of breakthroughs that we\u2019re seeing in language I fully expect to see in digital biology and manufacturing and robotics,\u201d Huang said, noting this could create big opportunities for Europe with its rich digital biology and healthcare industries. \u201cAnd of course, Europe is also home of some of the largest industrial manufacturing companies.\u201d\nPraise for France\u2019s AI Leadership\nDurand kicked off the conversation by asking Huang about his views on the European AI ecosystem, especially in France, where the government has invested millions of euros in AI research and development.\n\u201cEurope has always been rich in AI expertise,\u201d Huang said, noting that NVIDIA works with 4,000 startups in Europe, more than 400 of them in France alone, pointing to Mistral, Qubit Pharmaceuticals and Poolside AI.\n\u201cAt the same time, you have to really get the computing infrastructure going,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAnd this is the reason why Scaleway is so important to the advancement of AI in France\u201d and throughout Europe, Huang said.\nHighlighting the critical role of data in AI\u2019s regional growth, Huang noted companies\u2019 increasing awareness of the value of training AI with region-specific data. AI systems need to reflect the unique cultural and industrial nuances of each region, an approach gaining traction across Europe and beyond.\nNVIDIA and Scaleway: Powering Europe\u2019s AI Revolution\nScaleway, a subsidiary of iliad Group, a major European telecoms player, is doing its part to kick-start that second wave in Europe, offering cloud credits for access to its AI supercomputer cluster, which packs 1,016 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs.\nAs a regional cloud service provider, Scaleway also provides sovereign infrastructure that ensures access and compliance with EU data protection laws, which is critical for businesses with a European footprint.\nRegional members of the NVIDIA Inception program, which provides development assistance to startups, will also be able to access NVIDIA AI Enterprise software on Scaleway Marketplace.\nThe software includes the NVIDIA NeMo framework and pretrained models for building LLMs, NVIDIA RAPIDS for accelerated data science and NVIDIA Triton Inference Server and NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM for boosting inference.\nRevolutionizing AI With Supercomputing Prowess\nRecapping a month packed with announcements, Huang explained how NVIDIA is rapidly advancing high performance computing and AI worldwide to provide the infrastructure needed to power this second wave.\nThese systems are, in effect,\u00a0 \u201csupercomputers,\u201d Huang said, with AI systems now among the world\u2019s most powerful.\nThey include Scaleway\u2019s newly available Nabuchodonosor supercomputer, or \u201cNabu,\u201d an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD with 127 NVIDIA DGX H100 systems, which will help startups in France and across Europe scale up AI workloads.\n\u201cAs you know the Scaleway system that we brought online, Nabu, is not your normal computer,\u201d Huang said. \u201cIn every single way, it\u2019s a supercomputer.\u201d\nSuch systems are underpinning powerful new services.\nEarlier this week, NVIDIA announced an AI Foundry service on Microsoft Azure, aimed at accelerating the development of customized generative AI applications.\nHuang highlighted NVIDIA AI foundry\u2019s appeal to a diverse user base, including established enterprises such as Amdocs, Getty Images, SAP and ServiceNow.\nHuang noted that JUPITER, to be hosted at the J\u00fclich facility, in Germany, and poised to be Europe\u2019s premier exascale AI supercomputer, will run on 24,000 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips, offering unparalleled computational capacity for diverse AI tasks and simulations.\nHuang touched on NVIDIA\u2019s just-announced HGX H200 AI computing platform, built on NVIDIA\u2019s Hopper architecture and featuring the H200 Tensor Core GPU. Set for release in Q2 of 2024, it promises to redefine industry standards.\nHe also detailed NVIDIA\u2019s strategy to develop \u2018AI factories,\u2019 advanced data centers that power diverse applications across industries, including electric vehicles, robotics, and generative AI services.\nOpen Source\nFinally, Durand asked Huang about the role of open source and open science in AI.\nHuang said he\u2019s a \u201chuge fan\u201d of open source. \u201cLet\u2019s acknowledge that without open source, how would AI have made the tremendous progress it has over the last decade,\u201d Huang said.\n\u201cAnd so the ability for open source to energize the vibrancy and pull in the research and pull in the engagement of every startup, every researcher, every industry is really quite vital,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re seeing it play out just presently, now going forward.\u201d\nFriday\u2019s fireside conversation was part of Scaleway\u2019s ai-PULSE conference, showcasing the latest AI trends and innovations.

Without CUDA-Q, it would be impossible to run this simulation,\u201d he said.\nThe work requires a lot of heavy lifting, too, so BASF turned to an NVIDIA DGX Cloud service that uses NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs.\n\u201cWe need a lot of computing power, and the NVIDIA platform is significantly faster than CPU-based hardware for this kind of simulation,\u201d said Kuehn.\nBASF\u2019s quantum computing initiative, which Kuehn helped launch, started in 2017. In addition to its work in chemistry, the team is developing use cases for quantum computing in machine learning as well as optimizations for logistics and scheduling.\nAn Expanding CUDA-Q Community\nOther research groups are also advancing science with CUDA-Q.\nAt SUNY Stony Brook, researchers are pushing the boundaries of high-energy physics to simulate complex interactions of subatomic particles. Their work promises new discoveries in fundamental physics.\n\u201cCUDA-Q enables us to do quantum simulations that would otherwise be impossible,\u201d said Dmitri Kharzeev,\u00a0 a SUNY professor and scientist at Brookhaven National Lab.\nIn addition, a research team at Hewlett Packard Labs is using the Perlmutter supercomputer to explore magnetic phase transition in quantum chemistry in one of the largest simulations of its kind. The effort could reveal important and unknown details of physical processes too difficult to model with conventional techniques.\n\u201cAs quantum computers progress toward useful applications, high-performance classical simulations will be key for prototyping novel quantum algorithms,\u201d said Kirk Bresniker, a chief architect at Hewlett Packard Labs. \u201cSimulating and learning from quantum data are promising avenues toward tapping quantum computing\u2019s potential.\u201d\nA Quantum Center for Healthcare\nThese efforts come as support for CUDA-Q expands worldwide.\nClassiq \u2014 an Israeli startup that already has more than 400 universities using its novel approach to writing quantum programs \u2014 announced today a new research center at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Israel\u2019s largest teaching hospital.\nCreated in collaboration with NVIDIA, it will train experts in life science to write quantum applications that could someday help doctors diagnose diseases or accelerate the discovery of new drugs.\nClassiq created quantum design software that automates low-level tasks, so developers don\u2019t need to know all the complex details of how a quantum computer works. It\u2019s now being integrated with CUDA-Q.\nTerra Quantum, a quantum services company with headquarters in Germany and Switzerland, is developing hybrid quantum applications for life sciences, energy, chemistry and finance that will run on CUDA-Q. And IQM in Finland is enabling its superconducting QPU to use CUDA-Q.\nQuantum Loves Grace Hopper\nSeveral companies, including Oxford Quantum Circuits, will use NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips to power their hybrid quantum efforts. Based in Reading, England, Oxford Quantum is using Grace Hopper in a hybrid QPU/GPU system programmed by CUDA-Q.\nQuantum Machines announced that the Israeli National Quantum Center will be the first deployment of NVIDIA DGX Quantum, a system using Grace Hopper Superchips. Based in Tel Aviv, the center will tap DGX Quantum to power quantum computers from Quantware, ORCA Computing and more.\nIn addition, Grace Hopper is being put to work by qBraid, in Chicago, to build a quantum cloud service, and Fermioniq, in Amsterdam, to develop tensor-network algorithms.\nThe large quantity of shared memory and the memory bandwidth of Grace Hopper make these superchips an excellent fit for memory-hungry quantum simulations.\nGet started programming hybrid quantum systems today with the latest release of CUDA-Q from NGC, NVIDIA\u2019s catalog of accelerated software, or GitHub.\n(Picture above source: BASF)\n\n\nCategories: Software | SupercomputingTags: Customer Stories | DGX Cloud | Events | GPU Computing | High-Performance Computing | New GPU Uses | Science | Scientific Visualization | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The APIs are built on the open-source MONAI project founded by NVIDIA and King\u2019s College London.\nMedical imaging is critical across healthcare, making up approximately 90% of healthcare data. It\u2019s used by radiologists and clinicians to do screening, diagnosis and intervention, by biopharma researchers to evaluate how clinical trial patients respond to new drugs and by medical device makers to provide real-time decision support.\nThe scale of work across each of these areas requires a medical imaging-specific AI factory \u2014 an enterprise-grade platform that delivers large-scale data management, creates ground-truth annotations, accelerates model development and establishes seamless AI application deployment.\nWith NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs, solution providers can more easily integrate AI into their medical imaging platforms, enabling them to provide supercharged tools for radiologists, researchers and clinical trial teams to build domain-specialized AI factories. The APIs are available in early access through the NVIDIA DGX Cloud AI supercomputing service.\nThe NVIDIA MONAI cloud API is integrated into Flywheel, a leading medical imaging data and AI platform that supports end-to-end workflows for AI development. Developers at medical image annotation companies including RedBrick AI and at machine learning operations (MLOps) platform providers including Dataiku are poised to integrate NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs into their offerings.\nEasy-to-Deploy Annotation and Training for Medical Imaging\nBuilding efficient and cost-effective AI solutions requires a robust, domain-specialized development foundation that includes full-stack optimizations for software, scalable multi-node systems and state-of-the-art research. It also requires high-quality ground-truth data \u2014 which can be arduous and time-consuming to gather, particularly for 3D medical images that require a high level of expertise to annotate.\nNVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs feature interactive annotation powered by the VISTA-3D (Vision Imaging Segmentation and Annotation) foundation model. It\u2019s purpose-built for continuous learning, a capability that improves AI model performance based on user feedback and new data.\nTrained on a dataset of annotated images from 3D CT scans from more than 4,000 patients, spanning various diseases and parts of the body, VISTA-3D accelerates the creation of 3D segmentation masks for medical image analysis. With continuous learning, the AI model\u2019s annotation quality improves over time.\nTo further accelerate AI training, this release includes APIs that make it seamless to build custom models based on MONAI pretrained models. NVIDIA MONAI cloud APIs also include Auto3DSeg, which automates hyperparameter tuning and AI model selection for a given 3D segmentation task, simplifying the model development process.\nNVIDIA researchers recently won four challenges at the MICCAI medical imaging conference using Auto3DSeg.

It allows researchers to pretrain or fine-tune state-of-the-art models on DGX Cloud.\nThe collaboration will initially focus on optimizing Genentech\u2019s drug discovery AI models in its \u201clab in a loop\u201d framework. The goal: To allow its researchers to understand complex biomolecular patterns and relationships to truly disrupt drug development and improve the success rate of R&D, and to empower scientists to deliver multiplicative, rather than linear or additive, benefits for patients and the broader healthcare ecosystem.\n\u201cOur collaboration with NVIDIA builds on our long history of successfully inventing and deploying technology in ways that were not initially apparent to others,\u201d said Aviv Regev, executive vice president and head of Genentech Research & Early Development (gRED). \u201cWe were the first biotech company to leverage molecular biology for drug discovery and development, which changed the world. We pioneered antibody therapeutics that became the paradigm of treatment. And now, we have brought AI, the lab and the clinic together to uncover otherwise inaccessible patterns in vast quantities of data, and to design experiments to test those patterns. Collaborating with NVIDIA, and introducing generative AI, has the power to turbocharge the discovery and design of therapeutics that will improve the lives of patients across the world.\u201d\n\nStreamlining Drug Discovery With Computation\u00a0\u00a0\nDrug discovery and development is currently a lengthy, complicated and costly process. Drug targets for novel medicines are difficult to predict, as is successfully developing a molecule as a potential therapeutic. AI can play a transformational role because generative and other AI models can help scientists rapidly identify potential drug molecules and interactions by training on large-scale datasets.\nFor Genentech, using AI helps bridge the gap between lab experiments and computational algorithms.\nThe company\u2019s R&D group, gRED, has already done significant work using AI \u2014 across multiple modalities \u2014 to discover and develop novel therapeutics while learning more about the building blocks of biology and diseases.\nTeams from Genentech and NVIDIA will now work together to optimize Genentech\u2019s custom-developed models to shorten this time-consuming process of drug discovery and development and lead to greater success.\nPutting AI in a Loop\nGenentech\u2019s \u201clab in a loop\u201d is an iterative framework for generating and exploring molecular designs with predicted properties. It aims to use experimental data to inform generative computational models and better optimize future molecular designs. NVIDIA will help Genentech optimize its framework by accelerating training and inference of Genentech\u2019s drug discovery models.\nThrough this collaboration, NVIDIA AI experts will gain insights into AI-related challenges in drug discovery and development. NVIDIA plans to use these insights to improve its BioNeMo platform and others to further accommodate the requirements of models used by the biotech industry.\n\u201cAI can play a transformational role in accelerating drug discovery and development \u2014 as it has across many parts of healthcare and life sciences,\u201d said Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA. \u201cTogether, NVIDIA and Genentech are unlocking scientific innovation by developing and implementing AI models and algorithms that enable us to rapidly iterate and unearth insights.\u201d\nSubscribe to NVIDIA healthcare news.\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | DGX Cloud | Healthcare and Life Sciences | NVIDIA NeMo | Science | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

All references to the name have been updated in this blog.\nNVIDIA today unveiled at SC23 the next wave of technologies that will lift scientific and industrial research centers worldwide to new levels of performance and energy efficiency.\n\u201cNVIDIA hardware and software innovations are creating a new class of AI supercomputers,\u201d said Ian Buck, vice president of the company\u2019s high performance computing and hyperscale data center business, in a special address at the conference.\nSome of the systems will pack memory-enhanced NVIDIA Hopper accelerators, others a new NVIDIA Grace Hopper systems architecture. All will use the expanded parallelism to run a full stack of accelerated software for generative AI, HPC and hybrid quantum computing.\nBuck described the new NVIDIA HGX H200 as \u201cthe world\u2019s leading AI computing platform.\u201d\nNVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs pack HBM3e memory to run growing generative AI models.\nIt packs up to 141GB of HBM3e, the first AI accelerator to use the ultrafast technology. Running models like GPT-3, NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs provide an 18x performance increase over prior-generation accelerators.\nAmong other generative AI benchmarks, they zip through 12,000 tokens per second on a Llama2-13B large language model (LLM).\nBuck\u00a0also revealed a server platform that links four NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips on an NVIDIA NVLink interconnect. The quad configuration puts in a single compute node a whopping 288 Arm Neoverse cores and 16 petaflops of AI performance with up to 2.3 terabytes of high-speed memory.\nServer nodes based on the four GH200 Superchips will deliver 16 petaflops of AI performance.\nDemonstrating its efficiency, one GH200 Superchip using the NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM open-source library is 100x faster than a dual-socket x86 CPU system and nearly 2x more energy efficient than an X86 + H100 GPU server.\n\u201cAccelerated computing is sustainable computing,\u201d Buck said. \u201cBy harnessing the power of accelerated computing and generative AI, together we can drive innovation across industries while reducing our impact on the environment.\u201d\nNVIDIA Powers 38 of 49 New TOP500 Systems\nThe latest TOP500 list of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers reflects the shift toward accelerated, energy-efficient supercomputing.\nThanks to new systems powered by NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs, NVIDIA now delivers more than 2.5 exaflops of HPC performance across these world-leading systems, up from 1.6 exaflops in the May rankings. NVIDIA\u2019s contribution on the top 10 alone reaches nearly an exaflop of HPC and 72 exaflops of AI performance.\nThe new list contains the highest number of systems ever using NVIDIA technologies, 379 vs. 372 in May, including 38 of 49 new supercomputers on the list.\nMicrosoft Azure leads the newcomers with its Eagle system using H100 GPUs in NDv5 instances to hit No. 3 with 561 petaflops. Mare Nostrum5 in Barcelona ranked No. 8, and NVIDIA Eos \u2014 which recently set new AI training records on the MLPerf benchmarks \u2014 came in at No. 9.\nShowing their energy efficiency, NVIDIA GPUs power 24 of the top 30 systems on the Green500. And they retained the No. 1 spot with the H100 GPU-based Henri system, which delivers 65.09 gigaflops per watt for the Flatiron Institute in New York.\nGen AI Explores COVID\nShowing what\u2019s possible, the Argonne National Laboratory used NVIDIA BioNeMo, a generative AI platform for biomolecular LLMs, to develop GenSLMs, a model that can generate gene sequences that closely resemble real-world variants of the coronavirus. Using NVIDIA GPUs and data from 1.5 million COVID genome sequences, it can also rapidly identify new virus variants.\nThe work won the Gordon Bell special prize last year and was trained on supercomputers, including Argonne\u2019s Polaris system, the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Perlmutter and NVIDIA\u2019s Selene.\nIt\u2019s \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg \u2014 the future is brimming with possibilities, as generative AI continues to redefine the landscape of scientific exploration,\u201d said Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA, in the special address.\nSaving Time, Money and Energy\nUsing the latest technologies, accelerated workloads can see an order-of-magnitude reduction in system cost and energy used, Buck said.\nFor example, Siemens teamed with Mercedes to analyze aerodynamics and related acoustics for its new electric EQE vehicles. The simulations that took weeks on CPU clusters ran significantly faster using the latest NVIDIA H100 GPUs. In addition, Hopper GPUs let them reduce costs by 3x and reduce energy consumption by 4x (below).\n\nSwitching on 200 Exaflops Beginning Next Year\nScientific and industrial advances will come from every corner of the globe where the latest systems are being deployed.\n\u201cWe already see a combined 200 exaflops of AI on Grace Hopper supercomputers going to production 2024,\u201d Buck said.\nThey include the massive JUPITER supercomputer at Germany\u2019s J\u00fclich center. It can deliver 93 exaflops of performance for AI training and 1 exaflop for HPC applications, while consuming only 18.2 megawatts of power.\nResearch centers are poised to switch on a tsunami of GH200 performance.\nBased on Eviden\u2019s BullSequana XH3000 liquid-cooled system, JUPITER will use the NVIDIA quad GH200 system architecture and NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking for climate and weather predictions, drug discovery, hybrid quantum computing and digital twins. JUPITER quad GH200 nodes will be configured with 864GB of high-speed memory.\nIt\u2019s one of several new supercomputers using Grace Hopper that NVIDIA announced at SC23.\nThe HPE Cray EX2500 system from Hewlett Packard Enterprise will use the quad GH200 to power many AI supercomputers coming online next year.\nFor example, HPE uses the quad GH200 to power the DeltaAI system, which will triple computing capacity for the U.S. National Center for Supercomputing Applications.\nHPE is also building the Venado system for the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the first GH200 to be deployed in the U.S. In addition, HPE is building GH200 supercomputers in the Middle East, Switzerland and the U.K.\nSeparately, Fujitsu will use the GH200 manufactured by Supermicro in the OFP-II system, an advanced HPC system in Japan shared by the University of Tsukuba and the University of Tokyo.\nGrace Hopper in Texas and Beyond\nAt the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), Dell Technologies is building the Vista supercomputer with NVIDIA Grace Hopper and Grace CPU Superchips.\nMore than 100 global enterprises and organizations, including NASA Ames Research Center and Total Energies, have already purchased Grace Hopper early-access systems, Buck said.\nThey join previously announced GH200 users such as SoftBank and the University of Bristol, as well as the massive Leonardo system with 14,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs that delivers 10 exaflops of AI performance for Italy\u2019s Cineca consortium.\nThe View From Supercomputing Centers\nLeaders from supercomputing centers around the world shared their plans and work in progress with the latest systems.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been collaborating with MeteoSwiss and ECMWF as well as scientists from ETH EXCLAIM and NVIDIA\u2019s Earth-2 project to create an infrastructure that will push the envelope in all dimensions of big data analytics and extreme scale computing,\u201d said Thomas Schultess, director of the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre of work on the Alps supercomputer.\n\u201cThere\u2019s really impressive energy-efficiency gains across our stacks,\u201d Dan Stanzione, executive director of TACC, said of Vista.\nIt\u2019s \u201creally the stepping stone to move users from the kinds of systems we\u2019ve done in the past to looking at this new Grace Arm CPU and Hopper GPU tightly coupled combination and \u2026 we\u2019re looking to scale out by probably a factor of 10 or 15 from what we are deploying with Vista when we deploy Horizon in a couple years,\u201d he said.\nAccelerating the Quantum Journey\nResearchers are also using today\u2019s accelerated systems to pioneer a path to tomorrow\u2019s supercomputers.\nIn Germany, JUPITER \u201cwill revolutionize scientific research across climate, materials, drug discovery and quantum computing,\u201d said Kristel Michelson, who leads Julich\u2019s research group on quantum information processing.\n\u201cJUPITER\u2019s architecture also allows for the seamless integration of quantum algorithms with parallel HPC algorithms, and this is mandatory for effective quantum HPC hybrid simulations,\u201d she said.\nCUDA-Q Drives Progress\nThe special address also showed how NVIDIA CUDA-Q\u00a0\u2014 a platform for programming CPUs, GPUs and quantum computers also known as QPUs \u2014 is advancing research in quantum computing.\nFor example, researchers at BASF, the world\u2019s largest chemical company, pioneered a new hybrid quantum-classical method for simulating chemicals that can shield humans against harmful metals. They join researchers at Brookhaven National Laboratory and HPE who are separately pushing the frontiers of science with CUDA-Q.\nNVIDIA also announced a collaboration with Classiq, a developer of quantum programming tools, to create a life sciences research center at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Israel\u2019s largest teaching hospital.\u00a0 The center will use Classiq\u2019s software and CUDA-Q running on an NVIDIA DGX H100 system.\nSeparately, Quantum Machines will deploy the first NVIDIA DGX Quantum, a system using Grace Hopper Superchips, at the Israel National Quantum Center that aims to drive advances across scientific fields. The DGX system will be connected to a superconducting QPU by Quantware and a photonic QPU from ORCA Computing, both powered by CUDA-Q.\n\n\u201cIn just two years, our NVIDIA quantum computing platform has amassed over 120 partners [above], a testament to its open, innovative platform,\u201d Buck said.\nOverall, the work across many fields of discovery reveals a new trend that combines accelerated computing at data center scale with NVIDIA\u2019s full-stack innovation.\n\u201cAccelerated computing is paving the path for sustainable computing with advancements that provide not just amazing technology but a more sustainable and impactful future,\u201d he concluded.\nWatch NVIDIA\u2019s SC23 special address below.\n\nExplore generative AI sessions and experiences at NVIDIA GTC, the global conference on AI and accelerated computing, running March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., and online.\nFeature image: Jupiter system at J\u00fclich supercomputer center, courtesy of Eviden.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AI | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | Events | Hardware | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | NVIDIA NeMo | Science | Scientific Visualization | Simulation and Design | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

NVIDIA NeMo, a framework for building, customizing and running LLMs, helps overcome these challenges.\nA team of experienced scientists and developers at Amazon Web Services creating Amazon Titan foundation models for Amazon Bedrock, a generative AI service for foundation models, has been using NVIDIA NeMo for over the past several months.\n\u201cOne key reason for us to work with NeMo is that it is extensible, comes with optimizations that allow us to run with high GPU utilization while also enabling us to scale to larger clusters so we can train and deliver models to our customers faster,\u201d said Leonard Lausen, a senior applied scientist at AWS.\nThink Big, Really Big\nParallelism techniques in NeMo enable efficient LLM training at scale. When coupled with the Elastic Fabric Adapter from AWS, it allowed the team to spread its LLM across many GPUs to accelerate training.\nEFA provides AWS customers with an UltraCluster Networking infrastructure that can directly connect more than 10,000 GPUs and bypass the operating system and CPU using NVIDIA GPUDirect.\nThe combination allowed the AWS scientists to deliver excellent model quality \u2014 something that\u2019s not possible at scale when relying solely on data parallelism approaches.\nFramework Fits All Sizes\n\u201cThe flexibility of NeMo,\u201d Lausen said, \u201callowed AWS to tailor the training software for the specifics of the new Titan model, datasets and infrastructure.\u201d\nAWS\u2019s innovations include efficient streaming from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to the GPU cluster. \u201cIt was easy to incorporate these improvements because NeMo builds upon popular libraries like PyTorch Lightning that standardize LLM training pipeline components,\u201d Lausen said.\nAWS and NVIDIA aim to infuse products like NVIDIA NeMo and services like Amazon Titan with lessons learned from their collaboration for the benefit of customers.\nExplore generative AI sessions and experiences at NVIDIA GTC, the global conference on AI and accelerated computing, running March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., and online.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Cloud Services | Customer Stories | Events | GPU | Machine Learning | NVIDIA NeMo | Parallel Computing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Learn how to opt-in to the beta on Bethesda\u2019s blog.\nTo download and install, head to the Drivers tab of GeForce Experience or GeForce.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III is available now! In the cinematic campaign, Captain Price and Task Force 141 face off against the ultimate threat, the ultranationalist war criminal Vladimir Makarov, who\u2019s extending his grasp across the world, causing Task Force 141 to fight like never before. Once you\u2019ve dug into the action-packed single-player campaign, head online to defeat Zombies in an exciting open-world co-op experience that takes the Zombies mode everyone knows and loves to the next level. If you prefer Multiplayer, dip into the selection of Core Multiplayer maps from the 16 iconic launch maps of 2009\u2019s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 that are being brought over and modernized for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.\nIn each mode, GeForce gamers can accelerate frame rates with AI-powered DLSS, or maximize image quality with DLAA. And gameplay gets even more responsive thanks to the day-one inclusion of NVIDIA Reflex in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III\u2019s built-in benchmark, cranking all settings to max at 4K sees performance increase by 1.8X on average when activating DLSS 3, enabling max setting gameplay at over 100 FPS on the GeForce RTX 4070, and at up to 200 FPS on the GeForce RTX 4090:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEvery frame of action counts in Call of Duty. Once again, NVIDIA introduces major innovations with DLSS 3 Frame Generation. Along with DLSS Super Resolution and Reflex, it allows us to bring faster and smoother gameplay to the PC version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.\u201d - Marc-Alexandre Milot, Design Director, Beenox\nAt 1440p, DLSS 3 boosts performance by 1.6X, enabling 100 FPS+ gameplay on the entire lineup of GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards, and up to 240 FPS gameplay on the GeForce RTX 4090:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 1080p, DLSS 3\u2019s 1.5X performance boost enables you to hit esports frame rates on all GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, and allows you to max out the highest refresh rate displays on the GeForce RTX 4090, which achieves a 300 FPS result:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn GeForce RTX 40 Series laptops, DLSS 3 increases performance by 1.6X at both 1080p and 1440p, enabling all owners to game at fast frame rates, and at up to 230 FPS on GeForce RTX 4090 laptops:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith such fast frame rates on so many GPUs, you may want to supercharge image quality with NVIDIA DLAA, an AI-based anti-aliasing mode that utilizes the same technology developed for DLSS. DLAA uses a native resolution image to maximize image quality, rather than boosting performance, and in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III DLAA can be combined with DLSS Frame Generation for the highest possible image quality, and excellent performance.\nAlso, be sure to activate NVIDIA Reflex, which has helped GeForce gamers reduce system latency in Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Call of Duty: Vanguard, Modern Warfare, Modern Warfare II, and Call of Duty: Warzone\u2122. In Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Reflex reduces system latency by up to 28%.\nTogether with the high frame rates delivered by DLSS and low latency delivered by Reflex, competitive players receive the definitive experience on GeForce RTX 40 Series PCs and laptops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Game Ready Driver - Download Now\nLearn more about GeForce Game Ready Drivers here; download the new GeForce Game Ready 546.17 WHQL driver through GeForce Experience.\nIf you experience any technical issues with the new Game Ready drivers please post a detailed report on the GeForce.com Driver Feedback Forum, where our Customer Care team can better assist you.

Completed in under 20 weeks and two months before expected, it offers half the computing power of the full system (four exaflops for AI and 65 petaflops for standard HPC.)The second stage of the computer will be completed in the first half of 2024.\u201cIsrael is home to world-leading AI researchers and developers creating applications for the next wave of AI,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia. \u201cWith Nvidia\u2019s Israel-1 AI supercomputer, a broad range of innovative companies in Israel will create AI that can transform the productivity and business models of enterprises around the world.\u201dIsrael-1 will be used as a testbed for Nvidia's Spectrum-X, a networking platform the company is developing in Israel that is hoped to improve the performance and efficiency of Ethernet-based AI clouds. Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and Lenovo will be the first to integrate Spectrum-X technologies.Plans for the supercomputer were first shared in May 2023, and the first phase was expected by the end of the year. The cloud-based system cost \"hundreds of millions of dollars.\"At the same time, Nvidia announced it was developing a supercomputer in Taiwan, known as Taipei-1, which will feature 64 DGX H100 AI systems and 64 OVX systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in HPC & Quantum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06 Feb 2025\n\n\n\n\nIntel partners with Japanese research institution for next-generation quantum computer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16 Jan 2025\n\n\n\n\nUS Department of Energy announces $625 million funding opportunity to establish five new quantum research centers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nThe architecture of a supercomputer: A journey into advanced HPC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in Middle East\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDCD>Connect |  Investment MENA - Sponsorship Brochure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 Oct 2024\n\n\n\n\nBiden administration weighing up sales cap on AI chips to Middle Eastern countries - report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nMENA's next growth frontiers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nIsrael-1\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\nJensen Huang\n\n\nIsrael\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

It will serve as a hub for advancing computing, communication, and cyber technologies and further support UF\u2019s work to integrate AI across the curriculum.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis building will not only advance the future of science, it is a symbol of what is possible when universities relentlessly focus on a future that is brighter,\u201d said UF Board of Trustees Chair Mori Hosseini. \u00a0\u201cThis building will propel AI education and research that will improve lives, bolster industry and create economic growth across the state and around the world.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0UF alumnus and NVIDIA co-founder Chris Malachowsky, the building\u2019s namesake, played a key role collaborating with architects to design its facade. The building is supported by $110 million from the state, as well as additional private and college funds. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe fields of AI and data science are of central importance in building a better world,\u201d Malachowsky said. \u201cI\u2019m honored to further UF\u2019s world-class capabilities in these areas by supporting the talent and interdisciplinary collaboration that will allow the university to lead during this time of unprecedented opportunity.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0With support from Malachowsky and Silicon Valley-based AI and accelerated computing company NVIDIA, UF is the first and only university in the country to offer every student the opportunity to learn about AI and how it applies in their fields. UF is also nationally recognized as a model for how the U.S. can build a competitive AI workforce, proactively working with universities, colleges, and K-12 schools on how to effectively integrate AI into their teaching.\u00a0\u00a0In 2020, UF announced that Malachowsky and NVIDIA gifted just under $60 million toward HiPerGator, one of the most powerful AI supercomputers in the country. The system, powered by 1,120 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, is now available to the university\u2019s 55,000 students. With additional state support, UF recently added more than 110 AI faculty members to the 300 already engaged in AI teaching and research. \u00a0\u00a0With its interdisciplinary focus, Malachowsky Hall will have units for various UF entities, such as the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Network, coordinated by the College of Medicine; the Biomedical AI Collaborative, and the College of Pharmacy\u2019s Consortium for Medical Marijuana Clinical Outcomes Research. The engineering spaces will serve as the headquarters for the Department of Computer & Information Science & Engineering, the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, the Florida Institute for Cybersecurity Research, the Florida Semiconductor Institute, and the Warren B. Nelms Institute for the Connected World. The hall also contains maker spaces for innovation in the fields of virtual reality, internet of things, as well as robotics and includes labs for AI, robotics, and cybersecurity.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cUF is giving students and faculty more tools and opportunities to move the needle than we\u2019ve seen in a generation,\u201d said UF President Ben Sasse. \u201cIn a space designed to fuel breakthroughs and boost multidisciplinary collaboration, this building is a critical component of UF\u2019s push to build one of the most forward-thinking and comprehensive research and teaching institutions of our time.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0Undergraduate and graduate students from any college and discipline will have access to data analytic courses through the Informatics Institute's data science certificate programs. These programs build on data and software courses that facilitate cross-college interactions, allowing students to be nimble in their approaches to multifaceted problems.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to the ribbon cutting and tours of the facility, students also participated in a \u201cfireside chat\u201d between UF President Ben Sasse and NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang. The event, moderated by engineering interim dean Forrest Masters, was live streamed. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nBlake Trauschke/\nNovember 3, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\u00a0\nUniversity of Florida,Gainesville, FL 32611\nnews@ufl.edu\n3523920186\n\n\nNews Categories \n\nAgriculture + Environment\nArts + Media\nBusiness + Economics\nCampus + Community\nEducation\nGovernment + Society\nHealth + Science\n\n\n\nFor Faculty  \n\nFaculty Resources\nSenior Communicators\n\n\n\nFor Media\n\nContact\nSubscribe to News Releases\nUF Facts for Media\nUF Administration\nUF Directory\nHurricane Hub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2025\r\n                                  University of Florida\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nPrivacy Statement\n\n\nAcceptable Use Policy\n\n\nText Only\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Having posted its Q3 2024 earnings results, NVIDIA also revealed that it achieved a record-setting revenue for the quarter. This was, of course, higher than expectations. NVIDIA\u2019s earnings-per-share (EPS) also came in above all expectations, making for what looks like an overall outstanding fiscal quarter for the graphics and AI-focused tech company.\nNVDIA posted its Q3 2024 earnings results in a press release on its investor relations website this week. In said results, the company achieved a revenue of $18.12 billion USD. That was around $2 billion over the $16.12 billion expectations of Wall Street analysts. As for EPS, the company put up a Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.02. The Whisper number called for $3.47 per share, while Wall Street was expecting $3.18 per share. It\u2019s also worth noting that this was up around six times NVIDIA\u2019s reported EPS in Q3 2023, which came in at $0.58 per share. It was also up 49 percent from Q2 2024.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) stock has bounced up and down following the release of its Q3 2024 earnings results.Source: Google\n\nSafe to say, NVIDIA overperformed against all expectations of the company. It\u2019s fairly easy to see why as well. NVIDIA has still done well with its GPUs and gaming technology, bringing DLSS graphics technology to a wealth of new titles, the most recent notable one being Starfield. The company is also blazing the trail in artificial intelligence technology as the craze around it catches fire. Earlier this year, CEO Jensen Huang pointed out that \u201cAI is at an inflection point,\u201d and the company has made huge moves to be part of a large portion of it.\nBetween gaming and AI alone, NVIDIA appears fit for the future, but we\u2019ll see if it can keep up the momentum in quarters ahead. For more financial reporting on NVIDIA and other companies reporting fiscal results, stay tuned to Shacknews for the latest news and updates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTJ Denzer\nSenior News Editor\n\n\n\nTJ Denzer is a player and writer with a passion for games that has dominated a lifetime.

Developers using the microservice can connect their AI applications to business data wherever it resides across clouds and data centers. It adds NVIDIA-optimized RAG capabilities to AI foundries and is part of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, available in AWS Marketplace.\nCadence, Dropbox, SAP and ServiceNow are among the pioneers working with NVIDIA to build production-ready RAG capabilities into their custom generative AI applications and services.\n\u201cGenerative AI applications with RAG capabilities are the next killer app of the enterprise,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cWith NVIDIA NeMo Retriever, developers can create customized generative AI chatbots, copilots and summarization tools that can access their business data to transform productivity with accurate and valuable generative AI intelligence.\u201d\nGlobal Leaders Enhance LLM Accuracy With NeMo Retriever\r\nElectronic systems design leader Cadence serves companies across hyperscale computing, 5G communications, automotive, mobile, aerospace, consumer and healthcare markets. It is working with NVIDIA to develop RAG features for generative AI applications in industrial electronics design.\n\u201cGenerative AI introduces innovative approaches to address customer needs, such as tools to uncover potential flaws early in the design process,\u201d said Anirudh Devgan, president and CEO of Cadence. \u201cOur researchers are working with NVIDIA to use NeMo Retriever to further boost the accuracy and relevance of generative AI applications to reveal issues and help customers get high-quality products to market faster.\u201d\nCracking the Code for Accurate Generative AI Applications\r\nUnlike open-source RAG toolkits, NeMo Retriever supports production-ready generative AI with commercially viable models, API stability, security patches and enterprise support.\nNVIDIA-optimized algorithms power the highest accuracy results in Retriever\u2019s embedding models. The optimized embedding models capture relationships between words, enabling LLMs to process and analyze textual data.\nUsing NeMo Retriever, enterprises can connect their LLMs to multiple data sources and knowledge bases, so that users can easily interact with data and receive accurate, up-to-date answers using simple, conversational prompts. Businesses using Retriever-powered applications can allow users to securely gain access to information spanning numerous data modalities, such as text, PDFs, images and videos.\nEnterprises can use NeMo Retriever to achieve more accurate results with less training, speeding time to market and supporting energy efficiency in the development of generative AI applications.\nReliable, Simple, Secure Deployment With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\r\nCompanies can deploy NeMo Retriever-powered applications to run during inference on NVIDIA-accelerated computing on virtually any data center or cloud. NVIDIA AI Enterprise supports accelerated, high-performance inference with NVIDIA NeMo, NVIDIA Triton Inference Server\u2122, NVIDIA TensorRT\u2122, NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM and other NVIDIA AI software.\nTo maximize inference performance, developers can run their models on NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips with TensorRT-LLM software.\nAvailability\r\nDevelopers can sign up for early access to NVIDIA NeMo Retriever.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company\u2019s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling industrial digitalization across markets. NVIDIA is now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.

The key reasons for the growth that, at the time of publication, amounted to 246.88% since January 1 are Nvidia\u2019s significant involvement with artificial intelligence (AI) and its overall dominant position in the semiconductor market.\nAdditionally, Nvidia received a significant boost on Monday, November 13, after it announced a new advanced AI chip that is to ship in Q2, 2024. The news further bolstered the company\u2019s stock, and as of Tuesday, it recorded a 10-day winning streak of ever-higher closes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Picks for you\n  \n\n\n\n                  Here\u2019s why Bitcoin\u2019s pullback is a buy signal and not a bear market warning\n              \n1 hour ago\n\n\n\n                  Economist says the real Trump trade is ditching U.S. stocks for foreign markets\n              \n4 hours ago\n\n\n\n                  How Dogecoin could trigger next market crash, according to commodity strategist\n              \n7 hours ago\n\n\n\n                  Legal expert warns Ripple v.

Source: Finbold and ChatGPT\nWhile ChatGPT considers this range the most likely, the AI conceded that there are other possible scenarios for the stock in the following two months. According to the language model, things may turn out even better for the semiconductor giant should enthusiasm reach a boiling point, and it may go as high as $650.\nIt also assessed that things might yet go slightly worse for Nvidia primarily due to the relatively tense situation between the U.S. and China and developments like Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) ordering advanced chips from Huawei rather than the American semiconductor giant.\u00a0\nHowever, the price range in this bearish scenario presents a relative stagnation rather than a major decline as it stands between $450 and $500.\nChatGPT offers a possible bearish scenario for NVDA for January 1, 2024. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT\nNvidia price analysis\nWhile it is impossible to say for certain how Nvidia will perform in the future, its growth so far in 2023 is undeniable. At the last market close, its stock stood at $496.54 \u2013 meaning it rose by 2.13% in the last 24 hours.\nNVDA 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold\nThe strong performance has, by the time of publication, continued into extended hours trading, and Nvidia shares are up another 0.55%.

He explained that the GH200 connects NVIDIA\u2019s Grace Arm CPU with its H200 GPU using a chip-to-chip interconnect called NVLink, at an astonishing one terabyte per second.\nEach processor has direct access to the high-performance HBM and efficient LPDDR5X memory. This configuration results in 4 petaflops of processing power and 600GB of memory for each superchip.\nAWS and NVIDIA connect 32 Grace Hopper Superchips in each rack using a new NVLink switch. Each 32 GH200 NVLink-connected node can be a single Amazon EC2 instance. When these are integrated with AWS Nitro and EFA networking, customers can connect GH200 NVL32 instances to scale to thousands of GH200 Superchips\n\u201cWith AWS Nitro, that becomes basically one giant virtual GPU instance,\u201d Huang said.\nThe combination of AWS expertise in highly scalable cloud computing plus NVIDIA innovation with Grace Hopper will make this an amazing platform that delivers the highest performance for complex generative AI workloads, Huang said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see the infrastructure, but it extends to the software, the services and all the other workflows that they have,\u201d Selipsky said, introducing NVIDIA DGX Cloud on AWS.\nThis partnership will bring about the first DGX Cloud AI supercomputer powered by the GH200 Superchips, demonstrating the power of AWS\u2019s cloud infrastructure and NVIDIA\u2019s AI expertise.\nFollowing up, Huang announced that this new DGX Cloud supercomputer design in AWS, codenamed Project Ceiba, will serve as NVIDIA\u2019s newest AI supercomputer as well, for its own AI research and development.\n\nNamed after the majestic Amazonian Ceiba tree, the Project Ceiba DGX Cloud cluster incorporates 16,384 GH200 Superchips to achieve 65 exaflops of AI processing power, Huang said.\nCeiba will be the world\u2019s first GH200 NVL32 AI supercomputer built and the newest AI supercomputer in NVIDIA DGX Cloud, Huang said.\nHuang described Project Ceiba AI supercomputer as \u201cutterly incredible,\u201d saying it will be able to reduce the training time of the largest language models by half.\nNVIDIA\u2019s AI engineering teams will use this new supercomputer in DGX Cloud to advance AI for graphics, LLMs, image/video/3D generation, digital biology, robotics, self-driving cars, Earth-2 climate prediction and more, Huang said.\n\u201cDGX is NVIDIA\u2019s cloud AI factory,\u201d Huang said, noting that AI is now key to doing NVIDIA\u2019s own work in everything from computer graphics to creating digital biology models to robotics to climate simulation and modeling.\n\u201cDGX Cloud is also our AI factory to work with enterprise customers to build custom AI models,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThey bring data and domain expertise; we bring AI technology and infrastructure.\u201d\nIn addition, Huang also announced that AWS will be bringing four Amazon EC2 instances based on the NVIDIA GH200 NVL, H200, L40S, L4 GPUs, coming to market early next year.\nSelipsky wrapped up the conversation by announcing that GH200-based instances and DGX Cloud will be available on AWS in the coming year.\n\nYou can catch the discussion and Selipsky\u2019s entire keynote on AWS\u2019s YouTube channel.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Corporate | Data Center | Deep Learning | Software | SupercomputingTags: DGX Cloud | NVIDIA NeMo \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It\u2019s heavy lifting that makes large language models widely available so every business can adopt them with tools like NVIDIA NeMo, a framework for customizing LLMs.\nIn a new generative AI test \u200cthis round, 1,024 NVIDIA Hopper architecture GPUs completed a training benchmark based on the Stable Diffusion text-to-image model in 2.5 minutes, setting a high bar on this new workload.\nBy adopting these two tests, MLPerf reinforces its leadership as the industry standard for measuring AI performance, since generative AI is the most transformative technology of our time.\nSystem Scaling Soars\nThe latest results were due in part to the use of the most accelerators ever applied to an MLPerf benchmark. The 10,752 H100 GPUs far surpassed the scaling in AI training in June, when NVIDIA used 3,584 Hopper GPUs.\nThe 3x scaling in GPU numbers delivered a 2.8x scaling in performance, a 93% efficiency rate thanks in part to software optimizations.\nEfficient scaling is a key requirement in generative AI because LLMs are growing by an order of magnitude every year. The latest results show NVIDIA\u2019s ability to meet this unprecedented challenge for even the world\u2019s largest data centers.\n\nThe achievement is thanks to a full-stack platform of innovations in accelerators, systems and software that both Eos and Microsoft Azure used in the latest round.\nEos and Azure both employed 10,752 H100 GPUs in separate submissions. They achieved within 2% of the same performance, demonstrating the efficiency of NVIDIA AI in data center and public-cloud deployments.\n\nNVIDIA relies on Eos for a wide array of critical jobs. It helps advance initiatives like NVIDIA DLSS, AI-powered software for state-of-the-art computer graphics and NVIDIA Research projects like ChipNeMo, generative AI tools that help design next-generation GPUs.\nAdvances Across Workloads\nNVIDIA set several new records in this round in addition to making advances in generative AI.\nFor example, H100 GPUs were 1.6x faster than the prior-round training recommender models widely employed to help users find what they\u2019re looking for online. Performance was up 1.8x on RetinaNet, a computer vision model.\nThese increases came from a combination of advances in software and scaled-up hardware.\nNVIDIA was once again the only company to run all MLPerf tests. H100 GPUs demonstrated the fastest performance and the greatest scaling in each of the nine benchmarks.\n\nSpeedups translate to faster time to market, lower costs and energy savings for users training massive LLMs or customizing them with frameworks like NeMo for the specific needs of their business.\nEleven systems makers used the NVIDIA AI platform in their submissions this round, including ASUS, Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, Lenovo, QCT and Supermicro.\nNVIDIA partners participate in MLPerf because they know it\u2019s a valuable tool for customers evaluating AI platforms and vendors.\nHPC Benchmarks Expand\nIn MLPerf HPC, a separate benchmark for AI-assisted simulations on supercomputers, H100 GPUs delivered up to twice the performance of NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs in the last HPC round. The results showed up to 16x gains since the first MLPerf HPC round in 2019.\nThe benchmark included a new test that trains OpenFold, a model that predicts the 3D structure of a protein from its sequence of amino acids. OpenFold can do in minutes vital work for healthcare that used to take researchers weeks or months.\nUnderstanding a protein\u2019s structure is key to finding effective drugs fast because most drugs act on proteins, the cellular machinery that helps control many biological processes.\nIn the MLPerf HPC test, H100 GPUs trained OpenFold in 7.5 minutes.\u00a0 The OpenFold test is a representative part of the entire AlphaFold training process that two years ago took 11 days using 128 accelerators.\nA version of the OpenFold model and the software NVIDIA used to train it will be available soon in NVIDIA BioNeMo, a generative AI platform for drug discovery.\nSeveral partners made submissions on the NVIDIA AI platform in this round.

Businesses can then deploy their customized models with NVIDIA AI Enterprise software to power generative AI applications, including intelligent search, summarization and content generation.\nIndustry leaders SAP SE, Amdocs and Getty Images are among the pioneers building custom models using the service.\n\u201cEnterprises need custom models to perform specialized skills trained on the proprietary DNA of their company \u2014 their data,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s AI foundry service combines our generative AI model technologies, LLM training expertise and giant-scale AI factory. We built this in Microsoft Azure so enterprises worldwide can connect their custom model with Microsoft\u2019s world-leading cloud services.\u201d\n\u201cOur partnership with NVIDIA spans every layer of the Copilot stack \u2014 from silicon to software \u2014 as we innovate together for this new age of AI,\u201d said Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft. \u201cWith NVIDIA\u2019s generative AI foundry service on Microsoft Azure, we\u2019re providing new capabilities for enterprises and startups to build and deploy AI applications on our cloud.\u201d\nIndustry Leaders Building Tailored, Timely LLMs \r\nNVIDIA\u2019s AI foundry service can be used to customize models for generative AI-powered applications across industries, including enterprise software, telecommunications and media. Once ready to deploy, enterprises can use a technique called retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to connect their models with their enterprise data and access new insights.\nAs the first customer of NVIDIA DGX Cloud on Microsoft Azure, SAP plans to use the service and optimized RAG workflow with NVIDIA DGX Cloud and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software running on Azure to help customize and deploy Joule\u00ae, its new natural language generative AI copilot.\n\u201cJoule draws on SAP\u2019s unique position at the nexus of business and technology, and builds on our relevant, reliable and responsible approach to Business AI,\u201d said Christian Klein, CEO and member of the Executive Board of SAP SE. \u201cIn partnership with NVIDIA, Joule can help customers unlock the potential of generative AI for their business by automating time-consuming tasks and quickly analyzing data to deliver more intelligent, personalized experiences.\u201d\nAmdocs, a leading provider of software and services to communications and media companies, is optimizing models for the Amdocs amAIz framework to speed adoption of generative AI applications and services for telcos globally.\n\u201cGenerative AI technology presents an incredible opportunity for service providers to reinvent the way they engage with customers,\u201d said Shuky Sheffer, president and CEO at Amdocs. \u201cLeveraging NVIDIA\u2019s and Microsoft's technology to power the Amdocs amAlz framework will bring new GenAI-powered applications to customers faster and enable them to benefit from the immense potential of generative AI, while also providing enterprise-grade security, reliability and performance.\u201d\nCurated, Optimized Models for Custom Generative AI \r\nCustomers using the NVIDIA foundry service can choose from several NVIDIA AI Foundation models, including a new family of NVIDIA Nemotron-3 8B models hosted in the Azure AI model catalog. Developers can also access the Nemotron-3 8B models on the NVIDIA NGC\u2122 catalog, as well as community models such as Meta\u2019s Llama 2 models optimized for NVIDIA for accelerated computing, which are also coming soon to the Azure AI model catalog.\nOptimized with 8 billion parameters, the Nemotron-3 8B family includes versions tuned for different use cases and have multilingual capabilities for building custom enterprise generative AI applications.\nNVIDIA DGX Cloud Now Available on Microsoft Azure Marketplace\r\nNVIDIA DGX Cloud AI supercomputing is available today on Azure Marketplace. It features instances customers can rent, scaling to thousands of NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs, and comes with NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, including NeMo, to speed LLM customization.\nThe addition of DGX Cloud on the Azure Marketplace enables Azure customers to use their existing Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment credits to speed model development with NVIDIA AI supercomputing and software.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise software is now integrated into Azure Machine Learning, adding NVIDIA\u2019s platform of secure, stable and supported AI and data science software. This brings NeMo and NVIDIA Triton Inference Server\u2122 to Azure\u2019s enterprise-grade AI service.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise is also available on Azure Marketplace, providing businesses worldwide with broad options for production-ready AI development and deployment of custom generative AI applications.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company\u2019s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling industrial digitalization across markets.

Brent Seales, chair of the University of Kentucky Computer Science Department, who has dedicated over a decade to developing methods to digitally unfurl and read the delicate Herculaneum scrolls.\nTurbocharging these efforts is Nat Friedman, the CEO of GitHub and the organizer of the Vesuvius Challenge, whose commitment to open-source innovation has fostered a community where such historical breakthroughs are possible.\nTo become the first to decipher text from the scrolls, Farritor, who served as an intern at SpaceX, harnessed the GeForce GTX 1070 to accelerate his work.\nWhen Rome Meets RAM: Older GPU Helps Uncover Even Older Text\nIntroduced in 2016, the GTX 1070 is celebrated among gamers, who have long praised the GPU for its balance of performance and affordability.\nInstead of gaming, however, Farritor harnessed the parallel processing capabilities of the GPU to accelerate the ResNet deep learning framework, processing data at speeds unattainable by traditional computing methods.\nFarritor is not the only competitor harnessing NVIDIA GPUs, which have proven themselves as indispensable tools to Vesuvius challenge competitors.\nLatin Lingo and Lost Text\nDiscovered in the 18th century in the Villa of the Papyri, the Herculaneum scrolls have presented a challenge to researchers. Their fragile state has made them nearly impossible to read without causing damage. The advent of advanced imaging and AI technology changed that.\nThe project has become a passion for Farritor, who finds himself struggling to recall more of the Latin he studied in high school. \u201cAnd man, like what\u2019s in the scrolls \u2026 it\u2019s just the anticipation, you know?\u201d Farritor said.\nThe next challenge is to unearth passages from the Herculaneum scrolls that are 144 characters long, echoing the brevity of an original Twitter post.\nEngaging over 1,500 experts in a collaborative effort, the endeavor is now more heated than ever.\nPrivate donors have upped the ante, offering a $700,000 prize for those who can retrieve four distinct passages of at least 140 characters this year \u2014 a testament to the value placed on these ancient texts and the lengths required to reclaim them.\nAnd Farritor\u2019s eager to keep digging, reeling off the names of lost works of Roman and Greek history that he\u2019d love to help uncover.\nHe reports he\u2019s now thinking about Rome \u2014 and what his efforts might help discover \u2014 not just every day now, but \u201cevery hour.\u201d \u201cI think anything that sheds light on that time in human history is gonna be significant,\u201d Farritor said.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AI \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

To enable customers to realize the full potential of generative AI, HPE is partnering with NVIDIA to build systems with the required power, efficiency and scalability to support these applications.\u201d\n\u201cGenerative AI can power unprecedented transformation but places unprecedented demands on enterprise infrastructure,\u201d said Yuanqing Yang, chairman and CEO of Lenovo. \u201cWorking closely with NVIDIA, Lenovo is building efficient, accelerated systems with the networking, computing and software needed to power modern AI applications.\u201d\nNetworking Purpose-Built to Accelerate AI\r\nFor peak AI workload efficiency, Spectrum-X combines the extreme performance of the Spectrum-4 Ethernet switch; the NVIDIA BlueField\u00ae-3 SuperNIC, a new class of network accelerators for supercharging hyperscale AI workloads; as well as acceleration software. Spectrum-X complements BlueField-3 DPUs, the world\u2019s most advanced infrastructure computing platform.\nSpectrum-4 is the world\u2019s first 51Tb/sec Ethernet switch for AI, providing highly effective data throughput at scale and under load while minimizing network congestion for multi-tenant, AI cloud workloads. Its intelligent, fine-tuned routing technology enables maximum utilization of network infrastructure at all times.\nBlueField-3 SuperNICs are designed for network-intensive, massively parallel computing, offering up to 400Gb/s RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) network connectivity between GPU servers and boosting performance for AI training and inference traffic on the east-west network inside the cluster. They also enable secure, multi-tenant data center environments, ensuring deterministic and isolated performance between tenant jobs. Boasting a power-efficient, half-height, half-length PCIe form factor, BlueField-3 SuperNICs are ideal for enterprise-class servers.\nAcceleration software powering Spectrum-X features NVIDIA software development kits such as Cumulus Linux, Pure SONiC and NetQ \u2014 which together drive the platform\u2019s breakthrough performance \u2014 and the NVIDIA DOCA\u2122 software framework, which is at the heart of BlueField.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise provides frameworks, pretrained models and development tools for secure, stable and supported production AI. NVIDIA AI Workbench allows developers to quickly create, test and customize pretrained generative AI models on a PC or workstation \u2014 then scale them to virtually any data center or cloud.\nNVIDIA Israel-1 Supercomputer Powered by Spectrum-X\r\nSpectrum-X also enables the NVIDIA Israel-1 supercomputer, a reference architecture for next-generation AI systems. Israel-1 is a collaboration with Dell Technologies, using Dell PowerEdge XE9680 servers powered by the NVIDIA HGX\u2122 H100 eight-GPU platform and BlueField-3 DPUs and SuperNICs with Spectrum-4 switches.\nAvailability\r\nNew systems from Dell, HPE and Lenovo featuring the complete NVIDIA AI stack are expected in the first quarter of next year.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company\u2019s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling industrial digitalization across markets.

Based on NVIDIA Hopper\u2122 architecture, the platform features the NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPU with advanced memory to handle massive amounts of data for generative AI and high performance computing workloads.\nThe NVIDIA H200 is the first GPU to offer HBM3e \u2014 faster, larger memory to fuel the acceleration of generative AI and large language models, while advancing scientific computing for HPC workloads. With HBM3e, the NVIDIA H200 delivers 141GB of memory at 4.8 terabytes per second, nearly double the capacity and 2.4x more bandwidth compared with its predecessor, the NVIDIA A100.\nH200-powered systems from the world\u2019s leading server manufacturers and cloud service providers are expected to begin shipping in the second quarter of 2024.\n\u201cTo create intelligence with generative AI and HPC applications, vast amounts of data must be efficiently processed at high speed using large, fast GPU memory,\u201d said Ian Buck, vice president of hyperscale and HPC at NVIDIA. \u201cWith NVIDIA H200, the industry\u2019s leading end-to-end AI supercomputing platform just got faster to solve some of the world\u2019s most important challenges.\u201d\nPerpetual Innovation, Perpetual Performance Leaps\r\nThe NVIDIA Hopper architecture delivers an unprecedented performance leap over its predecessor and continues to raise the bar through ongoing software enhancements with H100, including the recent release of powerful open-source libraries like NVIDIA TensorRT\u2122-LLM.\nThe introduction of H200 will lead to further performance leaps, including nearly doubling inference speed on Llama 2, a 70 billion-parameter LLM, compared to the H100. Additional performance leadership and improvements with H200 are expected with future software updates.\nNVIDIA H200 Form Factors\r\nNVIDIA H200 will be available in NVIDIA HGX H200 server boards with four- and eight-way configurations, which are compatible with both the hardware and software of HGX H100 systems. It is also available in the NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper\u2122 Superchip with HBM3e, announced in August.\n\r\nWith these options, H200 can be deployed in every type of data center, including on premises, cloud, hybrid-cloud and edge. NVIDIA\u2019s global ecosystem of partner server makers \u2014 including ASRock Rack, ASUS, Dell Technologies, Eviden, GIGABYTE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Ingrasys, Lenovo, QCT, Supermicro, Wistron and Wiwynn \u2014 can update their existing systems with an H200.\nAmazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will be among the first cloud service providers to deploy H200-based instances starting next year, in addition to CoreWeave, Lambda and Vultr.\nPowered by NVIDIA NVLink\u2122 and NVSwitch\u2122 high-speed interconnects, HGX H200 provides the highest performance on various application workloads, including LLM training and inference for the largest models beyond 175 billion parameters.\nAn eight-way HGX H200 provides over 32 petaflops of FP8 deep learning compute and 1.1TB of aggregate high-bandwidth memory for the highest performance in generative AI and HPC applications.\nWhen paired with NVIDIA Grace\u2122 CPUs with an ultra-fast NVLink-C2C interconnect, the H200 creates the GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip with HBM3e \u2014 an integrated module designed to serve giant-scale HPC and AI applications.\nAccelerate AI With NVIDIA Full-Stack Software\r\nNVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing platform is supported by powerful software tools that enable developers and enterprises to build and accelerate production-ready applications from AI to HPC. This includes the NVIDIA AI Enterprise suite of software for workloads such as speech, recommender systems and hyperscale inference.\nAvailability\r\nThe NVIDIA H200 will be available from global system manufacturers and cloud service providers starting in the second quarter of 2024.\nWatch Buck\u2019s SC23 special address on Nov. 13 at 6 a.m. PT to learn more about the NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPU.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

So the first question that I will ask and look for, would be the company\u2019s business.Source: Supermicro.comSupermicro (SMCI) is headquartered in San Jose, California, and has manufacturing operations in Silicon Valley, the Netherlands, and Taiwan. It is one of the largest producers of high-performance and high-efficiency servers, and its products are used by a wide range of customers, including data centers, cloud computing providers, and artificial intelligence companies.What are servers, you might ask?Well, a server is a computer program or device, that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called clients. Servers are used to host and deliver services, such as web pages, email, and databases.And one of the basic blocks to build a server is in fact, computer chips. The AI chips that have propelled NVIDIA to dizzying heights need to be built into servers before ChatGPT, web pages can run or get stored. SMCI produces various kinds of servers. It has a longstanding partnership with NVIDIA Corp., Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD).Source: Supermicro.comSMCI\u2019s Revenue & Margin TrendsSource: TIKR.comJudging from the revenue growth trend of SMCI, we can relate back to its YTD performances.Over the last 10 years, I would say that revenue growth has been choppy \u2013 some good growth in the early part, and some slowdown as well. But for FY 2022 and YTD 2023, we see revenue growing in the 30%-40% region.Source: TIKR.comGross margins and net margins are decent, but honestly, nothing worth shouting out loud. The recent growth in revenue has helped buoy its gross margins and net margins. SMCI\u2019s Cash flow & balance sheetSource: TIKR.comThere are not many solid trends when looking at SMCI\u2019s cash flow.SMCI\u2019s free cash flow over the last 10 years is largely affected by its change in inventory reconciliation. Particularly for Q4\u201923, cash flow used in operations was USD 9 million vs generated USD 198 million in Q3,23, due to higher accounts receivable, offset by lower inventory and higher accounts payable from backend loaded shipments due to supply constraints. Source: TIKR.comDebt-wise, even though there seems to be a surge for FY 2022, SMCI\u2019s debt-to-equity ratio looks well-managed. In FY 2023, the total debt repaid amount was USD 1.39 billion, which parred down the debt-to-equity ratio down to 15.69%.Source: TIKR.comWith the assurance that the company is not overutilizing its debt, the impressive improvement in its returns on equity can be attributed to better selling margins, not via an over-leveraged balance sheet.Risks of SMCI\u2019s business modelPredictability and the momentum of growth are key and inherent when a company is showing good growth.Even though the AI tailwind that SMCI is riding on seems inevitable, it is not the only company in the server space. Its margins do not suggest it is a company with a strong economic moat. Source: SMCI 10-K pg 30SMCI\u2019s business model of selling and providing servers is mainly one-off. Should demand or server take an unlikely dip, SMCI would be unable to adjust spending in time to compensate for any sales shortfall.The semiconductor sphere is also notoriously cyclical \u2013 any downturns hurt the entire value chain.SMCI Prospects: Is it worthy to be in your portfolio?The year 2023 brought a prospect and a tailwind that no one foresaw 1 year ago.In fact, one year ago, everyone was painting a bleak prospect for the semiconductor industry:Source: Asia NikkeiAccording to World Semiconductor Trade Statistics, the world semiconductor market will shrink in 2023 as server investments slow.We saw cautious revenue and earnings guidance from Intel, TSMC, and Samsung. But not all firms saw a tough 2023. Source: TIKR.comSMCI saw its most impressive growth during that period, as revenue surged to a historical high.Source: SEMI July 2023According to Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI), equipment spending for most regions is expected to return to growth in 2024. If the forecasts hold ground, SMCI and another semiconductor cohort might be beneficiaries of next year\u2019s growth spurt.SMCI\u2019s Tough CompetitionFrom the margins of SMCI, it can be deduced that the server market does not hold much competitive advantage. The market share analysis further confirms the thesis.Source: history-computer.comSMCI holds the 7th spot in terms of market share ranking. The top 3 market leaders hold some level of market share more than the rest of the players, but not with wide margins.There are two sides of a coin to this. On one side, SMCI can quickly scale and acquire market share. On the flip side, SMCI would need to be wary of stiff competition as well. Source: SMCI Q1\u201924 presentationSMCI\u2019s growth rate since 2022 has been impressive and also worrisome \u2013 it had been growing above the industry average but has also seen headwinds whipsaw the growth rate.Will I Add SMCI To My Portfolio?Fundamentally, SMCI is a good company. Apart from the highly competitive industry that will limit margin expansion, the company has grown well and benefitted from the AI tailwind.The concerns that could halt its growth, lie with the industry risk of cyclicity that cannot be hedged or mitigated. Buying at a discount would provide an ample margin of safety. Then again, the bull camps would argue that if growth rates continue to ride on the semiconductor 2024 recovery, wouldn\u2019t today\u2019s price be a fair price to go long?Food for thought.

Usually, anything involving the capital market subjects itself to debate. However, it would take significant verbal gymnastics to claim NVDA is anything close to a bargain.\nWe just need to look at some facts. Currently, Nvidia stock trades at nearly 118x trailing earnings and over 25x forward earnings. Its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio clocks in at 5.38x, well above the sector median 1.37x. NVDA also trades at 37.16x trailing-year sales and almost 44x book value. Practically every common valuation metric pings overvalued relative to the underlying industry\u2019s average stat.\nAbout the only way you can claim NVDA is a bargain is by assuming projections for artificial intelligence and machine learning are either understated or that Nvidia can grab more market share than anticipated. Maybe it\u2019s a bit of both. Nevertheless, the heat tied to NVDA also opens doors for alternative stocks to buy.\nGranted, nothing can truly compare to Nvidia stock at the moment. But if you\u2019re worried about holding the bag, these stocks to buy may offer much better value.\nDell Technologies (DELL)\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\nAmong the alternatives to Nvidia stock, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) carries a distinct risk. On Thursday, the consumer electronics and data server specialist is scheduled to release its earnings report for the third quarter. Back in Q2, the company crushed expectations, delivering earnings per share of $1.74 on revenue of $22.9 billion. In contrast, estimates called for EPS of $1.14 and $20.9 billion, respectively.\nOf course, market observers will be hoping for a repeat performance. And the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. Since the start of the year, DELL gained 82% of equity value. It\u2019s not an Nvidia stock, to be sure. However, DELL makes for a solid alternative for stocks to buy in the technology space. Still, a lot could be riding on the Q3 results so keep that in mind.\nAnd even if DELL disappoints, it might be worth picking up the discount. Dell is aggressively moving into practical applications of generative AI. At that point, you might counter that Dell isn\u2019t doing anything that\u2019s remarkably different from the competition. Maybe not. But it does trade at an attractive forward price-earnings (PE) ratio of 10.82x. That\u2019s hard to overlook.\nIBM (IBM)\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\nI\u2019m fully aware that IBM (NYSE:IBM) doesn\u2019t get much coverage compared to Nvidia stock and that\u2019s for good reason. For the longest time across various initiatives and reorganizations, IBM has frustrated and disappointed stakeholders. For example, it gained about 31% of equity value \u2013 over the past five years. For context, the Dow Jones moved up roughly 39% during the same period.\nSo, in many ways, IBM is the antithesis of Nvidia stock. Nevertheless, investors are finally waking up to this opportunity. In the trailing month, IBM returned 8%. Against the trailing half-year period, it jumped over 20%. As I argued months before, IBM is attractive because it\u2019s one of the top pioneers of AI and machine learning. Such acumen doesn\u2019t just disappear.\nAlso, I did Big Blue as one of the alternative stocks to buy relative to NVDA because of its value proposition. Currently, IBM trades at 20.6x trailing-year earnings and 15.55x forward earnings. These stats sit below the sector median values of 26.39x and 21.66x, respectively. Also, Big Blue offers a big dividend of 4.28%. Does Nvidia stock do that? No.\nIntel (INTC)\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\nOver the past five years, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares lost 11% of equity value. So, while you might think IBM is boring, at least it provided a positive return for its stakeholders. For the ultimate in frustration \u2013 at least as far as this list of alternative stocks to buy is concerned \u2013 INTC takes top dubious honors. However, Intel might pull a Sandra Bullock.\nBullock of course famously won both a Razzie and an Oscar. It\u2019s possible that Intel could be moving out of its Razzie phase and breaking into the main spotlight. Since the start of the year, INTC swung up over 64%. Even better, the underlying business enjoys fundamental justification for the rally. For instance, its Q3 earnings beat estimates because of gains in its foundry business and surging interest in AI.\nNaturally, some have questioned the sustainability of the rally, leading to institutional trades selling call options. In my opinion, this dynamic looks like a gamma squeeze, a feedback loop that forces traders holding a bearish position to maintain their hedge.\nMore recently, traders appear to be buying large volume of calls (instead of selling them), which could lead to higher open-market prices for INTC.\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

For example, you could throw your entire savings at Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and probably do OK over the long run. But, if you want to capture Nvidia\u2019s upside without the steep price tag, look to stocks that will benefit from Nvidia\u2019s success.  Nvidia\u2019s wide reach means that it\u2019s involved in many peripheral industries. At the same time, Nvidia doesn\u2019t stand alone. The company depends on various subcontractors and manufacturers to facilitate its product lines. Finding companies within those subindustries can help you diversify your existing Nvidia-centric portfolio and capture wider industry trends. At the same time, stocks that will benefit from Nvidia\u2019s success are often much cheaper than Nvidia itself \u2013 meaning a value for bargain hunters. Fabrinet (FN)   a close up image of a semiconductor   Source: Shutterstock Fabrinet (NYSE:FN) specializes in the standardized manufacturing of electronic and technical subcomponents. The subcomponents are then sold to companies like Nvidia as part of their final assembly. Picture how car companies outsource components like doors before assembling complete vehicles in their facilities. That\u2019s basically how Fabrinet fits into Nvidia\u2019s ecosystem. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips In Fabrinet\u2019s case, they focus on manufacturing optical communication components and advanced lasers for companies like\u00a0Nvidia and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).  Beyond Nvidia, industry experts foresee how the booming semiconductor sectors and enthusiasm for AI can propel Fabrinet to new heights. Following a robust earnings report, analysts have raised the consensus price target for Fabrinet to $165. That increase is primarily due to the promising opportunities tied to artificial intelligence. FN\u2019s stock surged by nearly 40% following this collective upgrade, although it still trades below the established price target. It\u2019s worth noting that Nvidia accounts for 13% of Fabrinet\u2019s revenue. But other AI-focused data communications companies are increasingly drawn to the company. But, importantly, Fabrinet\u2019s success doesn\u2019t solely hinge on Nvidia. It stands to benefit from the broader AI trend, regardless of which companies ultimately emerge as victors. Onto Innovation (ONTO)   Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.   Source: Shutterstock Onto Innovation (NYSE:ONTO) is a semiconductor support company set to benefit from Nvidia\u2019s success. Furthermore, its role is indispensable to the broader industry. This support provider remains at the forefront of the AI-driven wave. Its year-to-date surge of 75% marks the beginning of this hardware company\u2019s journey.   Story Continues In August, the company announced a $100 million deal centered around its Dragonfly inspection system. This hardware is critical in identifying flaws and defects in third-party semiconductors, an essential operational concern for companies like Nvidia.Onto Innovation has firmly established itself within the semiconductor supply chain. Semiconductor inspection requirements are rigid and position Onto as a key player in the sector. The services offered by Onto cater to a diverse clientele, given the integral role that chips now play in most electronic systems.AI demand continues to rise. At the same time, the existing GPU and technology stack market, currently valued at $3.16 billion, will expand to $25.5 billion by 2030. As companies compete to lead the charge in the semiconductor \u201cspace race,\u201d Onto Innovation stands in a prime position to capitalize on this trend, regardless of the ultimate victor in this dynamic industry.Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX)  Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) website displayed on a modern smartphone  Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comRecursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RXRX) stock popped in July, fueled by a game-changing development\u2014a direct investment of $50 million from Nvidia. But, since that month\u2019s peak, RXRX\u2019s stock has experienced a sharp decline. Today, it trades at nearly a third of its previous price. But there\u2019s been no headwind to Nvidia\u2019s enthusiasm about RXRX.RXRX harnesses the power of AI to swiftly and accurately identify cross-gene relationships and interactions within its extensive and ever-expanding genetic dataset. The notable advantage of their platform\u2019s technology lies in its ability to dramatically reduce drug discovery timelines by running generative AI processes. Drug discovery typically entails the lengthy and intricate process of identifying which combinations of compounds are therapeutically effective when interacting with genes.Manual management of drug discovery, involving sifting through millions of data points, can be akin to searching for a needle in a haystack. RXRX\u2019s distinctive and viable AI platform has the potential to be revolutionary in the field of therapeutics. The involvement of a company like Nvidia should certainly arouse interest, and RXRX stands to gain from Nvidia\u2019s direct involvement.On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

When 2023 started, many analysts and financial intuitions were announcing that the year would see recession and economic contraction. But those recession fears proved to be unfounded this year. Barclays in its 2024 outlook report said that this whole recession debate is misplaced. Barclays said that if anyone anticipates a recession akin to the 2008 financial crisis, potentially leading to the collapse of major economies, it can be confidently stated, based on Barclays' analysis, that such a recession is not projected to occur in 2024.  However, Barclays expects 2024 to be marred with uncertainties and volatility. Barclays said that central banks could go easy with their rate-hike policies in the year. The institution also expects inflation to cool this year. But the report warned that investors should be careful what they wish for since major rate cuts would only happen if there are signs of strong economic contraction. Analysts and institutions always make headlines when they make predictions but it\u2019s more interesting to see their evaluations in hindsight. When 2023 started, Jim Cramer also made some predictions about the stock market and named some stocks he thought would gain this year. We covered most of those stocks in our article titled Jim Cramer's Top Stock Picks for 2023. In this article we take a look at how Jim Cramer\u2019s stock picks performed in 2023. Some top names include Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).   Jim Cramer's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2023   Evaluating Performance of Jim Cramer's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2023 10. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) YTD Stock Performance Through November 22: +230% In February 2023, Jim Cramer said that the semiconductor industry got slaughtered but he still stuck with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) because the company makes chips that power AI. One of the reasons why Cramer stuck with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), according to him, is that when stocks like Nvidia bottom they come back up so quickly one does not get a chance to \u201cget back in.\u201d Cramer said that he stuck with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and then ChatGPT came in, which was a \u201cgame changer\u201d according to the analyst. There\u2019s no end in sight for revenue growth for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) thanks to the AI boom that started with ChatGPT because the company\u2019s GPUs are widely used to power generative AI software.   Story Continues NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have gained about 237% year to date through November 2023.O\u2019keefe Stevens Advisory made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\u201cThis quarter, we actively reduced our position in our favorite company,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA). Over the past several years, I have consistently noted the concentration of the top 5 holdings in our portfolio, with NVDA comprising 26% of the last quarter\u2019s 40%. The business, management, and outlook are nothing short of excellent. The business has a dominant market share in a rapidly growing market with competition seemingly years behind, though, fighting hard to gain share. Gross margin is expected to exceed 70% in 2024 and expand in 2025, reflecting the premium customers pay for their advanced technology. Revenue growth of 30%+ on a $50B base and a return on equity over 50%. If this isn\u2019t the best business in the world currently, certainly it is in the top 5. Like Nvidia, Jim Cramer also likes Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).9. Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH)YTD Stock Performance Through November 22: -61%Jim Cramer had called Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) the \u201cgolden boy\u201d of renewable energy when the year 2023 started. In February 2023, Cramer wrote in a tweet:\u201cEnphase is such a horse. Still the best clean energy play. Just love it.\u201d Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) shares have lost about 61% year to date through November 22. Jim Cramer\u2019s \u201cgolden boy\u201d of the renewable energy space saw its shares plummet in October after Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) posted mixed Q3 results and gave a disappointing Q4 guidance. For the fourth quarter Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) expects revenue in the range of $300 million to $350 million, much lower than the analyst consensus estimate of $597 million.Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 910 hedge funds shows that 40 hedge funds reported having stakes in Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) as of the end of the September quarter.ClearBridge SMID Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\u201cWe exited our position in\u00a0Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), in the IT sector, which designs, manufactures and sells semiconductor equipment for the residential solar photovoltaic industry. New regulations within California, as well as improving supply chain dynamics in Europe, have placed additional pressure on the company. Facing concerns surrounding weaker U.S. residential demand, decelerating revenue growth trends and falling prices compressing margins, we elected to sell the position and redeploy our assets to other, higher-conviction holdings.\u201d 8. American Electric Power Company Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP)YTD Stock Performance Through November 22: -17%American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP) was one of Jim Cramer\u2019s stock picks when the year 2023 started. He kept giving bullish calls for American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP) throughout the year. In September Cramer said:\u201cYou buy it...This won\u2019t just be a smooth ride, 4.2% yield is good. A lot of people sold this stock because the short term rates have gone so high because the Fed has raised rates so rapidly. That\u2019s why it\u2019s going down, nothing to do with the company which is incredibly well run. I would be a buyer of American Electric Power.\u201d American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP) shares have lost about 17% year to date through November 22.Earlier this month American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP) posted Q3 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $1.77, beating estimates by $0.07. Revenue in the quarter fell about 3.6% year over year to $5.3 billion, missing estimates by $80 million.American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP) also narrowed its earnings guidance.7. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)YTD Stock Performance Through November 22: -12%Jim Cramer had predicted in January 2023 that Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) could be one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 index this year given the geopolitical environment and the expected increase in demand for weapons. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) has lost about 12% year to date through November 22.Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:\u201cOur other purchase was\u00a0Northrop Grumman Corporation\u00a0(NYSE:NOC), a US defense contractor whose stock price experienced a pullback. We like that Northrop has a larger presence than its rivals in the most favorable subcategories of the defense industry-namely, nuclear weapons, space systems, and what\u2019s known as C4ISR (which stands for Command, Control, Communications, Computers. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance). C4ISR refers to digital systems that translate data picked up from different sensors-such as an incoming hypersonic missile or advancing troops-into a common format, and then escalate key information to the right people These differentiated technologies are especially relevant in a time of increased geopolitical tensions. Northrop also benefits from large barriers to entry in this stable industry, which should enable continued strong earnings and cash flow.\u201d 6. Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL)YTD Stock Performance Through November 22: -0.8%Jim Cramer had picked Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) for 2023 as he expected the company to have its multi-year rally ahead of it. In April 2022, Jim Cramer said that \u201cthis is Halliburton\u2019s time.\u201d Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) has remained almost flat in 2023 but over the past six months it has gained about 24%. In October Cramer reiterated his bullish stance on Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) after weak quarterly results.\u201cLet Halliburton [stock] come down, but this company\u2019s going to do just fine if oil stays at these prices,\u201d Cramer said. Carillon Eagle Mid Cap Growth Fund made the following comment about Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\u201cHalliburton Company\u00a0(NYSE:HAL) provides equipment and services to the global energy industry. The stock was an impressive outperformer in the quarter, as the recent sharp increase in oil prices should translate to healthy levels of North American shale activity in the remainder of the year and into 2024. Halliburton also is poised to benefit from the ongoing multi-year international and offshore upstream investment cycle.\u201d Like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Halliburton is a notable\u00a0 stock Jim Cramer picked for 2023.\u00a0 Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer's Top 5 Stock Picks for 2023.Suggested articles:10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Talking About 25 Most Racist States in America Ranked by Hate Crimes 25 Richest Criminals of All Time Disclosure: None.

Try These 3 Small-Cap Chip Stocks      Omor Ibne Ehsan   November 13, 2023 5 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.46%    AMD   -0.80%     ACMR   +0.05%    JKS   -0.17%    ATOM   -2.86%      With the Nasdaq taking investors on a roller coaster ride this year, many have sought refuge in mega-cap tech names like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, some of the best bargains right now are in smaller semiconductor stocks flying under Wall Street\u2019s radar. While not rivals to titans like Nvidia or AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), these chip makers boast massive growth potential and trade at bargain basement-level valuations. Snapping up shares now could deliver outsized returns in 2023 and beyond.  Of course, small caps carry elevated risks, especially when considering looming recession fears. But with valuations compressed, many of these semiconductor stocks are trading near historic lows. Their risk-reward outlooks appear skewed to the upside for patient investors with a long-term focus. Rather than chasing over-extended momentum stocks, it pays to discover under-followed names in beaten-down sectors. While semiconductor demand remains robust long-term, inventory gluts and falling memory chip prices have stung in the near term. This dynamic has created bargains in many small-cap chip stocks. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Atomera (ATOM)   AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocks. semiconductor stocks to buy and hold   Source: Shutterstock Atomera (NASDAQ:ATOM) is one of the most beaten-down names in the semiconductor space. Its stock has plunged nearly 87% from 2021 highs. However, with shares trading near multi-year lows, the stock\u2019s risk/reward is skewed sharply higher for long-term investors. A strategic partnership provides major validation of Atomera\u2019s technology and could open the floodgates for new licensing deals. Atomera\u2019s core technology is Mears Silicon Technology (MST), which enhances semiconductor performance by modifying materials at the atomic level. MST improves speed, power efficiency, and reliability without requiring changes to manufacturing tools. It has broad applications in analog, logic, and memory chips.  Despite strong customer validation, Atomera has struggled to generate meaningful revenue. The company\u2019s business model centers on upfront licensing fees and royalties, but deals have been slow to materialize. However, a landmark partnership with semiconductor giant STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) changes that narrative. In April, STM licensed MST for use across multiple next-generation products. While financial terms weren\u2019t disclosed, this deal will provide vital production validation and credibility. As STM integrates MST into its manufacturing process, investors will increasingly realize that MST is a proven solution ready for mass adoption. Royalties from STM shipments will start flowing in over the next 18-24 months. I estimate these could reach tens of millions annually within three years, meaningful for a company with negligible revenue today. More importantly, success with STM should open up enormous new licensing opportunities.   Story Continues Its balance sheet is solid, with $20 million in cash against minimal debt. Thus, I don\u2019t see any liquidity issues ahead for at least two years. The sole Wall Street analyst with a price target of $13 per share implies almost 150% upside in one year for ATOM stock.JinkoSolar (JKS)  The JinkoSolar logo displayed on a plain white wall.  Source: Lutsenko_Oleksandr / Shutterstock.comJinkoSolar (NYSE:JKS) is not a pure-play chip stock, but the company is a major producer of silicon wafers for solar modules. It also manufactures solar cells, panels, and other components critical to the industry. While the company deals in commoditized products, JinkoSolar\u2019s scale and low-cost manufacturing in China give it a competitive advantage.With its stock down 53% from 2022 highs, JinkoSolar trades at bargain basement valuations despite strong fundamentals. It has earned $3.25 per share ($12.2 expected for all of 2023) over the past quarter but trades around just $35 per share. Thus, shares fetch less than 3-times forward earnings and less than 0.11-times forward sales.Revenue surged nearly 60% last quarter to $4.36 billion as polysilicon costs retreated. This drove gross margins to 19.3%, up from 15.7% last year. Net income is up 141% year-over-year to $181.4 million. Profitability should continue improving as lower materials costs boost margins. JinkoSolar expects full-year module shipments of 70-75 gigawatts.Of course, JinkoSolar\u2019s debt-heavy balance sheet is a risk factor to consider. However, the company is already generating positive free cash flow while reducing leverage. As profits grow, its balance sheet will steadily improve. China is in a deflationary environment which will lead to looser monetary policy, and we are looking at interest rates likely near or at their peak in most countries. Regardless, the company is managing to churn out impressive profit metrics, and I\u2019m not too worried.ACM Research (ACMR)  a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website  Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) manufactures wet-cleaning tools for semiconductor wafers at various manufacturing steps. Its proprietary technologies optimize efficiency and purity at mature process nodes. Revenue is split between logic and memory chip makers inside and outside of China. Indeed,2023 has been volatile for ACMR stock, which has tumbled 19% from its October high. However, the company\u2019s financial performance remains rock-solid. Revenue grew 26% year-over-year last quarter, driving a 68% earnings beat. The consensus estimate calls for 37% sales growth this year.Despite moderating growth in the global WFE market, ACMR continues gaining share. Its niche wet-cleaning tools are critical for producers focused on high-volume mature nodes. With expertise in advanced packaging, ACM Research also provides mission-critical technologies. Trading around 12-times earnings at this growth rate seems too cheap. The company is estimated to triple revenue by 2030 by capturing more business in China, and perhaps, globally.In the near-term, macro headwinds persist. Lingering supply chain constraints have delayed some tool deliveries. A slowdown in China adds uncertainty and may temporarily dampen orders. However, these issues don\u2019t alter ACMR\u2019s long-term trajectory. ACM Research operates in an essential subset of the semiconductor industry. As new fabs are built globally, demand for wafer cleaning tools will continue rising. But most importantly, as sanctions against China\u2019s semiconductor imports begin to roll in, ACMR seems well-positioned to receive massive amounts of domestic investment. The average Wall Street analyst sees nearly 50% upside here in the next year.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

While I\u2019m partial to the latter, owning AMD stock is not wrong. Not by a long shot.\u00a0\nInvestorPlace contributor Dana Blankenhorn recently discussed why he still owns AMD. He pointed out that Nvidia might be the leader in graphics processing units (GPUs), but AMD has done an excellent job accelerating its efforts in artificial intelligence (AI) while also taking market share in central processing units (CPUs).\nMy colleague has long positions in both AMD and NVDA. He\u2019s proof you can and SHOULD\u00a0own both stocks if you can swing it. Here\u2019s why.\nAI Is Rapidly Expanding\nThere is a reason the Magnificent Seven has delivered most of the S&P 500\u2019s performance in 2023. It has everything to do with AI. These seven stocks account for 29% of the index\u2019s total market capitalization and 29% of its performance, while the other 493 stocks account for the rest. All of them are knee-deep in machine learning.\nI know my colleague owns five of the Mag 7. I\u2019m less confident whether he owns Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). However, what\u2019s important is that he\u2019s positioned himself to benefit from the rise in AI.\u00a0\nNow, given the demise of cannabis stocks over the past three years, I\u2019m always suspicious of an overly focused portfolio. However, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question AI is a much different kettle of fish than cannabis. In 10 years, AI will undoubtedly be a big part of our lives. You can\u2019t say the same about cannabis. That\u2019s the difference.\u00a0\nAs a portfolio strategy, I don\u2019t see an issue with Blankenhorn\u2019s move. There are plenty of investors just like him. The late Charlie Munger used to say, \u201cIt\u2019s not that easy to have a vast plethora of good opportunities that are easily identified. And if you\u2019ve only got three, I\u2019d rather be in my best ideas instead of my worst,\u201d CNBC reported.\nMakes sense to me.\u00a0\nWhy Own Both? Part 1\nNvidia is, hands down, the leader in AI at the moment. The company\u2019s move to democratize AI through the launch of AI Workbench is one of many brilliant moves by CEO Jensen Huang to bring AI to the masses. It\u2019s not enough to produce superfast chips like the H100; you\u2019ve got to get businesses involved in actively using and benefiting from AI. Nvidia\u2019s doing that.\u00a0\nHowever, there is no right way to grow AI.\u00a0\nAMD recently hired one-time Cray (supercomputing) Chief Technology Officer Steve Scott. He\u2019ll work with the company and CEO Lisa Su to develop high-level AI and supercomputing at AMD. That work is bound to create some exciting products to rival Nvidia AI down the road.\nIn the meantime, as my colleague said, it continues to capture more of the CPU market at a time when PC use has returned to growth. Owning both stocks lets you cover more ground in technology\u2019s secular trends.\u00a0\nWhy Own Both? Part 2\nThis last point is one of owning non-correlating assets. Over the past few years, I\u2019ve noticed when NVDA stock goes on a tear, AMD lags behind. Conversely, as is the case right now, when AMD goes on a run, NVDA\u2019s performance seems to slow.\u00a0\nIn May 2017, I suggested that NVDA had a much better chance to hit $200 by the year\u2019s end than AMD had of hitting $16. At the time, Nvidia was trading at $142 \u2014 it split 4-for-1 in July 2021 \u2014 finishing the year at $194, just shy of $200. AMD stock in May 2017 was around $11.40. It closed the year around $10.30.\u00a0\nHowever, in 2018, the roles were reversed, with AMD gaining 71% on the year and NVDA losing 33% of its value. Over the next five years, the two companies took turns delivering exceptional performance for their shareholders. Most of the time, just one of the two moved higher.\u00a0\nThat is why owning both stocks makes sense. More often than not, their returns are relatively uncorrelated.\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

However, the recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) seemed to be precisely what the sector needed to get back on its feet. The surge in interest in AI has caused a host of tech stocks to recover and soar in 2023.\nOne of the biggest winners of the AI boom so far has been Nvidia (NVDA -2.53%), which has seen its stock rise 242% year to date. The company has become the go-to chip supplier for nearly the entire AI market, and it likely has much to offer stockholders over the long term as the industry continues to develop.\nHowever, software-focused companies like Alphabet (GOOG -2.29%) (GOOGL -2.22%) are another attractive way to back the AI market. The Google parent has used the last year to invest heavily in the sector and plans to launch a highly anticipated large language model, dubbed Gemini, next year.\nThese companies are at different stages of their journeys into the AI business, and both could be lucrative ways to profit from the sector over the long term. But which looks like the better buy now?\nNvidia\nNvidia has been the preeminent name in graphics processing units (GPUs) for years, controlling 87% of the market as of Q2 2023 (per Jon Peddie Research). Prior to last year, one of Nvidia's biggest advantages was its popularity with PC gamers, who use the company's GPUs to power their custom-built gaming machines. However, advances in AI have changed the dynamic for the company.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's most powerful GPUs are crucial hardware for companies seeking to develop, train, and deploy AI models, and demand driven by those uses has sent Nvidia's chip sales skyrocketing this year. In its fiscal Q3 2024 (which ended October 30), revenue rose 206% year over year, while operating income increased by over 1,600%. The company massively benefited from soaring demand for GPUs, which saw its data center segment achieve revenue growth of 279%. \n\nNvidia's business will likely continue growing as tech companies increasingly require more powerful chips to take their products to the next level. Yet, it will face more competition in 2024 as various chipmakers challenge Nvidia's dominance by launching new GPUs of their own. Consequently, a long-term perspective will be crucial to successfully invest in Nvidia, as its stock might not be able to replicate 2023's growth any time soon.\nAlphabet\nAlphabet's stock has risen by 54% since Jan. 1. While that figure might pale in comparison to Nvidia's rally this year, Alphabet potentially has more room for growth over the long term.\nThe company owns some of the world's most recognizable brands, such as Google, YouTube, and Android, giving it almost endless opportunities to monetize its AI technology. These brands attract billions of users daily and could be leading drivers in the public's adoption of AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloud competitors Amazon and Microsoft have slightly overshadowed Alphabet in AI this year. However, in 2024, Alphabet plans to launch Gemini, a large language model based on massive data sets that is expected to be highly competitive with OpenAI's GPT-4.\nGemini could strengthen Alphabet's position in AI as it uses the model to improve cloud services, offer more efficient advertising on Google Search and YouTube, refine video recommendations on YouTube, and even bring AI upgrades to productivity platforms like Google Docs.\nAlphabet has the brand recognition and user base to see significant success in AI over the long term, making its stock an attractive option right now.\nIs Nvidia or Alphabet the better buy?\nNvidia and Alphabet operate in very different areas of tech and AI, with one a leader in hardware and the other dominating software and services. Both companies have solid growth potential over the long term, and it would be hard to go wrong with either stock. However, Alphabet's stock is trading at a bargain valuation compared to Nvidia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData by YCharts\nAlphabet's price-to-earnings and price-to-free-cash-flow ratios are significantly lower than Nvidia's, suggesting it offers far more value. Alphabet's metrics could make it the best and cheapest way to invest in AI.\nWhile Nvidia's meteoric rise in 2023 has benefited prior investors, it has made its stock too expensive for new ones. Meanwhile, the Google parent arguably has similar potential in AI, yet is trading at a substantially better value. As a result, Alphabet is the better buy, and an exciting opportunity ahead of Gemini's launch next year.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

In Western terms, they are first cousins once removed, which refers to cousins separated by a generation, she told CNN.\n    \n\n            To be exact, Su is Huang\u2019s uncle\u2019s granddaughter, said Wu, who described identifying their relationship by researching public records, newspaper clippings and yearbooks, as well as interviewing a close family member of Huang\u2019s.\n    \n\n            \u201cWe are distant relatives,\u201d Su said with a smile,\u00a0when asked at a Consumer Technology Association (CTA) event in 2020.\n    \n\n            An Nvidia spokesperson also confirmed that Huang was related to Su as a distant cousin through his mother\u2019s side of the family. Huang declined to comment for this story, while Su did not respond to a request for comment.\n    \n\n        Similar paths\n\n\n            The link has become a point of fascination for industry watchers.\n    \n\n            In Taiwan, where Su and Huang were born six years apart and now enjoy rockstar status, the topic has been featured on local news broadcasts.\u00a0Online, users\u00a0of Reddit and\u00a0other forums have buzzed over the coincidence, while\u00a0sketches\u00a0of purported family trees have circulated on social media.\n    \n\n            \u201cI was really surprised,\u201d Wu said of her discovery. \u201cI think people in Taiwan are happy about it because the world finally sees Taiwan.\u201d\n    \n\n            Christopher Miller, author of \u201cChip War: The Fight for the World\u2019s Most Critical Technology,\u201d said he was initially astonished, too.\n    \n\n            \u201cBut in other ways, it\u2019s not surprising to find two people of Taiwanese descent at the absolute center of the chip industry,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cBecause although Taiwan is a long way from Silicon Valley, in fact, there\u2019s really no two parts of the world that are more closely networked in terms of family ties, in terms of business ties, in terms of educational ties.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia offices in Taipei\n\nI-Hwa Cheng/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            Taiwan has a long tradition of producing world-leading hardware that has propped up its economy, noted Edith Yeung, general partner at Race Capital, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm.\n    \n\n            She credited companies such as chipmaker TSMC (TSM) and electronics manufacturers ASUS, Acer and Foxconn, as leading the way, encouraging many young people to aspire to work as tech engineers.\n    \n\n            Miller echoed that view. \u201cFor almost half a century now, Taiwan\u2019s economy has been centered on electronics production, chip assembly, chip manufacturing, chip design, everything semiconductors. And if you look at Taiwan\u2019s economy today, semiconductors are the largest export,\u201d he said.\n    \n\n            \u201cThat means when young people are entering university, when they think about potential career paths, semiconductors are one of the most popular choices.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA section of an integrated circuit board on display at the Semicon Taiwan exhibition show in Taipei, Taiwan, on Tuesday, Sept. 6, 2023.

His family later relocated to Thailand for his father\u2019s job at an oil refinery.\n    \n\n            When Huang was nine, political unrest in the Southeast Asian country led his parents to send him and his brother to live briefly with relatives in Washington state, who then sent the siblings to boarding school in Kentucky.\n    \n\n            Meanwhile, Su was born in Tainan in 1969. She headed to the United States earlier, immigrating to New York City at the age of 3.\n    \n\n            Though the two grew up far away from one another, they went on to similar paths as adults.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSu speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show in January in Las Vegas. Su has become one of America\u2019s best paid executives, ranking as the\u00a0highest-earning\u00a0female CEO in the S&P 500 last year.\n\nRobyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            They picked the same field of study \u2014 electrical engineering \u2014 with Su\u00a0studying\u00a0at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Huang\u00a0attending\u00a0Oregon State University and Stanford University.\n    \n\n            Later, as they landed in the fast-moving world of semiconductors, they worked at different companies, but did share one employer.\n    \n\n            Prior to starting Nvidia in 1993, Huang worked at AMD as a microprocessor designer. Su, of course,\u00a0joined AMD too, nearly two decades later, as senior vice president and was ultimately\u00a0credited with turning around\u00a0the company.\n    \n\n        From cousins to competitors\n\n\n            Now, both executives are based in Santa Clara, California, with their respective headquarters just a 5-minute drive apart.\n    \n\n            Their companies sell hardware and software to the world\u2019s leading tech companies, in an industry poised to reach\u00a0$1 trillion\u00a0in value by 2030, according to McKinsey. In its most recent\u00a0annual report, AMD named Nvidia as a top competitor in two of its four main lines of business: gaming and data centers.\n    \n\n            The firms were once best known by gamers for selling GPUs \u2014 graphic processing units \u2014 that display visuals in video games, helping them come to life. While the two still compete in the space, their GPUs are now also being used to power generative AI, the technology that underpins newly popular systems such as ChatGPT.\n    \n\n            Nvidia\u2019s H100 GPUs, for instance, have been used by OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, to train its language model, according to the chipmaker. Those components have been compared to AMD\u2019s recently launched MI300X, which it bills as \u201cthe world\u2019s most advanced accelerator for generative AI.\u201d\n    \n\n            AMD said Tuesday while reporting earnings that it expects GPUs to bring in more than $2 billion in revenue in 2024, and that the MI300 series was forecast to become \u201cthe fastest product to ramp to $1 billion in sales in AMD history.\u201d The robust projections sent AMD\u2019s stock up nearly 10% the next day.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn AMD graphics processing unit (GPU). AMD and Nvidia were once best known in the gaming world for producing graphics chips.\n\nFlorence Lo/Reuters\n\n\n\n            The two also compete in selling gear for data centers, the physical facilities used to store troves of electronic information. They rely on chips such as central processing units (CPUs), which help computers run operating systems and programs smoothly, and data processing units (DPUs), which free up space on computers so users can perform multiple tasks at a time. AMD sells both components to businesses, as does Nvidia.\n    \n\n            In recent years, the companies have gained more mainstream recognition for providing cutting-edge technology that promises to reshape society. The processors they make are increasingly being used to help run electric cars, in addition to AI systems, bolstering a reach that had already encompassed virtually everything from PCs to PlayStations.\n    \n\n            \u201cI would say anyone who logs on the internet is likely touching not just one, but dozens and hundreds of Nvidia and AMD chips,\u201d said Miller.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA trader works the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the opening bell, on May 25, 2023, in New York City.

Is it too late to invest?\n\n\n\n\n            \u201cMost people never think about AMD or Nvidia because they never see the chips that these companies produce. But in fact, in your day-to-day life, you likely rely on both Nvidia and AMD.\u201d\n    \n\n            The AI boom in particular has supercharged shares of Nvidia, which is seen at the forefront of the tech required to train artificial intelligence. As a result, Nvidia\u2019s stock has enjoyed a\u00a0massive rally, climbing 208% so far this year.\n    \n\n            AMD\u2019s shares have also popped 73% to date in 2023, though the company is much smaller than Nvidia, Miller noted.\n    \n\n            Meanwhile, Su has emerged as one of America\u2019s highest paid executives, ranking as the\u00a0best paid\u00a0female CEO in the S&P 500 last year. She\u00a0topped\u00a0the list for both male and female CEOs of companies in the index in 2019, according to joint reviews by executive compensation analysis firm Equilar and the Associated Press.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    I would say anyone who logs on the internet is likely touching not just one, but dozens and hundreds of Nvidia and AMD chips.\n                \n\n                    Christopher Miller, author of \u201cChip War: The Fight for the World\u2019s Most Critical Technology\"\n                \n\n\n\n\n            Both chipmakers, however, may see their luck change as geopolitical tension continues to flare. Last week, Nvidia\u00a0said\u00a0in a regulatory filing that\u00a0US export controls\u00a0to China affecting some of its advanced AI chips had come into effect \u201cimmediately,\u201d weeks earlier than scheduled.\n    \n\n            The company said it did not expect \u201ca near-term meaningful impact on its financial results,\u201d though it has\u00a0pointed to\u00a0a potential \u201cpermanent loss of opportunities\u201d over such restrictions in the long run.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Nvidia HGX H100 server arranged at the company's headquarters in Santa Clara, California, US, on Monday, June 5, 2023.

This prompts the question: Is Nvidia stock set to soar even higher following the quarterly result? While no one can forecast that with absolute certainty, analysts express optimism ahead of Q3 earnings. Street expects NVDA will exceed the already lofty estimates, potentially driving an additional increase in its stock value.\n\nWith this background, let\u2019s understand what factors could boost NVDA stock.\u00a0\nFactors Supporting NVDA Stock\nThe rally in Nvidia stock is driven by the enormous demand for\u00a0AI (Artificial Intelligence), with NVDA holding a dominant position in this domain. Consequently, investors will look at NVDA\u2019s management to ensure that the AI market and demand are rapidly growing, offering a multiyear growth opportunity. Addressing this, Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso said there is already evidence of sustained high demand for NVDA\u2019s AI offerings.\nCiting Nvidia\u2019s introduction of the H200 GPU at the SC23 event, Caso said that Nvidia has traditionally not refreshed its previous Data Center GPUs. He interprets this announcement as additional evidence of NVDA accelerating its product development cycle in response to the growing AI market and evolving performance requirements. The analyst assigned a Buy rating to Nvidia stock on November 13. Further, he has a price target of $630, representing about 25% upside potential from current levels.\u00a0\nAlong with the solid AI-led demand, Nvidia is expected to surpass analysts\u2019 Q3 predictions and offer guidance that exceeds expectations.\u00a0Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland\u00a0expects much stronger Q3 results and forward guidance from Nvidia. Expressing optimism about NVDA stock, Rolland raised the price target from $600 to $625 on November 16. He noted that the company is aggressively increasing its supply to meet the heightened demand. Moreover, he highlighted that Nvidia foresees this growth continuing each quarter throughout the next year.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\n\nWhat is the Prediction for Nvidia Stock?\nWith 37 out of 38 analysts recommending a Buy, Nvidia stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating. Further,\u00a0the average NVDA stock price target\u00a0of $644.07 implies an upside potential of 27.77% from current levels over the next 12 months.\n\nBottom Line\nNvidia\u2019s leadership in the AI space, improved supply chain and product ramp-up, and strength in the Data Center and Gaming segments provide a solid foundation for future growth. This is reflected in analysts\u2019 optimistic outlooks on NVDA stock.\u00a0\u00a0\nDisclosure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\n\n\n FACEBOOK\n\n\n\n\n TWITTER\n\n\n\n\n EMAIL\n\n\n\n\n COPY LINK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNVIDIA NewsMORE  \n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX PRO Comes to Workstations and Servers for Designers, Developers, Data Scientists and Creatives to Build and Collaborate With Agentic AIGlobeNewswire 20m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces DGX Spark and DGX Station Personal AI ComputersGlobeNewswire 22m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces Spectrum-X Photonics, Co-Packaged Optics Networking Switches to Scale AI Factories to Millions of GPUsGlobeNewswire 37m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell Ultra AI Factory Platform Paves Way for Age of AI ReasoningGlobeNewswire 47m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Dynamo Open-Source Library Accelerates and Scales AI Reasoning ModelsGlobeNewswire 1h \n\n\n\nNvidia GTC 2025: Rubin, reasoning, robotics and moreSeeking Alpha 1h \n\n\n\nGeneral Motors and NVIDIA Collaborate on AI for Next-Generation Vehicle Experience and ManufacturingGlobeNewswire 2h \n\n\n\nNVIDIA and Telecom Industry Leaders to Develop AI-Native Wireless Networks for 6GGlobeNewswire 2h \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tStart Trading Futures\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n\n\n\n\nNVDA\n\n\n\n116.58\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-2.95 (-2.47%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t03:14:32 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time NVDA charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFind News\n\t\t\t\tNews\n\n\n\n\n\nGO\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n            See also:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                - Explore more categories\n            \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

For example, you could throw your entire savings at Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and probably do OK over the long run. But, if you want to capture Nvidia\u2019s upside without the steep price tag, look to stocks that will benefit from Nvidia\u2019s success.\nNvidia\u2019s wide reach means that it\u2019s involved in many peripheral industries. At the same time, Nvidia doesn\u2019t stand alone. The company depends on various subcontractors and manufacturers to facilitate its product lines. Finding companies within those subindustries can help you diversify your existing Nvidia-centric portfolio and capture wider industry trends. At the same time, stocks that will benefit from Nvidia\u2019s success are often much cheaper than Nvidia itself \u2013 meaning a value for bargain hunters.\u00a0\nFabrinet (FN)\nSource: Shutterstock\nFabrinet (NYSE:FN) specializes in the standardized manufacturing of electronic and technical subcomponents. The subcomponents are then sold to companies like Nvidia as part of their final assembly. Picture how car companies outsource components like doors before assembling complete vehicles in their facilities. That\u2019s basically how Fabrinet fits into Nvidia\u2019s ecosystem.\u00a0\nIn Fabrinet\u2019s case, they focus on manufacturing optical communication components and advanced lasers for companies like\u00a0Nvidia and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).\nBeyond Nvidia, industry experts foresee how the booming semiconductor sectors and enthusiasm for AI can propel Fabrinet to new heights. Following a robust earnings report, analysts have raised the consensus price target for Fabrinet to $165. That increase is primarily due to the promising opportunities tied to artificial intelligence. FN\u2019s stock surged by nearly 40% following this collective upgrade, although it still trades below the established price target.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Nvidia accounts for 13% of Fabrinet\u2019s revenue. But other AI-focused data communications companies are increasingly drawn to the company. But, importantly, Fabrinet\u2019s success doesn\u2019t solely hinge on Nvidia. It stands to benefit from the broader AI trend, regardless of which companies ultimately emerge as victors.\nOnto Innovation (ONTO)\nSource: Shutterstock\nOnto Innovation (NYSE:ONTO) is a semiconductor support company set to benefit from Nvidia\u2019s success. Furthermore, its role is indispensable to the broader industry. This support provider remains at the forefront of the AI-driven wave. Its year-to-date surge of 75% marks the beginning of this hardware company\u2019s journey.\nIn August, the company announced a $100 million deal centered around its Dragonfly inspection system. This hardware is critical in identifying flaws and defects in third-party semiconductors, an essential operational concern for companies like Nvidia.\nOnto Innovation has firmly established itself within the semiconductor supply chain. Semiconductor inspection requirements are rigid and position Onto as a key player in the sector. The services offered by Onto cater to a diverse clientele, given the integral role that chips now play in most electronic systems.\nAI demand continues to rise. At the same time, the existing GPU and technology stack market, currently valued at $3.16 billion, will expand to $25.5 billion by 2030. As companies compete to lead the charge in the semiconductor \u201cspace race,\u201d Onto Innovation stands in a prime position to capitalize on this trend, regardless of the ultimate victor in this dynamic industry.\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX)\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RXRX) stock popped in July, fueled by a game-changing development\u2014a direct investment of $50 million from Nvidia. But, since that month\u2019s peak, RXRX\u2019s stock has experienced a sharp decline. Today, it trades at nearly a third of its previous price. But there\u2019s been no headwind to Nvidia\u2019s enthusiasm about RXRX.\nRXRX harnesses the power of AI to swiftly and accurately identify cross-gene relationships and interactions within its extensive and ever-expanding genetic dataset. The notable advantage of their platform\u2019s technology lies in its ability to dramatically reduce drug discovery timelines by running generative AI processes. Drug discovery typically entails the lengthy and intricate process of identifying which combinations of compounds are therapeutically effective when interacting with genes.\u00a0\nManual management of drug discovery, involving sifting through millions of data points, can be akin to searching for a needle in a haystack. RXRX\u2019s distinctive and viable AI platform has the potential to be revolutionary in the field of therapeutics. The involvement of a company like Nvidia should certainly arouse interest, and RXRX stands to gain from Nvidia\u2019s direct involvement.\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

Now the semiconductor powerhouse is stepping up its AV game by seeking a talent boost in China.\nThe firm is recruiting two dozen roles for an autonomous driving team spread across Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, according to a post on its official WeChat account on Tuesday. The unit, consisting of positions in software, end-to-end platform, system integration, mapping, and product, is led by Xinzhou Wu, who is recognized for bringing smart driving features to mass-produced vehicles in China over the last few years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn August, Nvidia hired Wu, the former head of autonomous vehicles at Xpeng, a Chinese electric vehicle upstart often compared to Tesla for its commitment to smart driving. According to Wu\u2019s LinkedIn profile, he joined as Nvidia\u2019s head of automotive and serves on the executive staff team reporting directly to Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of the chip giant.\nNvidia enjoys a critical position in the self-driving space thanks to its powerful graphics cards. In September last year, the company unveiled its latest generation of automotive-grade chips known as Thor, which has a 2,000 teraflops of performance.\nIt\u2019s unsurprising that Nvidia has designated China as an important hub for its AV endeavors. Cut-throat competition in the country\u2019s auto industry has driven many electric carmakers to invest in autonomous driving, producing a pool of talent experienced in bringing the technology from R&D to mass production.\nIndeed, Wu, who serves as the head of AV at Nvidia and personally leads the China AV team, alludes to the country\u2019s critical role in potentially fueling the firm\u2019s commercial success in smart driving. According to his statement included in the job posting:\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope that the Chinese autonomous driving team can become a core force in driving the commercialization of Nvdia\u2019s autonomous driving products, tapping the country\u2019s talent and experience to create autonomous driving products for the global market.\u201d\n\nNvidia\u2019s own relationship with China is a delicate one. Under U.S. export control, the chip giant is currently barred from exporting its most powerful AI GPUs to China, one of its biggest markets, though its automotive products are not affected at the moment.\nLed by Wu, Nvidia\u2019s AV team carries out wide-ranging functions to \u201cdesign, create, and deploy\u201d AI systems for automation and autonomous vehicles, according to the post. Specifically, the unit performs AI training and testing tasks as well as real-time data processing in vehicles, which can include robotaxis, commercial fleets and passenger cars.\nWu\u2019s job hopping has had the blessing of his former boss. In a Weibo post announcing Wu\u2019s departure, Xpeng\u2019s founder and CEO He Xiaopeng expressed pride in his former employee for attaining a \u201ctop-level management role\u201d at a \u201cglobally renowned company,\u201d which turned out to be Nvidia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn social media, He and Wu have each hinted at a tie-up between Xpeng and Nvidia in the area of semiconductors. In a photo posted by Wu the day before he started at Nvidia, he was flanked by Huang and He, suggesting a close partnership between the two companies.\n\u201cTomorrow is my first day at Nvidia, and I appreciate Xiaopeng for personally escorting me here. According to Old Huang [Jensen Huang], I will still be working for Xiaopeng in the future, just without him having to pay my salary,\u201d Wu wrote in the post.\nNvidia declined to comment on the story.\nNvidia unveils Drive Thor, one chip to rule all software-defined vehicles\n\nTesla rival XPeng\u2019s head of autonomous driving quits, rumored to join Nvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nAI, autonomous driving, autonomous vehicles, China, chips, Hardware, nvidia, semiconductors, Transportation, Xpeng \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRita Liao\t\n\n\n\nReporter, China\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tRita covered Asia for TechCrunch, with a special interest in Chinese companies going global and web3 projects with real-world applications.\r\n\r\nBefore her previous writing stints with Tech in Asia and TechNode, Rita managed communications for SOSV\u2019s accelerators in Asia.

The analysts greatly increased their revenue estimates, suggesting a stark improvement in business fundamentals. Following the upgrade, the most recent consensus for NVIDIA from its 53 analysts is for revenues of US$88b in 2025 which, if met, would be a huge 97% increase on its sales over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are presumed to shoot up 133% to US$17.80. Before this latest update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$80b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$15.20 in 2025. So we can see there's been a pretty clear increase in analyst sentiment in recent times, with both revenues and earnings per share receiving a decent lift in the latest estimates.  Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA    NasdaqGS:NVDA Earnings and Revenue Growth November 26th 2023   Although the analysts have upgraded their earnings estimates, there was no change to the consensus price target of US$655, suggesting that the forecast performance does not have a long term impact on the company's valuation. These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the NVIDIA's past performance and to peers in the same industry. The analysts are definitely expecting NVIDIA's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 72% annualised growth to the end of 2025 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 28% per annum over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 16% per year. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that NVIDIA is expected to grow much faster than its industry. The Bottom Line The most important thing to take away from this upgrade is that analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates for next year, expecting improving business conditions. They also upgraded their revenue estimates for next year, and sales are expected to grow faster than the wider market. The lack of change in the price target is puzzling, but with a serious upgrade to next year's earnings expectations, it might be time to take another look at NVIDIA. With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

Data is my edge.for\u00a0Great SpeculationsFollow AuthorNov 22, 2023, 04:32pm ESTShareSaveCommentMoscow, Russia - April 7, 2019: NVIDIA video chip on the motherboard, close-upgetty\nNVIDIA Corp\u2019s\nNVDA\n stock is up more than 1,200% in the last five years and 238% year-to-date (YTD). However, even after beating fiscal 3Q24 earnings and issuing guidance that surpassed expectations, the future cash flow expectations baked into the current stock price are disconnected from reality. I think they are much too high for any reasonable investor to believe NVIDIA can achieve them. The bottom line is that the fundamentals of the business have not improved at anywhere close to the pace of the meteoric stock rise.\n\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) hype that is driving the company\u2019s stock is similar to the crypto and blockchain hype that drove other stocks to nosebleed heights only to fall back down to earth a few months after the hype wore off.\n\nBelow, I\u2019ll use my reverse discounted cash flow model to illustrate the expectations baked into NVIDIA\u2019s current stock price and quantify just how risky the current valuation is.\n\nStock Price Implies NVIDIA\u2019s Revenue Will Be Larger Than Mexico\u2019s GDP\n\nTo justify its current price of $484/share, my model shows that Nvidia would have to:\n\n\n\nimmediately improve NOPAT margin to 38% (highest ever \u2013 achieved in fiscal 2022),\ngrow revenue by consensus in fiscal 2024 (101%) and 2025 (47%), and\ngrow revenue 25% each year thereafter through fiscal 2038.\n\n\nIn this scenario, Nvidia\u2019s revenue would grow 30% compounded annually for 15 years and reach $1.45 trillion in fiscal 2038. This revenue level would be 32x TTM ended fiscal 3Q24 and higher than the 2022 GDP of countries such as Mexico, Turkey, Switzerland, and Ireland. Figure 1 illustrates the magnitude of the implied revenue growth in NVIDIA\u2019s stock price.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Tax Software Of 2022Best Tax Software For The Self-Employed Of 2022Income Tax Calculator: Estimate Your Taxes\n\nFigure 1: Implied Revenue Growth in NVIDIA\u2019s Current Stock Price Vs. Sovereign Countries\u2019 GDPNVDA DCF Implied RevenueNew Constructs, LLC\n\nFor reference, this implied revenue would be 2.3x Walmart\u2019s\nWMT\n TTM revenue, which generates the most revenue in the S&P 500 and 1.2x the combined TTM revenue of Walmart and Amazon\nAMZN\n. Furthermore, $1.45 trillion in revenue would be the 14th highest 2022 GDP in the world, right between South Korea and Mexico. See Figure 2.\n\n\nFigure 2: Implied Revenue in NVDA vs. Country GDP and Highest Revenue Generating FirmsNVDA Implied Revenue Vs GDP and PeersNew Constructs, LLC\nStock Price Implies Ridiculous Profits (NOPAT), Too\nWhile revenue vs. GDP is the more apt comparison, I also compare the implied net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) in this scenario to 2022 GDP levels. The scenario above implies Nvidia\u2019s NOPAT grows 33% compounded annually through fiscal 2038 to $549.5 billion, or 49x its TTM ended fiscal 2Q24 NOPAT.\nFor reference, this implied NOPAT would be 5.4x Apple\u2019s\nAAPL\n TTM NOPAT, which is the highest NOPAT in the S&P 500 and 1.6x the combined TTM NOPAT of Apple, Microsoft\nMSFT\n, Alphabet, JPMorgan, and Exxon Mobil (the companies with the highest TTM NOPAT in the S&P 500).\nFurthermore, $549.5 billion in profit would make Nvidia the 25th largest GDP in 2022, right between Belgium and Ireland. See Figure 3. ROIC in this scenario would also equal 68%, up from 50% in the TTM.\nFigure 3: Implied NOPAT In NVDA vs. Country GDP and Highest NOPAT Generating FirmsNVDA Implied NOPAT Vs GDP and PeersNew Constructs, LLC\nThere\u2019s 40%+ Downside Even with Massive Growth\nGiven the optimism baked into the stock price, I also quantify the downside risk should NVIDIA not achieve the lofty expectations detailed above.\nInstead, if I assume Nvidia:\n\n\nmaintains NOPAT margin at 35% (equal to TTM) and\ngrows revenue by consensus in fiscal 2024 and 2025, and\ngrows revenue by 20% each year thereafter through fiscal 2038, then\n\n\nthe stock would be worth just $290/share today \u2013 a 40% downside to the current price.\nIn this scenario, NVIDIA\u2019s revenue would grow 26% compounded annually for 15 years and reach $855.1 billion in fiscal 2038. This implied revenue would be 1.4x Walmart\u2019s TTM revenue and 73% the combined TTM revenue of Walmart and Amazon.\nThis scenario also implies Nvidia\u2019s NOPAT grows 28% compounded annually through fiscal 2038 to $296 billion. This implied NOPAT would be 3.0x Apple\u2019s TTM NOPAT and 85% the combined TTM NOPAT of Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, JPMorgan, and Exxon Mobil. This scenario also implies NVIDIA improves its ROIC to 62% in fiscal 2038, up from 50% in the TTM.\nThere\u2019s 57%+ Downside if Margins Fall to Apple Levels\nLastly, if I assume Nvidia:\n\n\nNOPAT margin falls to 26.1% (equal to Apple\u2019s TTM Margin, and above NVDIA\u2019s 10-year average of 24.9%) through 2038,\ngrows revenue by consensus in fiscal 2024 and 2025, and\ngrows revenue by 20% each year thereafter through fiscal 2038, then\n\n\nthe stock would be worth just $206/share today \u2013 a 57% downside to the current price. This scenario still implies that Nvidia generates $223 billion in NOPAT in 2038, which is 2.2x Apple\u2019s TTM NOPAT and 90% of Apple, Microsoft, and Google\u2019s\nGOOG\n combined TTM NOPAT.\nFigure 4 compares NVIDIA\u2019s implied future NOPAT in these scenarios to its historical NOPAT. For reference, I include the TTM NOPAT of Apple, which has the highest NOPAT in the S&P 500.\nFigure 4: NVIDIA\u2019s Historical and Implied NOPAT: DCF Valuation ScenariosNVDA DCF Implied NOPATNew Constructs, LLC\nThe above scenarios assume NVIDIA grows revenue, NOPAT, and FCF while change in invested capital averages 11-13% of revenue throughout each DCF scenario. For reference, NVIDIA\u2019s change in invested capital has averaged 20% of revenue over the past five years, 12% of revenue over the past decade, and 9% of revenue over the past 15 years. As a result, my conservative capital growth assumptions make the above scenarios even more optimistic than if the future capital growth rates are closer to historical rates. Most likely, the capital growth rates will be much, much higher to support the unusually high revenue growth rates that the stock prices implies the company will achieve for so long.\nDisclosure: David Trainer, Kyle Guske II, Italo Mendon\u00e7a, and Hakan Salt receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, sector, style, or theme.\nEditorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

This is a substantial step up from the H100\u2019s 80GB of HBM3 and 3.5 TB/s in memory capabilities.\n[Related: Nvidia CEO Explains How AI Chips Could Save Future Data Centers Lots Of Money]\n\n\nid\nunit-1659132512259\n\n\ntype\nSponsored post\n\n\nThe two chips are otherwise identical.\n\u201cThe integration of faster and more extensive memory will dramatically improve and accelerate HPC and AI applications,\u201d said Dion Harris, director of product go-to-market for accelerated data center solutions at Nvidia, in a briefing with journalists.\nThe Santa Clara, Calif.-based company also revealed that the H200 is part of its previously announced second-generation Grace Hopper Superchip. The GH200 combines the H200 and 141GB of HBM3e with its 72-core, Arm-based Grace CPU and 480GB of LPDDR5X memory on an integrated module.\nH200 Arrives In Servers, Clouds In Q2 2024\nNvidia said the H200 will become available in systems and cloud instances starting in the second quarter of next year through HGX H200 server boards in four-GPU and eight-GPU configurations.\nThose supporting the chip include server vendors such as Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro as well as cloud service providers Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud plus small but rising cloud players CoreWeave, Lambda and Vultr.\nExisting HGX H100-based systems are software- and hardware-compatible with the H200, which will allow server and cloud vendors to easily update those systems with the new GPU, Harris said.\nMemory Race Heats Up Among Rivals\nNvidia revealed the H200 details as rival AMD plans to push the memory envelope with its upcoming AI chip. Called the Instinct MI300X, the GPU will come with 192GB of HBM3 and a 5.2 TB/s memory bandwidth, which would put it well above the H200 in capacity and bandwidth.\nIntel, too, plans to ramp up the HBM capacity of its Gaudi AI chip, saying in a recent presentation that the third generation, due out next year, will increase to 144GB from the predecessor\u2019s 96GB HBM2e capacity. The company\u2019s other AI chip family, the Intel Max Series GPU, currently goes up to 128GB of HBM2, but it plans to increase the chip\u2019s capacity in future generations.\n\u201cWhen you look at what\u2019s happening in the market, model sizes are rapidly expanding, demanding increased computational power, as well as faster and stronger memory subsystems,\u201d Harris said.\nHow H200 Compares To H100 And A100\nNvidia is promoting the H200 as a big upgrade over both the H100, which debuted in 2022, and its predecessor, the A100, which debuted in 2020, when it comes to two popular large language models (LLMs) and a handful of high-performance computing workloads.\nFor running inference on the GPT-3 175B LLM, the H200 is 60 percent faster than the H100. For inference on the Llama2 70B LLM, the GPU is even faster, getting a 90 percent boost.\nFor HPC, Nvidia decided to compare the H200 to the A100, saying that the new GPU is two times faster on average across the CP2K, GROMACS, ICON, MILC, Chroma and Quantum Espresso benchmarks.\nWhen eight H200s are combined in an HGX H200-based system, the system can provide \u201c32 petaflops of FP8 deep learning compute and 1.1TB of aggregate bandwidth memory for the highest performance in generative AI and HPC applications,\u201d according to Nvidia.\nNvidia is promising to unleash further performance improvements in the future through software updates, like it did with the recently released TensorRT-LLM software library.\n\u201cOur relentless pursuit of energy efficient performance improvements through hardware and software remain a key focus as we move forward,\u201d Harris said.\nThe H200 is based on the same Hopper architecture that powers the H100. This means, outside the new memory capabilities, the H200 sports the same features, such as the Transformer Engine, which speeds up LLMs and other deep learning models based on the transformer architecture.\nGH200: Cloud Access Today, In Servers Soon\nWhile the H200 won\u2019t arrive in systems and cloud services until several months from now, the GPU will be available in the second-generation Grace Hopper Superchip, the GH200, much sooner.\nNvidia said the GH200 is available now in early access from two cloud service providers, Lambda and Vultr. Other cloud companies expected to offer GH200-based instances include Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and CoreWeave, with the latter set to open instances in the first quarter of 2024.\nAs for server vendors, ASRock Rack, Asus, Gigabyte and Ingrasys plan to start shipping GH200-based systems by the end of the year.\nThe company said the Grace Hopper Superchip family has been adopted through early-access programs by more than 100 enterprises, organizations and government agencies so far, including the NASA Ames Research Center and global energy company TotalEnergies.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It explores distinct options strategies for each scenario, providing investors with a comprehensive toolkit to navigate Nvidia\u2019s future.Investing with options: Nvidia - 3 long term scenariosIn the ever-evolving world of technology, Nvidia stands as a titan, its influence extending not only to AI-related stocks but also the entire US technology sector. As Nvidia prepares to report its earnings results on Tuesday after the US market close, the anticipation is palpable. Analysts and investors remain bullish on the outlook, yet recent developments from Microsoft and Tencent suggest a potential dip in demand in the medium term. Microsoft is forging ahead with its own purpose-built AI chips, expected to be delivered as early as next year, and Tencent\u2019s recent acquisition of a significant inventory of AI chips from Nvidia hints at a possible frontloading of demand.  Related article:\u00a0Earnings preview Is the Intel moment coming for NvidiaAgainst this backdrop, it becomes crucial to explore the potential trajectories that Nvidia could follow in the long term. In this article, we will delve into three such scenarios, each accompanied by a distinct options strategy. These strategies, designed for use over an extended timeframe, will provide investors with a comprehensive toolkit to navigate the potential twists and turns in Nvidia\u2019s journey. Stay tuned as we unpack these scenarios and strategies, using the insights from the referenced article as our starting point. Let\u2019s embark on this exciting exploration of Nvidia\u2019s future.        Important note: the strategies and examples provided in this article are purely for educational purposes. They are intended to assist in shaping your thought process and should not be replicated or implemented without careful consideration. Every investor or trader must conduct their own due diligence and take into account their unique financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment objectives before making any decisions. Remember, investing in the stock market carries risk, and it's crucial to make informed decisions. \u00a0Bullish outlook        Long Call Option Strategy on NVIDIA Corp (NVDA)ExecutionBuy to Open 1 20-Dec-2024 470 Call @ $115.50Premium and RiskPremium Paid Per Option: $115.50 (debit)Total Premium Paid: $11,550.00 USDMax Risk: The premium paid, $11,550.00Margin Impact: $0.00 EURBreakeven Point: $585.50\u00a0RationaleThe investor has a bullish outlook, expecting NVDA to rise above $585.50 by expiration.Strategy SummaryThe investor employs a bullish strategy with a long call, accepting the risk of the premium for the chance at unlimited profit.Your insights matter to us. Rate this article.Neutral / range bound outlook        Short Strangle Option Strategy on NVIDIA Corp (NVDA)ExecutionSell to Open 1 19-Jan-2024 595 Call @ $7.85Sell to Open 1 19-Jan-2024 420 Put @ $9.40Premium and RiskNet Premium Received Per Option: $17.55 (credit)Total Premium Received: $1,755.00 USDMax Risk: Unlimited due to the naked callMargin Impact: \u20ac2,372.13Upper Breakeven Point: $612.55Lower Breakeven Point: $402.45\u00a0RationaleThe trader is utilizing a neutral strategy, anticipating NVDA to stay within a specific range until expiration (63 days from now). As this is more of an income strategy, the time frame is a little shorter than the other strategies in this article.\u00a0 Strategy SummaryThis strangle strategy reflects a neutral stance on the market, with the goal of profiting from NVDA's stock staying between the breakeven points. \u00a0 If you have the underlying stock, you could view this strategy as a way to catch extra yield on the stock: $1755.- credit received on a capital of $49179.- (based on the current value of the stock * 100 for 1 contract) = 3.57% over a period 63 days. If the price of the stock moves outside the breakeven points, you have the underlying stock to cover these excess moves. Having the underlying stock alters the strategy from undefined to defined risk. Do take into account, that once you're using your stock as cover, this will limit the potential upside of your investment at the upper-strike price of the strangle. On the downside, if you don't have enough cash to cover an assignment of the put, you will have to sell your existing stock to cover that position, possibly resulting in extra loss.Your insights matter to us.

The strategy didn't correctly mention the downside risk when using 2 puts rather than 1. This has been corrected. Our apologies for the confusion.ExecutionSell to Open: 1x 20-Dec-2024 650 Call @ 55.50Buy to Open: 1x 20-Dec-2024 420 Put @43.20Premium and RiskNet Premium Received: 12.60 USD (credit)Total Premium Received: 1,260.00 USDMax Risk: Unlimited due to selling a call (unless you have the underlying stock, which changes the naked call to a covered one)Margin Impact: 3,745.35 EUR (if you have the underlying stock, the margin impact will be much lower)Breakeven Point: $662.60\u00a0RationaleThe trader is implementing a collar strategy to hedge a long position in NVDA stock. By selling a call, they receive a premium which partially offsets the cost of the put. This setup is typically used when holding the underlying asset and wanting protection against a downturn while capping the upside potential.\u00a0 Strategy SummaryThis collar strategy protects against a significant drop in NVDA's stock price with the purchased put, but also limits the upside gains by selling a call. It's a risk management tactic, trading off profit potential for downside protection. The actual risk and breakeven would depend on the price of the NVDA stock owned by the trader. This strategy suggests a neutral to slightly bullish outlook, willing to forgo some upside for protection.\u00a0ConclusionIn summary, we\u2019ve explored three options strategies for Nvidia - a long call, a short strangle, and a protective put collar. Each offers unique benefits and risks, providing a range of tools for different market scenarios.Did this article meet your expectations? Your feedback counts!

According to Valeo's complaint, Mohammad Moniruzzaman, an engineer for NVIDIA who used to work for its company, had mistakenly showed its source code files on his computer as he was sharing his screen during a meeting with both firms in 2022. Valeo's employees quickly recognized the code and took screenshots before Moniruzzaman was notified of his mistake.To note, Valeo and NVIDIA are working together on an advanced parking and driving assistance technology offered by a manufacturer to its customers. Valeo used to be in charge of both software and hardware sides of the manufacturer's parking assistance tech. In 2021, however, the the bigger corporation won the contract to develop its parking assistance software. Valeo wrote in its lawsuit that its former employee, who helped it develop its parking and driving assistance systems, had realized that his exposure and access to its proprietary technologies would make him \"exceedingly valuable\" to NVIDIA.Moniruzzaman allegedly gave his personal email unauthorized access to Valeo's systems to steal \"tens of thousands of files\" and 6GB of source code shortly after that development. He then left Valeo a few months later and took the stolen information with him when he was given a senior position at NVIDIA, the complaint reads. He also worked on the very same project he was involved in for Valeo, which is why he was present at that video conference.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementValeo said its former employee admitted to stealing its software and that German police found its documentation and hardware pinned on Moniruzzaman's walls when his home was raided. According to Bloomberg, he was already convicted of infringement of business secrets in a German court and was ordered to pay \u20ac14,400 ($15,750) in September.In a letter dated June 2022, NVIDIA's lawyers told the plaintiff's counsel that the company \"has no interest in Valeo's code or its alleged trade secrets and has taken prompt concrete steps to protect [its] client\u2019s asserted rights.\" Valeo still sued the company earlier this month, however, and said that NVIDIA has \"saved millions, perhaps hundreds of millions, of dollars in development costs, and generated profits that it did not properly earn and to which it was not entitled\" by stealing its trade secrets.This is but another proof that competition continues to heat up in the autonomous driving market. Back in 2017, Waymo accused Uber of colluding with its former employee, Anthony Levandowski, to steal over 14,000 confidential and proprietary design files. Levandowski was sentenced to 18 months in prison, but he was pardoned six months later by then President Donald Trump.If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

According to the report, the three new products have been modified from a base version of the H100 GPU, a high-end GPU used for AI training that was also blocked from being sold to China in August 2022.Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.If Nvidia confirms the move, it would be another sign of how important the Chinese market is for US chip firms and how far some of them are prepared to go to remain compliant with Washington\u2019s evolving restrictions.AdvertisementUS chip maker Micron Technology, whose products were subjected to a partial sales ban in China earlier this year, had a booth for the first time at this month\u2019s China International Import Expo in Shanghai in a show of its commitment to the Chinese market.Advertisement"

\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNvidia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupply chain independence is going to be challenging for the US and could take decades, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Wednesday.\n\u201cWe are somewhere between a decade and two decades away from supply chain independence,\u201d Huang said during a chat at New York Times\u2019 DealBook summit on Wednesday. \u201cWe should absolutely go down the journey of it, [but it\u2019s] not a really practical thing for a decade or two.\u201d\nA recent Congressional Research Service report on the CHIPS Act \u2013 the bill that would provide funding for US foundries to break ground \u2013 noted that 90% of chip production is based in Taiwan, which is something that Huang also emphasized in his speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSupply chain independence is going to be really challenging,\u201d he said, pointing out that Nvidia\u2019s latest AI servers have 35,000 parts, from all over the world, including Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\u2019s (TSMC) facilities in Arizona will only produce around 50,000 wafers per month when they hit full capacity, according to reports, which is only about half of the capacity of one of the company\u2019s Gigafabs in Taiwan \u2013 which it has four of.\u00a0\n\u201cThe TSMC Arizona fab is effectively a paperweight in any geopolitical tension or war [with China over Taiwan] due to the fact that it still requires sending the chips back to Taiwan for packaging,\u201d Dylan Patel, chief analyst at SemiAnalysis, told The Information in a recent interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA globally connected supply chain\nDespite consistent efforts, \u201cno government has been able to achieve true self-sufficiency in semiconductor manufacturing to date,\u201d noted a recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nEven though Taiwan is the epicenter of all things chip manufacturing, it\u2019s still reliant on China as a supply chain partner as the country is a major manufacturer of complementary components to its chips or for services like packaging and testing.\nTaiwanese government data shows China is Taiwan\u2019s largest export market, and largest source of imports, though, like the US, it\u2019s also trying to rid itself of reliance on the country.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the very first time in 2022 that Taiwanese investment in Southeast Asia and South Asia actually outpaced [that going to] China,\u201d Taiwan\u2019s minister of economic affairs Wang Mei-hua recently told Nikkei Asia. \u201cWe think the trend will only continue because of the push from the US-China trade tensions.\u201d\nWang also emphasized that Taiwan closely adheres to US export controls and rules, using the US Entity List as a guideline for its tech sector, particularly semiconductors, with US experts assisting in understanding these rules, amid tightened US restrictions on AI chip sales and semiconductor equipment exports to certain countries.\nNvidia remains bullish on China\nNvidia\u2019s Huang is quite familiar with the US restrictions on chip exports to China, with the company\u2019s high-margin AI-focused GPUs being at the center of recent export bans \u2013 which also had the side effect of including certain consumer-grade GPUs in the criteria leading to skewed prices worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn stage at the summit, Huang said that his company continues to work on chips that would be regulatory compliant.\n\u201cWe have to come up with new chips that comply with the regulation, and once we comply with the regulation, we\u2019ll go back to China,\u201d he

The integrated solution will feature quad GH200 processors, scaling up to tens of thousands of Grace Hopper Superchip nodes to provide organizations with unmatched supercomputing agility and quicker AI training. This configuration will also be part of a supercomputing solution for generative AI that HPE introduced today.\n\u201cOrganizations are rapidly adopting generative AI to accelerate business transformations and technological breakthroughs,\u201d said Justin Hotard, executive vice president and general manager of HPC, AI and Labs at HPE. \u201cWorking with NVIDIA, we\u2019re excited to deliver a full supercomputing solution for generative AI, powered by technologies like Grace Hopper, which will make it easy for customers to accelerate large-scale AI model training and tuning at new levels of efficiency.\u201d\nNext-Generation AI Supercomputing Centers\nA vast array of the world\u2019s supercomputing centers are powered by NVIDIA Grace Hopper systems. Several top centers announced at SC23 that they\u2019re now integrating GH200 systems for their supercomputers.\nGermany\u2019s J\u00fclich Supercomputing Centre will use GH200 superchips in JUPITER, set to become the first exascale supercomputer in Europe. The supercomputer will help tackle urgent scientific challenges, such as mitigating climate change, combating pandemics and bolstering sustainable energy production.\nJapan\u2019s Joint Center for Advanced High Performance Computing \u2014 established between the Center for Computational Sciences at the University of Tsukuba and the Information Technology Center at the University of Tokyo \u2014 promotes advanced computational sciences integrated with data analytics, AI and machine learning across academia and industry. Its next-generation supercomputer will be powered by NVIDIA Grace Hopper.\nThe Texas Advanced Computing Center, based in Austin, Texas, designs and operates some of the world\u2019s most powerful computing resources. The center will power its Vista supercomputer with NVIDIA GH200 for low power and high-bandwidth memory to deliver more computation while enabling bigger models to run with greater efficiency.\nThe National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign will tap NVIDIA Grace Hopper superchips to power DeltaAI, an advanced computing and data resource set to triple NCSA\u2019s AI-focused computing capacity.\nAnd, the University of Bristol recently received funding from the UK government to build Isambard-AI, set to be the country\u2019s most powerful supercomputer, which will enable AI-driven breakthroughs in robotics, big data, climate research and drug discovery. The new system, being built by HPE, will be equipped with over 5,000 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips, providing 21 exaflops of AI supercomputing power capable of making 21 quintillion AI calculations per second.\nThese systems join previously announced next-generation Grace Hopper systems from the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, Los Alamos National Laboratory and SoftBank Corp.\nGH200 Shipping Globally and Available in Early Access from CSPs\nGH200 is available in early access from select cloud service providers such as Lambda and Vultr. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure today announced plans to offer GH200 instances, while CoreWeave detailed plans for early availability of its GH200 instances starting in Q1 2024.\nOther system manufacturers such as ASRock Rack, ASUS, GIGABYTE and Ingrasys will begin shipping servers with the superchips by the end of the year.\nNVIDIA Grace Hopper has been adopted in early access for supercomputing initiatives by more than 100 enterprises, organizations and government agencies across the globe, including the NASA Ames Research Center for aeronautics research and global energy company TotalEnergies.\nIn addition, the GH200 will soon become available through NVIDIA LaunchPad, which provides free access to enterprise NVIDIA hardware and software through an internet browser.\nLearn more about Grace Hopper and other supercomputing breakthroughs by joining NVIDIA at SC23.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | Climate | High-Performance Computing | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | Science | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But the GPU-maker insists its new device is more than just a superlative.\nSo what exactly is a SuperNIC? An Nvidia explainer describes it as a \"new class of networking accelerator designed to supercharge AI workloads in Ethernet-based networks.\" Key features include high-speed packet reordering, advanced congestion control, programmable I/O pathing, and, critically, integration with Nvidia's broader hardware and software portfolio.\nIf that sounds like what a SmartNIC or DPU would do, you're not wrong. The SuperNIC is even based on a current Nvidia DPU, the BlueField-3.\n\nNvidia's BlueField-3 SuperNIC promises Infiniband-ish network performance \u2013 if you buy Nvidia's fancy 51.2Tbit/sec switches \u2013 Click to enlarge. Source: Nvidia.\n\nThe difference is the SuperNIC is designed to work alongside Nvidia's own Spectrum-4 switches as part of its Spectrum-X offering.\nNvidia's senior veep for networking, Kevin Deierling, emphasized in an interview with The Register that the SuperNIC isn't a rebrand of the DPU, but rather a different product.\nEast-west vs north-south\nBefore considering the SuperNIC, it's worth remembering that SmartNICs/IPUs/DPUs are network interface controllers (NICs) that include modest compute capabilities \u2013 sometimes fixed-function ASICs, with or without a couple of Arm cores sprinkled in, or even highly customizable FPGAs.\nMany of Intel and AMD's SmartNICs are based around FPGAs, while Nvidia's BlueField-3 class of NICs pairs Arm cores with a bunch of dedicated accelerator blocks for things like storage, networking, and security offload.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis variety means that certain SmartNICs are better suited, or at the very least marketed, towards certain applications more than others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the most part, we've seen SmartNICs \u2013 or whatever your preferred vendor wants to call them \u2013 deployed in one of two scenarios. The first is in large cloud and hyperscale datacenters where they're used to offload and accelerate storage, networking, security, and even hypervisor management from the host CPU.\nAmazon Web Services' custom Nitro cards are a prime example. The cards are designed to physically separate the cloudy control plane from the host. The result is that more CPU cycles are available to run tenants' workloads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is one of the use cases Nvidia has talked up with its BlueField DPUs and has partnered with companies like VMware and Red Hat to integrate the cards into their software and virtualization stacks.\nBypassing bottlenecks\nThe second application for SmartNICs has focused more heavily on network offload and acceleration, with an emphasis on eliminating bandwidth and latency bottlenecks.\nThis is the role Nvidia sees for the SuperNIC variant of its BlueField-3 cards. While both BlueField-3 DPUs and SuperNICs are based on the same architecture and share the same silicon, the SuperNIC is a physically smaller device that uses less power, and is optimized for high-bandwidth, low-latency data flows between accelerators.\n\"We felt it was important that we actually named them differently so that customers understood that they could use those for east-west traffic to build an accelerated AI compute fabric,\" Deierling explained.\n\nWith all eyes on OpenAI, Meta drags its Responsible AI team to the recycle bin\nCerebras CEO puts Nvidia on blast for 'arming' China with top-tier GPUs\nDesperately seeking GPUs? AWS will let you reserve instances in advance \u2013 no refunds\nBroadcom says Nvidia Spectrum-X's 'lossless Ethernet' isn't new\n\nInfiniBand-like network for those that don't want Infiniband\nThose paying attention to large-scale deployments of Nvidia GPUs for use in AI training and inference workloads will know that many communicate over Infiniband networks.\nThe protocol is widely deployed throughout Microsoft's GPU clusters in Azure and Nvidia sells plenty of Infiniband kit.\nFor those wondering, this is where Nvidia's ConnectX-7 SmartNIC fits in. According to Deierling, a lot of the functionality required to achieve low-latency, low-loss networking across Ethernet is built into Infiniband, and so not as much computing power is required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith that said, ConnectX-7 does add another layer of complexity to Nvidia's networking identity crisis. At least for now, Nvidia's data sheets still describe [PDF] the card as a SmartNIC, though Deierling tells us the biz is shying away from that descriptor due to the confusion it causes.\nHowever, not every customer wants to support multiple network stacks and would instead prefer to stick with standard Ethernet. Nvidia is therefore positioning its Spectrum-4 switches and BlueField-3 SuperNICs as the tech that lets customers stick with Ethernet.\nMarketed as Spectrum-X, the offering is a portfolio of hardware and software designed to work together to provide InfiniBand-like network performance, reliability, and latencies using 400Gbit/sec RDMA over converged Ethernet (ROCE).\nWhile this avoids the requirement of managing two network stacks, it won't necessarily eliminate hardware lock-in. The individual components will work with the broader Ethernet ecosystem, but to fully take advantage of Spectrum-X's feature set, customers really need to deploy Nvidia's switches and SuperNICs in tandem.\nBut depending on who you ask, customers may not need to resort to Nvidia Ethernet kit, with Broadcom's Ram Velaga previously telling The Register \"there's nothing unique about their device that we don't already have.\" He claimed that Broadcom can achieve the same thing using its Jericho3-AI switch or Tomahawk5 switch ASICs in conjunction with customers' preferred DPUs.\nWhether or not that's true, major OEMs don't seem to be worried about it as Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and Lenovo have all announced plans to offer Spectrum-X to prospective AI customers \u2013 presumably alongside large orders of Nvidia GPU servers. \u00ae \nGet our Tech Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                AI\n

It\u2019s about time we stop doing that. Beside the fact that no one can match Nvidia\u2019s performance edge in the short term, the overblown messaging doesn\u2019t do justice to the very real accomplishments made by AI startups.\nHere\u2019s a concrete example of what we are referring to: Sapeon, a South Korean startup backed by the sizable SK Group, is said to be making a stab at Nvidia\u2019s AI crown with its brand-new X330 chip. At least, that\u2019s the impression we\u2019re left with after reading the coverage from publications such as Reuters, Bloomberg and CNBC.\nHowever, Sapeon\u2019s promise is similar to what we recently heard from cloud vendor Scaleway: for AI inferencing, a sizable workload but not the heaviest in the field of AI by any means, there are more efficient alternatives to Nvidia. To train state-of-the-art LLMs, you\u2019ll have to go elsewhere. In other words, the offerings of a startup like this are a lot less ambitious than the headlines suggest.\nThat\u2019s the story regarding alleged \u2018Nvidia competitors\u2019 in miniature, but there are countless other examples. Incidentally, The Information believes it has found eight such formidable rivals for Nvidia. CNBC resorts to this rhetoric often, too, with American company Kneron as a relatively recent example of a company getting the exaggerated moniker. These offerings are categorically not intended to train AI models at lightning speed.\nInstead of listing all sorts of similar startups getting the same media treatment, it might make more sense to look at why Nvidia is unapproachable to any startup.\nWhy Nvidia is firmly in the driving seat\nFew readers will have failed to notice that Nvidia has partnered with just about everyone by this point. Everyone from AWS and HPE to VMware and IBM has announced an expanded partnership to integrate with Nvidia\u2019s offerings. Mind you, this isn\u2019t just about the hardware stack, but also includes Nvidia AI Enterprise, the software that large organizations can deploy to tinker with AI models. \nNvidia thus not only sells the most powerful generative AI chips in the world, but also shapes the market in a direction that makes companies even more dependent on its own software. It isn\u2019t just a throwaway line that Nvidia characterizes this software package as the \u201coperating system\u201d of enterprise AI. The success of this strategy is clear, as AI developers are building their applications with an Nvidia-first mindset, because the GPU giant provides a combination of the best hardware and the most mature software.\nIn short, Nvidia has done everything it can to build on its leadership position. It even argues that customers have a lower total cost of ownership when using its highly expensive and sought-after top-of-the-line GPUs. \u201cTaken at a holistic level of the actual costs incurred by a data center, significant performance speedups reduce the equipment and maintenance requirements, leading to sizable capital and operational expense savings,\u201d Nvidia has stated.\nCompetition, but no short-term concerns\nNow, despite its supreme position when it comes to AI hardware, Nvidia is not infallible. Prices for its much sought-after products are skyrocketing to the point where the competitors that do exist can seize opportunities. Intel classifies its own Gaudi chips as a sensible and viable alternative, while AMD also has a newly minted offering to run AI on with the Instinct MI300. It\u2019s not like all competing efforts are unviable, or that anyone is entirely trapped in the Nvidia ecosystem. \nThe company also relies on the aforementioned heaps of collaborations to actually get AI hardware to customers, whether that\u2019s on-prem along with the likes of Dell or through the cloud services of AWS, Microsoft and Google. With those big cloud players, it is likewise the case that they all have AI chips ready or in development that should reduce their dependence on Nvidia.\nThose are some factors to keep Nvidia in check, then, even if there\u2019s no cause for concern in the short term. As for startups looking to develop AI hardware, Nvidia\u2019s dominance is apparently causing investors to stay away. That makes sense, given the gigantic moats Nvidia and other chip companies have now built up against potential new AI players.\nWhere startups can succeed (and already have)\nStartups are up for some challenge, then, if they legitimately want to go toe-to-toe with Nvidia. However, coverage from major news sites continues to present a false narrative. Barely anyone will actually believe they have any hope whatsoever of knocking the company off its perch within the next few years. Where one startup after another is bombarded as Nvidia rival, we see that this is rarely the stated goal of these companies. In terms of hardware, startups invested there tend to focus on aforementioned inferencing solutions, while AI software developers are taking aim at all sorts of unsolved problems that\u2019s beyond the scope of Nvidia. Nobody\u2019s truly fighting the trillion-dollar GPU giant. They\u2019re working alongside it, and often partner up with it, too.\nA good example of this approach taking shape can be found in the career of Naveen Rao, currently VP of Generative AI at Databricks. After leaving Intel, he led MosaicML, an AI startup that launched from stealth in 2021 and has since been acquired by Databricks. Upon leaving Intel, Rao quickly realized that there was no real alternative to the Nvidia AI stack. Indeed, in direct comparisons, no other option proved powerful and agile enough to get developers away from Nvidia. Instead of seeking to build a hardware competitor, MosaicML chose to specialize in software. The end result was an offering complementary to what Nvidia had already come up with on both the hardware and software front. Namely, MosaicML went on to focus on software that secures enterprise data when training AI models and allows inferencing in secure environments. You\u2019ll have to get hold of the hardware from someone else.\nDatabricks proved that it considered MosaicML\u2019s approach to be worth at least 1.3 billion by acquiring it for that amount earlier this year. Incidentally, Databricks entered into a partnership with Nvidia back in 2020.\nIn conclusion, AI startups certainly have something to offer, but it doesn\u2019t help anyone when the headlines cast them as one of many Nvidia competitors that aim to strike it down, any day now. Anyone developing something on the hardware side mostly presents inferencing options suitable for everyday use at a lower overall cost. Those options exist predominantly because Nvidia simply cannot produce enough chips at an economical price to meet demand. In terms of software and infrastructure, it\u2019s the big players that Nvidia also depends on, while startups can find specializations to excel in and bring value. There\u2019s certainly room for them in the AI field, especially given the fledgling state of generative AI use. However, it\u2019s simply incorrect to deny Nvidia\u2019s central role in this and to suggest that there\u2019s a real alternative out there somewhere. That option B doesn\u2019t currently exist, and in all likelihood will not arrive anytime soon.\nAlso read: Nvidia dominates AI market, where are the limits to its growth?\n\n\n\nTags:\nAI hardware / AI startup / Competition / generative AI / Nvidia \n\n\n\n\n\n\"*\" indicates required fields\n\nStay tuned, subscribe!\nE-mailadres*\n\nNieuwsbrieven*\n\nMorning Bytes\n\n\nWeekly Advisor\nCommentsThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nRelated                                \n\n\n\nJFrog makes big splash on Nvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree suspects arrested who may have supplied Nvidia chips to DeepSeek\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Cloud now offers Nvidia Blackwell-supported instances\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia challenger Groq receives 1.5 billion from Saudi Arabia\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor picks    \n\n\n\nServiceNow makes Now platform AI-driven and adds thousands of AI agents\n\nAI agents are taking over the platform\n\n\n\n\n\nOracle launches Java 24 with enhanced AI support and post-quantum cryptography\n\nSecurity and AI take center stage in Java 24\n\n\n\n\n\nUiPath strengthens agentic AI options with Peak acquisition\n\n\nUiPath has acquired Peak, an AI company that optimises product invent...\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are Google\u2019s plans for cloud security provider Wiz?\n\nCatching up in the cloud computing market\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsight: Cloud ERP\n\n\n\n\nIFS grows like crazy despite AI strategy with the handbrake on\n\nAI development needs to be faster\n\n\n\n\n\nSAP\u2019s board exodus: Mueller, White and Russell are gone\n\nHow should the ERP giant proceed?\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWorkday further elasticates adaptive planning\u00c2\u00a0\n\n\nWork, like life, is difficult.

By Monday morning, we were an AI company.\nGreg Estes, the vice president of Nvidia's corporate marketing, told the New Yorker that the company was in the middle of some internal restructuring.\nHe pointed out that this was not the first time Nvidia's CEO has bet the farm on new business ventures.\n\u00a0According to the article, the unofficial corporate motto of Nvidia is \"Our company is 30 days from going out of business,\" which refers to the big gambles it has made on everything from coining the term \"GPU\" to its revolutionary CUDA product stack.\nThe email where Huang declared Nvidia an AI company came after the development of AlexNet. Alex Krizhevsky and his research partner, Ilya Sutskever, were among the first to use Nvidia graphics cards to train an AI model called AlexNet. Google quickly snatched up Krizhevsky, and Sutskever is currently the chief scientist of OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.\n\u00a0In an interview for the story, Sutkever said, \"GPUs showed up and it felt like a miracle.\"\nNvidia bet on CUDA in 2006, and although it has seen a rise in popularity since it hit a fever pitch with the development of ChatGPT.\nThousands of Nvidia GPUs were behind the model that built ChatGPT, and almost overnight, Nvidia had thousands of new customers looking to capitalize on the AI revolution. It has made Nvidia one of the most valuable tech companies in the world, sitting only slightly behind Amazon and Alphabet.\nAll this has made Nvidia less interested in being a graphics company than it once was, with the RTX 4060 Ti having a high price and a low-performance gain over past models.\nNvidia's AI investment has helped PC gamers. Its DLSS 3.5 tech, which applies AI to frame generation, upscaling, and ray tracing, has boosted visual quality and performance in games like Cyberpunk 2077. Nvidia's AI-based ACE tool is said to drive characters in games, generating new lines of dialogue, facial animations, and audio \u2013 although that has not been seen yet.\nHowever, this does leave room for AMD and Intel. \n\n\n\nRate this item\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n(7 votes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in this category:\n\n\t\t\t\u00ab Tech entrepreneur reboots his AI church\t\t\n\n\t\t\tAI is creating, not destroying jobs \u00bb\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tback to top\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about:\n\n\n"

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nHaving earned\u00a0$14.5 billion on datacenter hardware\u00a0in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, Nvidia clearly sold a boatload of its H100 GPUs for artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC). Omdia says that Nvidia sold nearly half a million A100 and H100 GPUs, and demand for these products is so high that the lead time of H100-based servers is from 36 to 52 weeks.Omdia, a market tracking company, believes that Meta and Microsoft are the largest purchasers of Nvidia's H100 GPUs. They procured as many as 150,000 H100 GPUs each, considerably more than the number of H100 processors purchased by Google, Amazon, Oracle, and Tencent (50,000 each). It is noteworthy that\u00a0the majority of server GPUs are supplied to hyperscale cloud service providers. Server OEMs (Dell, Lenovo, HPE) cannot get enough AI and HPC GPUs to fulfill their server orders yet, Omdia claims.(Image credit: Omdia)The analyst firm believes that sales of Nvidia's H100 and A100 compute GPUs will exceed half a million units in Q4 2023. Meanwhile, demand for H100 and A100 is so strong that the lead time of GPU servers is up to 52 weeks. Meanwhile, Omdia says that server shipments for 2023 are trending between -17% and -20% year-over-year, whereas server revenue for 2023 is trending between +6% and +8% year-over-year.\u00a0Meanwhile, it should be noted that virtually all companies that purchase Nvidia's H100 GPUs in large quantities are also developing custom silicon for AI, HPC, and video workloads. As a result, their purchases of Nvidia hardware will likely decline over time as they transit to their own chips.\u00a0Meanwhile, looking forward to 2027, the server market's value is estimated at a staggering $195.6 billion. This growth trajectory is fueled by the shift towards servers tailored for specific applications featuring a diverse array of co-processors. Examples include Amazon's servers dedicated to AI inference, which boast 16 Inferentia 2 co-processors, and Google's video transcoding servers, outfitted with 20 custom VCUs. Meta has also followed suit with servers equipped with 12 custom processors for video processing. \n\nThis inclination towards custom, application-optimized server configurations is set to become the norm as the cost-efficiency of building specialized processors is realized, with media and AI being the current front runners and other sectors like database management and web services expected to join the movement.\u00a0Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (0)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

He left to join Nvidia later that year.A letter written by Nvidia's lawyers submitted with the lawsuit said the tech giant was not aware Mr Moniruzzaman had the data.The firms worked on a joint project, which led to the Microsoft Teams meeting in March 2022 when Mr Moniruzzaman unwittingly revealed the data.ScreenshotsValeo claims that Mr Moniruzzaman gave a slide presentation and then minimised the app he was using - but crucially, he was still sharing his screen, leaving visible the file which Valeo says contained the source code behind its proprietary software.\"Valeo participants on the videoconference call immediately recognised the source code and took a screenshot before Mr Moniruzzaman was alerted of his error,\" the lawsuit claims. \"By then, it was too late to cover his tracks.\"As a result Mr Moniruzzaman was convicted by German authorities in September 2023 over unlawfully holding the data, the court document says.\"When questioned by the German police, Mr Moniruzzaman admitted to stealing Valeo's software and using that software while employed at Nvidia,\" the lawsuit claims. It continues: \"In fact, Mr Moniruzzaman did not deny the charge of the crime at any point during the German criminal investigation.\"Nvidia must halt China AI chip sales 'immediately'Nvidia and Foxconn to build 'AI factories' togetherThis conviction has now led to Valeo launching a suit against Nvidia itself, in which it claims the tech giant benefitted financially from its \"stolen trade secrets\". \"Nvidia has saved millions, perhaps hundreds of millions, of dollars in development costs, and generated profits that it did not properly earn and to which it was not entitled,\" the complaint alleges. \"In using these stolen trade secrets to develop a competing product, Nvidia has diminished the value of Valeo's trade secrets,\" it says.The lawsuit has been filed by Valeo Schalter und Sensoren GmbH, the German arm of French firm. It is seeking significant damages, and wants the court to make an injunction prohibiting Nvidia and its affiliates from using Valeo's code. It has been filed in a court in California, which is where Nvidia is headquartered.In the complaint, Valeo states that after the Teams call in March 2022 it audited its systems and found Mr Moniruzzaman had copied their source code, along with \"tens of thousands of files\" containing other proprietary information.His Nvidia-owned computers were then seized by German police as part of the criminal investigation, according to the lawsuit.'Stored locally'Meanwhile, as part of the complaint, Valeo also submitted a letter it received from Nvidia in June 2022.In the letter, lawyers representing Nvidia state Mr Moniruzzaman's actions \"were entirely unknown\" to the firm until May 2022 - the date he told his employer he was under investigation.According to their letter, Mr Monizruzzaman told Nvidia the code was \"stored only locally on his laptop\", so it could not be accessed by other people at the company.\"Nvidia has no interest in Valeo's code or its alleged trade secrets and has taken prompt concrete steps to protect your client's asserted rights,\" the letter reads, adding that the firm has \"cooperated fully\". The BBC has approached Valeo for comment.

Use AI-powered NVIDIA DLSS to accelerate performance and enhance graphics. Make gameplay snappier and more responsive with NVIDIA Reflex. Take immersion to the next level with next-gen ray tracing. And get frequent Game Ready Driver updates to keep your PC running smoothly, with support for the latest and greatest games.\nBelow, you\u2019ll find information to help compare GPUs, what graphics card is the best graphic card for gaming, and checklists for upgrading your system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Is a Video Card & What Does It Do?\nA graphics card (also called a video card, VGA, or GPU) runs a game\u2019s graphics and displays it on your monitor or TV. It plugs into your computer\u2019s motherboard and is powered by cables from your power supply (PSU).\nSome CPUs include limited graphics processing capabilities, but if you want to play popular and recent games, you will need a dedicated GPU such as a RTX 4060 or 4060ti. These graphics cards in your PC will give you great HD graphics at 1080p, the most popular gaming resolution.\nGraphics cards can output to multiple displays simultaneously, and at smoother refresh rates, like 120Hz, which is supported by many monitors and TVs.\nYou can buy NVIDIA video cards from ASUS, Colorful, Gainward, GALAX, GIGABYTE, INNO3D, KFA2, MSI, Palit, PNY, and ZOTAC. And limited NVIDIA Founders Edition models are also sold directly from the NVIDIA website in select regions.\nFully-assembled systems with GeForce graphics cards inside are also available from major brands including HP Omen, Lenovo Legion, Dell, Alienware, Acer, ASUS, MSI or from leading system builders including CyberPower PC, Digital Storm, Falcon NW, IBUYPOWER, Maingear, Origin, NZXT, Puget and many more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 4060 Price and Specifications\nGeForce RTX 4060 graphics cards were first released in June 2023. 4060 RTX specifications include:\n\nMSRP is $299\n3072 CUDA Cores\n2.46 GHz Boost Clock\n8 GB GDDR6 VRAM\nOnly 110W power consumption on average while gaming\u00a0\nDesigned to be paired with a 1080p gaming monitor\n\nAs the least expensive 40 Series GPU, it\u2019s the entry point to the latest NVIDIA GPU architecture design, named Ada Lovelace, which includes features like AI DLSS 3.5, beautiful Ray Tracing, fast and efficient AV1 video encoding, and more\nThese GPUs follow in the footsteps of prior generation 60-class cards being accessible and popular, powering high-frame rate 1080p gaming, especially in multiplayer titles\nNVIDIA RTX 4060 is available from a range of well known, trusted manufacturers and retailers worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 4060 Upgrade Checklist \nIf you\u2019re almost ready to buy a new graphics card to upgrade your PC, quickly run down this checklist to ensure your system is ready, and it\u2019s the right class of card for you:\n\nCheck your system\u2019s power supply and case compatibility. For example:\n  \nIf the GPU requires a \u201c550W power supply\u201d, you need to check the power rating of the PSU in your current PC. This is usually displayed in big bold letters on the power supply itself (the boxy device typically located at the bottom right of a case, with lots of wires coming out of it, and your plug from the wall going into it)\nMany 4060 GPUs require 1x PCIe 8-pin cable from your power supply. But some may require more, or use a 12-pin cable. Check the specifications and requirements of the graphics card, then refer to the manual of your power supply to see which cables to install where, and if you have enough cables to power the GPU. An example of these requirements can be seen below:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat resolution is your monitor? If your monitor\u2019s resolution is 2560x1440 or higher, we recommend selecting an even faster GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU. If you\u2019re at 1920x1080, you\u2019re golden. It is possible to play at 2560x1440, but frame rates will be lower. If you then opt to play at 1080p on your 1440p display, you\u2019ll be upscaling graphics to 1440p, which on some monitors can be particularly blurry, so it\u2019s always recommended to play at your monitor\u2019s native resolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich RTX 4060 Graphics Card Should You Buy?\n\nIf price/budget is your main factor, some of the best value cards include the following two-fan cards, all of which are relatively small and each retailing at or under $300 at the time of writing:\u00a0\n  \nZOTAC Gaming GeForce RTX 4060 8GB SOLO\nPNY GeForce RTX 4060 8GB VERTO Dual Fan\nGIGABYTE GeForce RTX 4060 WINDFORCE OC\n \n\nMost dual-fan RTX 4060 products will fit in ITX cases.\nThere are plenty of RTX 4060 graphics cards available.

In comparison, the GeForce RTX 4060 can give you nearly double the performance in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, making it the best GPU in its class for enjoying the critically acclaimed game at 1080p.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFramerate Per Second (FPS) for RTX 4060 vs 3060 Graphics Cards 1920x1080 Resolution, Highest Game Settings, DLSS Super Resolution Quality Mode, DLSS Frame Generation on RTX 40 Series, i9-12900K, 32GB RAM, Win 11 x64.

When shopping for a new GeForce RTX 4060 Family graphics card, the key differences to consider are:\n\nFactory Overclocks: GPUs run at a speed listed in MHz, generally referred to as a \u201cclock speed\u201d. Some manufacturers apply safe, pre-tested, warrantied clock speed boosts (known as overclocking) to select products, giving you faster out of the box performance. Compare the GPU MHz speeds on product pages.\nSize: 4060 graphics cards are generally small, but some models with bigger fans and heatsinks may affect compatibility with tiny cases. Check the card\u2019s length and width can fit in your chassis, and look at the listed \u201cslot size\u201d or \u201cslot height\u201d. If a GPU is listed as being \u201c2 slots\u201d, you need two free expansion slots on the back of your case. Look at the\u00a0images below for an example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStyle: If you like to see your system\u2019s hardware through a case window, the GPU\u2019s looks are likely an important factor. Certain models incorporate premium metals, have decorative back plates, and additional colored lighting (RGB lighting) that can sync with your system\u2019s other lights.\nPower Connectors: Most GeForce RTX 4060 family graphics cards require only 1x PCIe 8-pin cable. Some larger models with additional fans and lighting may require additional power and cables. Check the card\u2019s specifications and ensure your system\u2019s power supply has enough juice and cables.\n\nNote: If you\u2019re buying a fully assembled pre-built PC or system from a manufacturer, you won\u2019t have to worry about anything - everything is designed to work flawlessly together.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Are Important Features On A GPU?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll GeForce RTX GPU owners can also tap into an ecosystem of apps and technologies to further enhance gaming, work and creativity.

The majority of jobs are in the company's engineering department \u2014 including chip designers, software engineers, and AI product developers \u2014 but there are more than 100 openings across operations, sales, and program management as well.\"We have many opportunities,\" Lindsey Duran, the VP of global recruiting at Nvidia, told Insider. \"A lot of our goals continue to be focused on engineering and AI.\"\n\nHere are 5 tips on how to get hired at Nvidia, according to a top hiring leader at the company.1) Emphasize your skills on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9It may sound obvious, but include specific skills on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nFor technical roles related to machine learning and AI, Duran said that Nvidia looks for a strong math background; computer vision proficiency; and knowledge of programming, machine learning, deep learning algorithms, data handling, and the utilization of GPUs.Outlining this expertise is particularly important for applicants with degrees in humanities, Duran said.These skills can be applied to Nvidia roles like AI developer, security architect, and generative AI performance engineer \u2014 some which offer salaries of as high as $333,500.\n\n2) Articulate how you're more than a degreeBeyond technical knowledge, job applicants should articulate what makes them different, Duran said.Applicants shine when they clearly communicate their career milestones, leadership capabilities, and personal achievements in their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or interview, she added. Showing off past projects, for example, demonstrates problem solving skills, mastery of a particular subject, and impact.\n\nCommunicating how you've grown in your career is especially important for applicants who come from non-traditional education backgrounds.\"There's got to be something that shows what makes you unique,\" Duran said. \"There could be many that say \"I've got a bachelor's degree, a master's degree,\" but really, how are you showing on your resume that you stand out?\"3) Show interest in generative AI, but be careful with how you use it\n\nWith AI fueling Nvidia, it makes sense that the chip giant considers knowing how to use AI tools such as ChatGPT when hiring.Still, Duran maintains it's a \"relatively new skill\" and interest in the topic is paramount to a specific tool.\"The technology is evolving so quickly,\" Duran said in regards to AI. \"We need to find people that are able to learn and grow because in the next few years, there could be new skills that are going to be required.\"\n\nOne thing to avoid: using ChatGPT to move through the application process. Duran said recruiters at Nvidia have caught candidates using ChatGPT during interviews, despite being told not to.4) Tap into your professional networkKnowing somebody who works at Nvidia can increase your chances of getting hired.\n\nDuran said that Nvidia has a \"very strong\" employee referral program that the company frequently uses to make hiring decisions.5) Do an internshipIf you're just starting out in your career and don't have the required skills for a particular role, Duran suggests applying for an internship.\n\nUndergrads, master's students, and PhD candidates \u2014 even applicants with unconventional backgrounds \u2014 are considered for Nvidia's internships, she added.As of mid-November, Nvidia had 154 internship openings, including sales and research positions.US-based internships pay an hourly between $19 and $93 an hour depending on the applicant's background.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerative AI\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\nAI\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider\n      subscribers.

And we do not have good visibility into the magnitude of that impact even over the long-term,\u201d Colette Kress, Nvidia\u2019s CFO shared on the earnings call.\nKress pegs China\u2019s share of data center revenue at 20-25% and expects Nvidia\u2019s guidance for that to decrease substantially as we move into Q4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think that China will impact future earnings; anyone would be foolish to ignore the impact,\u201d said Anshel Sag, Principal Analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.\u00a0\nSag did note that the world is still experiencing a GPU shortage, and \u201cthe gap between China\u2019s demand and pent-up demand within the rest of the world will more than be made up for.\u201d\nNvidia maintains lion\u2019s share in AI chips\nNvidia is projected to have about 85% of the generative AI chip market next year between its H100 and H200 chips, according to a note published by Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri.\n\nBut these chips largely require export licenses.\nIn October, the US Department of Commerce introduced new rules to tighten export controls on advanced computing and semiconductor manufacturing, targeting China\u2019s military-civil fusion and AI development strategies.\nNvidia is working with some customers in China and the Middle East to pursue licenses from the US government, Kress said, adding that Nvidia is also working to expand its data center portfolio to offer compliant chips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFab capacity is still a concern\nTech companies continue to wrestle with maintaining a supply of access to fabs, where the chips are made, and this has become increasingly difficult.\nDuring the call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang re-assured investors that the company is \u201cexpanding our supply quite significantly\u201d and that Nvidia has the \u201clargest and most capable supply chain in the world,\u201d but, in his own words, supply chains are \u201ccomplicated,\u201d especially for next-generation AI chips.\n\u201cFab capacity is yet another bottleneck that Nvidia has to overcome,\u201d Moor Insights & Strategy\u2019s Sag said. \u201cNvidia will likely improve the supply situation with increased capacity next year, but I\u2019m not sure it will fully resolve capacity issues next year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSag suggests that Nvidia\u2019s use of monolithic dies \u2014 as opposed to AMD\u2019s chiplet architecture \u2014 presents a challenge in managing production capacity efficiently, impacting both the yield and cost per chip.\u00a0\u00a0\nMonolithic dies are single, large pieces of silicon containing an entire chip\u2019s circuitry, while chiplets are smaller, modular pieces of silicon combined to form a complete chip, offering greater flexibility and potentially lower costs.\n\u201cAMD is capitalizing on Nvidia\u2019s limited capacity,\u201d Sag said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance on manufacturing partners\nLike many companies that design chips and do not manufacture them, Nvidia relies on Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) as a production partner, specifically for its latest 3nm process node.\nTSMC is currently racing to build out increased capacity for this process node with additional factories planned for Japan.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAt the recent APEC summit in San Fransisco, Morris Chang, TSMC\u2019s founder, met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to discuss enhancing their semiconductor partnership.\n\nLocal media in Taiwan report that TSMC already has a high demand for availability on its 3nm process node, driven by high demand from major tech companies for advanced AI chips and new iPhones.\nFinancial analysts say that the relatively high cost of using the node is expected to boost TSMC\u2019s revenue growth significantly.\u00a0\nGPUs and AI everywhere\nThe AI revolution is generally putting intense pressure on chip designers as well as chip makers to pump out more processors to meet demand, but it is also having downstream effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia recently announced that its new AI-ready ethernet protocol, Spectrum-X, is available from major server manufacturers.\nSpectrum-X is essential for \u201csuccessfully deploying Generative AI workloads is the infrastructure and networking capabilities needed to support them,\u201d according to Deepika Giri, one of IDC\u2019s lead analysts in Asia.\nThere\u2019s also a geopolitical element. Countries are building up sovereign AI infrastructure \u201cto support economic growth and industrial innovation,\u201d as Kress said in the earnings call, not wanting to cede this ability to foreign governments, which in turn boosts demand for GPUs. \u201cMarket dynamics are expected to become more interesting next year, with constraints still present; however, both Nvidia and AMD should perform well despite China\u2019s restrictions, as other countries outside the US also invest in AI and require GPUs,\u201d Sag said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRelated content\n\n \n\n\nNews\n\nIonQ, Alice & Bob tout quantum breakthroughs\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Maria Korolov \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 14, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n5 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCPUs and Processors\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tServers\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTechnology Industry\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nHuawei at center of European Parliament bribery investigation\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Peter Sayer \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 13, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n2 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetworking Devices\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTechnology Industry\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nIntel taps semiconductor veteran Lip-Bu Tan as new CEO\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Andy Patrizio \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n4 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCPUs and Processors\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGPUs\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTechnology Industry\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nIBM wins UK lawsuit against LzLabs for mainframe intellectual property theft\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Michael Cooney \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 10, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n4 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Center\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMainframes\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTechnology Industry\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Sections\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPODCASTS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVIDEOS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRESOURCES\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEVENTS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpotlight: Managing modern risks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom our editors straight to your inbox\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tGet started by entering your email address below.\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email address\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow me morePopularArticlesPodcastsVideos\n\n\nopinion  Jio teams with AMD, Cisco and Nokia to build AI-enabled telecom platform  By Zeus Kerravala\nMar 18, 20254 mins\nNetworkingTelecommunications\n\n\n\n\nnews  2025 network outage report and internet health check By Ann Bednarz\nMar 18, 202528 mins\nInternet Service ProvidersNetwork Management SoftwareNetworking\n\n\n\n\nnews  Cloudflare unveils network-powered posture management By Sean Michael Kerner\nMar 18, 20255 mins\nCloud ComputingNetwork Security\n\n\n\n\npodcast  Has the hype around \u2018Internet of Things\u2019 paid off? | Ep. 145 \nApr 18, 202436 mins\nIoT PlatformsIoT Security\n\n\n\n\npodcast  Episode 1: Understanding Cisco\u2019s Converged SDN Transport \nSep 24, 202120 mins\nCisco SystemsInternetNetworking\n\n\n\n\npodcast  Episode 2: Pluggable Optics and the Internet for the Future \nSep 23, 202117 mins\nCisco SystemsInternetOptical Drives\n\n\n\n\nvideo  How to use the vmstat command \nFeb 25, 20251 mins\nLinux\n\n\n\n\nvideo  How to use the Alias Command \nFeb 25, 20252 mins\nLinux\n\n\n\n\nvideo  How to use exit codes \nFeb 21, 20252 mins\nLinux\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSponsored Links\n\n\nOptimum Business | Ensure continuity with Business Connection Backup.  \n\n\nEmpower your cybersecurity team with expert insights from Palo Alto Networks.\n\n\nSecure AI by Design: Unleash the power of AI and keep applications, usage and data secure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nFoundry Careers\n\n\nReprints\n\n\nNewsletters\n\n\nBrandPosts\n\n\nNews\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\nBlogs/Opinion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nCookie Policy\n\n\nCopyright Notice\n\n\nMember Preferences\n\n\nAbout AdChoices\n\n\nE-commerce Affiliate Relationships\n\n\nYour California Privacy Rights\n\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCIO\n\n\nComputerworld\n\n\nCSO Online\n\n\nInfoWorld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 IDG Communications, Inc. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Back in August we saw NVIDIA\u2019s plans to release an HBM3E-equipped version of the Grace Hopper GH200 superchip, and now for the SC23 tradeshow, NVIDIA is announcing their plans to bring to market an updated version of the stand-alone H100 accelerator with HBM3E memory, which the company will be calling the H200.\nLike its Grace Hopper counterpart, the purpose of the H200 is to serve as a mid-generation upgrade to the Hx00 product line by rolling out a version of the chip with faster and higher capacity memory. Tapping the HBM3E memory that Micron and others are set to roll out n, NVIDIA will be able to offer accelerators with better real-world performance in memory bandwidth-bound workloads, but also parts that can handle even larger workloads. This stands to be especially helpful in the generative AI space \u2013 which has been driving virtually all of the demand for H100 accelerators thus far \u2013 as the largest of the large language models can max out the 80GB H100 as it is.\nMeanwhile, with HBM3E memory not shipping until next year, NVIDIA has been using the gap to announce HBM3E updated parts at their leisure. Following this summer\u2019s GH200 announcement, it was only a matter of time until NVIDIA announced a standalone version of the Hx00 accelerator with HBM3E, and this week NVIDIA is finally making that announcement.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Accelerator Specification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\nH200\nH100\nA100 (80GB)\n\n\nFP32 CUDA Cores\n16896?\n16896\n6912\n\n\nTensor Cores\n528?\n528\n432\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1.83GHz?\n1.83GHz\n1.41GHz\n\n\nMemory Clock\n~6.5Gbps HBM3E\n5.24Gbps HBM3\n3.2Gbps HBM2e\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n6144-bit\n5120-bit\n5120-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n4.8TB/sec\n3.35TB/sec\n2TB/sec\n\n\nVRAM\n141GB\n80GB\n80GB\n\n\nFP64 Vector\n33.5 TFLOPS?\n33.5 TFLOPS\n9.7 TFLOPS\n\n\nINT8 Tensor\n1979 TOPS?\n1979 TOPS\n624 TOPS\n\n\nFP16 Tensor\n989 TFLOPS?\n989 TFLOPS\n312 TFLOPS\n\n\nFP64 Tensor\n66.9 TFLOPS?\n66.9 TFLOPS\n19.5 TFLOPS\n\n\nInterconnect\nNVLink 4\r\n\t\t\t18 Links (900GB/sec)\nNVLink 4\r\n\t\t\t18 Links (900GB/sec)\nNVLink 3\r\n\t\t\t12 Links (600GB/sec)\n\n\nGPU\nGH100\r\n\t\t\t(814mm2)\nGH100\r\n\t\t\t(814mm2)\nGA100\r\n\t\t\t(826mm2)\n\n\nTransistor Count\n80B\n80B\n54.2B\n\n\nTDP\n700W\n700W\n400W\n\n\nManufacturing Process\nTSMC 4N\nTSMC 4N\nTSMC 7N\n\n\nInterface\nSXM5\nSXM5\nSXM4\n\n\nArchitecture\nHopper\nHopper\nAmpere\n\n\n\nBased on the same GH100 GPU as found in the original H100, the new HBM3E-equipped version of the H100 accelerator will be getting a new model number, H200, to set it apart from its original predecessor and align it with the GH200 superchip (whose HBM3E version is not getting a distinct model number).\nLooking at the specifications being disclosed today, the H200 basically looks like the Hopper half of GH200 as its own accelerator. The big difference here, of course, is swapping out HBM3 for HBM3E, which is allowing NVIDIA to boost both memory bandwidth and capacity \u2013 as well as NVIDIA enabling the 6th HBM memory stack, which was disabled in the original H100. This will increase the H200\u2019s memory capacity from 80GB to 141GB, and memory bandwidth from 3.35TB/second to what NVIDIA is preliminarily expecting to be 4.8TB/second \u2013 an approximately 43% increase in bandwidth.\nWorking backwards here based on total bandwidth and memory bus width, this indicates that H200\u2019s memory will be running at roughly 6.5Gbps/pin, a roughly 25% frequency increase versus the original H100\u2019s 5.3Gbps/pin HBM3 memory. This is actually well below the memory frequencies that HBM3E is rated for \u2013 Micron wants to hit 9.2Gbps/pin \u2013 but since it\u2019s being retrofit to an existing GPU design, it\u2019s not surprising to see that NVIDIA\u2019s current memory controllers don\u2019t have the same range.\nThe H200 will also keep GH200\u2019s unusual memory capacity of 141GB. The HBM3E memory itself physically has a capacity of 144GB \u2013 coming in the form of six 24GB stacks \u2013 however NVIDIA is holding back some of that capacity for yield reasons. As a result, customers don\u2019t get access to all 144GB on board, but compared to H100 they are getting access to all six stacks, with the capacity and memory bandwidth benefits thereof.\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted in past articles, shipping a part with all 6 working stacks will essentially require a perfect chip, as H100\u2019s specs very generously allowed NVIDIA to ship parts with a non-functional stack. So this is likely to be a lower volume, lower yielding part than comparable H100 accelerators (which are already in short supply).\nOtherwise, nothing NVIDIA has disclosed so far indicates that H200 will have better raw computational throughput than its predecessor. While real-world performance should improve from the memory changes, the 32 PFLOPS of FP8 performance that NVIDIA is quoting for an HGX H200 cluster is identical to the HGX H100 clusters available on the market today.\nFinally, as with HBM3E-equipped GH200 systems, NVIDIA is expecting H200 accelerators to be available in the second quarter of 2024.\nHGX H200 Announced: Compatible With H100 Systems\nAlongside the H200 accelerator, NVIDIA is also announcing their HGX H200 platform, an updated version of the 8-way HGX H100 that uses the newer accelerator. The true backbone of NVIDIA\u2019s H100/H200 family, the HGX carrier boards house 8 SXM form factor accelerators linked up in a pre-arranged, fully-connected topology. The stand-alone nature of the HGX board allows it to be plugged in to suitable host systems, allowing OEMs to customize the non-GPU parts of their high-end servers.\n\nGiven that HGX goes hand-in-hand with NVIDIA\u2019s server accelerators, the announcement of the HGX 200 is largely a formality. Still, NVIDIA is making sure to announce it at SC23, as well as making sure that HGX 200 boards are cross-compatible with H100 boards. So server builders can use HGX H200 in their current designs, making this a relatively seamless transition.\nQuad GH200 Announced: 4 GH200s Baked Into a Single Board\nWith NVIDIA now shipping both Grace and Hopper (and Grace Hopper) chips in volume, the company is also announcing some additional products using those chips. The latest of which is a 4-way Grace Hopper GH200 board, which NVIDIA is simply calling the Quad GH200.\nLiving up to the name, the Quad GH200 places four GH200 accelerators on to a single board, which can then be installed in larger systems. The individual GH200s are wired up to each other in an 8-chip, 4-way NVLink topology, with the idea being to use these boards as the building blocks for larger systems.\n\nIn practice, the Quad GH200 is the Grace Hopper counterpart to the HGX platforms. The inclusion of Grace CPUs technically makes each board independent and self-supporting, unlike the GPU-only HGX boards, but the need to connect them to host infrastructure remains unchanged.\nA Quad GH200 node will offer 288 Arm CPU cores and a combined 2.3TB of high-speed memory. Notably, NVIDIA does not mention using the HBM3E version of GH200 here (at least not initially), so these figures seem to be with the original, HBM3 version. Which means we\u2019re looking at 480GB of LPDDR5X per Grace CPU, and 96GB of HBM3 per Hopper GPU. Or a total of 1920GB of LPDDR5X and 384GB of HBM3 memory.\nJupiter Supercomputer: 24K GH200s at 18.2 Megawatts, Installing in 2024\nFinally, NVIDIA is announcing a new supercomputer design win this morning with Jupiter. Ordered by the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking, Jupiter will be a new supercomputer built out of 23,762 GH200 nodes. Once it comes online, Jupiter will be the largest Hopper-based supercomputer announced thus far, and is the first one that is explicitly (and publicly) targeting standard HPC workloads as well as the low-precision tensor-driven AI workloads that have come to define the first Hopper-based supercomputers.\nContracted to Eviden and ParTec, Jupiter is a showcase of NVIDIA technologies through and through. Based on the Quad GH200 node that NVIDIA is also announcing today, Grace CPUs and Hopper GPUs sit at the core of the supercomputer. The individual nodes are backed by a Quantum-2 InfiniBand network, no doubt based on NVIDIA\u2019s ConnectX adapters.\n\nThe company is not disclosing specific core count or memory capacity figures, but since we know what a single Quad GH200 board offers, the math is simple enough. At the top end (assuming no salvaging/binning for yield reasons), this would be 23,762 Grace CPUs, 23,762 Hopper H100-class GPUs, and roughly 10.9 PB of LPDDR5X and anther 2.2PB of HBM3 memory.\nThe system is slated to offer 93 EFLOPS of low-precision performance for AI uses, or over 1 EFLOPS of delivered high-precision (FP64) performance for traditional HPC workloads. The latter figure is especially notable, as that would make Jupiter the first NVIDIA-based exascale system for HPC workloads.\nThat said, NVIDIA\u2019s HPC performance claims should be taken with a word of caution, as NVIDIA is still counting tensor performance here \u2013 1 EFLOPS of FP64 is something 23,762 H100s can only provide with FP64 tensor operations. The traditional metric for theoretical HPC supercomputer throughput is vector performance rather than matrix performance, so this figure isn\u2019t entirely comparable to other systems. Still, with HPC workloads also making significant use of matrix math in parts, it\u2019s not an entirely irrelevant claim, either. Otherwise, for anyone looking for the obligatory Frontier comparison, the straight vector performance of Jupiter would be around 800 TFLOPS, versus over twice that for Frontier. How close the two systems get in real-world conditions, on the other hand, will come down to how much matrix math is used in their respective workloads (LINPACK results should be interesting).\nNo price tag has been announced for the system, but power consumption has: a toasty 18.2 Megawatts of electricity (~3MW less than Frontier). So whatever the true price of the system is, like the system itself, it will be anything but petite.\nAccording to NVIDIA\u2019s press release, the system will be housed at the Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich facility in Germany, where it will be used for \u201cthe creation of foundational AI models in climate and weather research, material science, drug discovery, industrial engineering and quantum computing.\u201d Installation of the system is scheduled for 2024, though no date has been announced for when it\u2019s expected to come online.\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n14 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nSarahKerrigan - Monday, November 13, 2023 - link\n\"1 TFLOPS is just a bit under what 23,762 H100s can provide with FP64 tensor operations.\"Seems a little low, but what's a few orders of magnitude between friends?\n\n\n\nThreska - Monday, November 13, 2023 - link\nNow one can run CuLitho.https://youtu.be/HxyM2Chu9Vc\n\n\n\njvl - Tuesday, November 21, 2023 - link\nQuietly corrected? \n\n\n\nthomasjkenney - Monday, November 13, 2023 - link\nHAHA!

As digitalization accelerates, enterprise IT teams are under greater pressure to identify and block incoming cyber threats to ensure business operations and services are not interrupted \u2014 and AI-based cybersecurity provides a reliable way to do so.\nFew industries appear immune to cyber threats. This year alone, international hotel chains, financial institutions, Fortune 100 retailers, air traffic-control systems and the U.S. government have all reported threats and intrusions.\nWhether from insider error, cybercriminals, hacktivists or other threats, risks in the cyber landscape can damage an enterprise\u2019s reputation and bottom line. A breach can paralyze operations, jeopardize proprietary and customer data, result in regulatory fines and destroy customer trust.\nUsing AI and accelerated computing, businesses can reduce the time and operational expenses required to detect and block cyber threats while freeing up resources to focus on core business value operations and revenue-generating activities.\nHere\u2019s a look at how industries are applying AI techniques to safeguard data, enable faster threat detection and mitigate attacks to ensure the consistent delivery of service to customers and partners.\nPublic Sector: Protecting Physical Security, Energy Security and Citizen Services\nAI-powered analytics and automation tools are helping government agencies provide citizens with instant access to information and services, make data-driven decisions, model climate change, manage natural disasters, and more. But public entities managing digital tools and infrastructure face a complex cyber risk environment that includes regulatory compliance requirements, public scrutiny, large interconnected networks and the need to protect sensitive data and high-value targets.\nAdversary nation-states may initiate cyberattacks to disrupt networks, steal intellectual property or swipe classified government documents. Internal misuse of digital tools and infrastructure combined with sophisticated external espionage places public organizations at high risk of data breach. Espionage actors have also been known to recruit inside help, with 16% of public administration breaches showing evidence of collusion. To protect critical infrastructure, citizen data, public records and other sensitive information, federal organizations are turning to AI.\nThe U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security and Emergency Response (CESER) is tasked with strengthening the resilience of the country\u2019s energy sector by addressing emerging threats and improving energy infrastructure security. The DOE-CESER has invested more than $240 million in cybersecurity research, development and demonstration projects since 2010.\nIn one project, the department developed a tool that uses AI to automate and optimize security vulnerability and patch management in energy delivery systems. Another project for artificial diversity and defense security uses software-defined networks to enhance the situational awareness of energy delivery systems, helping ensure uninterrupted flows of energy.\nThe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which is charged with researching and investing in breakthrough technologies for national security, is using machine learning and AI in several areas. The DARPA CASTLE program trains AI to defend against advanced, persistent cyber threats. As part of the effort, researchers intend to accelerate cybersecurity assessments with approaches that are automated, repeatable and measurable. The DARPA GARD program builds platforms, libraries, datasets and training materials to help developers build AI models that are resistant to deception and adversarial attacks.\nTo keep up with an evolving threat landscape and ensure physical security, energy security and data security, public organizations must continue integrating AI to achieve a dynamic, proactive and far-reaching cyber defense posture.\nFinancial Services: Securing Digital Transactions, Payments and Portfolios\u00a0\nBanks, asset managers, insurers and other financial service organizations are using AI and machine learning to deliver superior performance in fraud detection, portfolio management, algorithmic trading and self-service banking.\nWith constant digital transactions, payments, loans and investment trades, financial service institutions manage some of the largest, most complex and most sensitive datasets of any industry. Behind only the healthcare industry, these organizations suffer the second highest cost of a data breach, at nearly $6 million per incident. This cost grows if regulators issue fines or if recovery includes legal fees and lawsuit settlements. Worse still, lost business may never be recovered if trust can\u2019t be repaired.\nBanks and financial institutions use AI to improve insider threat detection, detect phishing and ransomware, and keep sensitive information safe.\nFinSec Innovation Lab, a joint venture by Mastercard and Enel X, is using AI to help its customers defend against ransomware. Prior to working with FinSec, one card-processing customer suffered a LockBit ransomware attack in which 200 company servers were infected in just 1.5 hours. The company was forced to shut down servers and suspend operations, resulting in an estimated $7 million in lost business.\nFinSec replicated this attack in its lab but deployed the NVIDIA Morpheus cybersecurity framework, NVIDIA DOCA software framework for intrusion detection and NVIDIA BlueField DPU computing clusters. With this mix of AI and accelerated computing, FinSec was able to detect the ransomware attack in less than 12 seconds, quickly isolate virtual machines and recover 80% of the data on infected servers. This type of real-time response helps businesses avoid service downtime and lost business while maintaining customer trust.\nWith AI to help defend against cyberattacks, financial institutions can identify intrusions and anticipate future threats to keep financial records, accounts and transactions secure.\nRetail: Keeping Sales Channels and Payment Credentials Safe\nRetailers are using AI to power personalized product recommendations, dynamic pricing and customized marketing campaigns. Multichannel digital platforms have made in-store and online shopping more convenient: up to 48% of consumers save a card on file with a merchant, significantly boosting card-not-present transactions. While digitization has brought convenience, it has also made sensitive data more accessible to attackers.\nSitting on troves of digital payment credentials for millions of customers, retailers are a prime target for cybercriminals looking to take advantage of security gaps. According to a recent Data Breach Investigations Report from Verizon, 37% of confirmed data disclosures in the retail industry resulted in stolen payment card data.\nMalware attacks, ransomware and distributed denial of service attacks are all on the rise, but phishing remains the favored vector for an initial attack. With a successful phishing intrusion, criminals can steal credentials, access systems and launch ransomware.\nBest Buy manages a network of more than 1,000 stores across the U.S. and Canada. With multichannel digital sales across both countries, protecting consumer information and transactions is critical. To defend against phishing and other cyber threats, Best Buy began using customized machine learning and NVIDIA Morpheus to better secure their infrastructure and inform their security analysts.\nAfter deploying this AI-based cyber defense, the retail giant improved the accuracy of phishing detection to 96% while reducing false-positive rates. With a proactive approach to cybersecurity, Best Buy is protecting its reputation as a tech expert focused on customer needs.\nFrom complex supply chains to third-party vendors and multichannel point-of-sale networks, expect retailers to continue integrating AI to protect operations as well as critical proprietary and customer data.\nSmart Cities and Spaces: Protecting Critical Infrastructure and Transit Networks\nIoT devices and AI that analyze movement patterns, traffic and hazardous situations have great potential to improve the safety and efficiency of spaces and infrastructure. But as airports, shipping ports, transit networks and other smart spaces integrate IoT and use data, they also become more vulnerable to attack.\nIn the last couple of years, there have been distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on airports and air traffic control centers and ransomware attacks on seaports, city municipalities, police departments and more. Attacks can paralyze information systems, ground flights, disrupt the flow of cargo and traffic, and delay the delivery of goods to markets. Hostile attacks could have far more serious consequences, including physical harm or loss of life.\nIn connected spaces, AI-driven security can analyze vast amounts of data to predict threats, isolate attacks and provide rapid self-healing after an intrusion. AI algorithms trained on emails can halt threats in the inbox and block phishing attempts like those that delivered ransomware to seaports earlier this year. Machine learning can be trained to recognize DDoS attack patterns to prevent the type of incoming malicious traffic that brought down U.S. airport websites last year.\nOrganizations adopting smart space technology, such as the Port of Los Angeles, are making efforts to get ahead of the threat landscape. In 2014, the Port of LA established a cybersecurity operations center and hired a dedicated cybersecurity team. In 2021, the port followed up with a cyber resilience center to enhance early-warning detection for cyberattacks that have the potential to impact the flow of cargo.\nThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has developed an AI certification framework that assesses the trustworthiness of AI and ML applications. The FAA also implements a zero-trust cyber approach, enforces strict access control and runs continuous verification across its digital environment.\nBy bolstering cybersecurity and integrating AI, smart space and transport infrastructure administrators can offer secure access to physical spaces and digital networks to protect the uninterrupted movement of people and goods.\nTelecommunications: Ensure Network Resilience and Block Incoming Threats\nTelecommunications companies are leaning into AI to power predictive maintenance and maximum network uptime, network optimization, equipment troubleshooting, call-routing and self-service systems.\nThe industry is responsible for critical national infrastructure in every country, supports over 5 billion customer endpoints and is expected to constantly deliver above 99% reliability. As reliance on cloud, IoT and edge computing expands and 5G becomes the norm, immense digital surface areas must be protected from misuse and malicious attack.\nTelcos can deploy AI to ensure the security and resilience of networks. AI can monitor IoT devices and edge networks to detect anomalies and intrusions, identify fake users, mitigate attacks and quarantine infected devices. AI can continuously assess the trustworthiness of devices, users and applications, thereby shortening the time needed to identify fraudsters.\nPretrained AI models can be deployed to protect 5G networks from threats such as malware, data exfiltration and DOS attacks.\nUsing deep learning and NVIDIA BlueField DPUs, Palo Alto Networks has built a next-generation firewall addressing 5G needs, maximizing cybersecurity performance while maintaining a small infrastructure footprint. The DPU powers accelerated intelligent network filtering to parse, classify and steer traffic to improve performance and isolate threats. With more efficient computing that deploys fewer servers, telcos can maximize return on investment for compute investments and minimize digital attack surface areas.\nBy putting AI to work, telcos can build secure, encrypted networks to ensure network availability and data security for both individual and enterprise customers.\nAutomotive: Insulate Vehicle Software From Outside Influence and Attack\u00a0\nModern cars rely on complex AI and ML software stacks running on in-vehicle computers to process data from cameras and other sensors. These vehicles are essentially giant, moving IoT devices \u2014 they perceive the environment, make decisions, advise drivers and even control the vehicle with autonomous driving features.\nLike other connected devices, autonomous vehicles are susceptible to various types of cyberattacks. Bad actors can infiltrate and compromise AV software both on board and from third-party providers. Denial of service attacks can disrupt over-the-air software updates that vehicles rely on to operate safely. Unauthorized access to communications systems like onboard WiFi, Bluetooth or RFID can expose vehicle systems to the risk of remote manipulation and data theft. This can jeopardize geolocation and sensor data, operational data, driver and passenger data, all of which are crucial to functional safety and the driving experience.\nAI-based cybersecurity can help monitor in-car and network activities in real time, allowing for rapid response to threats. AI can be deployed to secure and authenticate over-the-air updates to prevent tampering and ensure the authenticity of software updates. AI-driven encryption can protect data transmitted over WiFi, Bluetooth and RFID connections. AI can also probe vehicle systems for vulnerabilities and take remedial steps.\nRanging from AI-powered access control to unlock and start vehicles to detecting deviations in sensor performance and patching security vulnerabilities, AI will play a crucial role in the safe development and deployment of autonomous vehicles on our roads.\nKeeping Operations Secure and Customers Happy With AI Cybersecurity\u00a0\nBy deploying AI to protect valuable data and digital operations, industries can focus their resources on innovating better products, improving customer experiences and creating new business value.\nNVIDIA offers a number of tools and frameworks to help enterprises swiftly adjust to the evolving cyber risk environment. The NVIDIA Morpheus cybersecurity framework provides developers and software vendors with optimized, easy-to-use tools to build solutions that can proactively detect and mitigate threats while drastically reducing the cost of cyber defense operations. To help defend against phishing attempts, the NVIDIA spear phishing detection AI workflow uses NVIDIA Morpheus and synthetic training data created with the NVIDIA NeMo generative AI framework to flag and halt inbox threats.\nThe Morpheus SDK also enables digital fingerprinting to collect and analyze behavior characteristics for every user, service, account and machine across a network to identify atypical behavior and alert network operators. With the NVIDIA DOCA software framework, developers can create software-defined, DPU-accelerated services, while leveraging zero trust to build more secure applications.\nAI-based cybersecurity empowers developers across industries to build solutions that can identify, capture and act on threats and anomalies to ensure business continuity and uninterrupted service, keeping operations safe and customers happy.\nLearn how AI can help your organization achieve a proactive cybersecurity posture to protect customer and proprietary data to the highest standards.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Cybersecurity | NVIDIA NeMo \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's best graphics card for gaming, the RTX 4090 was recently struck with an export ban preventing the GPU from being sold to China. In response, Nvidia is reportedly developing a China-exclusive variant dubbed the RTX 4090 D (for \"Dragon\") \u2014 that's according to WCCFTech. The RTX 4090 D will supposedly feature lower performance and specifications to comply with U.S. export regulations. Sprinkle liberally with salt, obviously, though the idea absolutely makes sense.\n\nThe rumored GPU's specifications are unknown, but due to the US export guidelines, the RTX 4090 D will need to be less powerful than its outgoing counterpart. As a result, we will likely see the 4090 D coming with a lower TDP and a lower SM/core count to separate itself from the RTX 4090. Given how big the performance gap is between the RTX 4080 and the RTX 4090, this neutered 4090 could be quite a bit slower than the outgoing part (if the RTX 4080 Super doesn't come out). In a worst-case scenario, it might not even come with the AD102 GPU die.\n\nThe main metric that the 4090 D will need to meet is TPP, Total Processing Power. This is calculated by the maximum compute for a given bit-depth, using TFLOPS (or TOPS for integer work) multiplied by the number of bits. For the RTX 4090, TPP is 660.8 * 8 = 5,286 for FP8 work running on the Tensor cores (sparsity doesn't count). Also note that the value is the same for FP16: 330.4 * 16 = 5,286. The allowed limit is 4,800, so the RTX 4090 is about 10% \"too powerful.\"(Image credit: U.S. Department of Commerce)This is why the RTX 4080 can still be sold (and manufactured / assembled) in China. It has a TPP of 389.6 * 8 = 3,117. There's a secondary metric for data center parts called Performance Density (TPP divided by die area), but that doesn't come into play for consumer GPUs. It's the reason the Nvidia L4 also falls under the restrictions, as it has a PD rating of 6.6, using the AD104's 294 mm^2 die size and a TPP value of 1,936. (It's a good thing PD doesn't apply to consumer products, as the entirety of Nvidia's desktop RTX 40-series has a PD above 6.0.)\n\nSo what would Nvidia need to do for an RTX 4090 D to be allowable under U.S. export controls? Technically, anything below 4,800 TPP would suffice, but Nvidia will likely build in some wiggle room \u2014 to ensure overclocking as an example doesn't become a problem. Assume a clock speed of 2.7 GHz and we get a maximum number of SMs of 108. That would still have a TPP score of 4,778, however, so Nvidia will likely be aiming a bit lower, like around 100 SMs (4,428 TPP), just to be safe.\n\nMaking a neutered RTX 4090 is a smart move from Nvidia, as the Chinese market is huge, with a total population over 4x greater than the United States. As a result, it's worth Nvidia's time and effort to create a high-end replacement for the Chinese market that is similarly priced, so it can reclaim the ultra-high-end GPU market \u2014 7900 XTX cards are reportedly doing well in China right now.\n\nAccording to WCCFTech, the RTX 4090 D will be available from add-in board partners in China, similar to the RTX 4090, with no indication of a Founders Edition model. Pricing is also reported to be \"similar\" to the RTX 4090's old price in China \u2014 i.e. before the restrictions caused prices to shoot up \u2014 though it may be a tad less expensive to reflect its lower performance.\n\nThe demise of the RTX 4090 and the rise of the RTX 4090 D is the result of the U.S. Commerce Departments recent attempts to deny China access to advanced technologies. The RTX 4090 is an unfortunate casualty of the recent bans, though given what we're now seeing with RTX 4090 cards being retrofitted with blower-style \u00a0coolers, its understandable that even consumer parts may need restrictions.\n\nThe RTX 4090 D is one of several GPUs Nvidia is creating to comply with the U.S. regulations. Nvidia is also preparing several additional AI and HPC-focused GPUs that will comply with the United States' performance restrictions. The RTX 4090 D will reportedly launch in early 2024.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nAda Lovelace\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (9)\n\n\n\nAaron KlotzSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAaron Klotz is a contributing writer for Tom\u2019s Hardware, covering news related to computer hardware such as CPUs, and graphics cards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about gpus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 50-series GPU scalping extends to system integrators \u2014 over $3,000 for a RTX 5090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI skips RDNA 4 and will not manufacture AMD Radeon 9000-series GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina will enforce clear flagging of all AI generated content starting from September\n\n\n\nSee more latest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 Comments\n\nComment from the forums\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\natomicWAR\n\n\nI totally get they want to address such a large market but it is getting a little bothersome Nvidia has tried to barely fly under the embargo radar again, again and again.

Make it closer to a RTX 4080 in tensor core count. And it shouldn't kill RTX as the RT cores are a different thing. The big thing it would affect is DLSS gains as far as I can tell looking over the architecture.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nilukey77\n\n\nIsnt China chasing the 4090 for its AI related tasks ??\n\nWe all know China's market is huge even more than the US is some cases !!\n\nReally hammers home if Nvidia want to make more money the will build it ..

Yields on those seem to have gone up dramatically enough with the RTX 30 cards, that it wasn't viable to do a GTX production run with them. I don't expect that there will ever be a GTX card based on the RTX 40 or 50 architectures, especially now that AMD can do raytracing, too. Nvidia could release GTX 16, when they did, because RX 5000 couldn't do raytracing at all. A card that can't do raytracing at all, is going to be tough to sell now.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 9 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina will enforce clear flagging of all AI generated content starting from September\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk and OpenAI to fast-track trial to December \u2014 suit aims to stop OpenAI's transition to a for-profit company\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Atari parts store still open after 41 years, has spent $100K+ designing new parts \u2014 last original Atari hardware launched 32 years ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Huawei Kirin X90 chip revealed in state report \u2014 possible server and PC chip set to replace the aging Kunpeng 920 design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoolIT unleashes 4kW single-phase DLC Cold Plate \u2014 Seemingly timed for Nvidia Blackwell Ultra chips\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAkira ransomware can be cracked with sixteen RTX 4090 GPUs in around ten hours \u2014 new counterattack breaks encryption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Flower\u2019s beastly 2800W power supply lands at $899 \u2014 enough juice to power a couple of RTX 5090 GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei's Microsoft Windows license for PCs expires this month, company launching PCs with Harmony OS: Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 50-series GPU scalping extends to system integrators \u2014 over $3,000 for a RTX 5090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel\u2019s new CEO gets a $1 million salary plus $68 million in bonuses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

It was developed by researchers from Argonne National Laboratory, NVIDIA, the University of Chicago and a score of other academic and commercial collaborators.\nWhen the researchers looked back at the nucleotide sequences generated by GenSLMs, they discovered that specific characteristics of the AI-generated sequences closely matched the real-world Eris and Pirola subvariants that have been prevalent this year \u2014 even though the AI was only trained on COVID-19 virus genomes from the first year of the pandemic.\n\u201cOur model\u2019s generative process is extremely naive, lacking any specific information or constraints around what a new COVID variant should look like,\u201d said Arvind Ramanathan, lead researcher on the project and a computational biologist at Argonne. \u201cThe AI\u2019s ability to predict the kinds of gene mutations present in recent COVID strains \u2014 despite having only seen the Alpha and Beta variants during training \u2014 is a strong validation of its capabilities.\u201d\nIn addition to generating its own sequences, GenSLMs can also classify and cluster different COVID genome sequences by distinguishing between variants. In a demo available on NGC, NVIDIA\u2019s hub for accelerated software, users can explore visualizations of GenSLMs\u2019 analysis of the evolutionary patterns of various proteins within the COVID viral genome.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GenSLM.mp4\n\u00a0\nReading Between the Lines, Uncovering Evolutionary Patterns\nA key feature of GenSLMs is its ability to interpret long strings of nucleotides \u2014 represented with sequences of the letters A, T, G and C in DNA, or A, U, G and C in RNA \u2014 in the same way an LLM trained on English text would interpret a sentence. This capability enables the model to understand the relationship between different areas of the genome, which in coronaviruses consists of around 30,000 nucleotides.\nIn the NGC demo, users can choose from among eight different COVID variants to understand how the AI model tracks mutations across various proteins of the viral genome. The visualization depicts evolutionary couplings across the viral proteins \u2014 highlighting which snippets of the genome are likely to be seen in a given variant.\n\u201cUnderstanding how different parts of the genome are co-evolving gives us clues about how the virus may develop new vulnerabilities or new forms of resistance,\u201d Ramanathan said. \u201cLooking at the model\u2019s understanding of which mutations are particularly strong in a variant may help scientists with downstream tasks like determining how a specific strain can evade the human immune system.\u201d\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SLM.mp4\n\u00a0\nGenSLMs was trained on more than 110 million prokaryotic genome sequences and fine-tuned with a global dataset of around 1.5 million COVID viral sequences using open-source data from the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center. In the future, the model could be fine-tuned on the genomes of other viruses or bacteria, enabling new research applications.\nTo train the model, the researchers used NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU-powered supercomputers, including Argonne\u2019s Polaris system, the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Perlmutter and NVIDIA\u2019s Selene.\nThe GenSLMs research team\u2019s Gordon Bell special prize was awarded at last year\u2019s SC22 supercomputing conference. At this week\u2019s SC23, in Denver, NVIDIA is sharing a new range of groundbreaking work in the field of accelerated computing.

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Editor\u2019s note: This post is part of our weekly In the NVIDIA Studio series, which celebrates featured artists, offers creative tips and tricks, and demonstrates how NVIDIA Studio technology improves creative workflows.\u00a0\nThis week\u2019s talented In the NVIDIA Studio artist, Nourhan Ismail, created a literal NVIDIA studio.\nHer piece, called Creator by Day, Gamer by Night, was crafted with the isometric art style and impressive graphical fidelity Ismail\u2019s known for, rich with vibrant colors and playful details. It also captures her \u201cwork hard, play hard\u201d mentality as a 3D artist, interior designer and game level designer.\nThe same art style is featured in the NVIDIA Studio Sessions YouTube miniseries led by Ismail, which provides step-by-step tutorials on how to create a low-poly bedroom, from inception to final render.\n\nFacial Animations Made Easier\nReallusion is the maker of Reallusion iClone, real-time 3D animation software built to produce professional animations for films and video games.\nTo expedite character animation workflows, the company recently launched its AccuFACE plug-in, which accurately captures facial expressions from webcams and conventional video files, without the need for expensive, specialized equipment.\n\nThe NVIDIA Maxine software development platform, the foundational technology behind the revolutionary NVIDIA Broadcast app, powers this incredible capability by weighing output and analyzing facial expressions and blendshapes to predict facial mesh animations.\nFrom there, the AccuFACE plug-in converts this data into facial mesh assets for creators to apply seamlessly. It also fine-tunes lip and tongue articulation using proprietary AccuLIPS technology.\n\nDownload the plug-in today, available to creators with NVIDIA RTX GPUs.\nTurning Pain Into Beauty\nIsmail\u2019s creative journey began at age four as a form of escape from the armed conflict occurring in Syria, her homeland. During that time, Ismail\u2019s family faced many difficulties, including the loss of their home.\nIn the aftermath, she looked to her father, an accomplished artist and fashion designer, as a source of inspiration.\n\u201cHis encouragement propelled me to showcase the pinnacle of my abilities, reminding me that art has the power to transform pain into beauty,\u201d she said.\nThat encouragement has guided and fueled Ismail\u2019s creative journey, eventually giving rise to her signature, single-room isometric style, an homage to the power of resilience and finding beauty in adversity.\nWarm and homey.\n\u201cStarting with a single room, I delve into interior design, crafting spaces that reflect the comfort and joy I yearned for during challenging times,\u201d she said. \u201cTo me, overcoming adversity proves that even from the harshest circumstances, beauty can emerge.\u201d\nIsmail started as a self-taught 3D artist, driven by a passion to learn the intricacies of creating digital masterpieces.\n\u201cPosting my works became a personal gauge of improvement \u2014 not for validation, but as a record of my learning curve,\u201d she said.\nBeautifully conceived, masterfully executed.\nEach of Ismail\u2019s pieces is a testament to her evolving skills, dedication and love for sharing her craft, especially with her father.\nIn fact, she dedicated her first isometric house to her father. \u201cThat was the happiest moment, to create something inspiring and make someone happy,\u201d she said.\nIsometric Art\nIsmail first collects reference material on Adobe Behance to gain inspiration on ways to mix different art styles.\nShe then opens Blender and starts sketching in 3D. Blender Cycles\u2019 RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing, powered by her GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU, ensured smooth viewport movement.\nA gorgeous work in progress.\nWhile the models are still fairly rudimentary, Ismail calculates the angles that light should be coming in from.\n\u201cLighting is an emotional element,\u201d she said. \u201cThe lighting of each piece evokes different emotions and a certain idiosyncratic introspectiveness, making the experience unique to each person.\u201d\nThe NVIDIA Studio has NVIDIA Canvas!\nHer trick is to regularly switch between rich, colorful scenes and plain color models to measure the emotional weight and visual impact. She either creates the custom textures herself or downloads premade ones online when on a time crunch.\nIsmail\u2019s incredible detail on full display.\nThen, she plays with camera angles to analyze depth shadows and lighting, setting up animations and sequence shots in Blender. There, Blender Cycles\u2019 RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing delivered seamless viewport movement.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/studio-nourhan-ismail-wk85-nvidia-camera-animation-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nFinal touch-ups are done in post-production in Adobe After Effects. Over 30 GPU-accelerated effects sped the process, allowed Ismail to complete the project with time to spare.\n\u201cCreator by Day, Gamer by Night\u201d in dark mode.\n\u201cThere will always be hard times, so never give up and keep believing in yourself,\u201d Ismail encourages content creators.\nDigital 3D artist Nourhan Ismail.\nCheck out Ismail\u2019s Instagram for more spectacular isometric art.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

The chip is available in North America and other regions not impacted by a new wave of U.S. export restrictions announced last month blocking sales of the A800 and other high-end AI chips to China and other countries.\n[Related: AMD\u2019s Threadripper 7000 Series To Mark Return Of High-End Desktop CPUs For Prosumers]\n\n\nid\nunit-1659132512259\n\n\ntype\nSponsored post\n\n\nIn an interview with CRN, Allen Bourgoyne, a director of product marketing at Nvidia, said the company introduced the A800 40GB Active because it needed a replacement for 2018\u2019s Quadro GV100, which it stopped producing after being one of the last GPUs to use Nvidia\u2019s six-year-old Volta architecture.\n\u201cWhatever happened to China, we would have had to build a follow-on product. We would\u2019ve needed to do that, because that product [the GV100] went end-of-life. We needed a replacement,\u201d he said.\nWhen the time came to design the GV100\u2019s successor, the product team looked at the GPUs \u201cavailable to us\u201d that could meet the product requirements defined by the team. These requirements included constraints around physical, electrical, cooling and pricing attributes, and the product also had to deliver fast double-precision performance, which is crucial for HPC applications, according to Bourgoyne.\nThis is typical of how Nvidia designs its chip-based products.\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically product engineering,\u201d Bourgoyne said.\nFrom the options available, the product team decided to use \u201cthe same GPU [that] was used in the original A800 server product,\u201d mainly due to the A800\u2019s high throughput for double-precision computing, which is also known as 64-bit floating point or FP64, according to the Nvidia employee.\nNvidia introduced the A800 server GPU to customers in China last year as an alternative to its powerful A100 GPU because the latter part had been banned in the country by U.S. export restrictions.\nThe company designed the A800 to sidestep these restrictions by reducing the GPU\u2019s chip-to-chip bandwidth, but Nvidia had to halt sales of the A800 and other high-end GPUs to China last month due to new U.S. rules targeting high performance density capabilities.\nTo the A800 40GB Active\u2019s product team, however, it didn\u2019t matter that the A800 started out as a server GPU designed initially for the Chinese market or that it would be banned from the country a year later. What was important was that it was available and it fit the team\u2019s needs.\n\u201cIt would exist regardless of what happened to China,\u201d Bourgoyne said.\nThis is similar to how Nvidia tapped the Volta-based V100 server GPU for the GV100 workstation chip.\n\u201cFor the foreseeable future, we\u2019ll probably always need to leverage data center parts for high double-precision components for things we need in desktop. That\u2019s just where the technology is more important,\u201d Bourgoyne said.\nHow Nvidia Adapted The A800 For A Workstation\nTo adapt the A800 for a workstation, which is a heavy-duty desktop PC, the product team needed to make some changes from the server design.\nOne of the most important changes is the addition of a fan for actively cooling the GPU since a workstation can\u2019t provide enough cooling for a server chip that is only equipped with a passive cooling solution, according to Bourgoyne.\nBecause the fan requires power, that meant the product team had to adjust the GPU to keep it within the team\u2019s targeted power budget for the product. These adjustments included trimming down the GPU\u2019s memory a \u201clittle bit\u201d and running the GPU \u201ca little slower,\u201d Bourgoyne said.\nThe result is that the A800 40GB Active offers \u201csimilar performance\u201d to the A800 server GPU, but it can offer that performance in a desktop form factor rather than a server, the product marketer added.\nHow A800 40GB Active Compares To Quadro GV100\nCompared to 2018\u2019s Quadro GV100, the A800 40GB Active is considered a big upgrade, offering 40GB of HBM2 memory versus GV100\u2019s 32GB, a 5,120-bit memory interface versus GV100\u2019s 4,096-bit interface, 1.5 TB/s of memory bandwidth versus GV100\u2019s 870 GB/s, 6,912 CUDA cores versus GV100\u2019s 5,120 CUDA cores and 400 GB/s of NVLink chip-to-chip bandwidth versus GV100\u2019s 200 GB/s.\nAnd while the A800 40GB Active\u2019s 432 Tensor cores is less than the GV100\u2019s 640 Tensor cores, the former is capable of hitting more than five times the peak Tensor performance at 623.8 teraflops. The GPU also provides a single-precision performance of 19.5 teraflops and a double-precision performance of 9.7 teraflops, which are 31 percent increases over the GV100\u2019s capabilities.\nCompared to the GV100, the A800 40GB Active runs 4.2 times faster for AI inference with the BERT Large model, 90 percent faster for AI training with the BERT Large model, 90 percent faster for the GTC benchmark and 70 percent faster for the LAMMPS benchmark, according to internal tests run by Nvidia.\nWhat makes the A800 40GB Active a big upgrade is that the GPU is based on Nvidia\u2019s Ampere architecture, which brings several substantial improvements over Volta, including a new efficiency technique for speeding up AI computations called structural sparsity and the ability to split the GPU into as many as seven GPU instances for running multiple workloads in parallel.\nBoth GPUs have a power budget of 240 watts.\nA800 40GB Active Availability\nNvidia started selling the A800 40GB Active globally through channel partners last week, though the recent U.S. export restrictions mean the chip won\u2019t be available in some countries, like China.\nAccording to Nvidia partner PNY Technologies, the full list of excluded countries is as follows:\nAfghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Belarus, Burma, Cambodia, Central African Republic, China, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cuba, Cyprus, Egypt, Eritrea, Georgia, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, North Korea, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Libya, Macau, Moldova, Mongolia, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, South Sudan, Republic of Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Vietnam, Yemen and Zimbabwe.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Editor\u2019s note: This post is part of our weekly In the NVIDIA Studio series, which celebrates featured artists, offers creative tips and tricks, and demonstrates how NVIDIA Studio technology improves creative workflows. We\u2019re also deep diving on new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.\nCharacter animator Sir Wade Neistadt works to make animation and 3D education more accessible for aspiring and professional artists alike through video tutorials and industry training.\nThe YouTube creator, who goes by Sir Wade, also likes a challenge. When electronics company Razer recently asked him to create something unique and creative using the new Razer Blade 18 laptop with GeForce RTX 4090 graphics, Sir Wade obliged.\n\u201cI said yes because I thought it\u2019d be a great opportunity to try something creatively risky and make something I didn\u2019t yet know how to achieve,\u201d the artist said.\n\nI, Robot\nOne of the hardest parts of getting started on a project is needing to be creative on demand, said Sir Wade. For the Razer piece, the animator started by asking himself two questions: \u201cWhat am I inspired by?\u201d and \u201cWhat do I have to work with?\u201d\nSir Wade finds inspiration in games, technology, movies, people-watching and conversations. Fond of tech \u2014 and having eyed characters from the ProRigs library for some time \u2014 he decided his short animation should feature robots.\nWhen creating a concept for the animation, Sir Wade took an unorthodox approach, skipping the popular step of 2D sketching. Instead, he captured video references by acting out the animations himself.\nThis gave Sir Wade the opportunity to quickly try a bunch of movements and preview body mechanics for the animation phase. Since ProRigs characters are rigs based on Autodesk Maya, he naturally began his animation work using this 3D software.\n\u201cYOU SHALL NOT (RENDER) PASS.\u201d\nHis initial approach was straightforward: mimicking the main robot character\u2019s movements with the edited reference footage. This worked fairly well, as NVIDIA RTX-accelerated ray tracing and AI denoising with the default Autodesk Arnold renderer resulted in smooth viewport movement and photorealistic visuals.\nThen, Sir Wade continued tinkering with the piece, focusing on how the robot\u2019s arm plates crashed into each other and how its feet moved. This was a great challenge, but he kept moving on the project. The featured artist would advise, \u201cDon\u2019t wait for everything to be perfect.\u201d\nThe video reference footage captured earlier paid off later in Sir Wade\u2019s creative workflow.\nNext, Sir Wade exported files into Blender software with the Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD) framework, unlocking an open and extensible ecosystem, including the ability to make edits in NVIDIA Omniverse, a development platform for building and connecting 3D tools and applications. The edits could then be captured in the original native files, eliminating the need for tedious uploading, downloading and file reformatting.\nAI-powered RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in the viewport allowed Sir Wade to manipulate the scene with ease.\nSir Wade browsed the Kitbash3D digital platform with the new asset browser Cargo to compile kits, models and materials, and drag them into Blender with ease. It\u2019s important at this stage to get base-level models in the scene, he said, so the environment can be further refined.\nDubbed the \u201cultimate desktop replacement,\u201d the Razer Blade 18 offers NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 graphics.\nSir Wade raved about the Razer Blade 18\u2019s quad-high-definition (QHD+) 18\u2033 screen and 16:10 aspect ratio, which gives him more room to create, as well as its color-calibrated display, which ensures uploads to social media are as accurate as possible and require minimal color correction.\nThe preinstalled NVIDIA Studio Drivers, free to RTX GPU owners, are extensively tested with the most popular creative software to deliver maximum stability and performance.\n\u201cThis is by far the best laptop I\u2019ve ever used for this type of work.\u201d \u2014 Sir Wade Neistadt\n\nReturning to the action, Sir Wade used an emission shader to form the projectiles aimed at the robot. He also tweaked various textures, such as surface imperfections, to make the robot feel more weathered and battle-worn, before moving on to visual effects (VFX).\nThe artist used basic primitives as particle emitters in Blender to achieve the look of bursting particles over a limited number of frames. This, combined with the robot and floor surfaces containing surface nodes, creates sparks when the robot moves or gets hit by objects.\nSir Wade\u2019s GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU with Blender Cycles RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in the viewport provides interactive, photorealistic rendering for modeling and animation.\nParticle and collusion effects in Blender enable compelling VFX.\nTo further experiment with VFX, Sir Wade imported the project into the EmberGen simulation tool to test out various preset and physics effects.\nVFX in EmberGen.\nHe added dust and debris VFX, and exported the scene as an OpenVDB file back to Blender to perfect the lighting.\nFinal lighting elements in Blender.\n\u201cI chose an NVIDIA RTX GPU-powered system for its reliable speed, performance and stability, as I had a very limited window to complete this project.\u201d \u2014 Sir Wade Neistadt\n\nFinally, Sir Wade completed sound-design effects in Blackmagic Design\u2019s DaVinci Resolve software.\nSir Wade\u2019s video tutorials resonate with diverse audiences because of their fresh approach to solving problems and individualistic flair.\n\u201cCreativity for me doesn\u2019t come naturally like for other artists,\u201d Sir Wade explained. \u201cI reverse engineer the process by seeing a tool or a concept, evaluating what\u2019s interesting, then either figuring out a way to use it uniquely or explaining the discovery in a relatable way.\u201d\nSir Wade Neistadt.\nCheck out Sir Wade\u2019s animation workshops on his website.\nLess than two days remain in Sir Wade\u2019s Fall 2023 Animation Challenge. Download the challenge template and Maya character rig files, and submit a custom 3D scene to win an NVIDIA RTX GPU or other prizes by end of day on Wednesday, Nov. 15.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

OpenUSD is a key technology in Autodesk\u2019s suite of products and solutions, across media and entertainment; architecture, engineering and construction; and product design and manufacturing.\nThe latest OpenUSD updates to Autodesk Maya enable artists and technical professionals to create and manipulate OpenUSD assets with greater control and efficiency, while also ensuring more efficient and accurate 3D workflows.\n\nRegister for NVIDIA GTC, which takes place March 17-21, to hear how companies like Autodesk\u00a0are using the latest innovations in AI and graphics.\u00a0Join OpenUSD Day to learn how to build generative AI-enabled 3D pipelines and tools using Universal Scene Description.\n\nBridging the Digital and Real Worlds With Maya and OpenUSD\nMany creators are using Maya and OpenUSD to propel their 3D workflows.\nKarol Osinski is a 3D artist at S20M, an architectural and design firm that specializes in tackling unique, bold and elegant projects. When it comes to creating architectural visualizations, Osinski says the biggest challenge is matching the digital world to the real one.\nUsing USD and creative tools such as Maya, SideFX Houdini and Epic Games\u2019 Unreal Engine, Osinski creates high-quality visuals for clients while accelerating his architectural workflows.\nOsinski\u2019s panoramic view from the 20th floor terrace in the Upper East Side\n\u201cOpenUSD provides the possibility of bridging different tools like never before,\u201d said Osinski. \u201cI love how accessible USD is for first-time users and how it opens opportunities to make designs very complex.\u201d\n\u201cSir Wade\u201d Neistadt, an animator and YouTube creator, aims to make animation and 3D education more accessible through his video tutorials and industry training. The first step of his unique animation workflow is to act out his animations on camera. He then translates them in Maya to begin his animation work before using USD to export them to other 3D software, including Blender, for finishing touches.\nThe making of Sir Wade\u2019s VFX robot animation\n3D artists at NVIDIA are also experiencing the power of Maya and OpenUSD. Technical specialist Lee Fraser led the \u201cFerret-Tale Project\u201d to showcase character creation and animation workflows enabled by OpenUSD and generative AI.\nTo create the demo, Fraser and his team collaborated across 3D applications like Blender, Autodesk Maya and Reallusion Character Creator through OpenUSD Connectors. This allowed them to reduce the data prep and import and export time that\u2019s usually required when working with multiple data sources.\n\u201cMy favorite thing about using OpenUSD is not having to think about where the 3D files I use originated from,\u201d Fraser said. \u201cIt was also easy to use USD layers to experiment with applying different animation clips with different characters.\u201d\n\nMembers of the creative community joined a recent livestream to share their workflows using Autodesk tools, OpenUSD and NVIDIA Omniverse, a development platform for connecting and building OpenUSD-based tools and applications.\nWhether adjusting lighting conditions in an environment or looking at building designs from the street view, designers in architecture, engineering, construction and operations are advancing their work with AI. Learn more by watching the replay:\n\nShaping the Future of 3D With More Efficient Workflows\nAU 2023 attendees experienced how Autodesk is enhancing Maya with its new OpenUSD plug-in to provide additional practical workflows for various production processes. The software\u2019s latest features include:\n\nSimplified asset sharing: Designers can now use relative paths when creating OpenUSD stages, allowing for easy asset sharing between different systems. This includes support for sublayers, references, payloads and textures.\nEnhanced control: Plug-in developers and technical directors can overwrite the default prim writers in Maya USD to gain complete control over their OpenUSD exports.\n\nPlus, Autodesk introduced impressive capabilities to LookdevX in Maya, a look-development tool that lets users create OpenUSD shade graphs and custom materials in Maya. These new features include:\n\nStreamlined shader creation: Users can employ a unified shader workflow, replacing the need for multiple shaders. They can select their desired shader type within the parameters panel, with intuitive error messages guiding them to the correct selection.\nEfficient operations: Creators can copy, paste and duplicate shaders and materials using the Outliner and LookdevX tool sets, with the option to include or exclude connections.\nSeamless color management: LookdevX in Maya integrates with color managers in other digital content creation apps to ensure accurate color representation. Color management data is precisely embedded in USD files for accurate reading.\nAdvanced graphing: Users can explore advanced graphing options with the integrated component workflow, supporting multichannel Extended Dynamic Range (EXR) workflows within USD, MaterialX or Arnold shading graphs.\nEfficient troubleshooting: Solo nodes enable faster look-development workflows and efficient graph troubleshooting. Users can inspect renders of upstream nodes, supporting both Autodesk Arnold and MaterialX graphs, including materials, shaders and compounds.\n\nAccess to default prim options in Maya UI\nGet Plugged Into the World of OpenUSD\nAnyone can build their own Omniverse extension or Connector to enhance their 3D workflows and tools. Explore the Omniverse ecosystem\u2019s growing catalog of connections, extensions, foundation applications and third-party tools.\nAutodesk and NVIDIA are founding members of the Alliance for OpenUSD (AOUSD), together strengthening an open future with USD.

One key player in this transition is Nvidia, the AI-driven computing company, which makes both hardware and software for a range of industries. In this episode, HBR editor in chief Adi Ignatius speaks with Nvidia\u2019s CEO and cofounder Jensen Huang\u00a0at HBR\u2019s Future of Business conference\u00a0about how he keeps his company\u00a0agile\u00a0in the face of accelerating change\u00a0and where he sees AI going next.\n\n\n\nALISON BEARD: Welcome to the\u00a0HBR IdeaCast\u00a0from Harvard Business Review. I\u2019m Alison Beard.\nThere\u2019s no question that the biggest business story of 2023 is artificial intelligence \u2013 not just all of us using generative AI tools like ChatGPT on our own but what those advances mean for how companies can collect and use data to improve decision making, R&D and more. These developments are driving a new, exponentially faster era of computing, and our guest today is at the forefront of this warp-speed transition.\nJensen Huang is the founder and CEO of Nvidia, a world leader in AI-driven computing that makes both software and hardware for a host of industries.\nAn electrical engineer by training, he launched the company with two co-founders at a Denny\u2019s restaurant. It now earns $26 billion in annual revenue and employs 26,000 people around the world. Its technology is quite literally propelling us into the future.\nJensen spoke with HBR editor in chief Adi Ignatius at HBR\u2019s Future of Business virtual conference last week about not just what\u2019s new in A.I. and computing but also the kind of corporate culture and leadership that keeps Nvidia agile and innovative.\nHere is their conversation.\nADI IGNATIUS: Jensen, thank you for joining us on what I know is an early morning for you, probably a busy day for you. We really appreciate you making the time.\nJENSEN HUANG: I\u2019m happy to be here.\nADI IGNATIUS: So Jensen, NVIDIA is producing technology that is quite literally driving the future, and I\u2019m talking about the chips and processors that are driving innovation in AI and generative AI. I\u2019d love your view as a sort of hardware guy. What\u2019s your thought on AI, on gen AI? Do you think it will revolutionize how we work and play, or is it simply too soon to tell?\nJENSEN HUANG: Well, at the core of generative AI is the ability for software to understand the meaning of data. You can understand the meaning of words of course, letters and words and sentences and paragraphs, and find the relationships and patterns. And from a lot of examples, it figures out \u2013 learns \u2013 the representation of the data and even understand its meaning.\nSo it understands the structure and understand how it\u2019s constructed and the meaning of the information. This applies to English, it applies to pixels, 3D objects, proteins, chemicals. We\u2019ve now used this deep learning method to learn the representation of a whole lot of different types of data \u2013 any data with structure. And so there are a lot of things in the physical world, in the world that we live in that has structure.\nOnce we can understand the meaning of the data, and we can associate one modality to another modality, for example, we can associate the pixels of a cat in an image with the word cat. Once you could do this for one modality to another modality, then you can translate things. And so you could translate from English to Chinese, Chinese to French. You can also of course translate from English to pixels, which is generative AI or from pixels to language, which is captioning. Or you could go from text to text summarization, so on and so forth.\nThis basic model, the model that has learned representation of data is incredibly powerful. And so now what the AI industry, what the computer industry is doing is mixing all of these type of generative methods and translation methods into all kinds of interesting applications. So I think at the core of this excitement is the fundamental ability to learn representation, learn meaning, and to go from one modality to another and that\u2019s just incredibly powerful.\nADI IGNATIUS: I\u2019m guessing that our viewers, by and large are familiar with gen AI, maybe are playing around with it, probably relatively few are using it or applying it, other than through experimentation. I\u2019d love \u2013 do you have examples maybe using NVIDIA technology of applications that you\u2019re amazed by that you\u2019re seeing out there already?\nJENSEN HUANG: Well, we\u2019re using AI to design our chips, to find optimal placements, to help us connect transistors into circuits and help us optimize designs at a scale that isn\u2019t really possible before. We\u2019re starting to use AI to help us determine from a failure where the bug likely started from, which line of code was responsible for the bug. So we\u2019re using generative AI to help us from everything from designing the chip, optimizing the chip, to understanding where the failures are. One of the most powerful things that\u2019s happening of course, is that generative AI predicts the next word or predict the next letter, next word, next sentence, next paragraph, predicts the next pixel, it predicts the next frame of a video. These predictions could hallucinate. And one of the really effective ways is one of them, of course, is providing a lot of context, a lot of prompts that people do to set the background, precondition the model before you prompt it, before you ask it a question, or before you ask it to do something.\nOne of the things that\u2019s really useful is retrieval augmentation. What that means is a database, whether it\u2019s structured or unstructured, tabular or otherwise that has been vectorized \u2013 vectorizing or embedding a database, requires you to learn the relationship between all the data among each other, just like you\u2019re learning the representation of the data that I was talking about before. And by learning the representation and learning the \u2013 vectorizing the database, you could understand its meaning. And so what\u2019s really exciting now is that you could vectorize the database, you can connect it to a large language model and that large language model essentially allows you to talk to your data. Every company has a ton of data in their company. Most of that data is now dormant. It\u2019s hard to use. Sometimes you have to do a lot of queries on it.\nBut now you could have a database that actually understands meaning. And so you could do a semantic search into the database. It brings back out the information that you meant to query, and you take that embedding and you augment that with the prompt that you\u2019re prompting the model with. And so now the context, the background information with this prompt is much richer. And so the thing that is really quite generalized now is the ease of being able to interact with applications because of large language models that understands your meaning.\nAnd then secondarily, all of these databases that you can now vectorize, which could then be used to augment the prompts and queries. And so the applications across your company is really quite amazing. One of the fun things, of course, if you\u2019re a company with a large customer service department and customer service agents are inputting their interactions with customers, whether it\u2019s problems or complaints or whatever it is, help that you\u2019re routing the customer through, all of that is somehow captured in a very large database. But wouldn\u2019t it be amazing if now that database was vectorized and you can just talk to the database. What are the things that people are most upset about? What are some trends that we\u2019re starting to see? If we want to improve the customer service of our company, what are the top two or three things that you can do? You could talk to your database like you\u2019re talking to a person, and that\u2019s really powerful.\nADI IGNATIUS: So I want to shift here a little bit and talk about some of the challenges of running a tech company in 2023. And for starters, how do you keep up with constantly shifting demand for new products, for new services? And how do you build a management team that can imagine the future and keep pace with so much change?\nJENSEN HUANG: Well, you got to learn. First of all, we\u2019re surrounded by people who are expert in the art, in the fundamental and the foundational parts of computer science and they could be compiler experts or they could be chip design experts, or they could be processor design experts or interconnect experts or so on and so forth. And so you\u2019ve got experts all over your company and they\u2019re the best in the field of what they do. Meanwhile, you want your company to be as alert as possible.\nAnd so the ability for information to be moving freely in your organization without being trapped in silos is something that\u2019s really important as the company gets larger and larger. Especially when the industry\u2019s moving so fast, you want to be alert of very weak signals that could be coming from somewhere. And so it could be a research paper that\u2019s coming out of left field, it could be related to digital biology, it could be related to something in robotics. And somehow that robotics information, it could be generalized in such a way that it could be useful for how we train a chatbot.\nMaybe reinforcement learning was something that was really invented for articulating and animating stick figures and articulating fingers and things like that and playing a game. But it turns out that reinforcement learning human feedback could be quite useful in fine-tuning a large language model. And so you want to be able to see developments in adjacent fields or even unrelated fields and be able to somehow distill it back down to first principles and then extrapolate it to useful applications in other domains.\nThat fundamental ability of starting from really good foundation, expertise in the company, the ability to stay alert of weak signals, and then being able to go back to first principles when you make some observation, go back to first principles on why is that important, what is the reason, what are the governing dynamics associated with that phenomenon? And then be able to generalize them.\nADI IGNATIUS: Then you have the political issues that affect your business. I\u2019d love to hear you talk about how NVIDIA is coping with the loss of, I think it\u2019s billions of dollars in sales to China partly as a result of US restrictions on sales of sophisticated chips to China.\nJENSEN HUANG: Well, the restriction is a capability restriction. It\u2019s not an absolute restriction. The limitations are related to the performance levels of our GPUs, these are restrictions of CPUs and computers that has gone back a very, very long time. The restrictions limit the level of capability or the amount of computation that a processor can do. The first thing that we have to do is comply with the regulation and understand what the limits are and to the best of our ability offer products in the marketplace to serve customers that can still be competitive while complying with the restrictions.\nAnd so the challenge there is that the local markets, especially in China, has a lot of competitors. And so we have to compete in the marketplace while, of course, complying with the regulations that are inspired by national security. And so it\u2019s not easy and it\u2019s a great challenge and the competitors are moving quickly. And so it\u2019s like anything else, you\u2019ve got to stay alert and do the best you can.\nADI IGNATIUS: So it sounds like you\u2019re saying you\u2019re not giving up on that market, you\u2019re finding ways within what\u2019s allowable, finding ways to, if I have you right, create new products or new approaches to that market? Is that fair?\nJENSEN HUANG: Well, only if the new products continues to be attractive to customers. The first thing that we have to do is understand what the regulation limits. And second thing we do is go propose products to the marketplace that customers might still find attractive, but there\u2019s no guarantees. I mean, competitors are coming up with all kinds of ways to attract the customer. And so we will float the best possible products that we can that are fully compliant with regulations and take it from there \u2013 see if customers are still attracted to the products that we offer.\nADI IGNATIUS: I want to go to an audience question now, and this is from Steven. I don\u2019t know where Steven is, but question is, do you think that AI will always need human supervision?\nJENSEN HUANG: A human in the loop is pretty important. As you know in robotics, you could have different levels of autonomy and most of the levels of autonomy until you have a great deal of nines of safety and safety in all kinds of different ways. For example, in the case of a self-driving car, if you want the self-driving car to be able to take your family while they\u2019re sleeping in the backseat fully autonomously, you want to be fairly assured that the sensor system, the computing system, the vehicle control, all of it has diversity and redundancy.\nAnd so for example, you might insist on making sure that you have cameras as well as radars, as well as LIDARs. You might even have redundant steering control and redundant braking dynamics and so on and so forth. And these things give you assurance that irrespective of the conditions, that the critical components that affects the functionality has diversity and redundancy.\nDiversity and redundancy is an important part of intelligence, autonomous intelligence in a lot of ways. Even in companies, we have diversity and redundancy. Notice, we talk a lot about diversity in companies because it allows the company to be more resilient. We have redundant ways of doing the same thing. We\u2019re trying to analyze the same problem from different perspectives. Maybe the sales organization is augmented by the marketing organization, which is augmented by so on and so forth, and different types of ways to ensure the vibrancy and the resilience of the company. And most autonomous systems, whether it\u2019s as a robotic car or it\u2019s a large organization, wants to be designed in such a way that you have diversity and redundancy.\nAnd then above that, you want human in the loop. Sometimes you get to a level where you don\u2019t believe you need human in loop inside the car. Maybe you have human in loop outside the car and you\u2019re monitoring the effectiveness. This is no different than air traffic control for example:\u00a0 you have two pilots. You also have redundant autopilot systems, but you also have air traffic control. And pilots keep an eye out for each other.\nAnd so there\u2019s a lot of different ways that autonomous systems are designed for maximum safety and reliability. The same line of thinking will have to be done for generative AI. We have to invent the technologies for safety. We have to apply engineering methods that allows us to design systems that are safe, validation systems that ensure safety. And then lastly, for quite a long time, we will likely\u2026 we will not likely, we will surely have human in loop. For example, while you\u2019re learning the next batch from the next batch of data before you release it out to the world, you have humans validate it and test it and red team it instead of just have it be continuously learning and continuously updating all by itself. So there are a lot of different methods that we ensure safety and human in the loop is one of the best ways.\nADI IGNATIUS: Yep. I\u2019m interested in hearing more about NVIDIA\u2019s culture. One of your vice presidents was quoted as saying, \u201cWorking at NVIDIA feels existential every day. We feel like the company is going to go bankrupt tomorrow.\u201d So I\u2019m wondering, is that deliberate? Do you try to instill a sense of paranoia to try to spur innovation?\nJENSEN HUANG: You don\u2019t have to instill it. If you don\u2019t think you\u2019re in peril, it\u2019s probably because you have your head in the sand. There are no companies that are assured survival. We have the benefit of having built the company from the ground up and having not exaggerated circumstances of nearly going out of business, actual experiences of nearly going out of business a handful of times, we don\u2019t have to pretend that the company\u2019s always peril. The company\u2019s always in peril and we feel it.\nI don\u2019t need and the company doesn\u2019t need assurance that we will do well in order to do our best work. And so I think the company living somewhere between aspiration and desperation, living somewhere within that spectrum is a lot better than either always optimistic or always pessimistic. And so I think a guarded level of optimism and realistic understanding that the company could be in peril at any given time, and we have to stay focused and alert and do our best work and constantly earn the right to be in business. Those feelings and that sensibility I think is really good and healthy for companies to have.\nADI IGNATIUS: From what I\u2019ve read, your management style is somewhat unusual that you maintain a very flat organizational structure, that you have very few one-on-one meetings. Talk about your theory of management.\nJENSEN HUANG: Well, an architecture is designed for the company to do its work, to operate as efficiently as possible. And one of the things that is really important for a company and technology that\u2019s moving as quickly as it is, we invented this technology called accelerated computing. And whereas Moore\u2019s Law in the past, it is no longer nearly this fast, but Moore\u2019s Law in the older days would increase performance by a factor of 10 every five years and a factor of 100 every 10 years.\nBut in the case of accelerated computing, we\u2019re moving somewhere between 1000 to 100,000 times every 10 years. And so when you\u2019re moving that fast, you want to make sure that that information is flowing through the company as quickly as possible. You want the company to be as aligned as possible. And also our company builds really complicated things.\nPeople think our GPUs are like the add-in cards that we designed for gamers, and they are, we build those with great pride and great joy. But the GPUs that we build for AI weighs 70 pounds. They have 35,000 parts. Out of those 35,000 parts, eight of them come from TSMC. They consume 10,000 amps. Obviously they\u2019re so heavy, you use robots to manufacture them. And they\u2019re so\u2026 the computers are so advanced that it takes a supercomputer to test another supercomputer.\nAnd so these GPUs that we\u2019re building are insanely complex and it requires a lot of software to run it. And for a company like us that designs the fundamental chips to create the systems, create the software and creates all the networking and all the silicon photonics and connect it into a large data center and help companies stand it up and operate it, our company information has to really move quickly through the company and really, really have no barriers and no boundaries.\nAnd so we architected a company that allows us to be able to work across this really complicated stack of computing technology on the one hand, build incredibly complicated things on the other hand, and be very comfortable moving at light speed.\nIf you want a company like that, then the last thing you want is for it to be information to pass along hierarchically. And if you look at most organizations, there are only two or three people at the top. And if that starts that way, then the number of layers of management or layers of managers before you get to somebody who\u2019s actually dealing with ground truth could be 7, 8, 9, 10 layers. And I didn\u2019t want that to happen. And so the best way to do that is to put the most\u2026 at the highest level to be as flat as possible up there. And so we probably reduced three or four layers of management out of our company just by doing so.\nADI IGNATIUS: Yeah. So we have time for one more quick question. I wanted to bring in one more audience question. This is from Leon. And the question is, what can you say about quantum computing? To what extent are you investing in it and what can you say about that?\nJENSEN HUANG: Well, in order to build the world\u2019s next fast computer, you need the world\u2019s fastest computer to help you design it, simulate it, create new algorithms for it. And the world\u2019s fastest computer is NVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing systems. And so we don\u2019t build quantum computers, but we work with just about everybody in the quantum computing ecosystem from people who are doing the basic quantum computing design to algorithm developers, to architects who are working on classical quantum computers architectures. And so we work with just about everybody out there. The quantum computer won\u2019t come along in a real industrial way for probably another decade and maybe two. And when it gets here, it\u2019ll likely be an accelerator that\u2019s connected to the NVIDIA accelerated computing systems. And some of the computation will be done. Quantum computers, a lot of the computation will be done on classical computers doing pre-processing, post-processing, and so on and so forth. And so I\u2019m looking forward to when quantum computers are going to be useful and effective, and when it comes, classical computers and particularly the accelerated computing and AI will be a very big part of it.\nALISON BEARD: That\u2019s Jensen Huang, the CEO of NIVDIA, speaking with HBR\u2019s Editor-in-Chief Adi Ignatius at HBR\u2019s future of business conference last week.\nAnd we have more episodes, and more podcasts to help you manage your team, your organization, and your career.

Train another AI to synthesize training data.\nArtificial intelligence is changing the way medicine is done, and is increasingly being used in all sorts of clinical tasks.\nThis is fueled by generative AI and models like GatorTronGPT, a generative language model trained on the University of Florida\u2019s HiPerGator AI supercomputer and detailed in a paper published in Nature Digital Medicine Thursday.\nGatorTronGPT joins a growing number of large language models (LLMs) trained on clinical data. Researchers trained the model using the GPT-3 framework, also used by ChatGPT.\nThey used a massive corpus of 277 billion words for this purpose. The training corpora included 82 billion words from de-identified clinical notes and 195 billion words from various English texts.\nBut there\u2019s a twist: The research team also used GatorTronGPT to generate a synthetic clinical text corpus with over 20 billion words of synthetic clinical text, with carefully prepared prompts. The synthetic clinical text focuses on clinical factors and reads just like real clinical notes written by doctors.\nThis synthetic data was then used to train a BERT-based model called GatorTron-S.\nIn a comparative evaluation, GatorTron-S exhibited remarkable performance on clinical natural language understanding tasks like clinical concept extraction and medical relation extraction, beating the records set by the original BERT-based model, GatorTron-OG, which was trained on the 82-billion-word clinical dataset.\nMore impressively, it was able to do so using less data.\nBoth GatorTron-OG and GatorTron-S models were trained on 560 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs running NVIDIA\u2019s Megatron-LM package on the University of Florida\u2019s HiPerGator supercomputer. Technology from the Megatron LM framework used in the project has since been incorporated with the NVIDIA NeMo framework, which has been central to more recent work on GatorTronGPT.\nUsing synthetic data created by LLMs addresses several challenges. LLMs require vast amounts of data, and there\u2019s a limited availability of quality medical data.\nIn addition, synthetic data allows for model training that complies with medical privacy regulations, such as HIPAA.\nThe work with GatorTronGPT is just the latest example of how LLMs \u2014 which exploded onto the scene last year with the rapid adoption of ChatGPT \u2014 can be tailored to assist in a growing number of fields.\nIt\u2019s also an example of the advances made possible by new AI techniques powered by accelerated computing.\nThe GatorTronGPT effort is the latest result of an ambitious collaboration announced in 2020, when the University of Florida and NVIDIA unveiled plans to erect the world\u2019s fastest AI supercomputer in academia.\nThis initiative was driven by a $50 million gift, a fusion of contributions from NVIDIA founder Chris Malachowsky and NVIDIA itself.\nUsing AI to train more AI is just one example of HiPerGator\u2019s impact, with the supercomputer promising to power more innovations in medical sciences and across disciplines throughout the University of Florida system.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: NVIDIA NeMo \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Instead He Lives Off The GridByPhoebe LiuFollowShareSaveBillionairesDaily CoverThis Nvidia Cofounder Could Have Been Worth $70 Billion. Instead He Lives Off The GridCurtis Priem stands in front of a quantum chandelier\u2014an intricately wired structure that contains the processor chip and helps keep it at a necessary -460 degrees Fahrenheit\u2014at an October groundbreaking event at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The university will become the first one in the world to house an IBM Quantum System One computer next year.Hans Pennink/Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute/APNov 26, 2023, 06:30am ESTShareSaveIf Curtis Priem, Nvidia\u2019s first CTO, had held onto all his stock, he\u2019d be the 16th richest person in America. Instead, he sold out years ago and gave most of his fortune to his alma mater Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\nBy Phoebe Liu, Forbes Staff\n\nCurtis Priem wanders across a wooden stage before coming to a standstill a few feet right of center. It\u2019s one of the \u201cacoustic sweet spots\u201d in the 1,165-seat Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute concert hall that the Nvidia cofounder donated $40 million to construct between 2003 and 2008. Bathed in warm stage lights, Priem, 64 and dressed in suit and red tie, gestures toward the thousands of uniquely curved wood panels lining the walls and tightly-woven fabric specifically tuned for air permeability and mass on the ceiling\u2014all built for ideal acoustics. \u201cThis is the most technically advanced performance space in the world,\u201d the electrical engineer beams, describing the Troy, NY, venue that is named after him: the Curtis Priem Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a much bigger commitment to his alma mater that most recently includes helping it become the first university in the world to house an IBM Quantum System One computer. Expected to be operational by next spring, it will be the cornerstone of a new computational center that will hopefully help RPI and the surrounding area attract top talent.\n\nSince 2001, Priem has given $275 million to RPI, accounting for 40% of RPI\u2019s total gifts during that period, and he\u2019s pledged approximately $80 million more. Only half that amount has ever been publicly acknowledged as gifts from Priem. An anonymous pledge of $360 million was announced by RPI in 2001 around the time Priem started giving, but neither he nor the school would comment on whether he is the donor.\n\nWhat\u2019s even less known is Priem\u2019s own story. An inventor who has almost 200 patents, he helped design the first graphics processor ever for PCs in the early 1980s and later cofounded semiconductor firm Nvidia, where he spent a decade working as its first chief technology officer.\n\n\nFollowing Nvidia\u2019s 1999 IPO, he transferred most of his shares to a charitable foundation, after deciding it was an \u201cexcessive amount of money\u201d to hold onto. A few years later he left the company, in part due to a highly litigious first marriage that ended in divorce and domestic violence allegations against his ex-wife. By 2006 he\u2019d sold off his remaining shares. Had he held onto his entire stake, he\u2019d be worth $70 billion. Instead, Forbes estimates that Priem has a fortune that\u2019s closer to $30 million, just over one tenth of what he\u2019s given to RPI.Photos from Nvidia's early days: Curtis Priem in the company's first office and getting his hair cut and dyed with the Nvidia logo when its share price hit $100 in 1999. \"Back then, it was almost bad luck to take pictures of something you didn\u2019t know would succeed,\" Priem recalls.Curtis Priem\nThat includes a $6 million home near Fremont, California where he lives off the grid with unreliable cell service and writes \u201cmanifestos\u201d filled with equations about how to solve world problems like \u201crepairing the earth.\u201d (None have been published anywhere). He says he often communicates by giving out unique email addresses\u2014sixteen-digit strings of numbers including one given to this Forbes reporter, as a way of avoiding spam (he says he hasn\u2019t gotten any since 2000). He also owns a Gulfstream G450 private jet, named Snoopy, that he bought in 2021 and now uses to fly to RPI four times a year.\nIn an interview on RPI\u2019s campus in the historically blue-collar town of Troy, NY, Priem opens up about his donations, why he left Nvidia and a few regrets. \u201cI did a little crazy thing, and I wish I'd kept a little bit more [Nvidia shares],\u201d admits Priem, who says he still thinks of Nvidia twice a day\u2014when he puts on and takes off his Omega Speedmaster X-33 Mars watch, the same model worn by Thunderbirds and Space Shuttle astronauts; it was a gift from Nvidia on his fifth company anniversary. For him, RPI has become the place not only to put his money but also to find meaning and solace. \u201cHell was happening for me on the outside, and [RPI] was actually my retreat,\u201d says Priem of his work with RPI, where he has served on the board of trustees since 2003. \u201cIt became my purpose and my sanity.\u201d\nPriem chose RPI over the better-known Massachusetts Institute of Technology thanks in part to it having a fancy IBM computer he wanted to use. It turned out to be an ideal place for Priem, who had always been interested in the intersection of technology and the arts. In high school, after moving \u201call over the east coast\u201d as a child, his family settled outside Cleveland, where Priem took cello lessons with the Cleveland Orchestra\u2019s Donald White, the first Black musician to play in a major orchestra, and spent two summers at an intensive camp for classical musicians in North Carolina. He also played the trombone. At RPI, he played cello in its orchestra all four years, and credits much of his creativity in the electronics industry and his work at RPI to his musician upbringing. \u201cTo perform, you have to practice, right? And you have to be creative,\u201d Priem says. \u201cSo I started applying that to electronics and computer science.\u201d\nHe graduated from RPI with a degree in electrical and computer engineering in 1982, and went to work as a staff engineer for PC company Vermont Microsystems, followed by a stint as a hardware engineer at electronic test equipment firm GenRad. He later moved to California to work at Sun Microsystems for seven years.\nThe idea for Nvidia was hatched in 1993 at a Denny\u2019s in Silicon Valley. That\u2019s where he, his Sun Microsystems colleague Chris Malachowsky and their friend Jensen Huang, an engineer who worked at LSI Logic, would meet up to brainstorm how to build a better chip. Priem describes his role early on as the architect creating the underlying blueprint that allowed engineers to design algorithms for Nvidia\u2019s chips, working mostly behind the scenes. \u201cThere was a saying at Nvidia to never put Curtis in front of a camera, and never put Curtis in front of a customer,\u201d Priem quips. (CEO Huang\u2019s response: \u201cCurtis was actually excellent with customers.\u201d)\nIn 1999, Nvidia had two major breakthroughs: It went public with a $1.1 billion market capitalization and it invented its graphics processing unit, or GPU, which was initially used for video editing and gaming but eventually reshaped the computing industry. That July Priem also married his first wife, Veronica, and two months later, established the Priem Family Foundation in which he put more than three quarters of his 12.8% (at IPO) Nvidia stake\u2013about 100 million shares (in today\u2019s share count). Part of the reason for the big gift, he said, was that he didn\u2019t want the government to get the money if he had sold a bunch of shares and owed taxes on them.\nIt was also around that time that Priem looked at his shareholding and thought he\u2019d end up with around $50 million. \u201cMy saving grace was that I couldn\u2019t predict the future,\u201d he says somewhat wistfully about his decision to sell off shares in the now $1.2 trillion (market cap) company.\nAfter initially donating to a handful of causes including The Nature Conservancy and the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Priem shifted away from his goal of alleviating human-induced suffering to preventing it, mostly through education-focused giving. \u201cAdam and Eve had free will and chose a sinful path which originated suffering \u2026 our belief is that most suffering can be avoided since it is within our control to begin with,\u201d stated his foundation\u2019s early website, drawing on his family\u2019s roots in the United Church of Christ (Priem doesn\u2019t practice the religion, but his father, sister and grandparents were all ministers, he says).\nIn 2000, Priem went back to RPI to receive the university\u2019s Entrepreneur of the Year Award for his work at Nvidia. \u201cI walked onto campus, and it\u2019s like, okay, this is sort of my calling,\u201d Priem says. He says he donated $1 million to RPI in 2000 and again in 2001. Then in the fiscal year ending in June 2002, the Priem Family Foundation began disbursing at least $10 million a year to RPI\u2014and has done so ever since.\nMore than 40% Of Gifts to RPI Since June 2001 Have Come From The Priem Foundation\nThings at Nvidia, meanwhile, weren\u2019t going as well. According to Priem, he was distracted by personal issues at home and not contributing at the level he wanted, so he left.\nThe next decade of Priem\u2019s life was a mess, he says\u2014a court found that Veronica had a \u201chistory of domestic violence\u201d against him. He alleged in 2013 court filings that the violence had \u201cgenerated 19 written police reports, five arrests, three criminal convictions, three criminal protective orders, one civil temporary restraining order, and three probationary periods.\u201d According to the same document, Veronica claimed that Curtis \u201ctriggered her violent reactions by provoking her verbally\u201d and mentioned a \u201clack of severity associated with her misconduct.\u201d (Her lawyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) At one point, Curtis Priem says he met with California state senator Bob Wieckowski to advocate for an amendment that would make it harder for alleged perpetrators of domestic violence to receive spousal support. The amendment, SB 28, passed unanimously in a 2015 Senate vote. His ex-wife pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of domestic violence, and he never paid spousal support.\nThroughout this time, Priem continued to help RPI, which he said had financially \u201cfloundered\u201d for decades. He wanted to help \u201cturn this super tanker around.\u201d First, his donations went to the essentials\u2014hiring more faculty, building renovations and acquiring lab equipment. Then came contributions to what\u2019s now the Shirley Ann Jackson Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies and to the performing arts center, which opened in 2008.\nThe idea for his biggest contribution yet came just months ago at a board retreat in Carlsbad, California. That\u2019s where Priem suggested to RPI\u2019s new president Martin Schmidt that they try to bring a quantum computer to RPI, an interesting idea but one Schmidt thought would be too costly.\n\u201cWe left Carlsbad with me agreeing that I would drive down to see Dario Gil, the head of IBM research \u2026 to see if we could convince him that IBM should put a quantum computer on the RPI campus,\u201d Schmidt told Forbes. Just three months later, in June, RPI formally announced plans to bring an IBM Quantum System One computer to campus next year, which will make it the only university in the world to house one.\n\u201cNow, with quantum computers, RPI will be at the forefront of ushering in a completely new paradigm of computing that offers profound possibilities for the exploration of a range of previously intractable problems across areas such as material design, sustainability, pharmaceutical development, healthcare and much more,\u201d Gil said at an October groundbreaking event for the quantum computer.\nPriem\u2019s latest $95 million pledge to bring the computer to campus and set up a new center for it is, in his words, setting his foundation on the \u201cglide path to zero.\u201d\n\u201cThis weekend is actually the termination of our foundation,\u201d Priem said at the groundbreaking event, where he explained to a packed crowd of students, faculty, alumni and other guests that his funding for the computer would be his foundation\u2019s last major gift and use up most of its remaining funds. He made the announcement standing in front of a gleaming \u201cquantum chandelier,\u201d the heart of the forthcoming quantum computer because it contains the quantum chip and is surrounded by intricate gold wiring to keep the 2,000-pound computer cold enough to operate, at around -460 degrees Fahrenheit. The computer is expected to be operational sometime in spring 2024 and will sit under four stained-glass windows in a former chapel.\nPriem\u2019s family foundation currently has $160 million in assets and is on track to wind down by 2031, he says, but he isn\u2019t sure the money will last that long, given all the new initiatives he keeps deciding to fund at RPI. \u201cWe can\u2019t stop spending, so it\u2019ll probably be a lot sooner than that,\u201d says Priem, who adds that \u201cwhen the money runs out, I get to retire.\u201d\n\nMORE FROM FORBESForbesInside The Two Companies That Dominate The U.S. Carrot CropBy Chloe SorvinoForbesHoliday Shoppers May Be Leaving Black Friday And Cyber Monday BehindBy Jeffrey MarcusForbesSatya Nadella And Microsoft Are The Biggest Winners Of The OpenAI Meltdown - For NowBy David JeansForbesMeet The Iranian-Born Billionaire Helping NASA Get Back To The MoonBy Giacomo TogniniForbesYaccarino On Hot Seat As Ad Execs Urge Twitter CEO To ResignBy John Paczkowski\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

(Photo by Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nOff the back of the sale of half a million H100 AI GPUs in Q3, mostly purchased by Facebook's parent company, Meta, as well as Microsoft, aiding a 279% boost to year on year AI revenue, the company is predicted by TSMC to become the world's largest chip company. However, its China sales have been hampered due to the recent enforcement of an export ban.\n\nThe ban is to limit the sales of advanced AI GPUs to China, which could find their way into the military, boosting its capabilities. Older restrictions on GPU sales focussed on a bidirectional transfer rate of 600GB/sec and chip performance of 4800TPP (total processing performance). It's AI GPUs such as the powerful A100, is banned from sale in China, but recently it came to light that hordes of gaming-orientated RTX 4090s with its AD102 GPU cores were purchased and are being repurposed as AI GPUs.\n\nNvidia's GeForce RTX 4090Antony Leather\nThe RTX 4090 is now also banned as its TPP is above 4,800 and the Biden administration implemented performance density restrictions in October, shifting the goal posts and making it even harder to ship high-end GPUs to China. With the RTX 4090 banned, AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX has been in high demand given it's the company's flagship card that can perform close to the RTX 4090 in some games.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of September 2023By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of September 2023By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is keen to keep sales figures up and is working on both gaming and AI-focussed models with less performance to sit below the restrictions and avoid the ban. A so-called RTX 4090 D has been detailed by MEGAsizeGPU, with the D standing for Dragon, will feature a A102 GPU on a diet - the AD102-250 rather than the AD102-300-A1 under the hood of the RTX 4090.\nNvidia also has H20, L20 and L2 AI GPUs that are designed to sit under the performance and density restrictions for sale in China. These new AI GPUs are due for release in 2024.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Along with DLSS Super Resolution and Reflex, it allows us to bring faster and smoother gameplay to the PC version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.\u201d - Marc-Alexandre Milot, Design Director, Beenox\u00a0\nAt 1440p, DLSS 3 boosts performance by 1.6X, enabling 100 FPS+ gameplay on the entire lineup of GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards, and up to 240 FPS gameplay on the GeForce RTX 4090:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 1080p, DLSS 3\u2019s 1.5X performance boost enables you to hit esports frame rates on all GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, and allows you to max out the highest refresh rate displays on the GeForce RTX 4090, which achieves a 300 FPS result:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn GeForce RTX 40 Series laptops, DLSS 3 increases performance by 1.6X at both 1080p and 1440p, enabling all owners to game at fast frame rates, and at up to 230 FPS on GeForce RTX 4090 laptops:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith such fast frame rates on so many GPUs, you may want to supercharge image quality with NVIDIA DLAA, an AI-based anti-aliasing mode that utilizes the same technology developed for DLSS. DLAA uses a native resolution image to maximize image quality, rather than boosting performance, and in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III DLAA can be combined with DLSS Frame Generation for the highest possible image quality, and excellent performance.\nAlso, be sure to activate NVIDIA Reflex, which has helped GeForce gamers reduce system latency in Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Call of Duty: Vanguard, Modern Warfare, Modern Warfare II, and Call of Duty: Warzone\u2122. In Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Reflex reduces system latency by up to 28%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether with the high frame rates delivered by DLSS and low latency delivered by Reflex, competitive players receive the definitive experience on GeForce RTX 40 Series PCs and laptops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemnant II: The Awakened King DLC Launches November 14th: Get The Definitive Experience On GeForce RTX GPUs\nRemnant II from Gunfire Games is the sequel to the best-selling game Remnant: From the Ashes that pits survivors of humanity against new deadly creatures and god-like bosses across terrifying worlds. Play solo or co-op with two other friends to explore the depths of the unknown to stop an evil from destroying reality itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReleased to critical acclaim on July 25th, Remnant II has earned glowing praise from gamers around the world, and is breaking all sorts of records for the franchise. On November 14th, The Awakened King DLC arrives, adding a new quest chain to solve in the beautifully rendered Losomn. You\u2019ll encounter new enemies and bosses, your arsenal will expand with new items, armor and weapons, and players will even unlock a powerful new Archetype, the Ritualist.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX gamers can tailor their Remnant II experience with a full gamut of DLSS modes. DLSS 2 enables all GeForce RTX users to accelerate frame rates, DLSS 3 gives GeForce RTX 40 Series users the power of frame rate multiplication for the fastest performance possible, and DLAA uses a native resolution image to maximize image quality, rather than boosting performance. You can even combine DLAA and DLSS 3 Frame Generation for excellent image quality, and performance.\nUsing DLSS 3, GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers can multiply Remnant II frame rates by an average of 3.5X, enabling owners of the GeForce RTX 4070 and faster cards to enjoy the game at max settings at 4K, at over 60 FPS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name Available November 8th With DLSS 2\nOnce a legendary yakuza, Kazuma Kiryu faked his own death and abandoned his name for the sake of protecting his family. Now, he is thrust into conflict by a mysterious figure attempting to drive him out of hiding. Under the codename \u201cJoryu,\u201d Kiryu embarks on a gripping action narrative with bone-shattering combat in vibrant locations filled with exciting characters and activities, in Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 2 was also available in Judgment, Lost Judgment, and Like a Dragon: Ishin!, and from day-one our AI-powered performance accelerating technology will be available for GeForce RTX gamers playing Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, which launches tomorrow, November 8th. In Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio\u2019s highly anticipated new game, DLSS 2 accelerates frame rates by an average of 2.2X at 4K, with every setting maxed out:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Back Next Week For Even More RTX Games\nEach week there are even more DLSS integrations arriving for an array of games.

The confirmation comes after the French competition authority, the Autorit\u00e9 de la concurrence, conducted a dawn raid in September related to suspected anticompetitive practices in the graphics cards sector.\nInitially, the French regulator did not disclose the name of the company under investigation, but Nvidia revealed its involvement in a regulatory filing for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. The filing, submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), acknowledged the raid by the French authority and indicated that the company is now facing increased interest from other regulatory bodies.\nNvidia\u2019s 10-Q filing stated, \u201cOur position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States, and China.\u201d The French Competition Authority\u2019s inquiry focused on Nvidia\u2019s business and competition practices in the graphics card and cloud service provider markets.\nRead more: Regulators Scrutinize Nvidia\u2019s Graphic Cards Amid Growing Demand and AI Chip Delays\nWhile the company did not provide detailed information about the investigations, it did acknowledge receiving requests for information from regulators in the European Union and China. These requests pertain to Nvidia\u2019s sales of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and efforts to allocate supply. The company also anticipates additional requests for information in the future.\nNvidia\u2019s market position, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, has drawn regulatory attention globally. The company\u2019s dominance in AI-related markets has prompted authorities to scrutinize its business practices, reflecting the growing awareness of the strategic importance of AI technologies.\nIn response to the investigations, Nvidia commented that the heightened regulatory scrutiny may result in additional restrictions on its ability to provide products and services. The outcome of these investigations could have far-reaching implications for Nvidia and the broader tech industry, potentially shaping the landscape of competition in the graphics card and AI sectors.\nSource: EE News Europe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured News\n\nOracle Weighs National Security Risks in TikTok\u2019s US Operations Sale\nMar 18, 2025 by\n                    CPI \n\n\nGermany\u2019s Highest Court Upholds Antitrust Ruling Against Apple\nMar 18, 2025 by\n                    CPI \n\n\nNCAA to End Controversial NIL Ban After Antitrust Lawsuit Settlement\nMar 18, 2025 by\n                    CPI \n\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Examines Antitrust Issues in Medical Residency Market\nMar 17, 2025 by\n                    CPI \n\n\nBelgian Competition Authority Accuses Roche of Anticompetitive Practices in Cancer Drug Market\nMar 17, 2025 by\n                    CPI \n\nAntitrust Mix by CPI\n\nAntitrust Chronicle\u00ae \u2013 Self-Preferencing\nFeb 26, 2025 by\n                    CPI \n\n\nPlatform Self-Preferencing: Focusing the Policy Debate\nFeb 26, 2025 by\n                    Michael Katz                \n\n\nWeaponized Opacity: Self-Preferencing in Digital Audience Measurement\nFeb 26, 2025 by\n                    Thomas Hoppner & Philipp Westerhoff                \n\n\nSelf-Preferencing: An Economic Literature-Based Assessment Advocating a Case-By-Case Approach and Compliance Requirements\nFeb 26, 2025 by\n                    Patrice Bougette & Frederic Marty                \n\n\nSelf-Preferencing in Adjacent Markets\nFeb 26, 2025 by\n                    Muxin Li                \n\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\n\nYour email address\n\n\n\n                                        Thank you for subscribing\n                                    \n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCPI\n                    TV\u00a0|\u00a0\n                    Subscribe\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nEditorial Policy\n\nEditorial Advisory Board\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n\nContact Us\n\nPartnerships\n\nNewsletters\n\n\n\n\nFollow CPI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \u00a9 Competition Policy International 2025            \n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\u00a0|\u00a0Terms\n                    &\n                    Conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The chip manufacturer\u2019s data center revenues hit $14.5 billion, up 279% year over year for the three-month period ending October 29.\n\u201cThe enterprise wave of AI adoption is now beginning,\u201d Nvidia EVP and CFO Colette Kress said last week during the company's earnings call, pointing to a race to deploy AI copilots and assistants by software companies Adobe, Databricks, Snowflake and ServiceNow.\nCloud providers drove roughly half of data center revenue growth, according to Kress, noting the strength of demand for Nvidia graphic processing unit technology from hyperscalers and a growing cadre of GPU-specialized CSPs. \u201cNvidia H100 Tensor Core GPU instances are now generally available in virtually every cloud,\u201d Kress said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDive Insight:\nAs chaos erupted at OpenAI, Nvidia was in the process of remaking the very infrastructure enterprises \u2014 and cloud providers \u2014 are depending on to run large language model operations and scale generative AI capabilities.\nAI-optimized infrastructure, including enhanced processing technology, platform solutions and data center capacity drove robust revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter.\u00a0\n\u201cInvestment in infrastructure for training and inferencing large language models, deep learning recommender systems and generative AI applications is fueling strong broad-based demand for NVIDIA accelerated computing,\u201d Kress said.\nAn ongoing cycle of AI-related product and service launches has accompanied record spikes in Nvidia\u2019s revenue growth.\nThe company introduced the GH200 Grace Hopper server platform\u00a0in August, increasing bandwidth, memory and multi-GPU connectability, and announced plans for broad cloud-based deployments of HGX H200 chip technology earlier this month.\nKress confirmed that AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Oracle will be the first CSPs to offer H200 base instances starting next year.\nThe company launched an AI foundry for building and tuning customized generative AI enterprise applications in Azure public cloud last week at Microsoft Ignite.\n\u201cCustomers can bring their domain knowledge and proprietary data and we help them build their AI models using our AI expertise and software stack in our DGX Cloud,\u201d Kress said.\nThe DGX Cloud subscription service leverages Nvidia software, processors and AI expertise. It was initially deployed in Oracle\u2019s public cloud infrastructure earlier this year.\n\u201cWith each one of our partners, they rent a sandbox on DGX Cloud where we work together,\u201d Nvidia President and CEO Jensen Huang said during the earnings call. \u201cThey bring their data. They bring their domain expertise. We've got our researchers and engineers.\u201d\nIn addition to supporting hyperscaler build-outs, Nvidia infrastructure is fueling the emergence of a novel cloud ecosystem, according to Huang\n\u201cYou're seeing GPU-specialized CSPs cropping up all over the world, and they're dedicated to doing really one thing, which is processing AI,\u201d Huang said.\u00a0\nGrace Hopper instances are now available through GPU-specialized cloud providers and are \u201ccoming soon to Oracle Cloud,\u201d Kress said.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misidentified Nvidia's fiscal year. The company reported earnings for the third quarter of its 2024 fiscal year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npurchase licensing rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled Under:\nCloud, \nAI & Future Tech, \nHardware & Infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCIO Dive news delivered to your inbox\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect user consent:\n\n\n\n\n    By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our\n    Terms of Use and\n    Privacy Policy.

With the Maxine production release, now exclusively available on NVIDIA AI Enterprise, users can access advanced features across augmented reality, audio effects and video effects.\nThe New Face of Avatars\nDigital avatars have been used for decades, often seen as stylized animated representations of a person or character.\nNow, with NVIDIA Maxine\u2019s Live Portrait feature, users can choose the perfect photo of themselves and animate it with a standard webcam. Live Portrait syncs a person\u2019s head movement and facial expressions to the user\u2019s chosen photo. Users can also choose 2D stylized character representations of themselves.\nLive Portrait is now available as a production feature in Maxine and can use high-resolution model outputs of up to 1024\u00d71024 resolution.\nFinding Your Voice\nA person\u2019s voice can convey emotion and communicative nuances. NVIDIA Maxine\u2019s new Voice Font feature, available in early access, enables users to generate a unique voice for themselves \u2014 almost like a digital avatar for voice.\nThe feature can convert audio samples into a digital voice with just 30 seconds of reference audio.\nVoice Font can be helpful for people who have speech impediments, or who want to fine-tune the sound of their own voice. Voice Font is available for evaluation and testing in the early access release of Maxine.\nSeeing Eye-to-Eye\nNVIDIA Maxine\u2019s Eye Contact feature uses AI and a webcam feed to direct the user\u2019s gaze toward the camera in real time. Similarly, it can repose eyes in offline video to create more engaging and impactful videos.\nStudies have shown that maintaining eye contact during conversations encourages personal connection, understanding and engagement. Maxine Eye Contact enhances communication by ensuring that the user is always looking at their audience, whether in a video conference or via prerecorded video.\nThe new version of Maxine Eye Contact preserves naturally occurring micro-eye movement and has the added ability to \u201clook away\u201d periodically, creating a more realistic experience on video conferences. The frequency and duration of the \u201clook away\u201d function is also adjustable.\nThe latest version of Eye Contact also brings quality improvements, including increased gaze stability, more robust occlusion handling and much lower latency when used with NVIDIA Ada Generation GPUs. \u00a0\nThe Best of the Rest\nThe newest Maxine release also delivers new and updated real-time features across augmented reality, audio effects and video effects to advance video conferencing and editing capabilities. These include:\n\n3D Body Pose, for pose estimation when only the upper body is in camera view, introducing a new dimension to virtual interactions\nSupport for NVIDIA L4 Tensor Core and L40 GPUs, powered by the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture, bringing up to 1.75x performance increases compared to GPUs from previous families\nNVIDIA Triton Inference Server support for AI Green Screen, Eye Contact, Landmark Detection and Face Detection, enabling higher throughput for both single- and multiple-GPU workflows\nAudio super resolution performance improvements\n\nEye Contact performance improvements using NVIDIA Triton (throughput gain based on concurrent streams).\nAI Green Screen performance improvements using NVIDIA Triton (throughput gain based on concurrent streams).\nPartnering for Success\nMany NVIDIA partners and customers, such as Quicklink and CoPilot AI, are already experiencing high-quality video conferencing and editing with Maxine.\nQuicklink is a leading global provider of remote production solutions to the media, broadcast, production and sport industries. The company\u2019s Cre8 video production tool allows users to deliver professional virtual, in-person and hybrid events.\n\u201cOur partnership with NVIDIA has been driven by broadcast industry challenges, beginning with remote guest contribution,\u201d said Richard Rees, CEO of Quicklink. \u201cOur integration of NVIDIA Maxine into Quicklink Cre8 resolves these challenges with the addition of Maxine\u2019s Auto Framing, Video Noise Removal, Noise and Echo Cancellation, and Eye Contact features. These features have had an incredible reception across the industry.\u201d\nImage courtesy of Quicklink\nCoPilot AI, a Vancouver-based software-as-a-service startup operating in the cross-section between AI and sales enablement, incorporates Maxine to provide dependable solutions for content creators.\n\u201cUsing NVIDIA Maxine microservices, we empower users to record on the whim and stand out in the crowd,\u201d said Jackson Chao, cofounder of CoPilot AI Video. \u201cMaxine\u2019s Eye Contact feature allows users to record a script without compromising the connection with viewers. Even novice content creators are able to adopt video outreach with confidence and humanize the way they engage with their contacts.\u201d\nMaxine offers a collection of AI effects that enhance real-time audio and video and can be incorporated into existing customer infrastructures. And the solution can be deployed in the cloud, on premises or at the edge, enabling quality communication from nearly anywhere.\nAvailability\nFrom enhancing day-to-day video conferencing needs to integrating AI technology, NVIDIA Maxine offers high-quality video communications for all professionals.\nThe latest Maxine production release is included exclusively with NVIDIA AI Enterprise 4.1, allowing users to tap into production-ready features such as Triton Inference Server, enterprise support and more.\nFor customers requiring access to NVIDIA Maxine\u2019s limited early access program, fill in the relevant online application on the Maxine Microservices Early Access Program or Maxine SDK Early Access Program pages.\nTo help improve features in upcoming releases, participants can provide feedback by contributing to the NVIDIA Maxine and NVIDIA Broadcast App survey.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA Maxine | Video Streaming \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The amount of data is simply too large to screen manually.\nGenerative AI, the most transformative tool of our time, enables a kind of digital jiu jitsu. It lets companies shift the force of data that threatens to overwhelm them into a force that makes their defenses stronger.\nBusiness leaders seem ready for the opportunity at hand. In a recent survey, CEOs said cybersecurity is one of their top three concerns, and they see generative AI as a lead technology that will deliver competitive advantages.\nGenerative AI brings both risks and benefits. An earlier blog outlined six steps to start the process of securing enterprise AI.\nHere are three ways generative AI can bolster cybersecurity.\nBegin With Developers\nFirst, give developers a security copilot.\nEveryone plays a role in security, but not everyone is a security expert. So, this is one of the most strategic places to begin.\nThe best place to start bolstering security is on the front end, where developers are writing software. An AI-powered assistant, trained as a security expert, can help them ensure their code follows best practices in security.\nThe AI software assistant can get smarter every day if it\u2019s fed previously reviewed code. It can learn from prior work to help guide developers on best practices.\nTo give users a leg up, NVIDIA is creating a workflow for building such co-pilots or chatbots. This particular workflow uses components from NVIDIA NeMo, a framework for building and customizing large language models.\nWhether users customize their own models or use a commercial service, a security assistant is just the first step in applying generative AI to cybersecurity.\nAn Agent to Analyze Vulnerabilities\nSecond, let generative AI help navigate the sea of known software vulnerabilities.\nAt any moment, companies must choose among thousands of patches to mitigate known exploits. That\u2019s because every piece of code can have roots in dozens if not thousands of different software branches and open-source projects.\nAn LLM focused on vulnerability analysis can help prioritize which patches a company should implement first. It\u2019s a particularly powerful security assistant because it reads all the software libraries a company uses as well as its policies on the features and APIs it supports.\nTo test this concept, NVIDIA built a pipeline to analyze software containers for vulnerabilities. The agent identified areas that needed patching with high accuracy, speeding the work of human analysts up to 4x.\nThe takeaway is clear. It\u2019s time to enlist generative AI as a first responder in vulnerability analysis.\nFill the Data Gap\nFinally, use LLMs to help fill the growing data gap in cybersecurity.\nUsers rarely share information about data breaches because they\u2019re so sensitive. That makes it difficult to anticipate exploits.\nEnter LLMs. Generative AI models can create synthetic data to simulate never-before-seen attack patterns. Such synthetic data can also fill gaps in training data so machine-learning systems learn how to defend against exploits before they happen.\nStaging Safe Simulations\nDon\u2019t wait for attackers to demonstrate what\u2019s possible. Create safe simulations to learn how they might try to penetrate corporate defenses.\nThis kind of proactive defense is the hallmark of a strong security program. Adversaries are already using generative AI in their attacks. It\u2019s time users harness this powerful technology for cybersecurity defense.\nTo show what\u2019s possible, another AI workflow uses generative AI to defend against spear phishing \u2014 the carefully targeted bogus emails that cost companies an estimated $2.4 billion in 2021 alone.\nThis workflow generated synthetic emails to make sure it had plenty of good examples of spear phishing messages. The AI model trained on that data learned to understand the intent of incoming emails through natural language processing capabilities in NVIDIA Morpheus, a framework for AI-powered cybersecurity.\nThe resulting model caught 21% more spear phishing emails than existing tools. Check out our developer blog or watch the video below to learn more.\n\nWherever users choose to start this work, automation is crucial, given the shortage of cybersecurity experts and the thousands upon thousands of users and use cases that companies need to protect.\nThese three tools \u2014 software assistants, virtual vulnerability analysts and synthetic data simulations \u2014 are great starting points for applying generative AI to a security journey that continues every day.\nBut this is just the beginning. Companies need to integrate generative AI into all layers of their defenses.\nAttend a webinar for more details on how to get started.\nExplore generative AI sessions and experiences at NVIDIA GTC, the global conference on AI and accelerated computing, running March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., and online.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Cybersecurity | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA NeMo \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Isaac Sim, an extensible simulator for AI-enabled robots, is built on the NVIDIA Omniverse development platform for building and connecting OpenUSD applications.\nCombining powerful AI compute with graphics and media acceleration, the L40S GPU is built to power the next generation of data center workloads. Based on the Ada Lovelace architecture, the L40S enables ultrafast real-time rendering delivering up to a 3.8x performance leap for Omniverse compared with the previous generation, boosting engineering and robotics teams.\nThe generational leap in acceleration results in 2x faster performance than the A40 GPU across a broad set of robotic simulations tasks when using Isaac Sim.\nL40S GPUs can also be harnessed for generative AI workloads, from fine-tuning large language models within a matter of hours, to real-time inferencing for text-to-image and chat applications.\nNew Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) on the NVIDIA L40S in AWS Marketplace will enable roboticists to easily access preconfigured virtual machines to operate Isaac Sim workloads.\nRobotics development in simulation is speeding the process of deploying applications, turbocharging industries such as retail, food processing, manufacturing, logistics and more.\nRevenue from mobile robots in warehouses worldwide is expected to explode, more than tripling from $11.6 billion in 2023 to $42.2 billion by 2030, according to ABI Research.\nRobotics systems have played an important role across fulfillment centers to help meet the demands of online shoppers and provide a better workplace for employees. Amazon Robotics has deployed more than 750,000 robots in its warehouses around the world to improve the experience for employees supporting package fulfillment and its customers.\n\u201cSimulation technology plays a critical role in how we develop, test and deploy our robots.\u201d said Brian Basile, head of virtual systems at Amazon Robotics. \u201cAt Amazon Robotics we continue to increase the scale and complexity of our simulations. With the new AWS L40S offering we will push the boundaries of simulation, rendering and model training even further.\u201d\nAccelerated Robotics Development With Isaac Sim\nRobotics systems can demand large datasets for precision operation in deployed applications. Gathering these datasets and testing them in the real world is time-consuming, costly and impractical.\nRobotics simulation drives the training and testing of AI-based robotic applications. With synthetic data, simulations are enabling virtual advances like never before. Simulations can help verify, validate and optimize robot designs, systems and their algorithms before operation. It can also be used to optimize facility designs before construction or remodeling starts for maximum efficiencies, reducing costly manufacturing change orders.\nIsaac Sim offers access to the latest robotics simulation tools and capabilities as well as cloud access, enabling teams to collaborate more effectively. Access to the Omniverse Replicator synthetic data generation engine in Isaac Sim allows machine learning engineers to build production-ready synthetic datasets for training robust deep learning perception models.\nCustomer Adoption of Isaac Sim on AWS\nAWS early adopters tapping into the Isaac Sim platform include Amazon Robotics, Soft Robotics and Theory Studios.\nAmazon Robotics has begun using Omniverse to build digital twins for automating, optimizing and planning its autonomous warehouses in virtual environments before deploying them into the real world.\nUsing Isaac Sim for sensor emulation, Amazon Robotics will accelerate development of its Proteus autonomous mobile robot, improving it to help the online retail giant efficiently manage fulfillment.\nLearn more about Isaac Sim, powered by NVIDIA Omniverse.\n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | RoboticsTags: GPU | NVIDIA Isaac Sim | Omniverse | Synthetic Data Generation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Companies need to apply for a license for chips with performance densities between 3.2 and 5.92.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the restrictions ban the use of Nvidia GPUs, such as the H100 SXM, L40 S, L40, and the A100 SXM, the newly planned GPUs\u2019 total performance (TPP) and performance density don\u2019t breach the set limits, a separate report by Semianalysis showed.\nThe report puts the total performance and performance density of a 96GB H20 SXM GPU at 2,368 TPP and 2.9 respectively.\nSemianalysis also tested Nvidia\u2019s 46 GB L20 GPU and reported that the chip performed at 1912 TPP and had a performance density of 3.1.\n\nSeparately, analysis of Nvidia\u2019s 24 GB L2 GPU revealed a TPP of 1544 and a performance density of 5.2, well within the threshold of 5.92.\nOther chips, such as Intel\u2019s Gaudi 2 and AMD\u2019s MI250X along with MI300X, also cannot be sold in China as per Semianalysis\u2019 report, which only puts AMD\u2019s MI250 in the clear in terms of total performance capacity and performance density.\nAn email sent to Nvidia to confirm the new GPUs and their purpose went unanswered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new US restrictions builds on the older restrictions introduced last year that put limitations on aggregate bidirectional transfer rate of 600 GB/s and aggregate chip performance capacity of 4800TPP.\nCircumventing US export controls\nThe previous restrictions, according to analysts from Semianalysis, were easy to circumvent as chipmakers could lower the aggregate bandwidth while maintaining near-identical performance in AI applications.\n\u201cThis is what Nvidia did with the H800 and A800 modifications of their H100 and A100, which have shipped hundreds of thousands of units to China,\u201d analysts wrote in a report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChinese companies, however, continue to access the restricted chips through the market in Hong Kong and Mainland China.\nA recent Reuters investigative report highlighted how high-end Nvidia GPUs such as the A100 can still be procured in China, albeit at a higher price. \u00a0\u00a0\nThe cost per GPU, according to the vendors cited in the report, for the A100 GPU has nearly doubled to about $19,000 without warranty or support in China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

These searches serve as a gateway to new discoveries, cherished experiences, and lasting memories. The search bar is not just about finding a song; it\u2019s about the millions of active users starting their personal journey into the rich and diverse world that Amazon Music has to offer.\nDelivering a superior customer experience to instantly find the music that users search for requires a platform that is both smart and responsive. Amazon Music uses the power of AI to accomplish this. However, optimizing the customer experience while managing cost of training and inference of AI models that power the search bar\u2019s capabilities, like real-time spellcheck and vector search, is difficult during peak traffic times.\nAmazon SageMaker provides an end-to-end set of services that allow Amazon Music to build, train, and deploy on the AWS Cloud with minimal effort. By taking care of the undifferentiated heavy lifting, SageMaker allows you to focus on working on your machine learning (ML) models, and not worry about things such as infrastructure. As part of the shared responsibility model, SageMaker makes sure that the services they provide are reliable, performant, and scalable, while you make sure the application of the ML models makes the best use of the capabilities that SageMaker provides.\nIn this post, we walk through the journey Amazon Music took to optimize performance and cost using SageMaker and NVIDIA Triton Inference Server and TensorRT. We dive deep into showing how that seemingly simple, yet intricate, search bar works, ensuring an unbroken journey into the universe of Amazon Music with little-to-zero frustrating typo delays and relevant real-time search results.\nAmazon SageMaker and NVIDIA: Delivering fast and accurate vector search and spellcheck capabilities\nAmazon Music offers a vast library of over 100 million songs and millions of podcast episodes. However, finding the right song or podcast can be challenging, especially if you don\u2019t know the exact title, artist, or album name, or the searched query is very broad, such as \u201cnews podcasts.\u201d\nAmazon Music has taken a two-pronged approach to improve the search and retrieval process. The first step is to introduce vector search (also known as embedding-based retrieval), an ML technique that can help users find the most relevant content they\u2019re looking for by using semantics of the content. The second step involves introducing a Transformer-based Spell Correction model in the search stack. This can be especially helpful when searching for music, because users may not always know the exact spelling of a song title or artist name. Spell correction can help users find the music they\u2019re looking for even if they make a spelling mistake in their search query.\nIntroducing Transformer models in a search and retrieval pipeline (in query embedding generation needed for vector search and the generative Seq2Seq Transformer model in Spell Correction) may lead to significant increase in overall latency, affecting customer experience negatively. Therefore, it became a top priority for us to optimize the real-time inference latency for vector search and spell correction models.\nAmazon Music and NVIDIA have come together to bring the best possible customer experience to the search bar, using SageMaker to implement both fast and accurate spellcheck capabilities and real-time semantic search suggestions using vector search-based techniques. The solution includes using SageMaker hosting powered by G5 instances that uses NVIDIA A10G Tensor Core GPUs, SageMaker-supported NVIDIA Triton Inference Server Container, and the NVIDIA TensorRT model format. By reducing the inference latency of the spellcheck model to 25 milliseconds at peak traffic, and reducing search query embedding generation latency by 63% on average and cost by 73% compared to CPU based inference, Amazon Music has elevated the search bar\u2019s performance.\nAdditionally, when training the AI model to deliver accurate results, Amazon Music achieved a whopping 12 fold acceleration in training time for their BART sequence-to-sequence spell corrector transformer model, saving them both time and money, by optimizing their GPU utilization.\nAmazon Music partnered with NVIDIA to prioritize the customer search experience and craft a search bar with well-optimized spellcheck and vector search functionalities. In the following sections, we share more about how these optimizations were orchestrated.\nOptimizing training with NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs\nGaining access to an NVIDIA Tensor Core GPU for large language model training is not enough to capture its true potential. There are key optimization steps that must happen during training in order to fully maximize the GPU\u2019s utilization. However, an underutilized GPU will undoubtedly lead to inefficient use of resources, prolonged training durations, and increased operational costs.\nDuring the initial phases of training the spell corrector BART (bart-base) transformer model on a SageMaker ml.p3.24xlarge instance (8 NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs), Amazon Music\u2019s GPU utilization was around 35%. To maximize the benefits of NVIDIA GPU-accelerated training, AWS and NVIDIA solution architects supported Amazon Music in identifying areas for optimizations, particularly around the batch size and precision parameters. These two crucial parameters influence the efficiency, speed, and accuracy of training deep learning models.\nThe resulting optimizations yielded a new and improved V100 GPU utilization, steady at around 89%, drastically reducing Amazon Music\u2019s training time from 3 days to 5\u20136 hours. By switching the batch size from 32 to 256 and using optimization techniques like running automatic mixed precision training instead of only using FP32 precision, Amazon Music was able to save both time and money.\nThe following chart illustrates the 54% percentage point increase in GPU utilization after optimizations.\n\nThe following figure illustrates the acceleration in training time.\n\nThis increase in batch size enabled the NVIDIA GPU to process significantly more data concurrently across multiple Tensor Cores, resulting in accelerated training time. However, it\u2019s important to maintain a delicate balance with memory, because larger batch sizes demand more memory. Both increasing batch size and employing mixed precision can be critical in unlocking the power of NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs.\nAfter the model was trained to convergence, it was time to optimize for inference deployment on Amazon Music\u2019s search bar.\nSpell Correction: BART model inferencing\nWith the help of SageMaker G5 instances and NVIDIA Triton Inference Server (an open source inference serving software), as well as NVIDIA TensorRT, an SDK for high-performance deep learning inference that includes an inference optimizer and runtime, Amazon Music limits their spellcheck BART (bart-base) model server inference latency to just 25 milliseconds at peak traffic. This includes overheads like load balancing, preprocessing, model inferencing, and postprocessing times.\nNVIDIA Triton Inference Server provides two different kind backends: one for hosting models on GPU, and a Python backend where you can bring your own custom code to be used in preprocessing and postprocessing steps. The following figure illustrates the model ensemble scheme.\n\nAmazon Music built its BART inference pipeline by running both preprocessing (text tokenization) and postprocessing (tokens to text) steps on CPUs, whereas the model execution step runs on NVIDIA A10G Tensor Core GPUs. A Python backend sits in the middle of the preprocessing and postprocessing steps, and is responsible for communicating with the TensorRT-converted BART models as well as the encoder/decoder networks. TensorRT boosts inference performance with precision calibration, layer and tensor fusion, kernel auto-tuning, dynamic tensor memory, multi-stream execution, and time fusion.\nThe following figure illustrates the high-level design of the key modules that make up the spell corrector BART model inferencing pipeline.\n\nVector search: Query embedding generation sentence BERT model inferencing\nThe following chart illustrates the 60% improvement in latency (serving p90 800\u2013900 TPS) when using the NVIDIA AI Inference Platform compared to a CPU-based baseline.\n\nThe following chart shows a 70% improvement in cost when using the NVIDIA AI Inference Platform compared to a CPU-based baseline.\n\nThe following figure illustrates an SDK for high-performance deep learning inference. It includes a deep learning inference optimizer and runtime that delivers low latency and high throughput for inference applications.\n\nTo achieve these results, Amazon Music experimented with several different Triton deployment parameters using Triton Model Analyzer, a tool that helps find the best NVIDIA Triton model configuration to deploy efficient inference. To optimize model inference, Triton offers features like dynamic batching and concurrent model execution, and has framework support for other flexibility capabilities. The dynamic batching gathers inference requests, seamlessly grouping them together into cohorts in order to maximize throughput, all while ensuring real-time responses for Amazon Music users. The concurrent model execution capability further enhances inference performance by hosting multiple copies of the model on the same GPU. Finally, by utilizing Triton Model Analyzer, Amazon Music was able to carefully fine-tune the dynamic batching and model concurrency inference hosting parameters to find optimal settings that maximize inference performance using simulated traffic.\nConclusion\nOptimizing configurations with Triton Inference Server and TensorRT on SageMaker allowed Amazon Music to achieve outstanding results for both training and inference pipelines. The SageMaker platform is the end-to-end open platform for production AI, providing quick time to value and the versatility to support all major AI use cases across both hardware and software. By optimizing V100 GPU utilization for training and switching from CPUs to G5 instances using NVIDIA A10G Tensor Core GPUs, as well as by using optimized NVIDIA software like Triton Inference Server and TensorRT, companies like Amazon Music can save time and money while boosting performance in both training and inference, directly translating to a better customer experience and lower operating costs.\nSageMaker handles the undifferentiated heavy lifting for ML training and hosting, allowing Amazon Music to deliver reliable, scalable ML operations across both hardware and software.\nWe encourage you to check that your workloads are optimized using SageMaker by always evaluating your hardware and software choices to see if there are ways you can achieve better performance with decreased costs.\nTo learn more about NVIDIA AI in AWS, refer to the following:\n\nHow Amazon Search achieves low-latency, high-throughput T5 inference with NVIDIA Triton on AWS\nDeploy fast and scalable AI with NVIDIA Triton Inference Server in Amazon SageMaker\nAchieve hyper-scale performance for model serving using NVIDIA Triton Inference Server on Amazon SageMaker\nNVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs Now Available on AWS Cloud\n\n\n\nAbout the authors\nSiddharth Sharma\u00a0is a Machine Learning Tech Lead at Science & Modeling team at Amazon Music.

Robots are expected to play a crucial role in assisting workforces in multiple uses and settings, including factories, healthcare, retail and more.\nBy 2030, 80% of humans will engage with smart robots on a daily basis, due to advancements in intelligence, social interactions and human augmentation capabilities, up from less than 10% today,\u00a0according to research firm Gartner. This engagement will be seen across industries worldwide.\nSee the future of industrial robotics inside the exhibit halls of the International Robot Exhibition (iREX), taking place Nov. 29-Dec. 2, in Tokyo.\nDuring the show, NVIDIA and more than a dozen of its partners will feature the myriad ways they are delivering the hardware and AI simulation technology needed to rapidly accelerate the deployment of the latest robotics technology. This includes NVIDIA Jetson modules for edge AI and robotics.\nNotable examples that iREX attendees should be sure to check out include:\nFactory and Warehouse Usage\nFoodly, the collaborative robot from RT Corporation, is used in the production of processed foods and ready-made meals in factories. It\u2019s built using the NVIDIA Jetson platform to recognize food that it will then pick up and pack into a box to automate simple tasks. Bring your appetite to booth E2-36 to see the humanoid robots in action.\nThe Okamura robot vehicle (ORV), based on Jetson AGX Orin, is an autonomous mobile robot (AMR) that can transport roll-box pallets in distribution warehouses. Since ORV generates its own route and runs without human guidance, it can be introduced without major floor construction work, improving productivity and saving labor. See them in booth E6-04.\nTechman Robot will be featuring a digital twin of a palletize/de-palletize robot in action, built with the NVIDIA Omniverse software platform for connecting and developing OpenUSD-based 3D tools and applications. The robots will be in booth E5-19.\nOMRON will showcase Sysmac Studio, an integrated development environment for industrial automation and robotics, which uses Omniverse to create photorealistic digital twins. Omron will be at booth E6-17.\nNext-Generation Cobots\nKyocera Corporation will highlight an intelligent service for cooperative robots that launched in November. Continuously connected to the cloud, these robots, powered by NVIDIA GPUs and offered via a subscription model, can be operated without technicians. In addition, Kyocera will be showing technology it plans to deploy in the next one or two years. Look for them in booth E7-63.\nDenso Wave will exhibit a 3D-image-recognition picking system powered by the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano. The company\u2019s latest application is a system that enables 3D recognition with only one 2D camera in a flexible configuration using the Jetson Orin Nano. The booth is located at East E3-11.\nRobots for Outdoor and Agricultural Use\nCuboRex has an outdoor transport robot built with the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX to deploy AI models. They\u2019ll be at booth E7-90.\nLegmin will highlight an agriculture-focused robot that sprays pesticides on spring onions using vision AI accelerated by the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin. They will be at booth W4-19L.\nACSL will exhibit SOTEN, an industrial drone with a built-in guidance navigation system accelerated by Jetson Xavier NX for autonomous navigation in a GPS-denied environment. Watch them fly in booth W4-19E.\nYaskawa Electric uses NVIDIA technology to promote AI-enabled robotics. They\u2019ll be at booth E5-15.\nOther companies that you don\u2019t want to miss during iREX include:\n\nugo at booth E7-46\nMech-Mind at booth E3-40\nNeubility at booth W4-04\nLIPS at booth E4-10\nVecow at booth E4-10\n\nSee New Developments at the NVIDIA Booth\nNVIDIA will be in booth E7-13at iREX, where it will highlight the use of digital twins, AMRs and the NVIDIA Jetson line of modules and developer kits.\nAlongside NVIDIA, Techman Robot will demonstrate digital twins with a TM AI Cobot using NVIDIA Isaac Sim to virtually model the robot\u2019s behavior and environment for bin picking. In addition, AI trained from synthetic data is used for object recognition by the 3D vision system embedded in the robot.\nNVIDIA will show Nova Carter, a reference design robot based on the NVIDIA Isaac Nova Orin architecture, for the first time in Japan. To optimize operational efficiency and accelerate AMR development and deployment, NVIDIA offers the NVIDIA Isaac AMR open platform. The platform is modular and includes Isaac Sim for warehouse simulation and Isaac Nova Orin.\nIsaac Nova Orin is a state-of-the-art computing and sensor reference architecture that accelerates the development of AMR. With the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin and a suite of sensors required for next-generation AMR, it can be used as a lidar as well as a peripheral vision-based recognition offering. It also enables vision-based recognition of the surrounding environment.\nThe NVIDIA Jetson family delivers the performance and power efficiency needed to build autonomous machines at the edge. With AI performance of up to 275 TOPS, NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin modules can run multiple AI inference pipelines simultaneously and support high-speed interfaces to multiple sensors. From the entry-level Jetson Orin Nano series modules to the highest-performance Jetson AGX Orin series, it is ideal for the new era of robotics.\nAttendees at iREX can be among the first to experience human-robotic engagement up close and witness futuristic advancements today.\nTo keep up with the latest robotics news, subscribe to the NVIDIA newsletter.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: Events | NVIDIA Isaac Sim | Omniverse | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And NVIDIA RTX technology is making it even easier for developers to create AI applications to change the way people use computers.\nNew optimizations, models and resources announced at Microsoft Ignite will help developers deliver new end-user experiences, quicker.\nAn upcoming update to TensorRT-LLM \u2014 open-source software that increases AI inference performance \u2014 will add support for new large language models and make demanding AI workloads more accessible on desktops and laptops with RTX GPUs starting at 8GB of VRAM.\nTensorRT-LLM for Windows will soon be compatible with OpenAI\u2019s popular Chat API through a new wrapper. This will enable hundreds of developer projects and applications to run locally on a PC with RTX, instead of in the cloud \u2014 so users can keep private and proprietary data on Windows 11 PCs.\nCustom generative AI requires time and energy to maintain projects. The process can become incredibly complex and time-consuming, especially when trying to collaborate and deploy across multiple environments and platforms.\nAI Workbench is a unified, easy-to-use toolkit that allows developers to quickly create, test and customize pretrained generative AI models and LLMs on a PC or workstation. It provides developers a single platform to organize their AI projects and tune models to specific use cases.\nThis enables seamless collaboration and deployment for developers to create cost-effective, scalable generative AI models quickly. Join the early access list to be among the first to gain access to this growing initiative and to receive future updates.\nTo support AI developers, NVIDIA and Microsoft will release DirectML enhancements to accelerate one of the most popular foundational AI models, Llama 2. Developers now have more options for cross-vendor deployment, in addition to setting a new standard for performance.\nPortable AI\nLast month, NVIDIA announced TensorRT-LLM for Windows, a library for accelerating LLM inference.\nThe next TensorRT-LLM release, v0.6.0 coming later this month, will bring improved inference performance \u2014 up to 5x faster \u2014 and enable support for additional popular LLMs, including the new Mistral 7B and Nemotron-3 8B. Versions of these LLMs will run on any GeForce RTX 30 Series and 40 Series GPU with 8GB of RAM or more, making fast, accurate, local LLM capabilities accessible even in some of the most portable Windows devices.\nUp to 5X performance with the new TensorRT-LLM v0.6.0.\nThe new release of TensorRT-LLM will be available for install on the /NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM GitHub repo. New optimized models will be available on ngc.nvidia.com.\nConversing With Confidence\u00a0\nDevelopers and enthusiasts worldwide use OpenAI\u2019s Chat API for a wide range of applications \u2014 from summarizing web content and drafting documents and emails to analyzing and visualizing data and creating presentations.\nOne challenge with such cloud-based AIs is that they require users to upload their input data, making them impractical for private or proprietary data or for working with large datasets.\nTo address this challenge, NVIDIA is soon enabling TensorRT-LLM for Windows to offer a similar API interface to OpenAI\u2019s widely popular ChatAPI, through a new wrapper, offering a similar workflow to developers whether they are designing models and applications to run locally on a PC with RTX or in the cloud. By changing just one or two lines of code, hundreds of AI-powered developer projects and applications can now benefit from fast, local AI. Users can keep their data on their PCs and not worry about uploading datasets to the cloud.\n\nPerhaps the best part is that many of these projects and applications are open source, making it easy for developers to leverage and extend their capabilities to fuel the adoption of generative AI on Windows, powered by RTX.\nThe wrapper will work with any LLM that\u2019s been optimized for TensorRT-LLM (for example, Llama 2, Mistral and Nemotron-3 8B) and is being released as a reference project on GitHub, alongside other developer resources for working with LLMs on RTX.\nModel Acceleration\nDevelopers can now leverage cutting-edge AI models and deploy with a cross-vendor API. As part of an ongoing commitment to empower developers, NVIDIA and Microsoft have been working together to accelerate Llama on RTX via the DirectML API.\nBuilding on the announcements for the fastest inference performance for these models announced last month, this new option for cross-vendor deployment makes it easier than ever to bring AI capabilities to PC.\nDevelopers and enthusiasts can experience the latest optimizations by downloading the latest ONNX runtime and following the installation instructions from Microsoft, and installing the latest driver from NVIDIA, which will be available on Nov. 21.\nThese new optimizations, models and resources will accelerate the development and deployment of AI features and applications to the 100 million RTX PCs worldwide, joining the more than 400 AI-powered apps and games already accelerated by RTX GPUs.\nAs models become even more accessible and developers bring more generative AI-powered functionality to RTX-powered Windows PCs, RTX GPUs will be critical for enabling users to take advantage of this powerful technology.\nExplore generative AI sessions and experiences at NVIDIA GTC, the global conference on AI and accelerated computing, running March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., and online.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | GeForce | NVIDIA AI Workbench | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA RTX | TensorRT \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Get the ultimate Cyberpunk experience with full ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction, and NVIDIA Reflex, powered by GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs and laptops. \u00a0\nBecome an urban outlaw equipped with cybernetic enhancements and build your legend on the streets of Night City. Go on daring adventures and build relationships with unforgettable characters whose fates are shaped by the choices you make, and decide how V's story ends. Your choices in the base game and Phantom Liberty create interweaving webs of consequences, ones that shape the fate of the characters around you \u2014 and your own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition is the complete package, including every update, add-on and in-game item CD PROJEKT RED has released. For PC gamers with GeForce RTX graphics cards, you can experience all of Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition\u2019s content with the incredible technical and graphical enhancements NVIDIA and CD PROJEKT RED have partnered on pre and post release.\nWitness the most advanced graphics in gaming when you activate the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, which replaces Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s lighting with fully ray-traced (path-traced) rendering. Light, shadows and reflections are breathtakingly accurate, realistic and immersive. Night City\u2019s neon dazzles, and cinematic moments take a massive leap forward with revelatory image quality throughout.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake fully ray-traced visuals to the next level with DLSS 3.5\u2019s Ray Reconstruction, a new AI model that enhances ray-traced images for intensive ray-traced games and apps for higher fidelity, immersion and lighting responsiveness.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccelerate performance with DLSS Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Ray Reconstruction, and marvel at frame rates that are up to 5X faster with the click of a button:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS, Ray Reconstruction and full ray tracing make Cyberpunk 2077 look and play even better. NVIDIA Reflex helps you be a better badass by reducing system latency. Sometimes referred to as \u201csystem lag\u201d, system latency is the time it takes for an action to occur in-game, and can also affect how fast you see enemies, giving you additional time to shoot first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex greatly reduces system latency, making gameplay more responsive, improving the feel of gameplay, and the snappiness of your actions. Available in over 90 games, Reflex is used by over 50 million users each month, and with there being no downsides to its use, it\u2019s a must-have for gamers wanting the most responsive experience possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of these enhancements along with engine optimizations, under the hood tech features, and our tuned Game Ready Drivers deliver the definitive Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition PC experience, with class leading performance, unmatched image quality, and jaw-dropping fully ray-traced gameplay that can only be experienced at performant frame rates with max settings on GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards.\nIf your life lacks a powerful GeForce RTX PC or laptop, don\u2019t despair! You can still enjoy and experience Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition by streaming it from the cloud with the same technologies as GeForce RTX 40-Series owners, including DLSS 3.5, Ray Reconstruction, and Reflex, thanks to NVIDIA GeForce NOW Ultimate. Members can play over 1,700 full PC versions of games they already own from Steam, Epic Games Store, Xbox, Ubisoft Connect, and GOG.com. Head over to the GeForce NOW website to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoti: Byteland Overclocked Available Now With DLSS 2\nEach week, new games launch with or add support for NVIDIA DLSS.

The wish from Lofranco, who has Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, was the fifth NVIDIA has been a part of in the last decade.\nThe NVIDIA team kept the day\u2019s agenda a secret \u2014 surprising Lofranco with tours of the demo room and robotics lab, a chat with the University Recruiting team, a ride in a self-driving car and a video call with NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang. An aspiring computer science major, Lofranco was stoked for it all because, as his mom Cassandra shared, \u201cNVIDIA is his Disneyland.\u201d\nNVIDIA\u2019s auto garage\nA Long-Time NVIDIA Fan\u00a0\nAfter attending his first computer science summer camp when he was eight, Lofranco learned 3D modeling in Autodesk Maya, programming in Python, as well as 3D printing. His budding interest in tech grew and, soon enough, he was building his own gaming rigs.\nNVIDIA quickly became Lofranco\u2019s favorite tech company, he said, so much so that he carved the company logo out of a piece of wood using a computer numerical control machine.\nFor gaming, he enjoys using NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 and GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPUs. But Lofranco\u2019s ultimate draw to NVIDIA wasn\u2019t its products but its culture.\n\u201cEveryone is driven to see the same outcome and comes together to make it happen,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything is designed for collaboration.\u201d\nLofranco in NVIDIA gear\nA VIP Experience\nAhead of Lofranco\u2019s visit, the NVIDIA team sent him a box of swag \u2014 including a hoodie, a hat and a custom NVIDIA badge.\nOnce he arrived on campus, NVIDIA volunteers welcomed and whisked Lofranco off on a campus tour, followed by a meeting with the solutions architect team, which includes NVIDIANs focused on healthcare, auto, AI, cloud service providers and large language models.\n\nNext, a visit to the robotics lab helped satisfy Lofranco\u2019s \u201cmaker\u201d curiosity. He saw an NVIDIA DGX Station as well as test robots for developing the NVIDIA Jetson edge AI platform, and was soon directing a robot arm to stack colored blocks.\nAfter learning that Lofranco\u2019s favorite foods include lobster, tiramisu and Kit Kat candy bars, the caf\u00e9 team prepared a special menu for him and all employees in the office that day. Everyone enjoyed a lobster roll pop-up station in the campus park and tiramisu-flavored ice cream with assorted toppings, including Kit Kat pieces.\nLofranco checks out NVIDIA GPUs in the company\u2019s demo room\nInnovators\nOn a visit to the demo room at NVIDIA\u2019s Santa Clara site, Lofranco and his father revealed that they tinker with innovations themselves. They programmed their water heater in the family hot tub to maintain a comfortable temperature and decrease the time needed to warm it \u2014 all thanks to Python code and Raspberry Pi experimentation.\nWith so much to soak in, Lofranco described his wish day at NVIDIA as \u201cunfathomable\u201d \u2014 and that was before his video call with Huang, which stretched from a planned quarter hour to 45 minutes.\nAfter a conversation that spanned NVIDIA\u2019s origins, many near failures and innovation, Huang gifted Lofranco a GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition GPU and shared some sound advice: \u201cKeep playing video games \u2014 but make sure to prioritize your homework.\u201d\nLofranco with the surprise gift from Huang following their chat\nCapping a packed day of fun-filled support from nearly 50 NVIDIANs was a visit to the auto lab and a spin in one of NVIDIA\u2019s self-driving test cars.\nHow was it all? \u201cBreathtaking,\u201d said Lofranco, who learned firsthand from Huang that while NVIDIA has evolved from being the underdog to a leading tech company, it still feels \u201clike a family.\u201d\nLearn more about NVIDIA life, culture and careers.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: NVIDIA Life \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This one-stop shop enables automakers worldwide to unify digitalization across their core product and business processes. It allows enterprises to achieve faster production and more efficient operations, improving time to market and enhancing sustainability initiatives.\nFor design, engineering and manufacturing teams, digitalization streamlines their work, converting once primarily manual industrial processes into efficient systems for concept and styling; AV development, testing and validation; and factory planning.\nVirtual Factory Simulation Engine\nThe Omniverse Cloud virtual factory simulation engine is a collection of customizable developer applications and services that enable factory planning teams to connect large-scale industrial datasets while collaborating, navigating and reviewing them in real time.\nDesign teams working with 3D data can assemble virtual factories and share their work with thousands of planners who can view, annotate and update the full-fidelity factory dataset from lightweight devices. By simulating virtual factories on Omniverse Cloud, automakers can increase throughput and production quality while saving years of effort and millions of dollars that would result from making changes once construction is underway.\nOn Omniverse Cloud, teams can create interoperability between existing software applications such as Autodesk Factory Planning, which supports the entire lifecycle for building, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing and factory lines, as well as Siemens\u2019 NX, Process Simulate and Teamcenter Visualization software and the JT file format. They can share knowledge and data in real time in live, virtual factory reviews across 2D devices or in extended reality.\nT-Systems, a leading IT solutions provider for Europe\u2019s largest automotive manufacturers, is building and deploying a custom virtual factory application that its customers can deploy in Omniverse Cloud.\nSoftServe, an elite member of the NVIDIA Service Delivery Partner program, is also developing custom factory simulation and visualization solutions on this Omniverse Cloud engine, covering factory design, production planning and control.\nAV Simulation Engine\nThe AV simulation engine is a service that delivers physically based sensor simulation, enabling AV and robotics developers to run autonomous systems in a closed-loop virtual environment.\nThe next generation of AV architectures will be built on large, unified AI models that combine layers of the vehicle stack, including perception, planning and control. Such new architectures call for an integrated approach to development.\nWith previous architectures, developers could train and test these layers independently, as they were governed by different models. For example, simulation could be used to develop a vehicle\u2019s planning and control system, which only needs basic information about objects in a scene \u2014 such as the speed and distance of surrounding vehicles \u2014 while perception networks could be trained and tested on recorded sensor data.\nHowever, using simulation to develop an advanced unified AV architecture requires sensor data as the input. For a simulator to be effective, it must be able to simulate vehicle sensors, such as cameras, radars and lidars, with high fidelity.\nTo address this challenge, NVIDIA is bringing state-of-the-art sensor simulation pipelines used in DRIVE Sim and Isaac Sim to Omniverse Cloud on Microsoft Azure.\nOmniverse Cloud sensor simulation provides AV and robotics workflows with high-fidelity, physically based simulation for cameras, radars, lidars and other types of sensors. It can be connected to existing simulation applications, whether developed in-house or provided by a third party, via Omniverse Cloud application programming interfaces for integration into workflows.\nFast Track to Digitalization\nThe factory simulation engine is now available to customers via an Omniverse Cloud enterprise private offer through the Azure Marketplace, which provides access to NVIDIA OVX systems and fully managed Omniverse software, reference applications and workflows. The sensor simulation engine is coming soon.\nEnterprises can now also deploy Omniverse Enterprise on new optimized Azure virtual machines.\nLearn more on NVIDIA\u2019s Microsoft Ignite showcase page. \n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Driving | RoboticsTags: NVIDIA DRIVE Sim | NVIDIA Isaac Sim | Omniverse | Omniverse Enterprise | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"
