(Australian Story: Kate Wilson)abc.net.au/news/mick-curran-jamie-teh-changing-lives-of-the-blind-with-nvda/101768788Link copiedShareShare articleImagine what an airport terminal would be like for a blind person. Unable to see the signs telling you where to go \u2014 a great cavernous space full of rushing strangers.\u00a0\"There's just so much noise from all the travellers and suitcases around you echoing off the floor and walls,\" says Mick Curran, who has been completely blind since he was 15. \"Airports can be pretty overwhelming.\"But Mick has had to get used to airports. He and his childhood friend Jamie Teh, who is also blind, are rock stars of the software world and they get around.\"I have learned to roll with it,\" Jamie tells Australian Story. \"Take it as it comes.\"Loading...Mick and Jamie's disabilities\u00a0have\u00a0not been a barrier to success.The pair created screen-reading software called NVDA (Non-Visual Desktop Access) when they were fresh out of university. Seventeen years later, it's now used by 275,000 people in 175\u00a0countries and has been translated into 50 languages.\u00a0\"It is the only screen reader in the world that's made by blind people for blind people,\" says disability advocate Ben Clare, \"and opened doors for people with vision impairment\".Loading...NVDA had the potential to make them very rich\u00a0but from the outset, they were determined that the software would be free and open source.Both Mick and Jamie knew from personal experience how expensive it can be for visually impaired people to access the software\u00a0to independently use a computer.Commercial screen-reading software can cost upwards of $1,000.\u00a0\"Why should a blind person have to pay an extra thousand dollars in order to use a computer to the same extent as a sighted person?\" Mick says.\"Blind and vision-impaired people shouldn't have to be superheroes or have super wealthy families to benefit from the same education and opportunities as everyone else.\"Jamie and Mick strongly believe everyone should be able to use a computer. (Australian Story: Marc Smith)'I've got bad news': Mick loses his visionMick's cornea transplant at age four was life-changing. (Supplied: Mick Curran)Mick Curran was born with only one eye and his oesophagus wasn't joined in the middle.\u202f\u202fBefore he was five, he had seven operations on his stomach and chest. He had some sight, but it was blurry.When he was four, he became the youngest child in Victoria to have a corneal\u00a0transplant. It improved his sight dramatically, allowing him to read very large print. But as he got older, his sight began to deteriorate, and when he was 15, doctors suggested another corneal transplant.Mick (pictured before his operation) became completely blind at age 15. (Supplied: Mick Curran)\"They were honest and told me that there was probably a 70 per cent chance of success,\" Mick says. \"As a teenage boy, I heard 100 per cent. I did not process that at all as a risk. I think in my mind I was thinking perhaps I might even be almost fully sighted.\"But the operation didn't go to plan.\"They came out quite quickly,\" Mick's mother Debbie recalls, \"And just said, 'I'm very, very sorry. We've got bad news, as soon as we operated, his retina's haemorrhaged. There's just nothing we can do'.\"The first thing Michael said to me was, 'Did they put a lens in?' And I said, 'No, you've got no vision. That's it'. And he just was silent.\"'I was three months old when I had my first eye removed'Unlike Mick, Jamie was completely blind by the time he was six months old. Not long after birth, he was diagnosed with tumours in both eyes and his parents had to make the agonising decision whether to have his eyes removed or risk radiation treatment. \"It had to be his eyes because I wanted him alive no matter what,\"\u202fsays his mother, Sharon.Jamie became fascinated with computers and programming when he was nine. (Supplied: Jamie Teh)\"I was only three months old when I had my first eye removed, and then my second eye was removed at six months,\" Jamie explains. \"I have two artificial eyes. So, both my eyes are removable.\"Jamie showed an interest in computers from an early age. When he was in year four at primary school, his father bought a second-hand computer and Jamie said he wanted to learn basic programming.\"I bought an old book for programming,\" Jamie's father Terry says, \"And over a period of a week or so I read to him the whole book. So there were 100 questions in the book. Jaime got three wrong out of the hundred. I thought, 'God this guy is really, really so smart'.\"Music, mates and a big dreamWhen Mick lost his sight after the unsuccessful operation, he became despondent. \"I was very, very moody,\" he says. \"I guess I felt just completely numb and disconnected.\"Mick (pictured) and Jamie met at a music camp when they were kids. (Supplied: Mick Curran)But he had always been interested in technology and music and he found solace in those interests. \"I think what brought me out of my depression was identifying and throwing myself into skills that I already had and enjoyed doing.\"The following year he went to a braille music camp that he had attended when he was 10. Back then he met Jamie, who was a year younger, and they hit it off immediately. Once again, Jamie was at the camp and the pair immediately picked up their friendship. \"It was like we'd never, never left each other,\" Mick says. \"I think I was drawn to Jamie because he was very much like me in a lot of ways, he was very intellectual.\"\u202fIt was around this time that they began discussing how good it would be if there was a free screen reader that all blind people could use. \"We both had a really big interest and passion for this emerging open source and free software movement, we talked about that quite a lot at music camp.\"\u202fMick and Amy meet through their involvement in the Victorian blindness advocacy community.\u00a0 (Supplied: Mick Curran)Duo 'grinds\u00a0away' at a life-changing ideaAfter school, both Mick and Jamie went on to study computing at university. They both married \u2014 Jamie to Jennifer and Mick to Amy \u2014 and when Mick moved from Victoria to Queensland, the couples ended up living five minutes away from each other.Their idea of creating free screen-reading software for the visually impaired kept ticking over. Mick knew that 60 per cent of blind people were unemployed, \"and that's partly to do with lack of technology\". Eventually, he dropped out of university to try to turn the idea into a reality.\"I could see the potential for people around the world who were far less fortunate [to] not just access \u2026 technology but to change their lives, to get an education, to get jobs, to be able to socialise, to be independent and reach their potential.\"Mick and Jamie in the early days of NVDA. (Supplied: Jamie Teh)By this time, Jamie had a computer programming job and would work on the NVDA project during lunch breaks. Before long, Mick asked him to work on the project full-time, because \"it would actually get it there a lot faster.\"Risk-averse, Jamie had doubts, until his wife told him that if he didn't take the opportunity, \"you're going to regret it for the rest of your life\".Mick says keeping NVDA open-source means the general public can contribute to the code and even translate into their language. (Australian Story\u00a0)For a long time, Jamie says, \"it was just the two of us, just grinding away. We knew it was possible and it was going to take a long time\".They got early funding from the Mozilla Foundation, but it was only when they started receiving emails from people overseas wanting to translate the software and use it in their own countries that they realised how important it was going to be. More funding began to come in and the pair found themselves increasingly feted.While Jamie once worked full-time with NVDA, he now contributes where he can between his regular job as a programmer. (Australian Story: Kate Wilson)Loading YouTube content'They are an inspiration for us who are blind'\u00a0In January, Mick and Jamie visited Samoa to see how their software was being used to run the braille unit at the Samoa Blind Persons' Association.\"Everybody at the Samoa Blind Persons' Association knows the story of Jamie and Mick,\" says Ari Hazelman, who has been blind since birth. \"The fact that they themselves were blind is an inspiration for us who are blind so we can strive more to improve our communities.\"Ari Hazelman from the Samoa\u00a0Blind Persons' Association delivers braille school materials to teenager Harry Harim. (Australian Story: Marc Smith)Disability has only recently been included in the census in this Pacific Island nation, so there aren't accurate figures on how many in Samoa are vision-impaired.\"Some people feel very vulnerable or very reluctant to call themselves a person with disabilities,\" says Faatino Utumapu, Ari Hazelman's colleague.\"They are often considered as a burden for the family, considering that the responsibility to care for family members rests with the families themselves with minimum support by the government.\"Ari Hazelman calls Mick and Jamie an \"inspiration\" to their community. (Australian Story: Marc Smith)Mick and Jamie say they know the impact of their work, but rarely get to see it in action.The Samoa Blind Persons' Association uses NVDA to edit and translate student materials, restaurant menus, as well as government and United Nations documents into braille.\u202fThe association provides backup and support for young people with vision impairments to remain in education, such as teenager Harry Harim, who dropped out of school last year for personal reasons.Harry has now returned to school, where braille materials are key to his learning. (Australian Story: Marc Smith)Ari home-delivers Harry's schoolwork supplied by his teacher and translated into braille by the association, so Harry doesn't fall behind.\"When I lost my vision as a 15-year-old, I really locked myself away from the world. So any help that people can provide teenagers like Harry in regard to making school that little bit easier is a great thing,\" Mick tells Australian Story.Harry has recently returned to the classroom.The Samoa\u00a0Blind Persons'\u00a0Association uses NVDA to translate documents and print them into braille. (Australian Story: Marc Smith)Pair will 'never ever' take money for softwareOver the years, many people \u2014 including friends and family \u2014 have pointed out the obvious opportunity that exists for Mick and Jamie to make money from the NVDA. But they remain adamant that it should be free.\"The reason we started NVDA and the reason we continue with NVDA is purely for the fact that there needs to be a free, open-source screen reader for blind people around the world,\" Mick says. \"And we are never, ever going to sacrifice that no matter how much people ask or how much people offer us.\"Jamie has now stepped back from NVDA but remains on the board and still contributes code along with the open-source community. Mick continues to work full-time on the software.Jamie and Mick are sought after for their expertise in screen reader software. (Australian Story: Kate Wilson)Mick and Jamie test out a prototype braille graphic display device by Korean company Dot Inc. (Australian Story: Kate Wilson)Ultimately, they see NVDA as an investment in the future.\"Everyone in the world has a right and responsibility to contribute what they can to make the world a better place. But if they aren't given the tools that help empower them then, we don't benefit from the great things they could contribute,\" Mick says.\"There are countless examples throughout history of people with disabilities that have done amazing things. And if they hadn't been enabled to do those things, we would have missed out as a society.\"\u202fWatch Australian Story's Blind Leading the Blind on\u00a0ABC iview.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, Nvidia is an awesome company. And sometimes, just because an entity is overbought doesn\u2019t mean it will correct. Instead, this framework simply means that demand effectively outpaces supply.\nNevertheless, investors may want to consider other chip stocks to buy not named Nvidia. Almost like clockwork, once the earlier traders of NVDA have enjoyed the fruits of their labor so to speak, they\u2019ll probably secure profits to find the next big opportunity. Realistically, then, the hot ticker may be facing a corrective phase.\u00a0Also, broader economic circumstances might not justify heavy exposure to oversaturated market ideas. With factors such as mass layoffs imposing a contradiction to the seemingly robust workforce, it may be better for investors to consider high-potential chip stocks that are on relative discount. Below are seven such ideas to consider.\n\nDiodes (DIOD)\nSource: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.com\nThough not nearly as exciting as Nvidia, Diodes (NASDAQ:DIOD) ranks among the most relevant alternative chip stocks to NVDA. A global manufacturer and supplier of application-specific standard products within the discrete, logic, analog, and mixed-signal semiconductor markets, Diodes offers a utilitarian profile. It\u2019s also a solid performer, with DIOD gaining nearly 21% since the Jan. opener.\nFor comparison, NVDA gained just over 206% during the same period. I\u2019m not going to say that DIOD will duplicate such a performance. However, what makes the latter one of the chip stocks to buy is its value proposition. Per data from Gurufocus, the market prices Diodes shares at a trailing multiple of 12.85. In contrast, the semiconductor industry\u2019s median earnings multiple stands at 24.3.\nAlso, the company benefits from a strong balance sheet. In particular, its equity-to-asset ratio clocks in at 0.7 times, ranking better than 61.21% of its peers. Also, its Altman Z-Score pings at 6.88, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Thus, DIOD is one of the high-potential chip stocks that likely won\u2019t leave you stranded.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\nSource: shutterstock.com/CC7\nWhile most of the alternative chip stocks to NVDA on this list are not the most well-known enterprises, the same can\u2019t be said about Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Manufacturing semiconductors, software and services related to wireless technology, Qualcomm represents a powerhouse in the 5G rollout. A modest performer relative to its competitors, QCOM gained a respectable 12% since the beginning of this year.\nAgain, what makes QCOM one of the semiconductor stocks to buy centers on the value proposition. Per Gurufocus, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 12.21. As a discount to projected earnings, Qualcomm ranks better than 84.62% of its rivals. Also, its price-earnings-growth\u00a0ratio sits at 0.29 times, well below the sector median stat of 1.19 times.\nTo be fair, Qualcomm could use a bit of work on the balance sheet. Still, it features fiscal stability with an Altman Z-Score of 5.4. On the operational side, its three-year revenue growth rate (on a per-share basis) comes in at 25%, above 78.48% of its peers. Thus, it\u2019s one of the chip stocks to buy not named NVDA.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM)\nSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.com\nSince early last year, the world received a shocking lesson in geopolitics, which then clouds the narrative for Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). Without getting bogged down into a historical discussion, it suffices to say that the company\u2019s namesake country faces its own unignorable tensions. Nevertheless, Taiwan Semiconductor owns the distinction of being the world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker via its independent foundry. Further, investors love TSM, with shares jumping over 40% since the start of the year.\nI\u2019m not entirely sure if TSM ranks among the alternative chip stocks to NVDA that can also match its performance. That said, I don\u2019t think you can outright ignore the compelling value proposition. Presently, the market prices TSM at a forward multiple of 18.65. As a discount to projected earnings, Taiwan Semi ranks better than 66.15% of the competition.\nAlso, I appreciate the company\u2019s broad financial strengths. Per Gurufocus, TSM\u2019s Piotroski F-Score clocks in at 7 out of 9, indicating decent operational efficiency. On the top line, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 28.4%, outflanking 82.74% of its rivals. If you\u2019re seeking top-performing chip stocks, TSM could be it.\n\nHimax Technologies (HIMX)\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\nAnother company based in Taiwan, Himax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX) is a leading supplier and fabless semiconductor manufacturer according to its corporate profile. Though the rest of the world has attempted to diversify its chip supply chain, countries like Taiwan continue to dominate. It may take years if not decades to overturn this dominance. As a result, HIMX posted a solid performance, gaining almost 15% since the January opener.\nDespite running in the black, Himax still ranks among alternative chip stocks to NVDA. Unlike Nvidia, Himax offers a comfortable value play. Per Gurufocus, the market prices HIMX at a forward multiple of 16.25. As a discount to projected earnings, Himax ranks better than 73.85% of companies listed in the semiconductor industry. Plus, HIMX trades at 1.24 times trailing-12-month sales, comparing favorably to the sector median of 2.74 times.\nEven with the discount, Himax features an impressive three-year revenue growth rate of 20.8%, above 71.69% of rivals. Also, its book growth rate clocks in at 26.7%, above nearly 77%. Therefore, HIMX is a strong idea for high-potential chip stocks.\n\nAmkor (AMKR)\nSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.com\nHeadquartered in Tempe, Arizona, Amkor (NASDAQ:AMKR) is a semiconductor product packaging and test services provider. Per its public profile, Amkor designs, packages, and tests integrated circuits for chip manufacturers. Further, the company features an international footprint, with factories in China, Japan, Korea, and many other countries. Since the start of the year, AMKR gained a modest 5%.\nGranted, that\u2019s not an exciting backdrop for alternative chip stocks to NVDA. However, if you\u2019re looking for a relevant entity that can rise over the long run, Amkor deserves a closer look. Specifically, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 16.8. As a discount to projected earnings, AMKR ranks better than 71.54% of its chipmaking peers. Also noteworthy, AMKR trades at a lowly 0.92 times trailing sales.\nDespite the bargain stats, Amkor still delivers the goods operationally. Its three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 19.5%, outpacing 69.04% of sector rivals. For the patient market participant, AMKR is one of the semiconductor stocks to buy.\n\nSTMicroelectronics (STM)\nSource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.com\nBased in Switzerland, STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) designs, develops, manufactures, and markets semiconductor products. Per its corporate profile, the tech firm offers discrete and standard commodity components, application-specific integrated circuits, full custom devices, and semi-custom devices for analog, digital, and mixed-signal applications. Another broadly pertinent enterprise, STM easily ranks among the alternative chip stocks to NVDA.\nFor one thing, you can look at the charts. Since the start of the year, STM soared to over 38%. In the past 365 days, it gained nearly 45% of its equity value. Despite the robust print, STM remains undervalued. Per data from Gurufocus, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 11.33. As a discount to projected earnings, STMicroelectronics ranks better than 88.46% of the competition.\nAlso, the company continues to deliver strong operational stats. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 19.1%, above 67.55% of sector players. During the same period, its EBITDA growth rate impresses at 39.8%. Finally, its trailing-year net margin hits 25.3%, beating out 90.2% of its rivals. Again, it\u2019s an easy name to raise for chip stocks to buy.\n\nSilicon Motion (SIMO)\nSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.com\nA risky but enticing opportunity among alternative chip stocks to NVDA, Silicon Motion (NASDAQ:SIMO) develops NAND flash controller integrated circuits for solid-state storage devices. As well, its public profile indicates that the tech firm is the merchant leader in supplying solid-state drive controllers. Since the beginning of this year, SIMO gained just over 4%. However, in the trailing year, it\u2019s down nearly 21%.\nTo be sure, chipmakers present a risk because of the economy and also geopolitics. However, Silicon Motion helps assuage some of these concerns with its value proposition. Currently, the market prices SIMO at a trailing multiple of 17.34. As a discount to earnings, Silicon Motion ranks better than 62.54% of the competition. Also noteworthy is that SIMO\u2019s PEG ratio sits at 0.85 times, ranking favorably below 61% of its peers.\nEnticingly, Silicon enjoys a rock-solid balance sheet. With zero debt on its books, the company enjoys incredible flexibility, especially at this juncture. Also, its Altman Z-Score pings at just over 10, indicating an extremely low risk of imminent bankruptcy. With a three-year revenue growth rate nearing 30%, SIMO\u2019s a great idea for high-potential chip stocks.\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nSemiconductor, Technology\n\n\nGrowth Stocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2023/06/7-chip-stocks-to-buy-if-you-missed-out-on-nvda/.\n\u00a92025 InvestorPlace Media, LLC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored Headlines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMore from InvestorPlace\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHot Stocks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Top Stocks to Buy Under Trump Come From Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018BRAIN\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Luke Lango, InvestorPlace Senior Investment Analyst\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Danger that Could Derail Our Economy\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Jeff Remsburg, Contributing Editor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy Prediction Came True: Where to Find Opportunity Despite Market Unpredictability\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Eric Fry, Editor, Fry's Investment Report\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMost Popular\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 10, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBig Tech\u2019s Quantum War Has Begun \u2014 and One Tiny Stock Could Win It\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 5, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat to Make of the Weakening Economy and Trade War\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInvestors Applaud a Cool Inflation Print\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow to Escape the \u2018Tyranny of the Immediate\u2019 in Investing\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExpert Stock Picks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe System Flagging a Potential 50X Opportunity\u2026 Even in This Ugly Market\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAbout InvestorPlace\nProducts\nContact Us\nHelp\nCareers\nAdvertise With Us\nDisclosures & Disclaimers\nPrivacy Policy\nAd Choices\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\nCookie Policy\nCookie Preferences\nTerms of Use\nDMCA Policy\n All rights reserved.

NVIDIA AI software and hardware can help the industry combine their business data with geospatial data to accelerate these applications.\nBy better understanding the environmental and social risks associated with an investment, the financial sector can choose to prioritize those that are more likely to support sustainable development \u2014 a framework known as environmental, social and governance (ESG).\nFocus on sustainable investments is growing: A Bloomberg Intelligence analysis estimated that ESG assets will represent more than a third of total managed assets worldwide by 2025. And a report by the European Union Agency for the Space Programme predicts that the insurance and finance industry will become the top consumer of Earth observation data and services over the next decade \u2014 resulting in more than $1 billion in total revenue by 2031.\nSeveral members of NVIDIA Inception, a global program that supports cutting-edge startups, are advancing these efforts with GPU-accelerated AI applications that can track water pollution near industrial plants, quantify the financial risk of wildfires, assess damage after storms and more.\nPowerful Compute for Large-Scale Data\nGPU-accelerated AI and data science can rapidly extract insights from complex, unstructured data \u2014 enabling banks and businesses to set up real-time streaming and analysis of data as it\u2019s captured from satellites, drones, antennas and edge sensors.\nBy monitoring aerial imagery \u2014 available for free from public space agencies, or at higher granularity from private companies \u2014 analysts can get a clear view of how much water is being used from a reservoir over time, how many trees are being cut down for a construction project or how many homes were damaged by a tornado.\nThis capability can help audit investments by verifying the accuracy of written records such as government-mandated disclosures, environmental impact reports or even insurance claims.\nFor example, investors might track the supply chain of a company that reports it has achieved net zero in its production line, and discover that it actually relies on an overseas plant emitting coal ash visible in satellite images. Or, sensors that analyze heat emissions from buildings could help identify low-emitting businesses for a tax credit.\nNVIDIA\u2019s edge computing solutions, including the NVIDIA Jetson platform for autonomous machines and other embedded applications, are powering numerous AI initiatives in spatial finance.\nIn addition to using NVIDIA hardware to speed up their applications, developers are adopting software including the NVIDIA DeepStream software development kit for streaming analytics, part of the NVIDIA Metropolis platform for vision AI. They\u2019re also using the NVIDIA Omniverse platform for building and operating metaverse applications for detailed, 3D visualizations of geospatial data.\nInsuring Property \u2014 From Assessing Risks to Accelerating Claims\nNVIDIA Inception members are developing GPU-accelerated applications that turn geospatial data into insights for insurance companies, reducing the number of expensive onsite visits needed to monitor the status of insured properties.\nRSS-Hydro, based in Luxembourg, uses GPU computing on premises and in the cloud to train FloodSENS, a machine learning app that maps flood impact from satellite images. The company also uses NVIDIA Omniverse to animate FloodSENS in 3D, helping the team more effectively communicate flood risks and inform resource allocation planning during emergencies.\n\nToronto-based Ecopia AI uses deep learning-based mapping systems to mine geospatial data, helping to produce next-generation digital maps with highly accurate segmentation of buildings, roads, forests and more. These maps power diverse applications across the public and private sectors, including government climate resilience initiatives and insurance risk assessment. Ecopia uses NVIDIA GPUs to develop its AI models.\nCrowdAI, based in the San Francisco Bay Area, uses deep learning tools to accelerate the insurance claims process by automatically analyzing aerial images and videos to detect assets that were damaged or destroyed in natural disasters. The company uses NVIDIA GPUs for both training and inference.\nCrowdAI\u2019s deep learning model detected buildings from this aerial image taken in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael in 2018. The AI also categorizes the level of damage \u2013 ranging from green representing no damage; to yellow and orange for minor and major damage, respectively; to purple for destroyed buildings. Image credit: CrowdAI, Inc., DigitalGlobe, NOAA, and Nearmap.\nPredicting Risks and Opportunities for Businesses\nInception startups are also using geospatial data to help government groups and banks quantify the risks and opportunities of their investments \u2014 such as predicting crop yields, detecting industrial pollution and measuring the land and water use of an asset.\nSwitzerland-based Picterra is supporting sustainable finance with a geospatial MLOps platform that enables banks, insurance companies and financial consultancies to analyze ESG metrics. The company\u2019s AI-driven insights can help the financial industry make investment decisions, model risk and quickly quantify vulnerabilities and opportunities in investment portfolios. The company uses NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs and the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit to develop its AI models, which process raw data from satellite, drone and aerial imagery.\nLondon-based Satellite Vu, a startup applying satellite technology to address global challenges, will be able to monitor the temperature of any building on the planet in near real time using infrared camera data. These infrared images will provide its customers with insights about the economic activity, the energy efficiency of buildings, the urban heat island effect and more.\nAnd Sourcenergy, based in Houston, uses geospatial data to power an energy supply chain intelligence platform that can help the financial services industry with market research. Its AI tools, developed using NVIDIA A100 GPUs, enable investors to independently create real-time models of energy companies\u2019 well inventories and project costs, giving them insights even before the companies share data in their quarterly earnings reports.\nLearn more about NVIDIA\u2019s work in financial services, and read more on geospatial AI in investment management in chapter 10 of this handbook.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Agriculture and Food | Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Computer Vision | Financial Services | Inception | Metropolis | Smart Spaces \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We look at three ways that investors can find the next stock market darling.James Gruber06 June 2023 Article Page URL has been copied to clipboard for sharing. Mentioned: BetaShares Glb Rbtc & Artfcl Intlgc ETF (RBTZ), Apple Inc (AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN), The Walt Disney Co (DIS), Alphabet Inc (GOOG), Netflix Inc (NFLX), Nike Inc (NKE), NVIDIA Corp (NVDA)US chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) is all the rage in stock markets. This week, the company briefly entered the exclusive club of stocks valued at US$1 trillion or above.Only seven other US companies have ever achieved this mark. And Nvidia is now valued close to Amazon (AMZN).For a company that isn\u2019t a household name, it\u2019s an extraordinary achievement. What\u2019s even more extraordinary is the way in which it\u2019s achieved the milestone.Last week, after posting record sales, the company rose 24%, or US$184 billion in market value, in just one day. That one-day gain was larger than the market caps of companies like Disney (DIS), Nike (NKE), and Netflix (NFLX). And the market value jump has only ever been exceeded by two other companies: Amazon and Apple (AAPL) (both with US$191 billion gains).Nvidia\u2019s stock is up 164% this year and more than 10,000% over the past decade.\u00a0\u00a0Why is there such excitement over Nvidia? Well, the company designs semiconductor chips that are made of silicon slices which contain certain patterns. These chips have billions of switches that process complex information simultaneously. And now they are central to many Artificial Intelligence (AI) functions: everything from ChatGPT to image generation.It\u2019s the AI bit that has captured the imaginations of investors. As an analyst noted of Nvidia:\u201cThere\u2019s a war going on out there in AI, and Nvidia today is the only arms dealer out there. So as a result we\u2019re seeing this huge jump in revenues.\u201dOf AI\u2019s potential, Bill Gates has this to say:\u201cThe development of AI is as fundamental as the creation of the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet, and the mobile phone. It will change the way people work, learn, travel, get health care, and communicate with each other. Entire industries will reorient around it. Businesses will distinguish themselves by how well they use it.\u201dNvidia is now being valued at around 35x sales and it\u2019s invoked comparisons to the high valuations of the 2000 tech bubble.Identifying stocks with strong growth potentialWhile much of the commentary centres on the market implications of Nvidia\u2019s rise, less discussed is how investors might go about finding the next Nvidia. Not the next tech darling necessarily, but the next growth stock that will compound earnings over a long period and eventually be recognised by the market for its business performance.One way to do this may be termed the Morningstar method. It involves focusing on companies with wide economic moats that can help them fend off competitors. A moat can allow a company to consistently achieve higher margins than its competitors and earn returns in excess of its cost of capital. It can also enable a company to excel in any environment.Morningstar\u2019s Mark Lamonica says to identify moats requires an investor to be a student of business.\"You must understand the sector or industry that the company operates in and what factors influence customer behaviour,\"This is a skill you can develop, he says.\"Start with an everyday product that you use and make a list of competitors that offer the same or similar products. Think about substitutes as well as direct competitors. Think about the things that influence your own behaviour as a consumer. What would it take for you to switch to a different provider? What would cause you to buy more or less of the product? What does it take for the company to keep you as a customer \u2013 constant sales, constant marketing, constant improvements in the product? Think about how that good or service is produced. What are the different things that may influence the cost of producing that good or service. Does producing it at scale make it cheaper? Is it reliant on inputs with shifting prices? Finally, think about the ease with which new competitors can enter the market. Are there low barriers to entry or are there structures in place to prevent competition like government licenses or patents.\u201dBuying a basket of stocksIdentifying and buying a growth stock in one thing, holding onto it for the long term is another.Take Nvidia. To get the extraordinary gains of this year, you would have had to endure a painful 64% drop in the stock price between November 2021 and October 2022. And a 54% fall in 2018. The path to Nvidia joining the US$1 trillion club has been far from smooth.This is a common story with growth stocks. For example, Amazon lost almost 95% of its value during the 2000 tech bust. The stock had a 54% drop in 2005-2006, a 58% decline in 2008, and 5 separate instances of 25% or more in losses since 2009.\u00a0\u00a0Nvidia and Amazon aren\u2019t isolate examples. Portfolio manager Ben Carlson notes that since 1980, more than 40% of all companies in the US stock market have had a decline of 70% or worse without recovering.There aren\u2019t many investors who can stomach these types of losses and hang on. Especially if you don\u2019t know whether the stock will ever come back or not.Not only are growth stocks often hard to stomach, but choosing the right ones can be difficult. For instance, you may think the outlook for gene therapy looks amazing and choose a stock to play the theme. It can turn out that you were right on the theme but wrong on the stock, and a competitor got the jump on them to become the leader in the field.One way to avoid this problem is to buy a basket of stocks to play a stock market theme.That\u2019s what GQG CIO Rajiv Jain has chosen to do with AI. Jain told the recent Morningstar Investor Conference in Australia that he believes artificial intelligence (AI) will be revolutionary and the large cap tech stocks such as Alphabet (GOOG) are likely to be winners from this revolution. He says there are 400 AI startups and it\u2019s impossible to pick who will be the ultimate winner. Yet it does seem to him that the larger companies should do well from it, especially in an environment of higher interest rates, which make it harder for startups to get off the ground and scale.Buying a basket of stocks is one way to play a favoured stock market theme. Another is simply to buy an ETF. Thematic ETFs are gaining favour with investors for this reason. For instance, Australian investors can invest in AI through the Betashares Global Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF.The benefit of buying a basket of stocks is that you aren\u2019t reliant on one stock for performance. The downside is that you still have concentrated exposure to a group of stocks. And it may not prevent the stomach-churning volatility often associated with growth stocks and themes.Buying the whole marketThere\u2019s another way to get access to growth stocks and that\u2019s through buying a broad market ETF or index. Buying an ASX 200 ETF is essentially a bet on progress and innovation. As legendary Vanguard founder, John Bogle, said:\u201cDon't look for the needle in the haystack. Just buy the haystack.\u201dThe greatest stock picker of all time, Warren Buffett, seems to agree. Upon his death, he\u2019s advised the trustee for his wife\u2019s benefit to put 90% in a low-cost S&P 500 index fund and the rest in short-term government bonds.ALPHABETAMAZONAPPLE NEWSETFSGROWTH STOCKSJOHN C BOGLENEWSNVIDIARAJIV JAINWARREN BUFFETTAUTHORJames Gruberis an assistant editor for Firstlinks and Morningstar.com.au.SHARE THIS ARTICLE Article Page URL has been copied to clipboard for sharing.

There was a short window between our flight from Auckland\u00a0to Samoa and we had to pretty much run to make the tight turnaround.\u00a0Airports can be overwhelming for the most seasoned travellers. Add in blindness and it's a whole different story.\u00a0Plus, we were filming the mad dash for an upcoming Australian Story. I had underestimated what would be required.Seventeen years ago, Jamie Teh and Mick Curran\u00a0invented the world's most popular free screen-reader software.\u00a0Called\u00a0NVDA (Non-Visual Desktop Access),\u00a0it's\u00a0the only screen reader in the world made by blind people for blind people.It's now used by 275,000 people in 175\u00a0countries and has been translated into 50 languages.\u00a0We were travelling with Jamie and Mick\u00a0to document the impact their software is\u00a0having in Samoa.It was fascinating to watch them navigate their way through the airport using a form of echolocation, clicking their fingers to listen for sounds echoing off the walls and furniture to determine where they are in the space.In the end we got through security, tracked down the correct gate and finally boarded the plane. It wasn't until the adrenaline had subsided and I was seated next to Jamie\u00a0and Mick\u00a0that I could catch my breath and realise what we had just achieved.\"Are you guys OK?\"\u00a0I asked.The notoriously good-humoured pair just laughed. As Jamie says, they take their blindness in their stride and just \"get on with it\".Kristine Taylor and camera operator Anthony Sines sit down for an interview with NVDA co-founder Jamie Teh (left). (Australian Story: Kate Wilson)When we commissioned the story\u00a0we knew there could be some additional things to consider. As with many sighted people, I had not met many people with limited vision, so it was a big learning experience for me.\u00a0Mick and Jamie are seasoned travellers, but it\u00a0takes them a little extra planning to get from point A to point B, such as getting an escort at the airport from the taxi to the check-in counter and to the correct gate.There's so much that you take for granted\u00a0as a sighted person,\u00a0tiny\u00a0details that you pick up and process, that a person who is vision-impaired doesn't.Mick Curran (centre) and Jamie Teh (right) read a braille menu as they sit down for lunch with Ari Hazelman from the Samoa\u00a0Blind Persons\u00a0Association. (Australian Story\u00a0)When Jamie and Mick,\u00a0camera operator Marc Smith and I arrived at our hotel in Samoa, one of things we did was guide Mick and Jamie to their room and then orientate them within the room. When they are in a new space they need to orientate themselves and become familiar with the space, including doing little things\u00a0like identifying which bottle is the shampoo and which one is the conditioner, where they can find the TV remote, kettle and so on.\u00a0I said to Mick and Jamie when we first started filming that they would need to let me know what I was doing right and, more importantly, what I was doing wrong. They were not shy in pointing out the latter. Anyone who has watched the program will have noticed their sense of humour on the trip \u2014 we had a lot of laughs, much of it at our expense.Something we did get wrong was the first time we filmed with Jamie I took him by the hand to guide him. This is not the preferred way in the blind community, so I found out. Instead, I offered my elbow or arm. It was a small thing but made a big difference once I knew the correct way to guide.It was a memorable experience filming with Mick and Jamie, Taylor says. (Australian Story)Audio description rolls out across the ABCAlthough more than half the interview subjects in the story were blind, the interviews were structured and set up much the same as any other \u2014 lighting, two cameras, a producer and a quiet space to film. We faced one another in the interview as we normally would.In fact, nothing much differed with Mick and Jamie \u2014 it was like any other Australian Story interview, however, for any sequences outside the home we would ensure we orientated them in the space first.Jamie Teh in interview with Australian Story. (Australian Story: Kate Wilson)One thing Mick and Jamie had told me was that when blind or vision-impaired people got together in a room, they did not always feel it was necessary to face each other, so they might end up chatting away enthusiastically while facing in all different directions.In this case I had to ask them to direct their responses to where our voice was coming from, but that's something they are used to doing when talking to sighted people.We knew that there would be a lot of people who are vision-impaired and blind who would be interested in this story and we wanted to make sure those people could engage fully with the episode.Jamie Teh (left) and Mick Curran are sought after for their experience with accessibility for vision-impaired people. (Australian Story: Kate Wilson)In consultation with ABC's senior channel manager, Charlie Cox, digital producer Megan Mackander and I quickly discovered the best way to make content accessible for vision-impaired viewers was audio description (AD). This is a narration that describes important visual elements of a television program, movie or performance between lines of dialogue. As with closed captions, it can be turned on or off as needed.Loading...About 14 hours of content is audio described each week at the ABC. It's something the ABC is rolling out across ABC iview and TV broadcast for select programs\u00a0such as Australian Story, Back Roads, and popular children's shows such as\u00a0Bluey and Play School. The ABC is looking to expand this further in the future.We've had some great feedback on the program. Inspiring,\u00a0 talented, clever and change-makers were just some of the words popping up in our social media comments. Some viewers were even calling for the duo to have an Australian of the Year nomination.For me, making this program was a truly memorable and educational experience.\u00a0Jamie and Mick were kind teachers and such fun to be with.Watch Australian Story's Blind Leading the Blind\u00a0on\u00a0ABC iview\u00a0(AD option available) or ABC News In-Depth YouTube (or watch the AD version here)Posted\u00a0Mon 19 Jun 2023 at 7:58pmMonday 19 Jun 2023 at 7:58pmMon 19 Jun 2023 at 7:58pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX\u00a0(formerly\u00a0Twitter)Top StoriesPutin rejects full ceasefire in Trump call but agrees to key US demandTopic:WarPhoto shows Vladimir Putin, waring a suit and tie and making a hand gesture, pictured in front of a blue backgroundDo you recognise this man?

Are you excited?The ASUS DUAL CardSome Performance BenchmarksFinal ThoughtsAda now starts at 300 USD. Are you excited?\nNVIDIA is all-in on AI, but consumer GPUs are still a thing. And while marketing for even this modest little RTX 4060 will still center around AI-powered technologies (DLSS, frame generation), it is still a conventional desktop graphics solution. As such, there is the raster performance question, particularly as it relates to AMD\u2019s latest offering.\nAnd yes, this is another 8GB product in 2023, and I do remember that the RTX 3060 had 12GB of VRAM. Call it a regression if you must, but NVIDIA will point out that their big L2 cache and DLSS + FG will all but alleviate your VRAM concerns. But let\u2019s be honest. No product with 8GB of VRAM that costs $300 in 2023 is going to gain the Gamers Nexus or Hardware Unboxed seal of approval. YouTube skews negative, and they will probably have a field day with this.\nIn this written review, I will present some actual data from benchmarks I have just completed running over the past few days, and let you decide if this card is worth your hard-earned money. No drama, just the facts, ma\u2019am. Beginning with these specs (which I\u2019ll probably have to update since I am not 100% sure on a couple of them):\n \n\n\n\n\nRTX 4060\nRTX 4060 Ti\nRTX 4070\nRTX 4070 Ti\nRTX 4080\n\n\nGPU\nAD107\nAD106\nAD104\nAD104\nAD103\n\n\nArchitecture\nAda Lovelace\nAda Lovelace\nAda Lovelace\nAda Lovelace\nAda Lovelace\n\n\nSMs\n24\n34\n46\n60\n76\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n3072\n4352\n5888\n7680\n9728\n\n\nTensor Cores\n96 (4th Gen)\n136 (4th Gen)\n184 (4th Gen)\n240 (4th Gen)\n304 (4th Gen)\n\n\nRT Cores\n24 (3rd Gen)\n34 (3rd Gen)\n46 (3rd Gen)\n60 (3rd Gen)\n76 (3rd Gen)\n\n\nBase Clock\n1830 MHz\n2310 MHz\n1920 MHz\n2310 MHz\n2205 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock\n2460 MHz\n2535 MHz\n2475 MHz\n2610 MHz\n2505 MHz\n\n\nTexture Units\n96\n136\n184\n240\n304\n\n\nROPs\n48\n48\n64\n80\n112\n\n\nMemory\n8GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n12GB GDDR6X\n12GB GDDR6X\n16GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Data Rate\n17 Gbps\n18 Gbps\n21 Gbps\n21 Gbps\n21 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Interface\n128-bit\n128-bit\n192-bit\n192-bit\n256-bit\n\n\nL2 Cache Size\n24MB\n32MB\n36MB\n48MB\n64MB\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n272 GB/s\n288 GB/s\n504 GB/s\n504 GB/s\n716 GB/s\n\n\nTransistor Count\n?\n22.9B\n35.8B\n35.8B\n45.9B\n\n\nDie Size\n146 mm^2\n190 mm^2\n295 mm^2\n295 mm^2\n379 mm^2\n\n\nProcess Tech\nTSMC 4N NV Custom\nTSMC 4N NV Custom\nTSMC 4N NV Custom\nTSMC 4N NV Custom\nTSMC 4N NV Custom\n\n\nTGP\n115W\n160W\n200W\n285W\n320W\n\n\nLaunch Price\n$299\n$399\n$599\n$799\n$1199\n\n\n\n \nJust my opinion, but the $100 USD gap between the RTX 4060 and RTX 4060 Ti looks wrong. Or maybe it\u2019s the gap in specs / capability between the two. Should they be this disparate? Isn\u2019t there room for another SKU in between these two? Maybe I\u2019m missing something.\n \n \n \n\n\nThe ASUS DUAL Card\nThe entry-level solution from ASUS, named after its dual-fan configuration, the DUAL is a compact unit that is still quite a bit larger than the PCB hiding beneath the cooler.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most interesting aspect of this design to this editor?

Let\u2019s look at some more titles:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not sure what to make of these results. Clearly, the Radeon RX 7600 has improved with driver maturity since launch, and of course NVIDIA will continue to showcase performance using DLSS 3.0 with Frame Generation (which we will get to shortly).\nFor a sanity check, I went back and ran 3DMark Time Spy on all eight cards (three runs each, averaged), and here are the GPU scores:\n \n\n\nThe Radeon RX 7600 is just slightly ahead of the GeForce RTX 4060 in Time Spy, but still, I didn\u2019t expect any advantage (let alone the larger disparity in the above game results) considering the pricing. AMD doesn\u2019t have the same features as NVIDIA (remember, AMD\u2019s FSR 3.0 with frame generation is still MIA), but they are winning the sub-$300 raster war this generation. However, we can\u2019t forget that NVIDIA is all about that DLSS and ai-generated frames, so let\u2019s check that out.\n \n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sure what\u2019s up with the lackluster DLSS + FG results from this RTX 4060, as the RTX 4060 Ti really shines in that area. Perhaps this is a game optimization or driver issue, and we will see more DLSS 3.0 uplift after launch.\nFinally, a look at power draw. I decided to keep things simple and just show gen-on-gen performance here:\n \n\n\nThe RTX 4060 has a rated TGP of 115 watts, though it is clearly exceeding that here. Still, we are looking at a solid improvement in efficiency over the RTX 3060 \u2013 while offering a sizable performance advantage over this 30 Series counterpart.\n \n \n \n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIf you are looking for a GPU at this price level, the only competition from this generation (forgetting the mountain of previous-gen cards in the pipeline) is AMD Radeon RX 7600, and the Intel Arc stuff I didn\u2019t test as I was running behind schedule. If we are talking rasterization, AMD is winning the sub-$300 area this generation, but the 4060 is an RTX product, and that means ray tracing and DLSS.\nNaturally, DLSS with the RTX 40 Series means frame generation, and frame generation means higher perceived FPS on top of the performance gains from DLSS. AMD is apparently trying to thwart NVIDIA\u2019s DLSS advantage by blocking the feature on games in which they are partners (see Starfield drama), but many, many titles do support NVIDIA\u2019s upscaling tech. And, honestly, if you\u2019re buying a 4060 with 8GB of VRAM, you should use DLSS.\n \n\n\nI just can\u2019t help but think that if this product had been called the RTX 4050 Ti \u2013 even if it was launching at the same price (though that wouldn\u2019t go over well at all) \u2013 there would still be room for a cut-down AD106 product between this and the RTX 4060 Ti 8GB. And that product could have been the RTX 4060. Product names and pricing might be all we talk about when we look back on this generation of NVIDIA GPUs, years from now.\u00a0\n \n \n \n  \n\n\n \n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVideo News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviousThe Razer Blade 14 2023 Gaming Laptop Has Ryzen Inside \n\nNextWiFi Woes?

There is a small latency penalty with frame generation, though I\u2019ve noticed that in titles that support it NVIDIA\u2019s reflex is enabled when frame generation is turned on, to mitigate this.\nReply  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Editor\u2019s note: Neuralangelo is now available on GitHub.\u00a0\nNeuralangelo, a new AI model by NVIDIA Research for 3D reconstruction using neural networks, turns 2D video clips into detailed 3D structures \u2014 generating lifelike virtual replicas of buildings, sculptures and other real-world objects.\nLike Michelangelo sculpting stunning, life-like visions from blocks of marble, Neuralangelo generates 3D structures with intricate details and textures. Creative professionals can then import these 3D objects into design applications, editing them further for use in art, video game development, robotics and industrial digital twins.\nNeuralangelo\u2019s ability to translate the textures of complex materials \u2014 including roof shingles, panes of glass and smooth marble \u2014 from 2D videos to 3D assets significantly surpasses prior methods. The high fidelity makes its 3D reconstructions easier for developers and creative professionals to rapidly create usable virtual objects for their projects using footage captured by smartphones.\n\u201cThe 3D reconstruction capabilities Neuralangelo offers will be a huge benefit to creators, helping them recreate the real world in the digital world,\u201d said Ming-Yu Liu, senior director of research and co-author on the paper. \u201cThis tool will eventually enable developers to import detailed objects \u2014 whether small statues or massive buildings \u2014 into virtual environments for video games or industrial digital twins.\u201d\nIn a demo, NVIDIA researchers showcased how the model could recreate objects as iconic as Michelangelo\u2019s David and as commonplace as a flatbed truck. Neuralangelo can also reconstruct building interiors and exteriors \u2014 demonstrated with a detailed 3D model of the park at NVIDIA\u2019s Bay Area campus.\n\nNeural Rendering Model Sees in 3D\nPrior AI models to reconstruct 3D scenes have struggled to accurately capture repetitive texture patterns, homogenous colors and strong color variations. Neuralangelo adopts instant neural graphics primitives, the technology behind NVIDIA Instant NeRF, to help capture these finer details.\nUsing a 2D video of an object or scene filmed from various angles, the model selects several frames that capture different viewpoints \u2014 like an artist considering a subject from multiple sides to get a sense of depth, size and shape.\nOnce it\u2019s determined the camera position of each frame, Neuralangelo\u2019s AI creates a rough 3D representation of the scene, like a sculptor starting to chisel the subject\u2019s shape.\nThe model then optimizes the render to sharpen the details, just as a sculptor painstakingly hews stone to mimic the texture of fabric or a human figure.\nThe final result is a 3D object or large-scale scene that can be used in virtual reality applications, digital twins or robotics development.\nFind NVIDIA Research at CVPR, June 18-22\nNeuralangelo is one of nearly 30 projects by NVIDIA Research to be presented at the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), taking place June 18-22 in Vancouver. The papers span topics including pose estimation, 3D reconstruction and video generation.\nOne of these projects, DiffCollage, is a diffusion method that creates large-scale content \u2014 including long landscape orientation, 360-degree panorama and looped-motion images. When fed a training dataset of images with a standard aspect ratio, DiffCollage treats these smaller images as sections of a larger visual \u2014 like pieces of a collage. This enables diffusion models to generate cohesive-looking large content without being trained on images of the same scale.\n\nThe technique can also transform text prompts into video sequences, demonstrated using a pretrained diffusion model that captures human motion:\n\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\nLearn more about NVIDIA Research at CVPR.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | ResearchTags: 3D | Art | Artificial Intelligence | Graphics | NVIDIA Research \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

MVIS stock is now up 200% since the beginning of 2023.\nTo meme stock investors, the investment thesis here is obvious. MicroVision is a self-proclaimed leader in high-performance lidar sensors and the rise of self-driving vehicles will jumpstart demand for the technology. If Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) can become a trillion-dollar company by helping artificial intelligence (AI) applications \u201cthink,\u201d why can\u2019t MicroVision do the same by enabling them to \u201csee?\u201d\nSuch comparisons, however, fall short of the mark. A deeper look into MicroVision\u2019s technology reveals a struggling firm that\u2019s falling further behind. A cash shortage will also necessitate fundraising by 2025.\nAlthough MVIS shares will likely keep going up in the short term, long-term investors are better off finding an AI stock with stronger prospects.\n\nMicroVision Stock: A Meme in the Making\nIn May, InvestorPlace writer Samuel O\u2019Brient noted that Microvision had been \u201csurging all month with no real catalysts.\u201d\n\u201cThe biggest short squeeze of the season may already be upon us [\u2026] interest from retail investors has been rising steadily.\u201d\nSince then, MVIS stock has risen another 80% as of this writing, topping off an already incredible run. Earlier this week, InvestorPlace\u2019s Shrey Dua also noted that no MicroVision shares were available to short, per Fintel\u2019s sample brokerage.\nThe data tells us that investors should expect gains, at least in the short term. The company now scores an \u201cA\u201d for momentum in my quantitative Profit & Protection,\u00a0a historically bullish signal. Wall Street analysts have revised their earnings estimates up 7.5% in the past 30 days as well, suggesting greater gains ahead. Street analysts expect MicroVision to break even by 2025.\nMicroVision also has hype in its sails. Interest in self-driving technologies like Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Autopilot has been steadily rising since 2020\u00a0and the recent success of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT has put AI publicity into hyperdrive. According to data from Thomson Reuters, companies that mention the term \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d in their description have significantly outperformed this year.\n\n\nDon\u2019t Bet the Farm on MicroVision\u2026\nA deeper look into MicroVision reveals significant issues, however.\n1. Downstream Competition\nMicroVision and its rivals have been rocked by competition from Mobileye\u2019s (NASDAQ:MBLY) in-house lidar systems. Here\u2019s from Mobileye in 2021:\n\u201cIf autonomous vehicles are to take over complete control from human drivers, they\u2019ll require multiple types of sensors working in parallel [\u2026] But we soon found that the existing detection-and-ranging sensors on the market still leave much to be desired. That\u2019s why we\u2019re developing our own.\u201d\nMobileye has since become the dominant lidar supplier. In 2022, the Israel-based company generated $1.9 billion in revenues and poured almost $800 million into research and development (R&D), thanks to its success in advanced driver assistance solutions (ADAS). This strong revenue base means Mobileye easily outspends MicroVision ($30 million) and Ouster (NYSE:OUST) ($64 million). Only Luminar\u2019s (NASDAQ:LAZR)\u00a0$185 million R&D budget comes close.\n2. Too Many Technologies, Too Little Cash\nMicroVision has legacy baggage from its micro-display technologies and head-mounted augmented reality (AR) headsets. The meme stock now has a product suite that includes short- and mid-range lidar sensors, two different sensing systems and a validation software tool to replace manual data classification. MicroVision further weighed itself down earlier this year by acquiring Ibeo Automotive Systems, a German lidar maker that required a significant cash infusion.\nThat suggests MicroVision\u2019s R&D spending isn\u2019t particularly efficient. When investors see a company chasing too many technologies, it often signals that management is spreading bets too thinly.\nThe company has already spent $76 million of the $126 million it raised in 2021. At current cash burn rates, its liquidity could run out by 2025.\n\nUsually not a metric to advertise\nSource: 2023 MicroVision Investor Presentation\n3. No Revenue Momentum\nMicroVision has a chicken-and-egg problem where new clients find the firm unattractive for its lack of current customers. Per MicroVision\u2019s most recent annual report:\n\u201cWe have been unable to secure the customers at the scale needed to successfully launch our products. We have incurred substantial losses since inception, and we expect to incur a significant loss during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023.\u201d\nIn other words, no Tier 1 automaker has been willing to roll the dice on MicroVision. New vehicle models can take years to develop and millions of dollars to bring to market, making established firms like Luminar and Mobileye far more attractive.\n\n\u2026But Avoid Unhedged Short-Selling\nRecent history tells us that retail investors tend to buy stocks without regard for the fundamentals and can send shares up 5X\u2026 10X\u2026 50X on no news. Companies like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) still trade anywhere from 120% to 400% of their historical valuations, depending on the metric used.\nMicroVision is also a potential takeover target. Most Tier 1 automotive suppliers lack lidar technologies of their own and MicroVision\u2019s base models might seem like a tempting bolt-on acquisition. The 2022 merger between Ouster and Velodyne shows the potential for market consolidation.\nThat means traders should approach short-selling MVIS stock with care. An unhedged position could easily blow up a portfolio if shares rise 2X overnight. And even hedged positions will cost a great deal to maintain. According to data from Fintel, MicroVision\u2019s short borrow fee rate tops 70%.\nStill, the options market tells us that institutional investors remain skeptical of retail bullishness. Implied volatility for put options expiring in January 2024 sits at 130%, far higher than the roughly 80% implied volatility for call options. And a look into the company\u2019s R&D efforts reveals a money-burning company with little to show.\nBe careful of betting on MicroVision. Despite its recent rise, MVIS stock remains a longshot bet.\nAs of this writing, Tom Yeung\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTom Yeung is a market analyst and portfolio manager of the Omnia Portfolio, the highest-tier subscription at InvestorPlace.

Revenues declined 4% sequentially from $24.3 billion in 4Q 2022.Tesla delivered 422,875 cars in 1Q 2023, 36% higher than 1Q 2022 where it delivered 310,048 cars. Deliveries also increased 4% sequentially from 4Q 2022 with 405,278 cars delivered that quarter.Gross margin for 1Q 2023 stood at 19.3%, a 9.8 percentage point decline year on year and a 4.5 percentage point sequential decline.\u00a0The lower gross margin was attributed to price reductions on many vehicle models across regions. However, Tesla expects the cost of production to decrease from operating leverage and lower logistics costs, thereby boosting margins in the medium term.Net profit for 1Q 2023 was 24% lower year on year at US$2.5 billion as compared to U$3.3 billion for 1Q 2022. Net profit was also 32% lower than the prior quarter at US$3.7 billion.CEO Elon Musk provided an optimistic outlook, expecting the company to produce around 1.8 million cars in 2023, 29% higher than the 1.37 million cars produced in 2022.In addition, the Cybertruck remains on track to begin production this year at its Gigafactory in Texas, adding to total production volumes.At Tesla\u2019s recent investor day, CEO Elon Musk announced a retail electricity plan to people living in Texas and owning Tesla vehicles.\u00a0In this plan, customers will be offered unlimited overnight home charging for US$30 per month.CEO Elon Musk also announced his next master plan, sharing his vision of a total switch to electric vehicles and US$10 trillion in global spending to develop sustainable energy worldwide.Tesla has also tied up with General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motors (NYSE: F), providing access for GM and Ford\u2019s car owners to its charging network.Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA)Nvidia\u2019s share price is up more than 186% year to date.Nvidia\u2019s revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (1Q FY2024) ending 30 April decreased 13% year on year from US$8.3 billion to US$7.2 billion.\u00a0However, revenue increased 19% from $6.1 billion in 4Q FY2023.All of Nvidia\u2019s four revenue segments, namely, Gaming, Professional Visualisation and Automotive and Embedded Systems, achieved quarter-on-quarter revenue growth.In spite of strong sequential revenue growth of 22% and 31% respectively, the Gaming and Professional Visualisation segments still have much to catch up on as these segments recorded a 38% and 53% year-on-year decrease in revenue, respectively.Earnings per share for 1Q FY2024 stood at US$0.82, up 28% year on year and up 44% quarter on quarter.\u00a0The most mind-blowing part of Nvidia\u2019s announcement was its 2Q 2024 outlook. Nvidia has guided for revenue to be about US$11 billion. The forecast is underpinned by progress across all four segments.Some noteworthy progress shared by Nvidia is the use of its Graphics Processing Unit by Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services to accelerate AI applications and offer new products and services.Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META)Meta Platform\u2019s share price is up more than 117% year to date.The company\u2019s family of apps consists of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp and recorded a year on year increase in active users from 2.87 billion daily active people in 1Q 2022 to 3.02 billion daily active users for 1Q 2023.Meta\u2019s operating margin increased from 20% in 4Q 2022 to 25% in 1Q 2023 marking the first quarter since 1Q 2021 with a meaningful increase.\u00a0Before 1Q 2023, Meta\u2019s operating margin was on a declining trend almost every quarter since 2Q 2021, bottoming at 20% for 4Q 2022.The improvement in operating margin is attributed to Meta\u2019s Cost of Revenue.\u00a0Meta\u2019s cost of revenue for 1Q 2023 accounted for 21% of revenue, one percentage point lower as compared to 1Q 2022\u2019s cost of revenue and five percentage points lower than 4Q 2022\u2019s.\u00a0Meta also controlled its General & Administrative (G&A) costs well.\u00a0G&A costs as a percentage of revenue declined year on year from 12% of revenue in 1Q 2022 to 11% of revenue in 1Q 2023. G&A costs as a percentage of revenue also declined sequentially from 14% of revenue in 4Q 2022 to 11% of revenue in 1Q 2023.Meta achieved G&A costs reduction by implementing several restructuring measures such as the laying off of approximately 11,000 employees and reducing its lease footprint.As the first wave of layoffs were carried out in November 2022, Meta\u2019s financials in 1Q 2023 was the first quarter to reflect the full effect of these cost saving measures.\u00a0In its 4Q 2022 earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared that Meta considers 2023 to be its \u201cYear of Efficiency\u201d and management will focus on making the company a stronger and more nimble organisation.Meta may record even more cost reductions for 2Q 2023. In April 2023, Meta announced a second round of layoffs and a third round of layoffs is being planned for the end of May.It\u2019s hard to ignore the incredible progress that AI technology has made in recent years.

(Image Australian Story: Kate Wilson)Share optionsFacebookLinkedInX\u00a0(formerly\u00a0Twitter)TranscriptINTRODUCTION, PRESENTER LEIGH SALES: Hey. Jamie and Mick are two blokes who\u2019ve been friends since childhood.\u202fAnd they met at music camp and share a love of tech and computer programming.\u202f They\u2019re also both blind.\u202fWhat\u2019s come out of their friendship is something extraordinary that\u2019s transformed the lives of many people around the world.\u202f\u00a0MICK CURRAN: Over my life I have had many, many members of the public come up to me and tell me straight to my face that they could not imagine being blind.\u00a0\u00a0Airport sounds: Ding, dong announcer.\u00a0JAMIE TEH: Most of the time I feel like blindness is just part of my life and I get on with it. I have a full-time job, I'm a software engineer, I have two kids, I have a wife. But there are days when - I'll be really honest - there are days when it's a real struggle and I want to scream at the universe and ask, you know, why this had to happen.\u00a0(Check-in staff member)\u00a0We\u2019re just coming up to the check-in counter now, we\u2019ve got Tristan who will be helping you. now.\u00a0MICK CURRAN: An airport terminal for a blind person is a very interesting place because it is so large, it\u2019s very hard to get a good sense of where you are within this gigantic space.\u00a0Bang .. clank ..\u00a0MICK CURRAN: There's just so much noise from all the travellers and people and suitcases around you echoing off the floor and the walls. It's sometimes just feels like walking through, through space.\u00a0(Second check-in staff member)\u00a0\u00a0The other one is from Auckland to Samoa, all good.\u00a0JAMIE TEH: We're heading to Samoa to meet the people at the Samoa Blind Peoples Association to learn more about how we can work together to ensure good access to technology.\u00a0BEN CLARE, DISABILITY ADVOCATE: Mick and Jamie developed software that has enabled blind people worldwide to access education. It's really that simple and that amazing.\u00a0\u00a0ARI HAZELMAN, SAMOA BLIND PERSONS\u2019 ASSOCIATION: The fact that they themselves were blind is an inspiration for us who are blind. We can strive more to improve our communities.\u00a0(Ari to Jamie at caf\u00e9)\u00a0You have the drinks menu, you can drink what you want.\u00a0MICK CURRAN: I think that blind people have the capacity to help our own kind. I don't think we always do need to rely on sighted people. Blind people, if they get together and be role models for each other, I think great things can come of that.\u00a0STORY TITLE: BLIND LEADING THE BLIND\u00a0(Jamie at laptop to Mick)\u00a0\u00a0So if I wanted to do \u2018dodododo\u2019...\u00a0\u00a0JEN TEH, JAMIE\u2019S WIFE: The awesome thing about Jamie and Mick's friendship is that it spans basically a lifetime.\u00a0(Jamie at laptop to Mick)\u00a0\u00a0Separately it\u2019s too hard otherwise I'd have to edit every single note \u2026\u00a0JEN TEH, JAMIE\u2019S WIFE: They are always just so happy to catch up and play music and nerd out on different things.\u00a0\u00a0(Pair laughs)\u00a0MICK CURRAN: I think it was music that brought Jamie and I together. But it was also the love of technology.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jamie: I\u2019m calling it, have another take ...\u00a0JAMIE TEH: Technology, perhaps more than anything else in the world, levels the playing field for people with disabilities. So many things become possible that weren't possible before.\u00a0(Synthetic computer voice): Action strikes. Action keys.\u00a0\u00a0Jamie: Actions strikes.\u00a0MICK CURRAN: My overall dream is that I can pick up a computer and use it as soon as I get home.\u00a0\u00a0(Synthetic computer voice)\u00a0MICK CURRAN: And so, we design software that we've made free, which allows blind and vision impaired people to access computers.\u00a0(Jamie at laptop): Here\u2019s the cool thing \u2026\u00a0JEN TEH, JAMIE\u2019S WIFE: It was absolutely life-changing, because it meant that people could suddenly access everything that the internet has to offer, for free.\u00a0MICK CURRAN: I think Jamie and I are probably both very fortunate people. We had wonderful opportunities to go out and make a mark on the world.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DEBBIE CURRAN, MICK\u2019S MOTHER: I had a pretty normal pregnancy with Mick. But when he was born, they took him from me after a quick cuddle to the Royal Children's Hospital.\u00a0DEBBIE CURRAN, MICK\u2019S MOTHER: We were told he was born with only one eye, and that wasn't formed properly. He couldn't eat and they had to suction out saliva because his oesophagus wasn't joined. A surgeon said, \u2018I really would love to operate on him straight away. We\u2019ll try and fix this\u2019. So of course I said, \u2018Yes\u2019.\u00a0And that was a massive operation to go in. Michael cried a lot because I think he was in a lot more pain than we knew then. But he was resilient.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0JAMIE TEH: I was born in Brisbane to a pretty ordinary family. My mum is, you know, Australian. My dad is Malaysian-Chinese.\u00a0SHARON TEH, JAMIE\u2019S MOTHER: Jamie was our third child. He was born fine except I was noticing that he just wasn't focusing on me.\u00a0TERRY TEH, JAMIE\u2019S FATHER: We took Jamie to the ophthalmologist and he said, 'He\u2019s got a problem with his eyes\u2019. And I remember saying to him, \u2018Can't you fix his cross eyes?\u2019 And he then said to me, \u2018It could be worse than that, Terry\u2019. And I said, \u2018What could be worse? Is he blind?\u2019. And he said, \u2018It might even be worse\u2019. And that's when he told us that he had bad tumours in both eyes. Apparently, the cancer was so aggressive that he could have died within a few weeks.\u00a0SHARON TEH, JAMIE\u2019S MOTHER: Then we were told, you know, it's either enucleate both the eyes, which means to get take the eyes out or he said we can do radiation. But he said, \u2018If it starts up, it's only got like about a half an inch or an inch before it's in the brain\u2019. And he said, once it hits the brain, they're dead.\u00a0I thought for the sake of saving his life, it had to be his eyes, because I wanted him alive no matter what. I didn't care what he was as long as he was alive, so, and I think Terry was the same, weren\u2019t you? And I was sobbing, and Jamie started laughing in the cot, he was giggling his head off because he could hear me with this funny sound sort of thing. And I went and picked him up and I thought \u2018Well, darling, if you can laugh, then we'll laugh too\u2019. So that's how we sort of got on with it.\u00a0DEBBIE CURRAN, MICK\u2019S MOTHER: Before Michael turned five he probably had about seven major operations, stomach and chest.\u00a0CHRIS CURRAN, MICK\u2019S BROTHER: He had he had some sight. It wasn't very good. It was very, very blurry and I guess very early on we weren\u2019t too sure about how much he could see.\u00a0MICK CURRAN: I may have been, I think, the youngest child in Victoria to have a cornea transplant. Pretty exciting for me as a four-and-a-half-year-old to, to have that little bit of fame.\u00a0(Home video)\u00a0My name\u2019s Michael Curran. I\u2019m 7 and this is the lounge room, and you can see all these pictures of me in the magazine.\u00a0CHRIS CURRAN, MICK\u2019S BROTHER: The transplant improved his sight dramatically.\u00a0\u00a0(Home video)\u00a0\u00a0My glasses ...\u00a0CHRIS CURRAN, MICK\u2019S BROTHER: He could read, albeit very big letters, but all being very, very close to something. He could sit and watch television very, very close, right up against the TV. He had an absolute new lease on life.\u00a0(Home video)\u00a0\u00a0And that\u2019s the usual way of going down the steps.\u00a0I\u2019ve practiced this song for weeks and weeks.\u00a0MICK CURRAN: Generally, my parents didn't protect me, didn't wrap me up in cotton wool.\u00a0\u00a0(Home video)\u00a0\u00a0OK Dad, over here.\u00a0They let me play and explore and live like a regular child.\u00a0(Home video)\u00a0\u00a0Hang on, I\u2019ll do one more because I\u2019m good at this.\u00a0JAMIE TEH: I was only three months old when I had my first eye removed, and then my second eye was removed at six months. You know, I would trip over things or run into things. My parents were very sympathetic, but they also made it very clear to me that this was also the world that I lived in.\u00a0I have two artificial eyes, so, both of my eyes are removable. Initially, the eyes that they gave me, they were quite heavy and unwieldy. And apparently I used to just force them out of my head because I didn't like them.\u00a0SHARON TEH, JAMIE\u2019S MOTHER: He would invariably take them out when we were in the shop. One day I\u2019m in the glass area and I looked at him. No eyes. And I thought, \u2018Oh Jamie, where are they?\u2019 I looked everywhere for them, and this girl came out to me and she said, \u2018Can I help you if you lost something?\u2019. I said, \u2018Well, how do I tell I'm looking for a pair of eyes?\u2019. I can't do that.\u00a0TERRY TEH, JAMIE\u2019S FATHER: He was in about grade four and we had bought a second-hand computer. Jamie said to me that he wanted to learn how to do basic programming, so I bought an old book for programming.\u00a0So, over a period of a week or so, I read to him the whole book. And there were 100 questions in the whole book. Jaime got three wrong out of the hundred. I thought, \u2018God this guy is really, really so smart\u2019.\u00a0DEBBIE CURRAN, MICK\u2019S MOTHER: When Michael was 15, he was very independent. He was in high school, he was doing well. But the ophthalmologist was saying, \u2018Yeah, it looks like you're not seeing as well, maybe we could try and do another corneal transplant\u2019. That got Mick's attention and he's like, \u2018Well, yeah, I've had so many operations. I've had, you know, cornea transplant before, that worked, yeah, yeah, let's let's go for it!\u2019.\u00a0MICK CURRAN: They were honest and told me that there was probably a 70 per cent chance of success. As a teenage boy I heard 100 per cent. I did not process that at all as a risk. I think in my mind I was thinking perhaps I might even be almost fully sighted.\u00a0I remember seeing my parents for the last time and what I think what they were wearing and went in to have the surgery.\u00a0DEBBIE CURRAN, MICK\u2019S MOTHER: They came out quite quickly, and just said, \u2018I'm very, very sorry. We've got bad news, as soon as we operated his retina\u2019s haemorrhaged. There's just nothing we can do\u2019. The first thing Michael said to me was, \u2018Did they put a lens in?\u2019. And I said, this is one of the hardest things I think I've ever had to do. I said, \u2018No, they didn\u2019t put a lens in\u2019. I said, \u2018You've got no vision that that's it\u2019. And he just was silent.\u00a0MICK CURRAN: I guess I felt just completely numb and disconnected. I don't think I was processing it emotionally. And in fact, if I ever saw someone else processing it emotionally, that was really hard for me to deal with because it's like all the scaffolding around me that's holding me up is suddenly starting to fall.\u00a0\u00a0DEBBIE CURRAN, MICK\u2019S MOTHER: He said, \u2018You have to stop crying\u2019, You know. Like, \u2018Get over it. This is what it is. And we're moving on\u2019, basically. And when we heard that, it was like a light bulb went on and things lifted from my shoulders, that for him to say that to say that to us meant he was moving on.\u00a0\u00a0Mick plays piano.\u00a0MICK CURRAN: I think what brought me out of my depression was identifying and throwing myself into skills that I already had and enjoyed doing.\u00a0\u00a0Mick plays piano.\u00a0So, when I was 16, I decided to go back to music camp. And that\u2019s where I ran into Jamie.\u00a0JAMIE TEH: Mick and I first met at the Braille Music camp in 1994. I was nine and Mick was 10.\u00a0MICK CURRAN: We got along very good right from the beginning. And it was just sort of... sort of amazing to go back there and with Jamie and I it was like we'd never, never left each other.\u00a0Jamie: You didn't have any vision any more at that point.\u00a0\u00a0Mick: Yes.\u00a0Jamie: So, you were ... it was a different experience.\u00a0\u00a0Mick: A very different experience. I mean, because back in \u201894, my very first camp, you know, I was, I was guiding you around a great deal. And then suddenly I come back to music camp and Jamie was guiding me!\u00a0Jamie: There's a blind leading the blind joke in there somewhere [hahaha]\u00a0JAMIE TEH: We both had this clear fascination with technology.\u00a0\u00a0MICK CURRAN: For a blind person to use a computer you need a screen reader, which is essentially software which reads the text on the computer screen in synthetic speech.\u00a0Synthetic screen reader: Case. Case. SR. ERDR. Screen reading program translates the written text displayed on the screen for the voice.\u202f\u00a0MICK CURRAN: That screen reading software costs a lot of money. It was between $1,000 and $2,000.\u00a0Synthetic screen reader: Like websites or applications like audio ...\u202f\u00a0DEBBIE CURRAN, MICK\u2019S MOTHER: We couldn't afford to just get it. And unless we had some help from his grandparents, on occasion, for things, we had to go through charities and stuff.\u00a0\u00a0MICK CURRAN: You know, why should a blind person have to pay an extra thousand dollars in order to use a computer to the same extent as a sighted person? It was in the back of our minds, especially my mind, that, you know, wouldn't it be cool if we could have a free screen reader that all blind people could use?\u00a0JAMIE TEH: When the camp ended, we were able to stay in contact and our lives continued to move on in parallel. We both went to university, both studied computing. We both met our partners during or shortly after university.\u00a0JEN TEH, JAMIE\u2019S WIFE: So, Jamie and I met at this party. We sat and we chatted for hours. And then eventually at one point I turned to my friend on the other side of me and went, \u2018Oh, I think he might be blind\u2019. And she went, \u2018Yeah, do you think so?\u2019.\u00a0(Home video)\u00a0I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re 21 Mick. I\u2019m very excited about you gaining this independence, moving out ...\u00a0AMY CURRAN, MICK\u2019S WIFE: I first met Mick at the Young Blind Citizens Victoria. We were both coming into our late teens and quite involved in the blindness community.\u00a0\u00a0HOME VIDEO, MICK\u2019S WEDDING: Mick singing \u2026\u00a0Take my hand...\u00a0MICK CURRAN: Amy is also vision impaired, but not totally blind. And we would have wonderful, deep conversations about how we were going to change the world and make it better for blind children and things like that.\u00a0HOME VIDEO, MICK\u2019S WEDDING: Amy, wear this ring. With all my love. With all ...\u00a0MICK CURRAN: We decided to get married and to start having children as well.\u00a0HOME VIDEO, MICK & AMY & BABY HANNAH: She\u2019s coming. Keep going Hannah, you walk to Dada. Good girl.\u00a0JEN TEH, JAMIE\u2019S WIFE: It was actually holding their youngest as a little tiny newborn baby that made me think, \u2018Oh, actually, I think I think we need to have one of these\u2019.\u00a0(HOME VIDEO, JAMIE AND CHILDREN)\u00a0Jamie: Keep turning, keep turning.\u00a0Amy: Watch out for Leo!\u00a0JEN TEH, JAMIE\u2019S WIFE: And, so, as it turns out, we ended up moving within five minutes of each other, having been in different parts of the country for so long. Suddenly Jamie and Mick were just up the road dads at the same school.\u00a0JAMIE TEH: After university I went to work full-time in a computer programming job. Mick was volunteering on blindness advocacy.\u00a0MICK CURRAN: I was on a blind pension. I wanted to try my hand at writing free screen reading software. I named the software NVDA, which stands for Non-Visual Desktop Access.\u00a0Very early on I decided to make it open-source, which essentially means that anyone can look at all the computer code if they want to, and they can contribute to the project if they have the expertise on how to. Jamie was watching from the sidelines. But slowly he started taking some more interest.\u00a0JAMIE TEH: I was working on NVDA in my lunch breaks, contributing things here and there. Mick would be like, are you getting any work done at all?\u00a0AMY CURRAN, MICK\u2019S WIFE: It sort of got to a point where we were actually recognised by the Mozilla Foundation who said, you know we want this to take off, we want to support your screen-reader project. You know, what can we do to help you? And Mick was without hesitating, just said, \u2018I need to hire Jamie\u2019.\u00a0HOME VIDEO: The night before the actual board, the first board meeting of NV Access limited.\u00a0AMY CURRAN, MICK\u2019S WIFE: He knew that if he could get Jamie on board full-time, then it would actually get somewhere a lot faster.\u00a0HOME VIDEO: This is the board hard at work.\u00a0MICK CURRAN: And, so, it was around that time we created NV Access, which is a not-for-profit company now a registered Australian charity\u00a0HOME VIDEO: We work hard we play hard hahaha\u2026\u00a0\u00a0MICK CURRAN: to support and protect the NVDA product.\u00a0JAMIE TEH: So, what I'm doing here is I'm using NVDA on my Windows computer to fix a bug in some code and searching for things to try to find what I need.\u00a0What you can hear is NVDA speaking very, very fast at about 900 words a minute, reading the information on the screen to me, not the whole screen at once, but the information that's relevant at the time.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not necessarily listening to every word. It's almost like when you read a document or when you're skimming your email as a sighted person, you're not necessarily reading every single word. And that's kind of how it is.\u00a0\u00a0So, it\u2019s saying, \u2018Perhaps this doesn't get\u2019..sorry. \u2018Perhaps this doesn't cause re-flow so we don't get notified the bounds might have changed. Though this needs to be verified. This also applies to animating position properties\u2019. And then there's a bunch of code.\u00a0(The New Inventors)\u00a0James O\u2019Loughlin: Please welcome from Brisbane, James Teh \u2026\u00a0JAMIE TEH: We spent the first few years of work on the project just you know grinding away to get it from an idea to something that people were actually using.\u00a0(The New Inventors)\u00a0\u00a0Synthetic computer voice: The New Inventors is all about inventions and inventors ...\u00a0MICK CURRAN: It wasn't really I guess until we started receiving emails from, from people overseas, you know, whether it be from Brazil or Slovakia asking whether they could you know translate it and use it in their country. And I think that's what really made us start to realise just how important this project was and, you know, was going to be.\u00a0Jamie Teh, Ted talk: NVDA is now being relied upon by tens of thousands of blind people across the world and surveys suggest it is now the second most used screen reader in the world...\u00a0(Car trip conversation)\u00a0Jamie: Do you have the device.\u00a0Mick: Yes, the dot pad device.\u00a0JEN TEH, JAMIE\u2019S WIFE: When they first started out, it was real bootstrap operations. One of the major funders has been Mozilla and Microsoft have also contributed. But also, donations from individuals, from small businesses, from other companies and other grants like that.\u00a0\u00a0James Boreham: We\u2019re going straight ahead.\u00a0BEN CLARE, DISABILITY ADVOCATE: It is the only screen reader in the world that's made by blind people for blind people and has really opened doors for people with vision impairment.\u00a0James Boreham: Three steps up, ready to go.\u00a0Jamie: Yep, perfect.\u00a0MICK CURRAN: There's a constant stream of inquiries as to how companies can work with us.\u00a0Jamie tests new product: Ah \u2026 a, b, c, d, f, k\u202f\u00a0KI KWAN SUNG, BUSINESSMAN: My name is Ki. I'm from Dot Inc. So we're making smart devices for the visually impaired. like a dot pad.\u00a0Jamie tests new product: It\u2019s really fascinating, yeah.\u00a0JAMES BOREHAM, NV ACCESS: Dot Inc are from South Korea. They\u2019ve engaged us to make sure that we can get a working functional graphic braille display that can be used widely within the world to help out in education.\u00a0Ki Kwan Sung: Numbers here?\u00a0Mick: Yes, there\u2019s numbers.\u00a0MICK CURRAN: It has some great potential for blind people on how they access graphical materials. But there's still a long way to go.\u00a0Ki Kwan Sung: Is it, been good, right?\u00a0\u00a0Mick: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm happy. (Laugh)\u00a0\u00a0JAMIE TEH: In the last couple of months, an opportunity has come up for Mick and I to visit Samoa. We really don't know very much about how blind people in Samoa live. The little that we do know is that they are getting into learning braille and trying to make sure that blind people can be included in education.\u00a0Ari chats with Mick and Jamie: Working together, NVDA plus this machine...\u00a0ARI HAZELMAN, SAMOAN BLIND PERSONS\u2019 ASSOCIATION: Everyone at the Samoa Blind Persons\u2019 Association knows about Jamie and Mick's story. So, it was a very great honour for us just to host them.\u00a0Jamie speaks with Ari: So Ari, how long have you been using NVDA here to produce documents?\u00a0MICK CURRAN: It is run entirely by blind people, so it's by blind people for blind people. And that's pretty much the same kind of thing that Jamie and I have always strived for.\u00a0Jamie speaks with Ari: So you edit in Word?\u202f\u00a0Ari: Yep, edit in word using NVDA.\u00a0\u00a0Jamie: Nice.\u202f\u00a0ARI HAZELMAN, SAMOAN BLIND PERSONS\u2019 ASSOCIATION: We were able to demonstrate to them our work using NVDA to edit documents and translate them into braille and run them through the braille printer. Things like notes for students in school, menus right up to, you know, high level documents that are produced by the United Nations.\u00a0Ari to Jamie and Mick: And that\u2019s why NVDA is very essential.\u00a0ARI HAZELMAN, SAMOAN BLIND PERSONS\u2019 ASSOCIATION: This is the house of young Harry Harima. Unfortunately, he left school for some personal reasons in July of last year. He's hoping to go back to school this year. So we've delivered to him his basic science and also Samoan language notes.\u00a0MICK CURRAN: I can really appreciate just how hard it is for someone like Harry. When I lost my vision as a 15-year-old, I really locked myself away from the world. I required help from various people, including blindness services. But as a teenager, I really didn't want any of that. I was struggling so much with just losing my vision. And, so, any help that people can provide teenagers like Harry in regards to making school that little bit easier, less barriers is a great thing, and will really help.\u00a0ISAAKO TUATO, SAMOA BLIND PERSONS\u2019 ASSOCIATION: He's so smart and he is the future of this organisation. And that's why we try very hard to keep working together with him.\u00a0ARI HAZELMAN, SAMOA BLIND PERSONS\u2019 ASSOCIATION: He says that he wants to. He says that he wants to work for the Samoan Blind Persons\u2019.\u00a0\u00a0Association. Isaya - why? \u2013 Isaya?\u00a0Harry Harima responds in Samoan: [That\u2019s the only job that I know]\u00a0JAMIE TEH: We know about the impact of our work, but we don't always get to see it firsthand. We don't get to see the impact that it has. They've made some great strides forward. But I think Samoa is very much at the start of their journey in terms of integrating technology for blind people.\u00a0You guys ready, ready to order? No, we haven\u2019t \u2026\u00a0MICK CURRAN: We need to make sure that there\u2019s more technology going into Samoa, such as laptops, and that will require partnerships I think with other on the ground organisations.\u00a0\u00a0ARI HAZELMAN, SAMOAN BLIND PERSONS\u2019 ASSOCIATION: There's a fair bit of work for us to try and do. But I think Jamie and Mick being here and just having that initial conversation would lead to good things in the future.\u00a0FAMILY DINNER AT MICK\u2019S: We\u2019ve got the pizzas here, one on the left and one on the right.\u00a0DEBBIE CURRAN, MICK\u2019S MOTHER: Over the years, many people, including his family. Have said, you know, there could be opportunity to sell this or do something to make some money out of it. And he's like. \u2018No, no. No, this. Is not what. I wanted this for\u2019.\u00a0\u00a0MICK CURRAN: There needs to be a free, open-source screen reader for blind people around the world and we are never, ever going to sacrifice that.\u00a0\u00a0You lay on your back, and you grab your legs and you go...\u00a0MICK CURRAN: NVDA has been my, you know, apart from my own children, has been my baby.\u00a0I don\u2019t think so. I used to be able to...\u00a0MICK CURRAN: Jamie as well, of course.\u00a0JAMIE TEH: I stepped away to look at other opportunities. I'm still on the board, though, and very much involved in steering the project and contributing where I can.\u00a0Jamie places cutlery: I guess I\u2019ll sit here then.\u00a0SHARON TEH, JAMIE\u2019S MOTHER: Terry used to worry that Jamie would be the one that wouldn't get married and that he wouldn't have a job. And I used to say you might find that he\u2019ll do better than the rest of them, which he\u2019s proved to do! So we are proud of him.\u00a0CHRIS CURRAN, MICK\u2019S BROTHER: Watching this over the last however many years. It just completely blows my mind, but it doesn't surprise me. No matter what obstacle is thrown in along the way he's going to get over it, that's just what Mick does and that's what he's always done.\u00a0Mick at dinner: We just know what each other\u2019s thinking..\u00a0MICK CURRAN: I'm very proud that I can give back or give, I should say, give forward, the gift that I had been given of firstly life, to be honest, and the chance to succeed.\u00a0Jen: We\u2019ll have to catch up with them at some point.\u00a0Mick: Yeah, he only lives five minutes down the street!\u00a0END CAPTIONS:\u00a0\u00a0Harry Harima has since returned to school, with ongoing support from the Samoan Blind Persons\u2019 Association.\u00a0Mick and Jamie\u2019s screen reader is now used by 275,000 people in 175 countries.\u00a0* This is an Audio Description (AD) version of this episode Watch the episode without AD here\u00a0Introduced by presenter Leigh SalesMick Curran and Jamie Teh are lifelong friends who share a love of music and technology. They're also blind.Both computer programmers, the pair saw an injustice they wanted to fix: vision-impaired people have to buy expensive screen-reading software to access computers and the online world.Their screen-reader is now used across 175 countries and has been translated into 50 languages.And despite the potential to cash in on their innovation, they've\u00a0kept it free for\u00a0all.Related linksStream Blind Leading the Blind on ABC iview (AD-enabled option available)Watch Blind Leading the Blind on YouTube\u00a0| AD-enabled version available\u00a0Feature article |\u00a0How friendship between NVDA founders Mick Curran and Jamie Teh is changing lives for thousands of blind peopleAustraliaHuman InterestEyesStories from ABC NewsSevere storms to continue into new year in QueenslandTopic:WeatherPhoto shows New Year's Weather: Dark grey storm clouds over a green forested area, with a rain storm on the horizon.Has Video Duration: 3 minutes 46 seconds.3m 46sGunman on the run after shots fired at police during pursuitTopic:PolicePhoto shows Shots fired in police chase: Tactical police officers, some rolling suitcases, surround a tactical vehicle in a car park.Has Video Duration: 3 minutes 22 seconds.3m 22sMillions of Australians prepare to celebrate New Year's EveTopic:Carnivals and FestivalsPhoto shows Final Preparations: Pink hued fireworks burst from the Sydney Harbour Bridge.Has Video Duration: 2 minutes 49 seconds.2m 49sAid agencies deliver supplies to Gaza's struggling medical facilitiesTopic:Unrest, Conflict and WarPhoto shows Aid delivered to Gaza: Five men wearing blue stand in a circle.

For instance, QQQ ETF, which has the Nasdaq-100 index (NDX) as its benchmark, gained more than 32% year-to-date, reflecting a swift recovery in the share prices of its top five holdings.\u00a0\nIts\u00a0top five holdings\u00a0include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Meta Platforms\u2019 (NASDAQ:META). The image below shows the weightage and performance of QQQ\u2019s top holdings so far this year.\n\nIs QQQ a Good ETF to Invest In?\nThanks to the uptrend in its top holdings, QQQ ETF has exceeded the broader markets with its returns. Despite the recent gains, it has an\u00a0Outperform Smart Score of eight, implying it could deliver market-beating returns in the future.\u00a0\nPer the recommendations of 1,730 analysts giving stock forecasts for the holdings of QQQ, the 12-month average price target of $376.21 implies 6.88% upside potential from current levels. Also, the ETF has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on TipRanks.\u00a0\nAmong the Wall Street analysts providing ratings on its holdings, 67.17% have given a Buy rating, 28.96% have assigned a Hold rating, and 3.87% have given a Sell rating.\n\t\t\n\n\n\nOverall, QQQ provides exposure to the top technology stocks. Thanks to the diversification, the ETF is less risky and has consistently outperformed the broader markets with its returns in the past decade. Also, its low expense ratio supports the bull case.\u00a0\nDisclosure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\n\n\n FACEBOOK\n\n\n\n\n TWITTER\n\n\n\n\n EMAIL\n\n\n\n\n COPY LINK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApple NewsMORE  \n\n\n\n\n\nNotable open interest changes for March 18thTipRanks 7h \n\n\n\nAnalysts\u2019 Top Technology Picks: ServiceNow (NOW), Apple (AAPL)TipRanks 9h \n\n\n\nApple price target raised to $275 from $260 at Evercore ISITipRanks 10h \n\n\n\nTurkey plans to launch new regulations on big tech firms, Bloomberg reportsTipRanks 10h \n\n\n\nAnalysts\u2019 Opinions Are Mixed on These Technology Stocks: Apple (AAPL) and Robinhood Markets (HOOD)TipRanks 13h \n\n\n\nBoeing (NYSE:BA) Makes a Greater Push on AsiaTipRanks 1d \n\n\n\nPepsiCo to acquire poppi, Guess receives WHP offer: Morning BuzzTipRanks 1d \n\n\n\nApple Faces Embarrassing AI Setback as Siri Struggles to Catch UpTipRanks 1d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tStart Trading Futures\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n\n\n\n\nAMZN\n\n\n\n193.51\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-2.23 (-1.14%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t03:19:06 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time AMZN charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAAPL\n\n\n\n212.38\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-1.62 (-0.76%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t03:19:07 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time AAPL charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMETA\n\n\n\n583.40\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-21.50 (-3.55%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t03:18:59 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time META charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSFT\n\n\n\n383.45\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-5.25 (-1.35%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t03:19:05 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time MSFT charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA\n\n\n\n116.78\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-2.75 (-2.30%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t03:19:07 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time NVDA charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMORE \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFind News\n\t\t\t\tNews\n\n\n\n\n\nGO\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n            See also:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                - Explore more categories\n            \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

Nvidia, a leading manufacturer of graphics processing units (GPUs), is believed to have a virtual monopoly in the A.I. computing market. But Elon Musk, a co-founder of ChatGPT creator OpenAI, believes Nvidia\u2019s dominance won\u2019t last as newer types of chips arrive in the market.\n\u201cMany other NN accelerator chips are also under development. Nvidia will not have a monopoly on large-scale training and inference forever,\u201d Musk tweeted yesterday (June 7) in response to a post by Adam D\u2019Angelo, CEO of Quora, a social platform for questions and answers.\nThe \u201cNN accelerator\u201d Musk mentioned stands for \u201cneural network accelerators,\u201d also known as A.I. accelerators. They are processors designed specifically to handle neural network workloads. In comparison, GPUs are used for more general A.I. models.\nAs its name implies, a GPU is originally designed to generate graphics on computer screens. Nvidia first applied GPUs in video gaming in the 1990s, and these chips were later used to mine cryptocurrencies and train A.I. algorithms.\nIt\u2019s estimated Nvidia owns 95 percent of the GPU market. Its A100 and H100 GPUs are in hot demand but supply has been tight.\nIn his Twitter conversation with Musk yesterday, Quora CEO D\u2019Angelo said the A.I. boom would have been even bigger if there was enough GPU supply. \u201cThis shortage is causing all kinds of limits on product rollouts and model training but these are not visible. Instead all we see is Nvidia spiking in price,\u201d he tweeted.\nIn its latest quarterly earnings release on May 24, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company was seeing \u201cincredible orders\u201d for A.I. chips. Nvidia expects to rake in $11 billion in revenue in the coming quarter ending July 31, which is over 50 percent higher than what analysts predicted.\n\nTrue. Also, many other NN accelerator chips are also under development.\nNvidia will not have a monopoly on large-scale training & inference forever.\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 7, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Filed Under:\nArtificial Intelligence, Business, Technology, Adam Dangelo, Jensen Huang, Elon Musk, Nvidia \n\n\n\n\nSEE ALSO:  Disney\u2019s Last Magic Trick: Who Will Take Bob Iger\u2019s Throne in 2026?\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARTS\n\nArt Fairs\nArt Market\nArt Reviews\nAuctions\nGalleries\nMuseums\n\n\nBUSINESS\n\nEnergy\nFinance\nMedia\nPolicy\nTechnology\nClimate\n\n\nENTERTAINMENT\n\nBooks\nDance\nMovies\nOpera\nTheater\nTV Shows\n\n\nLIFESTYLE\n\nAutos\nHotels\nNightlife & Dining\nRestaurants\nStyle\nTravel\n\n\nWEALTH\n\nBillionaires\nParties\nPhilanthropy\nReal Estate\n\n\nEXPERT INSIGHTS\n\nA.I.

Please see disclaimer.\nNvidia: Down 10% From Last Week's High, is Now a Good Time to Buy?Puja Tayal - Barchart - Wed Jun 7, 2023What AI assistants like Apple's (AAPL) Siri, Amazon's (AMZN) Alexa, and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Hey Google couldn\u2019t do, ChatGPT did: it set the long overdue artificial intelligence (AI) trend in motion. Be it cracking some of the toughest exams or seeking stock recommendations, people are flocking to get answers from ChatGPT. And investors are pouncing on anything that says \u2018generative AI\u2019 because OpenAI (the company that developed ChatGPT) doesn\u2019t trade on the stock exchange. So which stock have investors been flocking to ride ChatGPT frenzy?\u00a0Nvidia (NVDA).\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s jump to trillion-dollar \u00a0www.barchart.comOn May 24, Nvidia released its fiscal 2024 first-quarter earnings, and the stock made a vertical jump of 24% in one day,\u00a0entering the $1 trillion market cap. The stock jumped from $305 to over $419, exceeding its crypto bubble peak of $329.85 in November 2021. Even though Intel (INTC) stock jumped 14.7% and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) 17.3%, they are nowhere close to their tech bubble peak.\u00a0Behind Nvidia stock\u2019s 24% jump was the company\u2019s bullish revenue\u00a0outlook\u00a0of $11 billion in the second quarter, up 63% from $6.7 billion in Q2FY23. All this growth will be led by record demand for accelerated computing and generative AI. Nvidia\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang, in the fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, said, \u201cOur entire data center family of products \u2014 H100, Grace CPU, Grace Hopper Superchip, NVLink, Quantum 400 InfiniBand, and BlueField-3 DPU \u2014 is in production. We are significantly increasing our supply to meet surging demand for them.\u201d\u00a0These products are quite expensive. For instance, Nvidia H100 can sell for $40,000 on the secondary market. And Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the AI GPU space. While AMD and\u00a0Intel\u00a0also have data center GPUs, they are no match for Nvidia\u2019s performance. Plus, Nvidia has a history of meeting and beating its earnings guidance. It means the outlook is something to be bullish on.\u00a0Is Nvidia leading a tech bubble?\u00a0A bubble is the result of a speculative frenzy where asset prices soar to unsustainable levels, only to be followed by a rapid and significant fall. This cycle is driven by market behavior that ignores the intrinsic value of the assets and trades them at prices far beyond what they are actually worth.Year-to-date (YTD), NVDA is up more than 150%. This is significantly higher than any other large or mega-cap stocks performance YTD (the next highest being Meta Platforms (META) which is up 119%). DataTrek Research points out that without the gains in 2023 in Apple, Microsoft (MSFT) , Alphabet, and Nvdia, \"the S&P 500 would be down 0.7 percent YTD without the snapback in US large cap Tech from deeply oversold conditions at the end of last year.\"This sudden jump in tech stocks remotely related to generative AI has sparked a debate on Wall Street about a new tech bubble.\u00a0In an interview on CNBC, Economist David Rosenberg said, \u201cNo question that we have a price bubble,\u201d when discussing the moves in AI stocks. In a recent letter to clients Rosenberg said, \u201d\u201cThere are breadth measures for the S&P 500 that are the worst since 1999. Just seven mega-caps have accounted for 90% of this year\u2019s price performance.\u201d He continued,\u201cYou look at the tech weighting in the S&P 500 and it is up to 27%, where it was heading into 2000 as the dotcom bubble was peaking out and soon to roll over in spectacular fashion.\u201dHowever, economist Jeremy Siegel believes, \u201cIt\u2019s not a bubble yet.\u201d In regards to NVDA, he said that the company is a beneficiary of the AI boom, and was a \"real, good company\" with \"blowout\" earnings.The long-term outlook for NvidiaLet\u2019s forget the short-term bump and look at the broader picture. Nvidia is the company that created GPUs, and these GPUs gave data centers the computing power to perform AI tasks. When no hardware company was talking AI, Nvidia was building use-case scenarios for GPU computing. It first rode the PC gaming rally, then the crypto rally, and now it is riding the data center rally.\u00a0The AI data center is moving from retrieving data (in which central processing units (CPUs) excelled) to generating data using AI (in which Nvidia\u2019s GPUs excel). A good example is Google\u2019s A3 supercomputer which has eight Nvidia H100 GPUs for one high-end Intel Xeon CPU. That explains why Nvidia\u2019s data center revenue surged 14%, while that of AMD was flat, and Intel\u2019s fell 39% in the January to March 2023 quarter.Generative AI is just one of the applications. Nvidia also has offerings in Omniverse like autonomous driving and smart city where AI will work at the edge to perform tasks, but that\u2019s an opportunity biding its time.\u00a0Long story short, global data centers are upgrading from general-purpose to accelerated computing as everyone, from enterprises to cloud companies, chase the AI dream. And Nvidia has a full stack of AI infrastructure with a supporting operating system ready to be sold. Nvidia, in its 2022 Investor Day presentation, estimated its AI ecosystem to have a $1 trillion addressable market, with data center and automotive each estimated to be a $300 billion market.\u00a0Down 10% from all-time highs, is now a good time to scoop up NVDA?\u00a0My opinion is that as good as NVDA look in the long-term, now is not a good time buy shares of the stock. The stock looks expensive, with a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 195. I think that in the current economy, recessionary factors like rising interest rates and high inflation are drying up liquidity. Interest rates are unlikely to impact the expansion plans of large-cap tech stocks, but a recession could.\u00a0Therefore, if you own NVDA already and looking at holding it for the long-term, I believe you can continue holding a core position, but now is a good time to book profits in some of your shares. And if you don't own Nvidia yet and are looking for a good entry point to scoop up some shares, my suggestion is to wait and watch, as a correction is likely.\u00a0On the date of publication, Puja Tayal did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

All thanks to the artificial intelligence boom, which shows no signs of cooling. Better, the company just blew earnings out of the water. Q1 EPS of $1.09 beat expectations by 17 cents. Revenue of $7.19 billion beat by $670 million. It even saw record data center revenue of $4.28 billion.\u00a0But this is just the start. As AI changes everything about everything, it could create a potential $1.81 trillion market by 2030, according to Grand View Research.\u00a0That\u2019s not just great news for Nvidia moving forward. It\u2019s also great news for some of the top tech stocks benefiting from Nvidia\u2019s growth.\nNvidia\u2019s rise comes from its hold on the GPU market for gaming and professional uses. This also includes its growing data center business and emerging AI technology roles. These expanding sectors boost the company\u2019s stock value and total market worth. This shows the increasing need for its top-tier computing solutions.\nDue to the company\u2019s success, there are also other tech stocks following in Nvidia\u2019s footsteps. Let take a look at what those companies are.\n\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD)\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\nThe last time I mentioned Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), it traded at around $105 on May 19. At that time, it just announced it was working with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to take on\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s current dominance with artificial intelligence.\nIt\u2019s now up to $125.27 and has become one of the top tech stocks benefiting from Nvidia\u2019s growth, as well. Granted, AMD is a bit overbought after such a substantial move.\nDespite these concerns, there is optimism around AMD\u2019s future trajectory. My analysis indicates that this stock may still have significant upside. Given its robust product pipeline, strategic acquisitions, and a strong foothold in key growth markets like data centers and gaming, the stock could potentially reach the $200 per share mark.\nEven better, KeyBanc Capital Markets just reaffirmed its overweight rating on AMD, with a price target of $110 from $95. The firm noted, \u201cWhile cloud demand is slowing, the increasing mix of AI server projects is benefiting Nvidia and AMD,\u201d as quoted by Barrons.\n\nC3.AI (AI)\nSource: shutterstock.com/Allies Interactive\nOn April 4, I mentioned C3.AI (NYSE:AI) \u2013 another one of the top tech stocks benefiting from Nvidia. At the time, it traded around $26 a share. Today, it\u2019s up to $43.95, and running on Nvidia\u2019s growth. Adding to the bullish sentiment is that Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) reported recently that generated AI could raise global GDP by 7% over the next ten years.\nAdditionally, C3 raised its outlook while also stating that it beat previous guidance numbers. The company stated that says total revenue for its fourth fiscal quarter grew from $72.1 million to $72.4 million, exceeding the company\u2019s own guidance. C3 expects an adjusted operating loss of $23.7 million to $23.9 million, narrower than previous expectations of $24 million to $28 million. C3.AI also noted, \u201cOverall business environment for enterprise AI is more active than we have seen since the company\u2019s inception and seems to be accelerating\u201d in its press release.\nThe company also notes that adoption of AI in its key operating segments appears to be accelerating. It reported that more clients than ever are signaling interest in using the tech to improve their business processes, and this seems like a trend that\u2019s set to continue.\n\nROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF (THNQ)\nSource: Phonlamai Photo / Shutterstock.com\nAnother one of the top tech stocks benefiting from Nvidia is the\u00a0ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF\u00a0(NYSEARCA:THNQ). The last time we mentioned THNQ, it traded at $32 on May 24. Now, it\u2019s up to $34.25, and running hot thanks in large part to Nvidia. This ETF invests in companies that are leading the AI revolution. Included in THNQ are companies developing the technology and infrastructure enabling AI, as well as companies that apply AI in various verticals, from business processes to e-commerce and healthcare.\nWith an expense ratio of 0.75%, the THNQ ETF offers exposure to Nvidia, Twilio (NYSE:TWLO),\u00a0Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM),\u00a0Splunk\u00a0(NASDAQ:SPLK), Cloudflare\u00a0(NYSE:NET),\u00a0Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN),\u00a0Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and 62 other AI-related holdings.\nSince the start of the year, the THNQ ETF exploded seeing a year-to-date increase of 23%. Over three years the fund has also managed to beat the market, as it returned 8.04% while the average return for funds was around 5.47%. This is a promising sign that it could continue to outperform in the future, especially a more companies adopt AI technologies.\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTechnology\n\n\nGrowth Stocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2023/06/3-tech-stocks-ready-to-ride-nvidias-coattails-tech-stocks-benefiting-from-nvidia/.\n\u00a92025 InvestorPlace Media, LLC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored Headlines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMore from InvestorPlace\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHot Stocks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Top Stocks to Buy Under Trump Come From Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018BRAIN\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Luke Lango, InvestorPlace Senior Investment Analyst\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Danger that Could Derail Our Economy\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Jeff Remsburg, Contributing Editor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy Prediction Came True: Where to Find Opportunity Despite Market Unpredictability\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Eric Fry, Editor, Fry's Investment Report\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMost Popular\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 10, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBig Tech\u2019s Quantum War Has Begun \u2014 and One Tiny Stock Could Win It\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 5, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat to Make of the Weakening Economy and Trade War\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInvestors Applaud a Cool Inflation Print\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow to Escape the \u2018Tyranny of the Immediate\u2019 in Investing\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExpert Stock Picks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe System Flagging a Potential 50X Opportunity\u2026 Even in This Ugly Market\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAbout InvestorPlace\nProducts\nContact Us\nHelp\nCareers\nAdvertise With Us\nDisclosures & Disclaimers\nPrivacy Policy\nAd Choices\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\nCookie Policy\nCookie Preferences\nTerms of Use\nDMCA Policy\n All rights reserved.

Its stock went public in 1980, and it has since delivered a whopping return of 183,300% for investors. \nIn dollar terms, an investment of $1,000 in Apple stock at its IPO would be worth over $1.8 million today! But it wasn't the first stock to have changed investors' lives over the long term, and it certainly won't be the last. So where will the next generation of market leaders come from?\u00a0\nCompanies developing electric vehicles (EVs), artificial intelligence (AI), and cybersecurity could be the best candidates. With that in mind, here are four stocks that fit the bill, and they could soar to become among the world's most valuable by 2040.\u00a0\n1. Tesla\nEVs are at the core of Tesla's (TSLA -5.00%) business; they account for the overwhelming majority of its revenue, and the company leads the industry in production and sales. It expects to produce 1.8 million cars in 2023, and CEO Elon Musk estimates that number could top 20 million by 2030.\u00a0\n\nBut EVs are also at the heart of what could be Tesla's most valuable long-term opportunity: its fully autonomous self-driving software. It is currently in live beta mode and has tested it over 150 million miles of road in the real world, with Elon Musk predicting it could be released publicly this year. By installing the software, a Tesla owner will be able to enroll a car as an autonomous robo-taxi within a ride-hailing network, where it will earn money during the hours it's not required for personal use.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAn estimate by Cathie Wood's Ark Investment thinks this could be a $4 trillion revenue opportunity by 2027, and it forms the basis of the firm's prediction that Tesla stock could soar almost 10-fold to $2,000 by then. Since competition is ramping up in the EV space, Tesla's leadership position in self-driving software could insulate it from an inevitable slowdown in sales over the long term, which is an attribute few other car companies will be able to match.\u00a0\nTesla is valued at $681 billion today, so if Ark's prediction comes true, the company will easily be one of the most valuable in the world by 2027, let alone 2040.\u00a0\n2. Palo Alto Networks\nCybersecurity is quickly becoming one of the most crucial industries in the world. A broad range of estimates place the value of the sector's opportunity in the trillions of dollars; one calculation by research firm McKinsey & Company suggests organizations are already underinvested in cybersecurity by about $1.8 trillion. Palo Alto Networks (PANW -1.04%) is the world's most valuable cybersecurity company today with a market capitalization of $70 billion.\u00a0\nThe company claims to use AI to a greater extent than any of its competitors, and perhaps that's true given that it has the most comprehensive portfolio of cybersecurity products. It's working to embed AI into its three core segments: cloud security, network security, and security operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalo Alto's AI models already block 8.6 billion attacks on behalf of customers each day, the company says, which is a culmination of the learning achieved by ingesting 750 million data points every 24 hours. According to a survey conducted by global consulting firm PwC, one-quarter of top corporate executives think their businesses will be either highly or extremely vulnerable to cyber risks over the next five years. New advancements in AI could help plug complex vulnerabilities to give those CEOs more confidence, and that alone could usher in a new era of cybersecurity investment.\nPalo Alto stock just earned a place in the S&P 500 index, which validates its incredible rise to the top of its field over the last few years. Based on the growing need for cybersecurity, spending should easily run into the trillions of dollars by 2040, and this company is well-positioned to remain at the front of the pack.\u00a0\n3. Nvidia\nSince hitting a 52-week low of $108 just eight months ago, shares of Nvidia (NVDA -2.53%) have surged 262%. The company's dominant leadership position in the artificial intelligence space is at the core of that move, and it's really starting to transform its financial results.\nNvidia is a semiconductor company, and it makes the most powerful data-center chips in the industry for training AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT. It has a whopping 90% market share in that specific segment, and the company recently said there's $1 trillion worth of data center infrastructure that needs upgrading to support accelerated computing and AI. That's a seismic opportunity for Nvidia to have almost entirely to itself (for now).\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its recent financial report for the fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended April 30), Nvidia not only crushed Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines, but it also issued revised revenue guidance for the second quarter that was $4 billion higher than any prior estimates. But here's the kicker: This wave of AI-driven value creation might just be getting started.\u00a0\nArk Investment Management thinks the technology will create $90 trillion in enterprise value by 2030, and add $200 trillion to global economic output thanks to immense gains in productivity. Nvidia is already the sixth-largest company in the world, and that could be the floor because the sky's the limit when it comes to 2040.\u00a0\n4. Amazon\nAmazon (AMZN -1.25%) is the undisputed global leader in e-commerce and cloud computing services, but it also has a formidable presence in other industries like robotics, digital advertising, and -- of course -- artificial intelligence. Amazon is worth $1.2 trillion today, which makes it the fifth-largest company in the world, and I'm suggesting it will at least hold that position thanks to its operational diversity.\u00a0\nThe company generated $220 billion in online sales in 2022, but a peek behind the curtain of that operation reveals an even more exciting opportunity. It has over 520,000 autonomous robots zipping around its fulfillment centers, and thanks to technological advances, they are now 2.5 times more efficient than human workers at picking and packing products. Amazon doesn't sell its robots to third parties yet, but it's worthwhile noting that the industry could be worth $9 trillion by 2030 (according to Ark Invest). \n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the company's cloud segment, and it's the point of focus for investors because it's the primary source of the company's overall profitability. AWS offers a broader portfolio of solutions and generates more revenue than any of its competitors. Plus, it's one of Nvidia's oldest data-center customers, and it's rapidly becoming a key distributor of AI.\nAWS is set to launch its new EC2 P5 cloud instances, which will enable customers to seamlessly scale from 10,000 GPU chips to 20,000. The supercomputer-like performance will help them train larger language models than ever before, in addition to AI applications in general. \nI think Amazon has a clear pathway to a $5 trillion valuation over the next 10 years, which should solidify its place as one of the world's largest companies by 2040.\u00a0\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Getty Images\nThe crowded generative artificial intelligence race just saw another rising star: Inflection AI, a startup barely two years old, is suddenly worth $4 billion after a fundraising round this week and seems to have rounded up every power investor in the buzzing A.I. space. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company raised $1.3 billion yesterday (June 29) in a round led by Bill Gates, Eric Schmidt, Reid Hoffman, Microsoft (MSFT) and new investor Nvidia (NVDA), Forbes first reported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSign Up\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThank you for signing up!\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBy clicking submit, you agree to our <a href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime.\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSee all of our newsletters\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nInflection AI is cofounded and led by Mustafa Suleyman, a founding researcher of Google\u2019s DeepMind lab, and incubated by Greylock Partners, a venture capital firm owned by LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman.\nIts main product is a ChatGPT-like text generator called Pi, which launched in May. Pi is powered by Inflection\u2019s in-house technology that prioritizes human conversations with a high level of emotional intelligence, which allows it to conduct conversations in a more human-like way than its competing applications like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Bard, the company claims.\n\u201cWith Pi, we set out to create a personal AI that is as flexible as it is powerful, so millions of people can use it to make their lives more meaningful, more productive, and more fun,\u201d Hoffman said in a statement when unveiling Pi last month.\nThat approach, which focuses on improving certain aspects of generative A.I. rather than building overall more powerful chatbots, is an increasingly appealing value proposition among A.I. startups. For example, Anthropic, a San Francisco AI company founded in 2021, seeks to train language models that are \u201csafer and more aligned with human values,\u201d said its co-founder and president Daniela Amodei in a podcast recently.\nAnthropic was also recently valued at more than $4 billion.

However, it only paid a few hundred millions in annual income taxes during that period.Read moreAll the sports that are part of Saudi Arabia's sportswashing planGoogle has officially changed its mind about remote workHow many UBI trials do we need to prove giving away money works?AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementThe company reveals in its financial statements that it recognized income tax expense of $189 million, $77 million, and $174 million for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively. Its annual effective tax rate was 1.9%, 1.7%, and 5.9% for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.This is largely attributable to federal tax benefits the company receives for attracting immense foreign direct investment into the US tech market, as it spearheads the rise of AI as a force in global business.The Chips and Science Act passed last August to boost the US semiconductor supply chain with research and development means Nvidia receives a 25% tax credit for investments in semiconductor manufacturing. The law appropriates $52.7 billion over five years in the form of grants and loans to incentivize chip making in the US. The firm also enjoys tax benefits for attracting foreign direct investment inflows into the US AI market.Additionally, a large portion of the chip manufacturer\u2019s income comes from other jurisdictions such as Israel, Europe, China, and Taiwan. In 2019, 50% of Nvidia\u2019s profits came from Israel. That year, the company only paid 3.7% in US federal tax. The firm has offices in more than 20 countries. The US only constitutes 7.3% of its revenue, with Taiwan (24.6%) and China (22.6%), being the top sources of sales revenue.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementNvidia outbid Intel and bought Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies for nearly $7 billion in 2019. Nvidia\u2019s\u00a0Israel operations include its largest research and development center outside the US, with 3,000 employees, representing 12% of its total workforce.While US companies pay federal corporate income taxes levied at 21% or (8.84% in California where Nvidia is based), tax breaks expanded by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as well as the CARES Act enacted in 2020 meant 55 big corporations in the US paid nothing in corporate taxes that year. Instead of paying a collective total of $8.5 billion, they received $3.5 billion in tax rebates, amounting to $12 billion in corporate tax breaks. Nvidia is a beneficiary of these two laws.More in BusinessTesla short sellers land a $16.2bn payday on stock plunge as rival BYD hits record high on world\u2019s fastest EV recharging techFortuneThe Most Fuel-Efficient New Cars You Can BuyAutoblogChina to spend $55 billion on R&D in 2025 \u2014 Semiconductor, AI and quantum computing fields to benefitTom's HardwareLeaked report reveals shocking downfall for Tesla \u2014 here's what's driving the drop in salesThe Cool DownMore from QuartzWhat's next for student loans if SCOTUS knocks down Biden's debt forgiveness?How to manage ADHD\u2014and leverage its benefits\u2014at workSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

Her Ark Invest exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have ranked among the top performers in the past.\nHowever, Wood's reputation as a premier stock picker seems to have taken a hit recently. As a case in point, she dodged Nvidia (NVDA -2.53%) stock before its enormous surge this year. Is this a warning for investors considering buying her Ark Invest ETFs?\n\nIs Ark leaving investors high and dry?\nArk Invest used to own a much greater stake in Nvidia. But in the months before the chip stock skyrocketed, Wood's investment firm sold nearly 1 million shares. That decision proved to be a costly one: Ark Invest's shareholders missed out on over $200 million in gains.\nSure, two of Wood's ETFs still own positions in Nvidia. It's the 10th-largest holding of the Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (ARKQ -1.59%). The Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW -2.74%) also owns a small stake in Nvidia. But her flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK -3.22%) completely exited its position in Nvidia in early January 2023.\u00a0\nWood's timing for selling so much of Nvidia stock could raise big questions for investors thinking about putting their hard-earned money in Ark Invest ETFs. That's especially the case considering how her funds have performed, especially compared to Nvidia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA data by YCharts\nNote that in the chart, the two Ark Invest ETFs that no longer have major positions in Nvidia have lost money over the five-year period. Without Nvidia, the Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF, which still has a larger stake in the chipmaker, wouldn't have performed nearly as well.\nIn Wood's defense\nTo be fair, Wood saw the potential for Nvidia in artificial intelligence (AI) relatively early. In 2014, Ark Invest recognized that the company was, in her words, \"the premier equity play\" in AI. Many at the time viewed Nvidia only as a way to profit from the gaming market. Ark Invest made a lot of money off of its investments in Nvidia.\u00a0 \nHowever, Wood thinks now that Nvidia is \"priced ahead of the curve.\" With shares trading at 25x forward revenue, plenty of other investors would agree with her.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also recently argued on Twitter that some investors \"seem to think [Nvidia] is the only AI play.\" She added emphatically, \"It is not!\" And she's obviously right.\u00a0\nArk Invest's newsletter published on May 30 stated, \"In our view, while Nvidia still has substantial runway for growth, its competitors are well armed with resources and strategic incentives to challenge its reign.\" That perspective is no doubt correct. \nA warning sign?\nShould investors view Wood's ill-timed sales of Nvidia as a warning sign to avoid her Ark Invest ETFs? Not necessarily. Every investor makes mistakes. Even Warren Buffett has acknowledged on numerous occasions that he regretted some of his decisions.\nOn the other hand, investors pay not-so-insignificant expense fees to Wood's ETFs for the fund managers to make smart decisions on their behalf. Ark Invest's sell-off of Nvidia before the stock exploded does seem to reflect an inability to read where the AI market is going.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, Wood's valuation argument rings a bit hollow in one way. Nvidia's shares traded at an even higher forward price-to-sales multiple in early 2022 than it did when Ark Invest dumped a big chunk of its position in the stock. Why didn't Wood raise the valuation issue back then?\u00a0\nSome investors might still want to bet on Ark Invest, despite the spectacularly poor timing of the Nvidia sales. However, others might prefer to check out other ETFs or make their own stock picks.\nEither way, Wood is right about one thing: There are plenty of other AI stocks beyond Nvidia that should be on your radar.\n\n\n\nKeith Speights has positions in Nvidia.

We\u2019ve seen some of the biggest tech companies emerge as pioneers in the field and this has taken the market valuation to new highs.  The companies that are developing products and services for AI applications will see immense growth soon. The recent quarterly results of several tech companies highlighted the potential that AI has and this AI boom will take the valuation of tech companies to new highs.    Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently joined the trillion-dollar club and the stock is up over 200% year to date. Its market cap surged after the company reported results.\u00a0 InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The market capitalization of a company reflects the size of the company and several companies have seen the market cap hit new highs over the past month.  Naturally, it is easier for a large-cap stock to reach a higher market cap as compared to a small-cap stock. So, if you are looking for stocks that have the ability to hit a new high in the market cap, you need to ensure that the company has strong fundamentals and a high growth potential. With higher earnings and revenue, we can see soaring tech stock valuations.\u00a0 With that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the three top tech stocks to watch as the market cap hits new highs.   MSFT  Microsoft\u00a0  $333.56   TSLA  Tesla\u00a0  $259.46   NVDA  Nvidia\u00a0  $430.45    Microsoft (MSFT)   Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.   Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com One of the top tech stocks with high market cap to keep your eyes on is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The tech dinosaur has been around for as long as I can remember.  While the company already has a market cap of $2.5 trillion, there is no stopping its expansion. The company is set for success with this investment in OpenAI and its integration across the infrastructure.  This is one company that already holds a strong market share and a dominant position in the industry. However, when it comes to AI, this is only the beginning.\u00a0   It is not the one to let any opportunities pass by and it has adopted AI as fast as it could. Microsoft has integrated AI into its Bing search engine.  It aims to capture a large share of the search engine from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the near future and this could mean a significant amount of revenue generation. Even one percent of the market share can bring billions to the business.\u00a0 Microsoft is one of the top tech stocks with new highs.\u00a0MSFT stock is trading at $338 today and is up 41% year to date. The stock has gone from $222 in Jan to $338 today and I am certain that it will end this year on a high note.    Story Continues   Besides AI, Microsoft is also set to benefit from the cloud computing business, Azure. It generated $75.3 billion in 2022 and $22.1 billion in the recent quarter, which was up 16%. The company enjoys a dividend yield of 0.80% and announced a quarterly dividend of $0.68.\u00a0 It holds a solid position in the market and the segment generates maximum revenue for the company. Tesla (TSLA)   Tesla (TSLA) supercharging station during the day.   Source: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.com Next on the top tech stocks to watch list is Tesla\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA). The EV maker enjoys a market cap of $850 billion and there\u2019s more to come.  TSLA stock is trading at $274 today and is up 99% in the past six months. The stock is up 153% year to date and 45% in the past month. Nothing can stop the momentum of this stock.\u00a0 The recent rally in the stock is due to the company\u2019s agreements with General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F). Even Rivian Automotive\u00a0(NASDAQ:RIVN)\u00a0announced that it will allow Rivian drivers to access Tesla\u2019s Supercharger network across North America.    Other EV makers could soon join the network. By opening up its charging networks for other automakers, the company is solidifying its position in the industry as an EV leader.\u00a0Besides growing the EV lineup and increasing sales, Tesla also enjoys a full $7,500 federal tax credit on all the variants of Model 3s.\u00a0 Tesla\u2019s long-term goal is to produce 20 million vehicles annually and while it is relentlessly working towards reducing costs, if this ambitious goal becomes a reality, it could take Tesla to new highs. The stock has already doubled since the start of the year but there is room for more.\u00a0 One reason to bet on Tesla is its approach toward expansion and innovation. With a leader like Elon Musk, this tech company can go places. He is always improving the quality and brings the latest technology to the forefront.  The company has the potential to become a leader in the AI space which could double the price of the stock. The company already enjoys a dominant position in the electric vehicle industry and with the recent collaborations, it is strengthening its position further.  Nvidia (NVDA)   Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green trees   Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com Already in the trillion-dollar club, all of us have witnessed the rise of Nvidia. The company reported blowout first quarter results and this led to a massive surge in the market cap.  NVDA stock is trading at $438 today and is up over 200% year to date. It is hitting new 52-week highs every week and there\u2019s no stopping its momentum. I\u2019ve said it in the past and I\u2019ll say it again, buy NVDA stock in every dip but if you missed the opportunity, NVDA still remains one of the high value tech stocks to own.\u00a0   Once known for gaming, Nvidia has become a popular name in the AI space now. It has the best technology in the industry right now which can also change gaming forever.  It recently announced the Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) which is an AI-based solution for game developers. This technology will be used to build 3D graphics and applications. Besides the data center business, the gaming segment could pick up and generate strong revenues for the company in the near future.\u00a0 Nvidia\u2019s rally will continue throughout the second half of the year and its position in the industry is only going to strengthen.  The company is set to make the most of the AI boom and has chips that can run AI applications and its demand is soaring. Its cloud business has also shown tremendous growth and the company will continue to grow its market share in the years to come which makes it one of the top tech stocks to watch.\u00a0 On the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The advanced chatbot's ability to produce human-like dialogue captivated tech enthusiasts and prompted countless companies to pivot their businesses to AI development.\u00a0\nCompanies like Nvidia (NVDA -2.53%) and Microsoft (MSFT -1.46%) have enjoyed monster stock growth this year thanks to their prospects in AI. These tech giants are attractive investments as they were both early to the AI party, with one responsible for the hardware running ChatGPT and the other being the biggest investor in OpenAI.\u00a0\nAs a result, it's not a bad idea to consider investing in Nvidia and Microsoft before their stocks fly any higher. However, if you only have room for one more stock in your portfolio, you'll need to know the better buy. So, let's take a closer look at both companies.\u00a0\nNvidia: A favorite among AI investors\nNvidia shares skyrocketed 189% since Jan. 1, with Wall Street impressed by the company's ability to outperform competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel in AI chips.\u00a0The company is undoubtedly a favorite among investors, with the chart below showing that Nvidia's stock has delivered more than double the year-to-date growth of almost any AI stock.\u00a0\n\nData by YCharts\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of Nvidia's biggest selling points is its role as the primary supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) to ChatGPT. According to data from TrendForce, ChatGPT utilized about 20,000 GPUs in 2020, with that figure projected to hit 30,000 as the platform commercially expands.\u00a0Meanwhile, Nvidia is already profiting from the platform's growth, reporting a 41% year-over-year rise in revenue in its AI-focused data center segment in fiscal 2022. \n\nNvidia's data center segment is now the highest-earning part of its business as it delves deeper into the high-growth industry. As the market expands, Nvidia's ability to supply its chips to any company strengthens its outlook. If the amount of chips required by ChatGPT is anything to go by, Nvidia could have an immensely lucrative future as more companies join the sector.\nMicrosoft: The king of software\nWhile Nvidia is leading the way in hardware, Microsoft is making promising inroads in AI software. The company had the impressive foresight to invest $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019, which led it to procure exclusive licenses on multiple AI models.\nThe partnership allows Microsoft to integrate OpenAI's technology across its services, including its Office productivity software and cloud platform, Azure.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the adoption of AI soars among consumers and businesses, Microsoft is well positioned to become the go-to in AI services. The company's potent brands like Windows, Office, and Azure mean most consumers already utilize Microsoft products in their workflow. Consequently, it won't be a stretch for many of these users to adopt the company's growing AI offerings.\u00a0\n\nMoreover, Microsoft's Azure holds the second-largest market share in cloud computing at 23%, only after Amazon Web Services' (AWS) 32%. With the power of OpenAI behind it, Microsoft is currently ahead of AWS in AI cloud services. If the company can keep its lead, it could eventually overtake the competition in the lucrative industry.\u00a0\nIs Nvidia or Microsoft the better buy?\nNvidia and Microsoft have promising outlooks in different aspects of AI, making them both compelling options to invest in a market projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. To determine the better buy, it's smart to look at which is trading at a better value and which has delivered better profits over the last few years.\u00a0\nPrice-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a helpful metric to determine value. Microsoft's P/E of 36 is vastly lower than Nvidia's 220, suggesting that the Windows company is by far the better value. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nData by YCharts\nAdditionally, the chart above illustrates how Microsoft's annual profits have seen nearly triple the growth of Nvidia's over the last five years. The figures indicate that Microsoft is a more reliable buy, with its more established businesses offering consistent financial growth. In addition to being a cheaper stock, Microsoft is the better buy right now and an excellent way to invest in AI.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Now trading at just under $400, Nvidia joins a rarefied elite of just four other U.S.-based companies -- Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon -- with trillion-dollar market valuations. Although Nvidia is obviously a strong play on the future growth of the tech industry, could it also be a sneaky crypto play?\nThat might not be as insane as it sounds. Nvidia already provides the specialized graphics processing units (GPUs) required for cryptocurrency mining rigs. And Nvidia's recent announcement of a new AI supercomputing platform has already led to a flurry of AI-themed cryptos surging higher over the past week. Here's a closer look at why Nvidia might be a way to get exposure to the crypto industry, without taking on excessive risk.\nThe old crypto investment thesis for Nvidia\nUntil the start of this year, the standard investment thesis for Nvidia as part of a crypto portfolio was based on cryptocurrency mining. To mine proof-of-work cryptos such as Bitcoin, miners need very powerful computing systems called mining rigs. And Nvidia has provided some of the most powerful GPUs used in these mining rigs. In any review of the best GPUs for mining, Nvidia typically ranks at the top of the list.\u00a0\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nAs a result of this link to cryptocurrency mining, some analysts and fund managers already consider Nvidia to be an invaluable part of any broad-based stock portfolio designed to get exposure to the crypto industry. For example, take the Schwab Crypto Thematic ETF.\u00a0Currently, Nvidia is its sixth-largest holding, behind PayPal and ahead of Block, representing 4.1% of the fund's holdings.\nHowever, crypto giant Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work blockchain to a proof-of-stake blockchain back in September, so the investment narrative around Nvidia and crypto mining has been fading. That's because Ethereum mining rigs are now obsolete.\u00a0You can no longer use Nvidia GPU mining rigs to mine Ethereum, so they need to be repurposed for other cryptos. Given that Ethereum is the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, that's actually a big deal. It definitely takes some of the allure away from the crypto mining idea.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new crypto investment thesis for Nvidia\nThat's why Nvidia's recent announcements related to AI are so exciting for crypto investors. It means that there's a new reason to buy Nvidia, and that's the rise of new AI-powered cryptos. With the popular success of ChatGPT and other generative AI projects, it's becoming more and more popular to put AI projects on the blockchain, and that's leading to a dramatic surge in AI cryptos. For example, as soon as Nvidia reported blowout sales estimates related to AI, SingularityNET, an AI crytpo, jumped almost 20%.\u00a0Smaller AI cryptos were up 5% across the board.\nBigger gains related to AI and crypto could be on the way. At a big computer industry trade show in Taiwan, Nvidia announced the launch of a new AI supercomputer platform (DGX GH200) that is specifically being billed as a way for large tech companies to build ChatGPT competitors.\u00a0Moreover, Nvidia said at the trade show that it was going to focus on ways to make video games more lifelike with the help of AI.\u00a0That could spur growth in the blockchain gaming and metaverse sectors of the crypto industry.\nHow much Nvidia is too much Nvidia?\nAs a result, Nvidia could be a relatively safe way for investors to gain access to the infamously volatile crypto market. Instead of trying to pick winners among a growing number of AI-themed cryptos (almost all of them with market caps of less than $50 million), you could simply diversify your exposure via Nvidia. And, instead of trying to find the best crypto mining stocks or trying to pick the best proof-of-work cryptos (which require mining), you could simply invest in Nvidia.\u00a0\nObviously, you don't want to overdo things, no matter how excited you might be about Nvidia, AI, or crypto. As noted above, the Schwab Crypto Thematic ETF currently has less than 5% of its portfolio dedicated to Nvidia. That might be a good benchmark figure when thinking about how to diversify your own portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith all of the good news coming out of Nvidia these days, I'm bullish both on the company and the long-term fortunes of the AI industry. The extra bonus for investors is that Nvidia also gives you sneaky access to crypto without having to dip your toes into the crypto market.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Antony reviews and covers the latest PC hardware and laptop technologyFollow AuthorJun 28, 2023, 09:00am EDTShareSaveCommentToday Nvidia is launching the GeForce RTX 4060 - it's cheapest RTX 40-series graphics card to date, which is set to retail for $299 and below we'll compare its gaming performance against other graphics cards such as AMD's similarly-priced Radeon RX 7600.\nNvidia's RTX 4060Antony Leather\n\nYou can see a video review below.\n\n\nThe GeForce RTX 4060 has 8GB of GDDR6 memory, which is the same as AMD's Radeon RX 7600, so here at least AMD doesn't enjoy a memory advantage like it does further up the stack. Cards such as the RX 6750 XT with 12GB of memory sit only $70 above the $299 asking price of the GeForce RTX 4600.\n\nNvidia's frame rate-boosting DLSS is all very well and does work brilliantly in many titles, but if you play a wide range of games that aren't DLSS compliant, this key feature of the RTX 4060 might not be that useful. As well as comparing the Radeon RX 7600, the Radeon RX 6750 XT as well as older Nvidia models such as the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3070 are also in the graphs to see whether spending a little more is worth it for those that need all-round performance.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nOf course there are other benefits to the GeForce RTX 4060 too. It has exceptionally low power consumption with a TDP of 115W and in reality, Nvidia claims the RTX 4060 draws less power than the RTX 3060. We have no reason to doubt this either as the RTX 4060 Ti and RTX 4070 were also exceptionally power-frugal and cool-running. This means you won't need to boost your PCs cooling or upgrade your power supply as it's unlikely the RTX 4060 will draw more power or run hotter than previous low to mid-range graphics cards.\n\nIn fact, Nvidia claims the RTX 4060 draws up to 60W less than some models of the RTX 3060, which can save you up to $57 over four years in the US at currently electricity prices if you game 10-20 hours per week, or up to $130 in Europe. That's close to half the cost of the RTX 4060.\n\n\nBenchmarks\nI used an Intel Core i9-12900K, 32GB of Kingston Fury 6400MHz DDR5 memory strapped to an NZXT N7 Z790 motherboard along with the latest drivers and Windows 11 updates. As the GeForce RTX 4060 is primarily a mid-range model facing 1080p and 1440p resolutions, I've focussed on these in the graphs but have included 4K performance with DLSS enabled on occasions to show its benefits. I've used the latest drivers and Windows 11 updates and BAR/Smart Access Memory is enabled. I've carried out 1080 testing on a select number of cards, but where possible, included results for high-end models for comparison at higher resolutions.\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\nNvidia is finally offering new graphics cards around the $300 price bracket and the RTX 4060 is the cheapest RTX 40-series card yet. It seems to consistently outperform the Raden RX 7600 except for one or two situations and also offers a decent upgrade over the RTX 3060 too in most situations.\nThe RTX 3060 Ti is faster in some situations, but its price of around $350 means it's rarely offering more bang for your buck, leaving the RTX 4060 in a decent position against older Nvidia cards at their current prices. Its main nemesis comes from older AMD cards. The Radeon RX 6750 XT for example, is much faster in games such as Halo Infinite, Forza Horizon 5, Far Cry 6 and Rainbow Six Extraction and costs just $60 more as well as being equipped with 50 percent more memory.Nvidia's RTX 4060 graphics cardAntony Leather\nThen of course you have two real trump cards for the RTX 4060 - its power efficiency and DLSS. The former means you won't need to upgrade your PC to use it as it runs cool and uses less power than an RTX 3060. It also has a standard 8-pin power connector. DLSS comes into its own where supported and the addition of frame generation means you'll see frame rates in games such as Microsoft Flight Simulator that see it knocking on the doors of much more expensive cards\nIt's not likely to achieve legendary status such as the Steam Hardware Survey-toping GTX 1060, GTX 1650 or RTX 3060, but the RTX 4060 has done enough to represent a decent upgrade from those and similar calibre graphics cards in addition to its excellent power efficiency and DLSS support.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

The Nasdaq-listed company reached a milestone in May when it reached a $1 trillion market capitalisation, making it the first global semiconductor company to do so.\nJust as Tesla became the focal point for mass adoption of electric cars in 2020, rising 800% in value in one year, Nvidia is now being pitched as the bellwether for the AI revolution. Can it live up to the hype?\nOur analysts think its shares have already overstretched themselves after a 170% gain so far this year. They raised the fair value from $200 to $300 but with shares now just shy of $400, they\u2019re screening as overvalued. For a summary of the bull and bear cases for the stock, read this: Nvidia Upgraded But Shares Now Overvalued.\u00a0\nAnalyst Brian Collelo has looked at the markets served by Nvidia in terms of their growth potential, including computer games, data centres, and automotives.\u00a0\n\"We expect the firm to dominate the training portion of deep-learning AI workload [...such as] large language models, other forms of generative AI, deep recommendation engines, and autonomous vehicle fleet data processing and training,\" he says.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn terms of what is being labelled the \"AI arms race\", investors naturally want to know which superpower to back. But investing is rarely that simple \u2013 Morningstar analysts have already identified an early leader in artificial intelligence in the form of Microsoft.\nAs always, there\u2019s a danger of jumping on a bandwagon that is already in motion (unless you\u2019re one of the rare elite group of traders who can profit by momentum and hype, buying ahead of price surges).\nNvidia certainly has a lot of hype at the moment, especially after the company\u2019s blowout earnings report at the end of May, when shares soared nearly 25%. Its recent strong run also has a back story, though. Shares fell 44% in 2022 during the tech selloff, but this followed a 126% gain in 2021. Great leaps ahead have been followed by painful retrenchment in the last few years. Its sudden renaissance has caught investors by surprise.\nFor those investors who might balk at Nvidia's valuation, other chipmakers are also in the mix: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), up 91% YTD, TSMC (2330), up 23% YTD - Morningstar analysts think that TSMC is still significantly undervalued. US stalwart Intel (INTC), considered fairly valued by our analysts, is also 13% higher than at the start of the year. Europe has its own Nvidia in the form of ASML (ASML), a Netherlands firm which provides equipment to the semiconductor makers. ASML's shares are 29% higher since the start of the year, surging after Nvidia's earnings. The industry is very interconnected after all - TSMC makes chips for ASML, for example.\nFormer UK tech darling ARM Holdings, bought by SoftBank in 2016, is expected to relist on the stock market this year - but New York seems the most likely venue. Its valuation will no doubt reflect the current levels of excitement surrounding semiconductor stocks.\nAs Tesla showed us, professional investors are often one step ahead of the crowd, so it\u2019s useful to see which UK funds already have exposure to Nvidia. We\u2019ve looked at the funds with a minimum 1% exposure to Nvidia and also a Morningstar Medalist Rating of Negative and above \u2013 the search came up with 326 funds, suggesting it's firmly been on the radar of active managers.\n\n\n\nStarting with open-ended funds for sale in the UK, Martin Currie US Unconstrained has the highest weighting towards Nvidia with 8.27%. The fund has returned 17.37% so far this year, but it\u2019s not the best performer on our list \u2013 that accolade is held by Natixis Loomis Sayles US Equity Leaders, a Gold-rated fund which also has the best three-year performance.\nSilver-rated Baillie Gifford Worldwide Discovery and Baillie Gifford Global Growth just missed the cut, placing at number 11 and 13.\n\n\n\nJP Morgan American (JAM) and Scottish Mortgage (SMT) investment trusts have weightings over 3%. Gold-rated Scottish Mortgage was early to the Tesla story, and its share price doubled in 2020. Since then it has struggled to match that vintage year, falling from a peak above \u00a315 per share in late 2021 to \u00a36.88 now.\nWhile it\u2019s still the largest investment trust in the UK at just shy of \u00a310 billion, veteran manager James Anderson has since retired and there have been disagreements at board level about investing in unlisted companies. Nvidia is the trust\u2019s sixth biggest holding, and it first appeared in the portfolio as far back as July 2016.\nJP Morgan American also has a strong track record and counts Nvidia as its seventh biggest holding, having initiated the position in December 2022.\nIn terms of exchange-traded funds, thousands of products have exposure to Nvidia because it\u2019s a US tech firm, so there are too many to list. But one popular thematic ETF is iShares Automation and Robotics (RBOT), a Neutral-rated fund which has Nvidia as its top holding with a 2.23% weighting.\n\n\nSaoT iWFFXY aJiEUd EkiQp kDoEjAD RvOMyO uPCMy pgN wlsIk FCzQp Paw tzS YJTm nu oeN NT mBIYK p wfd FnLzG gYRj j hwTA MiFHDJ OfEaOE LHClvsQ Tt tQvUL jOfTGOW YbBkcL OVud nkSH fKOO CUL W bpcDf V IbqG P IPcqyH hBH FqFwsXA Xdtc d DnfD Q YHY Ps SNqSa h hY TO vGS bgWQqL MvTD VzGt ryF CSl NKq ParDYIZ mbcQO fTEDhm tSllS srOx LrGDI IyHvPjC EW bTOmFT bcDcA Zqm h yHL HGAJZ BLe LqY GbOUzy esz l nez uNJEY BCOfsVB UBbg c SR vvGlX kXj gpvAr l Z GJk Gi a wg ccspz sySm xHibMpk EIhNl VlZf Jy Yy DFrNn izGq uV nVrujl kQLyxB HcLj NzM G dkT z IGXNEg WvW roPGca owjUrQ SsztQ lm OD zXeM eFfmz MPk\n\nTo view this article, become a Morningstar Basic member.\nRegister For Free\n\nAlready a member?Log In.\r\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor More News and Analysis\nSubscribe!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAGS\n\n\n\nAI\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information contained within is for educational and informational purposes ONLY.

It is projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Morningstar assigns star ratings based on an analyst\u2019s estimate of a stock's fair value. Four components drive the Star Rating: (1) our assessment of the firm\u2019s economic moat, (2) our estimate of the stock\u2019s fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This process culminates in a single-point star rating that is updated daily. A 5-star represents a belief that the stock is a good value at its current price; a 1-star stock isn't. If our base-case assumptions are true the market price will converge on our fair value estimate over time, generally within three years. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks, please visit here Quantitative Fair Value Estimate represents Morningstar\u2019s estimate of the per share dollar amount that a company\u2019s equity is worth today. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is based on a statistical model derived from the Fair Value Estimate Morningstar\u2019s equity analysts assign to companies which includes a financial forecast of the company. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is calculated daily. It is a projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Quantiative Fair Value Estimate, please visit hereThe Morningstar Medalist Rating is the summary expression of Morningstar\u2019s forward-looking analysis of investment strategies as offered via specific vehicles using a rating scale of Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. The Medalist Ratings indicate which investments Morningstar believes are likely to outperform a relevant index or peer group average on a risk-adjusted basis over time. Investment products are evaluated on three key pillars (People, Parent, and Process) which, when coupled with a fee assessment, forms the basis for Morningstar\u2019s conviction in those products\u2019 investment merits and determines the Medalist Rating they\u2019re assigned. Pillar ratings take the form of Low, Below Average, Average, Above Average, and High. Pillars may be evaluated via an analyst\u2019s qualitative assessment (either directly to a vehicle the analyst covers or indirectly when the pillar ratings of a covered vehicle are mapped to a related uncovered vehicle) or using algorithmic techniques. Vehicles are sorted by their expected performance into rating groups defined by their Morningstar Category and their active or passive status. When analysts directly cover a vehicle, they assign the three pillar ratings based on their qualitative assessment, subject to the oversight of the Analyst Rating Committee, and monitor and reevaluate them at least every 14 months. When the vehicles are covered either indirectly by analysts or by algorithm, the ratings are assigned monthly. For more detailed information about these ratings, including their methodology, please go to here The Morningstar Medalist Ratings are not statements of fact, nor are they credit or risk ratings. The Morningstar Medalist Rating (i) should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating an investment product, (ii) involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what was expected, (iii) are not guaranteed to be based on complete or accurate assumptions or models when determined algorithmically, (iv) involve the risk that the return target will not be met due to such things as unforeseen changes in changes in management, technology, economic development, interest rate development, operating and/or material costs, competitive pressure, supervisory law, exchange rate, tax rates, exchange rate changes, and/or changes in political and social conditions, and (v) should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the investment product. A change in the fundamental factors underlying the Morningstar Medalist Rating can mean that the rating is subsequently no longer accurate.

And that door could swing wide open at any time.\nQuite a few analysts believe that there's a lot more room to run.\u00a0Here's how much higher Wall Street thinks Nvidia stock will soar.\n\nAwestruck analysts\nNvidia's first-quarter update blew analysts away. After the company projected Q2 revenue of $11 billion, Wedbush's Dan Ives said that Nvidia \"delivered guidance for the ages.\"\u00a0\nJensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO, stated that his company could be having its \"iPhone moment,\" a reference to Apple's massive success with its smartphone. And Wall Street seems to agree.\nThe average analysts' 12-month price target for Nvidia reflects an upside potential of more than 14%. That's peanuts compared to the stock's gain so far this year. However, it could mean that investors still aren't too late to the party with Nvidia if analysts are right.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne firm is especially bullish about the stock. Elazar Advisors set a price target of $644.80 for Nvidia. That's nearly 65% above the current share price.\nSome skepticism\nThere are skeptics, though, who aren't convinced that Nvidia can fly even higher. Charles Schwab's Equity Ratings Report recently slapped an \"underperform\" (or \"sell\") rating on the stock.\nSchwab gave Nvidia grades of \"D\" on quality, stability, and valuation. It assigned a grade of \"F\" for growth prospects. The firm also stated that its outlook was for the stock to experience \"above average price volatility.\" \nDeutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore isn't as negative as Schwab is about Nvidia. However, he views the stock as one to hold rather than buy right now. Seymore's 12-month price target is a little below Nvidia's current price. He did admit, though, that Deutsche Bank \"see[s] little that could diminish investor optimism and recommend continuing to enjoy the ride.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nA former champion of Nvidia who isn't on Wall Street also now questions the stock's valuation. Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood tweeted last week that Nvidia is \"priced ahead of the curve.\" But her comment came after Ark's ETFs sold a big chunk of their positions in the stock in early January 2023 before its huge run.\nBetter picks?\nAre there any AI stocks that Wall Street likes even better than Nvidia? Yes, but you have to look hard for them.\u00a0\nThe consensus 12-month price target for Soundhound AI (SOUN -4.56%) is a whopping 77% higher than its current price. Soundhound develops voice AI applications used by multiple industries, including automakers and restaurants.\u00a0\n\nThis stock isn't widely followed on Wall Street. However, of the three analysts covering Soundhound who were surveyed by Refinitiv in May, all rated the stock as either a \"buy\" or \"strong buy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWood tweeted that Ark Invest \"sees dozens of AI winners.\" There's one that she trumpets the most -- Tesla. She stated that Tesla \"is the most obvious beneficiary of the recent breakthroughs in AI.\" Wood pointed out that the stock trades at 6x revenue while the total addressable market in \"autonomous mobility\" could be between $8 trillion and $10 trillion by 2030.\u00a0\nOf course, investors don't have to follow the lead of Wall Street analysts or well-known investment managers. Several other stocks are likely to be big winners from the AI boom over the long run.\u00a0\n\n\n\nCharles Schwab is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

The market\u2019s fickle nature is partly why stocks often lead to losses for retail investors. By going \u201call-in\u2019 or \u201call-out,\u201d individual investors can often be overexposed to the sudden changes the market brings. This is especially true when the market has treated investors well as it creates a sense of security \u2013 or worse, complacency.\n\nOur site is unique in that we provide active management. This has helped us outperform across four audit periods. Our stance is the weather will always change \u2013 from good times to bad times, and from bad times to good times. Therefore, we are not over exposed in either direction.\n\nBRAZIL - 2021/07/15: In this photo illustration the stock trading graph of Nvidia Corporation seen ... [+] on a smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\nAn example of this is Nvidia, our largest position. As the allocation grew well beyond 10%, we took gains. Even after taking gains, the company is currently at a 17% allocation. In May and June, I stated that our firm was not buying Nvidia right now. Well, similar to the weather, this has changed. My firm bought a small tranche of Nvidia yesterday for $410. This tranche will come with a stop, meaning if the stock sells off, we will close this 2% tranche while hedging the 15% original position.\n\n\nOur Current Nvidia Trade:\nWith the cash we raised throughout 2022, NVDA was the primary target of deploying some of this cash once our analysis signaled a bottom was in place. The below is a real-time trade notification we sent to our members on the October 13th.\nAbove is a real-time trade notification we sent to our members on the October 13th.I/O Fund\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nThe above alert was 1 of 9 alerts we sent out from 2021 \u2013 2022 to buy NVDA below $200. However, since February of 2023, we have been systematically taking gains at key levels based on technical and macro warnings. Even with logging sizable wins while raising cash, it in the top position in 2023.\n\nIn our pre-earnings buy-plan for NVDA, we stated that \u201cIt is our belief that NVDA is setting up for a sizable pullback, which we believe will open the door for better long-term entries.\u201d Though we do believe that lower levels will manifest in time, the recent earnings report moved forward expectations regarding AI, which is showing up in the price action. We have been discussing that Nvidia will be an AI leader for years with an allocation to match, yet predicting the exact day and month the market would finally price in this thesis is impossible to predict (and timing to this level is not necessary when holding a large longer-term position)\n\n\nRegarding price, we work in probabilities, and when the market changes, so do we. The key to NVDA today is the large gap from their earnings report. This gap is either a breakaway gap, or an exhaustion gap. If it is a breakaway gap, which is represented by our red count below, then it is the halfway point in this push higher. On the other hand, if price breaks below $340, likely on some type of \u201cevent,\u201d then the gap is an exhaustion gap, and will mark a larger top. This is represented by our blue count.The key to NVDA today is the large gap from their earnings report. This gap is either a breakaway ... [+] gap, or an exhaustion gap.

On the other hand, if price breaks below $340, likely on some type of \u201cevent,\u201d then the gap is an exhaustion gap, and will mark a larger top. This is represented by our blue count.I/O Fund\nThe $405 - $395 region will likely continue to act as strong support for the red count. This is where we added back in anticipation for a ~38% push higher. Our stop for this move will be a break below the $340 critical support region, which is ~14% lower than our entry.\nUnlike many, we do not believe AI is a bubble, nor do we think the valuations in some of these names is stretched, as many believe. What does concern us regarding possible \u201cevents\u201d are: 1) geo-political tensions forcing a ban of selling NVDA\u2019s chips to China \u2013 which Beth spoke about in May with Bloomberg Asia; 2) the inevitable recession that will likely start to be priced into equities in Q4/Q1, but could get pushed forward due to an unforeseen event.\nBecause of these risks, we are buying with an exit plan for any new entries. It is our belief, based on the economic data, that a recession is a more likely than not for the US economy. However, based on current projections on timing, we could see a continued push in AI leadership through year-end. This is what we are further positioning our portfolio for, with the realization that we could top out sooner than anticipated.\nThe I/O Fund has been beating the drum about AI for 5 years. Now that it is here, we are targeting choice mid-cap to mega-cap names in the coming pullback. Once this exuberance runs its course, and the market gives up on AI, we will be buying the dip for this once-in-a-lifetime tech trend that is just starting. Join us the week following the holiday, Thursday, 7/13, at 4:30 EST where we will go over the specific AI stocks we are targeting. We will provide the macro backdrop, along with entry prices.\nPlease note: The I/O Fund conducts research and draws conclusions for the company\u2019s portfolio.

Insiders and Analysts Have Differing Views\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipRanks\n\nJun. 23, 2023, 09:54 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSemiconductor stock Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been on a swift uptrend thanks to its fast-paced artificial intelligence (AI) developments. In fact, NVDA stock has ballooned by 195% this year. However, the past five trading days have been rather dull, with the stock down slightly. This brings us to the following question \u2014 is Nvidia stock\u2019s rally over?\n\nCorporate Insiders Are Selling the Stock\nThe company\u2019s corporate insider trading activity at least signals that. As per the latest regulatory filing, Director Mark A Stevens sold 118,602 shares of NVDA at an average price of ~$431 for a total consideration of over $51 million. \nMoreover, the TipRanks Insider Trading Activity tool shows that the Insider Confidence Signal on NVDA is Very Negative, with corporate insiders selling $193 million worth of shares in the last three months. The tool highlights that insiders may not be too optimistic about NVDA\u2019s future trajectory and are taking advantage of the current rally.\n\nHere\u2019s What Analysts Say About Nvidia Stock\nYesterday, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated a Buy rating on NVDA stock but set a price target of $400, which implies 5.4% downside potential from current levels. Rakesh believes that Nvidia is currently trading at steep multiples. Having said that, recovering demand for personal computers (PC), chip demand for gaming consoles, chip requirements in the Automotive and Data Center segments, and AI tailwinds position it well for upside.\nEven so, growing competition, reliance on third-party manufacturing, and pricing pressures are probable headwinds that could limit its stock\u2019s trajectory. His price target of $400 reflects a 50.5x Fiscal 2025 price/earnings per share (P/E) multiple based on his estimates, which is within NVDA\u2019s historical valuation.\n\t\t\n\n\nOverall, too, analysts are bullish about Nvidia and have awarded the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating. This is based on 30 Buys and three Hold ratings on TipRanks. Also, the average Nvidia price target of $464.85 implies 9.7% upside potential from current levels.\n\nBottom Line\nAlthough corporate insiders and Wall Street analysts have differing views on Nvidia stock, there is no denying the fact that the burgeoning generative-AI technology market is set to bolster demand for chips. Nvidia is indeed well-positioned to capitalize on the demand, and its shares could witness more upside in the long run as a result.\nDisclosure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\n\n\n FACEBOOK\n\n\n\n\n TWITTER\n\n\n\n\n EMAIL\n\n\n\n\n COPY LINK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNVIDIA NewsMORE  \n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX PRO Comes to Workstations and Servers for Designers, Developers, Data Scientists and Creatives to Build and Collaborate With Agentic AIGlobeNewswire 17m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces DGX Spark and DGX Station Personal AI ComputersGlobeNewswire 20m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces Spectrum-X Photonics, Co-Packaged Optics Networking Switches to Scale AI Factories to Millions of GPUsGlobeNewswire 35m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell Ultra AI Factory Platform Paves Way for Age of AI ReasoningGlobeNewswire 45m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Dynamo Open-Source Library Accelerates and Scales AI Reasoning ModelsGlobeNewswire 1h \n\n\n\nNvidia GTC 2025: Rubin, reasoning, robotics and moreSeeking Alpha 1h \n\n\n\nGeneral Motors and NVIDIA Collaborate on AI for Next-Generation Vehicle Experience and ManufacturingGlobeNewswire 2h \n\n\n\nNVIDIA and Telecom Industry Leaders to Develop AI-Native Wireless Networks for 6GGlobeNewswire 2h \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tStart Trading Futures\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n\n\n\n\nNVDA\n\n\n\n116.58\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-2.95 (-2.47%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t03:14:32 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time NVDA charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFind News\n\t\t\t\tNews\n\n\n\n\n\nGO\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n            See also:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                - Explore more categories\n            \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

This is not surprising, since the chipmaker's revenue and earnings are getting a serious boost from the booming demand for graphics processing units (GPUs), which are needed for training AI models and for inferencing.\nFrom reporting a 13% year-over-year decline in revenue to $7.2 billion in the previous quarter, Nvidia is now on track to deliver $11 billion in revenue in the current quarter. That would translate into a 64% jump over the prior year. The biggest reason why Nvidia is anticipating such outstanding growth despite the woeful situation in the personal computer (PC) market -- which has wrecked the company's gaming business -- is because of its dominant position in the data center GPU market.\nNvidia reportedly controls\u00a095% of the machine learning GPU market, according to New Street Research. As these graphics cards reportedly start from\u00a0$10,000 and could go up to more than $40,000, it is not surprising to see why the company's growth is about to accelerate big time. Its revenue is expected to increase close to 60% in fiscal year 2024, while earnings are estimated to jump 133%.\n\nHowever, investors will have to pay a rich premium to buy Nvidia's potential growth. It is trading at a whopping 41 times\u00a0sales and sports a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 57. While that premium may seem justified considering Nvidia's terrific grip over the AI GPU market, there may be a cheaper alternative for investors looking to capitalize on this lucrative market -- Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.80%). Let's see why this Nvidia rival could take advantage of the AI market despite being late to the game.\nThe market for AI chips is big enough to supercharge AMD\nAccording\u00a0to AMD CEO Lisa Su, AI is \"the largest strategic growth opportunity for AMD.\" She estimates\u00a0that the market for data center accelerators such as GPUs, data processing units (DPUs), and other types of processors could jump from $30 billion in 2022 to $150 billion in 2027.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is dominating this massive market, but there is space for another player, such as AMD. This is evident from reports that the waiting time for Nvidia's data center GPUs ranges between three and six months. The company is reportedly unable to keep up with the huge demand for its GPUs, which are deployed for training AI models. It is scrambling to place more orders with its foundry partner to ramp up output and satisfy customer demand.\nHowever, the shortage of Nvidia's data center GPUs has led to sharp price hikes, as these chips are reportedly commanding a 40% premium over the MSRP (manufacturer's suggested retail price). AMD can fill this void and capitalize on the multibillion-dollar AI chip market. The company is on track to launch\u00a0its MI300 family of data center GPUs for AI training and inference by the end of 2023.\n\nThese chips are already attracting customer interest, which isn't surprising as AMD is going all out to capture the AI chip opportunity.\nFor instance, AMD recently revealed the Instinct MI300X data center accelerator, which it claims is the \"world's most advanced accelerator for generative AI.\" With 192 gigabytes (GB) of high-bandwidth memory (HBM), it is not surprising to see why AMD is making such a claim, as this spec exceeds Nvidia's H100 data center GPU's 120GB memory capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD management points out that more memory will give data centers the \"compute and memory efficiency needed for large language model training and inference for generative AI workloads.\" The chipmaker intends to start sampling these chips with customers in the third quarter. So AMD's growth could start accelerating once again from the end of 2023, assuming its AI-focused GPUs are a hit with customers.\nWe have already seen how fast the AI accelerator market is expected to grow and the amount of revenue it is expected to generate. Success in this market will be critical for a turnaround in AMD's fortunes, and it looks like Wall Street is expecting the company's move in this space to pay off.\nInvestors can expect better times after a woeful 2023\nAccording\u00a0to consensus estimates, AMD's revenue in 2023 could fall 2.5% to $23 billion. Its earnings are expected to drop to $2.86 per share from $3.50 per share in 2022. However, the next two years are looking relatively better for AMD as per estimates, with the company expected to deliver solid double-digit growth.\n\nAMD EPS Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YCharts\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, AMD may be able to outpace Wall Street's expectations if it can hit gold in data center accelerators. Nvidia has already used this opportunity to execute a major turnaround, and AMD could replicate its bigger rival's feat. That's why investors looking to buy a potential AI winner trading at a cheaper multiple should take a closer look at AMD.\nThe company sports\u00a0a price-to-sales ratio of 8, which is significantly lower than Nvidia's, while AMD's forward P/E ratio of 39 indicates that investors are getting a good deal on the stock right now given the massive AI opportunity that lies ahead.\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The average analyst estimate had forecast that the company would guide for roughly $7.15 billion in second quarter, but the semiconductor leader wound up guiding for $11 billion in sales thanks to surging demand for artificial intelligence (AI). \nThe blowout quarterly results and guidance triggered massive gains for Nvidia stock and also helped power bullish momentum for other companies with AI exposure and the broader tech sector.\u00a0\n\nWith a market capitalization of roughly $1 trillion, Nvidia currently ranks as the world's sixth-largest company. Believe it or not, the processing leader could go on to become the most valuable company within the next decade.\u00a0\nHardware leadership and an emerging software and services business\nAs a leading provider of graphics processing units (GPUs) and accelerated processing systems, Nvidia is enjoying huge demand catalysts in conjunction with the rise of AI. Not only is the company positioned to provide key hardware for running advanced artificial intelligence applications through data centers, but it's also offering its own AI computation services and software.\u00a0\nNvidia's DGX Cloud service already includes access to Nvidia AI software, AI frameworks, and pretrained models.\u00a0Through DGX Cloud, Nvidia is also providing tools for building, refining, and operating custom large language and generative AI models.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt offers three distinct systems as part of the Nvidia AI Foundations package available in DGX Cloud:\n\nNvidia NeMo is a toolset to for the construction and operation of large language models.\u00a0\nNvidia Picasso can be used for to create generative image, video, and 3D processing systems.\nNvidia BioNeMo is a set of tools for building life-sciences applications.\u00a0\n\nThe company is at the outset of building an AI-as-a-service (AIaaS) business component, and it has the potential to have a fundamentally transformative impact on the business.\nAI services could make Nvidia far more profitable\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia recorded a non-GAAP (adjusted) gross margin of 67.1% -- already quite impressive given that hardware-oriented businesses typically have lower margins. But the company actually sees its margin improving. In the second quarter, the company is guiding for an adjusted gross margin of 70%. Pushing further into the AIaaS category could make the company's business even more profitable.\u00a0\nFor a look at how service-based business models can have a transformative impact on business performance and stock valuation, just look to Microsoft. The software giant is currently the second-largest company in the world and has a market cap of approximately $2.5 trillion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSFT data by YCharts\nOver the last decade, Microsoft transitioned most of its key non-operating-system software products to subscription-based models. It also built a massive subscription-based cloud-infrastructure services business. These catalysts helped the company's share price soar roughly 850% over the last decade.\u00a0\nBecause subscription-based revenue tends to be more dependable, predictable, and profitable, investors are typically willing to assign higher valuation multiples to companies with subscription-based businesses. It's possible that success with AIaaS initiatives could both significantly improve Nvidia's profit margin and make investors more willing to assign an even greater valuation premium to the company.\u00a0\nEarly leadership could turn into lasting competitive advantages\nNvidia's leadership position in advanced processing hardware already looks quite strong and hard to disrupt, but the company may be in the early stages of building another powerful competitive advantage. While algorithms and processing hardware play very important roles in constructing and running AI systems, data can be thought of as the other key component. As AI models are trained with a greater array of relevant valuable data, they tend to become more effective and capable.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy establishing itself as an early leader in AIaaS offerings, Nvidia is positioned to generate huge swaths of valuable data that help to inform and improve its own artificial intelligence capabilities. Through these improvements, the company should be able to deliver better services for its customers.\nIn turn, this will once again generate more valuable data for the company, setting up a network effect and virtuous cycle that could turn early leadership in AI services into a long-term competitive edge that competitors find very difficult to disrupt.\u00a0\nCould Nvidia really become the world's biggest company?\nWith a market cap of roughly $2.9 trillion, Apple currently stands as the world's most valuable company. It's too early to say whether Nvidia will be able to claim the mantle for itself at some point over the next 10 years, but it's certainly within the realm of feasibility.\u00a0\nThe tech specialist's GPUs and other advanced processors are already serving as a key foundation pushing the AI revolution forward, and the company is making smart moves and using its strengths to make software and services a new business pillar. Whether or not Nvidia goes on to become the biggest company in the world, there's a good chance it will be near the top of the list over the next decade.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeith Noonan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Jeff states that NVIDIA saw a 20% CAGR annual growth rate for the GeForce segment through FY23. The cards such as the GeForce RTX 4070 and RTX 4070 Ti which start at $699 US have seen 40 percent faster revenue ramp compared to their Ampere predecessors. Not only that but new game streamers, content creators and gamers themselves are buying a higher class of GPU which reflects the recent ASP lift.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPSAnd last, I wanted to share with you a bit about our Ada ramp. As you guys know, we have -- we launch our products, our new generations from the top down, starting at the top. And for reasons you're also aware of, Ada has taken us a little longer to move down the stack than typical generation. So for this reason, we've got a fair amount of history on the 699 up class of Ada, this is our 40-70 tie and up. And Ada from -- in terms of the revenue generated is ramping much faster, 3x that uttering and about 40% faster than Ampere. We're super pleased with the Ada ramp to date.\nNVIDIA SVP, Jeff Fisher (Bank of America Global Technology Conference)\n\nNVIDIA also presented a visual representation of the whole PC Gaming & GeForce RTX ecosystem. The NVIDIA GeForce GPU saw a 1.4x sell-through rate during FY23 & the GeForce Gaming revenue saw a climb of $8.4 Billion in FY23 compared to $4.8 Billion in FY20. The 3-year CAGR had a 10% ASP uplift and 9% units shipped on average.\nI shared with you how the 4070 tie is doing relative to prior Gens. And, in fact, the early results from lower down Ada are also very -- are very strong. I mean, we're -- I'm really pleased with the Ada ramp.\nOkay. Well, it's a good question. I -- the -- first of all, when we look at -- when I look at mix up or upsell, remember, even in the days of, I'll call it, product shortages throughout the pandemic and work from home and crypto as you mentioned, we didn't really change our GPU pricing. I mean, the way I measured upsell was from my core price now what it ultimately got inflated to in the end market.\nAnd what we've seen today for Ada in this class 699 and up is a $300 to $400 upgrade in mix in the high end. So gamers who are buying our high-end of our Ada are buying from a much lower class of product, which is super exciting for us. Ampere, it wasn't -- it was -- I'll speculate, it was in the $200 to $300 upgrade range. And Turing was probably a bit below that, so we've seen an increasing mix of upgrades over time.\nVivek Arya\nSo just to get it right. So what you're saying is that people who upgraded to Ampere on an average bought a card that was $200 more expensive. And now those who are upgrading to Ada are buying something that is $300 or $400 more expensive?\nJeff Fisher\nRight. Relative to what they had.\nNVIDIA SVP, Jeff Fisher (Bank of America Global Technology Conference)\nMeanwhile, the most important data point provided by NVIDIA is that while the $699 US+ segment has seen a 3x ramp over Turing GPUs with the newest GeForce RTX 40 \"Ada\" offerings, the majority of GeForce gamers are still running non-RTX GPUs. Of the entire GeForce userbase, only 44% of users are running an RTX GPU and 18% of users have a GPU that is more performant than an RTX 3060 GPU which leads to a massive growth area.\n\n\nYes, it's -- I'll tell you my expectation and that is, at the highest end, those gamers will upgrade every generation. I mean, they like the best, they likely have the wherewithal to afford the high end, each Gen.\nAnd that's about every 2, 2.5 years, right? As you get to the bottom of the stack, I think we're stretching out to probably 3.5 years to 4.5 years for a replacement cycle. It's probably, we see more upgrades than we do new PC sold. So it'd be shorter than the overall PC cycle, but that's about the frequency, yes.\nVivek Arya\nSo averaging somewhere around 3.\nJeff Fisher\n3.5, 3, 3.5 years, something.\nNVIDIA SVP, Jeff Fisher (Bank of America Global Technology Conference)\nTo address this large market, NVIDIA has recently announced the GeForce RTX 4060 which starts at $299 US and will be available next month. This new GPU is priced lower than the RTX 3060 which is priced at an MSRP of $329 US. This provides a great incentive for users to upgrade, especially in the features department where one would get DLSS 3, faster raytracing capabilities, superb AI-GPU prowess, and much more coming to the Ada GPUs in the latest AAA titles. NVIDIA showcased ACE, a platform that uses generative AI to create NPCs in games during Computex 2023 powered by Ada GPUs.\nBut NVIDIA has a more important point and that's the upgrade cycle. For a high-end user who eyes the RTX 4090, the upgrade cycle will be much smaller than a mainstream user. An RTX 4090 user is going to upgrade to whatever best is out there and that's a 1.5 - 2.0 years gap.\n\nFor a mainstream user, the upgrade cycle is much larger and it averages around 3.0 - 3.5 years. So the vast majority of gamers upgrading to an RTX 4060 are going to be coming from either a GTX 1060 or RTX 2060 GPU and they are going to see a big upgrade in performance and feature set.\nAs for when things will be returning to normal, Jeff except that the second half of this year will be a return to form for PC gaming with the mainstream GeForce RTX 40 GPUs in full wing & a wave of new AAA gaming titles to help boost the platform further.\nRecent figures by Jon Peddie Research paint a dire look for the PC gaming industry but the analyst is hopeful that the market is on course correction and also expects better results in the second half of this year. Also, despite its massive growth thanks to AI, NVIDIA's CEO has made a commitment to gamers that they won't be forgotten and that all the benefits that AI brings to the table will be extended to GeForce users.\nNews Source: Seeking Alpha\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n156\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n73\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n66\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n65\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n46\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

In the U.S., caring for those suffering from delirium costs up to $64,000 a year per patient, according to the National Institutes of Health.\nIn a paper published last month in Nature, researchers describe how they used a deep learning model called Vision Transformer, accelerated by NVIDIA GPUs, alongside a rapid-response electroencephalogram, or EEG, device to detect delirium in critically ill older adults.\nThe paper, called \u201cSupervised deep learning with vision transformer predicts delirium using limited lead EEG,\u201d is authored by Malissa Mulkey of the University of South Carolina, Huyunting Huang of Purdue University, Thomas Albanese and Sunghan Kim of the University of East Carolina, and Baijian Yang of Purdue.\nTheir innovative approach achieved a testing accuracy rate of 97%, promising a potential breakthrough in forecasting dementia. And by harnessing AI and EEGs, the researchers could objectively evaluate prevention and treatment methods, leading to better care.\nThis impressive result is due in part to the accelerated performance of NVIDIA GPUs, enabling the researchers to accomplish their tasks in half the time compared to CPUs.\nDelirium affects up to 80% of critically ill patients. Yet conventional clinical detection methods identify fewer than 40% of cases \u2014 representing a significant gap in patient care. Presently, screening ICU patients involves a subjective bedside assessment.\nThe introduction of handheld EEG devices could make screening more accurate and affordable, but the lack of skilled technicians and neurologists poses a challenge.\nThe use of AI, however, can eliminate the need for a neurologist to interpret findings and allow for the detection of changes associated with delirium roughly two days before symptom onset, when patients are more receptive to treatment. It also makes it possible to use EEGs with minimal training.\nThe researchers applied an AI model called ViT, initially created for natural language processing and accelerated by NVIDIA GPUs, to EEG data \u2014 offering a fresh approach to data interpretation.\nThe use of a handheld rapid-response EEG device, which doesn\u2019t require large EEG machines or specialized technicians, was another noteworthy study finding.\nThis practical tool, combined with advanced AI models for interpreting the data they collect, could streamline delirium screenings in critical care units.\nThe research presents a promising method for delirium detection that could shorten hospital stays, increase discharge rates, decrease mortality rates and reduce the financial burden associated with delirium.\nBy integrating the power of NVIDIA GPUs with innovative deep learning models and practical medical devices, this study underlines the transformative potential of technology in enhancing patient care.\nAs AI grows and develops, medical professionals are increasingly likely to rely on it to forecast conditions like dementia and intervene early, revolutionizing the future of critical care.\nRead the full paper.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | GPU | Healthcare and Life Sciences \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The new $299 Ada Lovelace-based graphics card is shown to be across-the-board faster than its predecessor based on the Ampere architecture, but there is catch: the newcomer shows its most significant advantages with AI frame generation enabled. Without it, it is merely 20% faster, according to Nvidia.\u00a0(Image credit: Nvidia)Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4060 graphics card is based on the AD106 GPU with 3072 CUDA cores enabled that has peak FP32 compute throughput of 15 TFLOPS, which is just 15% higher compared to GeForce RTX 3060 with its 13 FP32 TFLOPS. But the AD106 has noticeable advantages over GA106 in the form of massively improved ray tracing performance (+40%) and Tensor compute throughput (+137%). The latter can be used for AI, advanced DLSS 3 upscaling, and AI image generation workloads.\u00a0We'll see if that's enough to make it one of the best graphics cards.(Image credit: Nvidia)We can make guesses why Nvidia decided to balance its Ada Lovelace microarchitecture the way it balanced it, but it is obvious that the company will use benefits \u2014 DLSS 3 and AI image generation \u2014 that is has to outshine predecessors and competitors in games.That said, it is not particularly surprising that Nvidia demonstrated its GeForce RTX 4060 with DLSS 3 and image generation enabled in as many games as possible, showing rather dramatic performance gains compared to its GeForce RTX 3060. This is indeed a major improvement of the new GeForce RTX 4060 graphics card as it can enable high framerates with all the eye candy enabled in the latest games, something the GeForce RTX 3060 just cannot do.(Image credit: Nvidia)The company admits that far not all games support AI frame generation and this is where its GeForce RTX 4060 is only 20% faster than its predecessor. A 20% improvement is still not bad, only it is just not something one would expect from a new generation product based on the all-new architecture.\u00a0Nvidia considers lower power consumption of its GeForce RTX 4060 as another advantage of its new board as it will allow to save some money. Yet, this advantage is less obvious than performance gains.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.(Image credit: Nvidia)Leading graphics cards manufacturers like Asus, Colorful, Gainward, Galax, Gigabyte, Inno3D, KFA2, MSI, Palit, PNY, and Zotac will be releasing the GeForce RTX 4060 graphics cards starting June 29.

Not 106.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will say this again.\n\nNo point in counting DLSS 3 performance boost here, only pure raw rasterized performance if we really want to compare the 4060 with previous gen cards which lack proper support for DLSS3. It is moot.\n\nNvidia claims the card offers a 20% improvement over the GeForce RTX 3060 12 GB in traditional rasterization and bigger gains when RT and DLSS are factored in.\n\nSo, based on Nvidia's specs/claims, since we are getting up to a 70% increase (with DLSS 3) and a 20% increase (without DLSS) over the RTX 3060, that says that DLSS 3 is bad or unfair metric for comparison.

Washington has ramped up efforts to cut China off from key technologies that can support its military.\n    \n\n            The US Department of Commerce has not replied to a CNN request for comment.\n    \n\n            The rules, as reported, could make it harder for companies like Nvidia\n            \n                (NVDA) to sell advanced chips to China. Fueled by a boom in demand for its AI chips, the company briefly hit a market capitalization of $1 trillion in late May.\n    \n\n            \u201cWe are aware of reports that the US Department of Commerce is considering further controls that may restrict exports of our A800 and H800 products to China,\u201d Kress told an investment conference.\n    \n\n            \u201cOver the long-term, restrictions prohibiting the sale of our datacenter GPUs to China, if implemented, would result in a permanent loss of opportunities for US industry to compete and lead in one of the world\u2019s largest markets and impact on our future business and financial results,\u201d she said.\n    \n\n            GPUs refer to graphics processing units, which are chips or electronic circuits capable of rendering graphics for display on electronic devices.\n    \n\n            \u201cGiven the strength of demand for our products worldwide, we do not anticipate that such additional restrictions, if adopted, would have an immediate material impact on our financial results. We do not anticipate any immediate material impact on our financial results,\u201d Kress added.\n    \n\n            Last October, the Biden administration unveiled a sweeping set of export controls that ban Chinese companies from buying advanced chips and chip-making equipment without a license. \n    \n\n            The new move is aimed in part at Nvidia\u2019s A800 chip, which the US-based company created following the introduction of last year\u2019s curbs in order to continue to sell to China, Bloomberg reported.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicron Technology Inc. Double-Data-Rate Synchronous Random-Access Memory (SDRAM) chips are arranged for a photograph in Tokyo, Japan, on Wednesday, July 15, 2015.\n\nTomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nMicron warns of lost revenue after China slaps it with sanctions \n\n\n\n\n            China is a key market for Nvidia. Revenues from mainland China and Hong Kong accounted for 22% of the company\u2019s revenue last year, according to its financial statements.\n    \n\n            On Wednesday, shares of Nvidia slumped as much as 3.2%, before recouping some of the losses. It ended down 1.8%. Chinese AI stocks suffered much heavier losses. \n    \n\n            Inspur Electronic Information Industry fell by 10%, the maximum allowed, on Wednesday in Shenzhen. It dropped again by 5.3% on Thursday. Chengdu Information Technology of Chinese Academy of Sciences slid 12% on Wednesday. Baidu\n            \n                (BIDU), which is developing a rival to ChatGPT, sank 4.4% on Thursday in Hong Kong. \n    \n\n            \u201cThe US could ruin China\u2019s AI party,\u201d Jefferies analyst said in a research note. Local chipsets do not have Nvidia\u2019s GPU ecosystem, thus every update may require reworking, resulting in lower efficiency and higher costs.\n    \n\n            The Biden administration\u2019s chip curbs would be \u201cmuch more effective\u201d in limiting China\u2019s advances in military power driven by AI than rules restricting US investment in China\u2019s tech sector, the analysts added.\n    \n\n            China has strongly criticized US restrictions on tech exports, saying earlier this year that it \u201cfirmly opposes\u201d such measures.\n    \n\n            In May, Beijing banned Chinese operators of critical information infrastructure from buying products from Micron Technology\n            \n                (MU), in apparent retaliation against sanctions imposed by Washington and its allies on the country\u2019s chip sector.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN Business Videos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDEEP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\nCould humans live underwater?

Virtual environments with photo-realistic objects, and robot models with accurate physics are essential for developing and testing robots that perform reliably on sophisticated tasks in the physical world. \u00a0Setting up a high-fidelity simulation, training, and testing environment, however, poses challenges. Installing and configuring simulation tools takes time and expertise, and accurate realistic simulations demand significant computing, network, and storage resources. Precisely repeating and scaling simulations and tests across distributed teams is also challenging.\nThis blog provides a tutorial to address these challenges, showing how to orchestrate NVIDIA Isaac Sim and ROS 2 Navigation on AWS RoboMaker, a cloud-based simulation service that enables robotics developers to run, scale, and automate simulation, using a container image from the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) Public Gallery. The NVIDIA Isaac Robotics Platform provides industry leading simulation photo-realism, with a high performance open source physics engine (NVIDIA PhysX), which makes it ideal for robot simulation.\nSolution overview\nAWS RoboMaker is a fully managed service for running simulations at scale in the cloud without needing to provision servers or networks. AWS RoboMaker also supports running containers based on images from public container registries, including the Amazon ECR Public Gallery. NVIDIA has published an Isaac Sim image to the Amazon ECR Public Gallery, for use with AWS RoboMaker.\nNVIDIA Isaac Sim is a scalable robotics simulation application and synthetic data-generation tool that powers photorealistic, physically accurate virtual environments, and ROS 2 Navigation is a stack that enables a mobile robot to move and complete complex tasks in many types of environments. Running the NVIDIA public container images on AWS RoboMaker in the cloud offers many advantages. Robot developers can launch powerful simulation and training environments in a matter of minutes rather than days and tap nearly unlimited resources, paying only for what\u2019s needed. Teams can also achieve consistency and standardization by using a common set of containers.\nThe tutorial below explains how to run a high-fidelity robotic simulation using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and ROS 2 Navigation as containerized simulation and robot applications on AWS RoboMaker. The tutorial steps include launching an AWS RoboMaker Simulation from the Amazon ECR Public Gallery containing the NVIDIA tools and interacting with the tools via AWS RoboMaker. The example in the tutorial drives a Carter robot through a simulated warehouse environment using the ROS package RViz. An architecture diagram depicting how the simulation is set up is shown below. The AWS RoboMaker simulation job uses a simulation application to orchestrate the simulation environment (Isaac Sim), and a robot application to orchestrate the robot navigation software (ROS 2 Navigation), each based on a separate container, enabling modularity, repeatability, and flexibility. Logs from both applications are aggregated by AWS RoboMaker in Amazon CloudWatch.\nTutorial\n\n\nAWS Architecture to orchestrate NVIDIA Isaac Sim and ROS 2 Navigation containers on AWS RoboMaker\n\nPrerequisites\n\nAn AWS Account\nA user or role with permissions to create and run AWS RoboMaker simulation jobs and to create and store Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) images\nA development environment with the AWS CLI installed, or an AWS Cloud9 environment\n\nTutorial overview\nThe tutorial consists of the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Build the Docker image for the AWS RoboMaker robot application\nStep 2: Create and launch the AWS RoboMaker simulation job\nStep 2a (Optional): Export a simulation JSON file to launch simulations via the AWS CLI\nStep 3: Load a simulation environment in the simulation application\nStep 4: Load and run navigation with RViz in the robot application\n\nStep 1: Build the Docker image for the AWS RoboMaker robot application\nThis step provides specific instructions on how to build the Docker image for the AWS RoboMaker robot application in a Linux environment, but you can build the image in other environments with the files provided below.

The NVIDIA containers need internet access for loading example assets.\nFrom the Security groups drop-down in the Networking section, choose a security group that allows outbound TCP traffic on ports 80 and 443 to allow the container to load NVIDIA example assets.\nFrom the Subnets drop-down in the Networking section, choose at least two subnets. \nChoose Next at the bottom of the page.\n\nFor documentation on creating and editing VPCs, public subnets, and security groups, please refer to the Amazon VPC User Guide.\nConfigure the following for Step 2, Specify robot application, leaving the remaining inputs set to the defaults:\n\nFrom the Choose method section choose Create new application\nIn the Robot application section, \n         \nProvide a name such as ros-2-navigation\nIn the Container image sub-section, make sure the Private radio button is chosen and enter the following URI for the ROS 2 Navigation image you created, substituting the repository URI from the above Step 1: Build the Docker image for the AWS RoboMaker robot application: <repositoryUri>:latest\n \nIn the Robot application configuration section, \n         \nEnter the following into the Launch command field ros2, launch, carter_navigation, carter_navigation.launch.py\nMake sure the Run with streaming session checkbox is chosen \n \nExpand the Robot application tools section and choose Customize tools.\nChoose Add tool and input the information indicated below: \n         \nEnter robot-app-terminal for Tool Name\nEnter /usr/bin/xterm -geometry 120x40 for Command\nChoose Restart from the Exit behavior drop-down\nChoose Enable UI Streaming for Output settings\nMake sure the Send output to Amazon CloudWatch checkbox is chosen \nChoose Add tool\n \nChoose Next at the bottom of the page.\n\nConfigure the following for Step 3, Specify simulation application, leaving the remaining inputs set to the defaults:\n\nFrom the Choose method section choose Create new application\nIn the Simulation application section, \n         \nProvide a Name as isaac-sim\nIn the Container image sub-section, choose the Public radio button and enter the following URI for the NVIDIA Isaac Sim public image: public.ecr.aws/nvidia/isaac-sim-robomaker:latest\n \nIn the Simulation application configuration section, \n         \nInput the following into the Launch command field /isaac-sim/isaac-sim.sh --allow-root\nMake sure the Run with streaming session checkbox is chosen\n \nIn the Environment variables section, choose Add item \n         \nEnter ACCEPT_EULA for Name\nEnter Y for Value\n \nExpand the Simulation application tools section and choose Customize tools.\nChoose Add tool and input the indicated information for the following fields: \n         \nEnter simulation-app-terminal for Tool name\nEnter /usr/bin/xterm -geometry 120x40 for Command\nChoose Restart from the Exit behavior drop-down\nChoose Enable UI Streaming for Output settings\nMake sure the Send output to Amazon CloudWatch checkbox is chosen \nChoose Add tool\n \nChoose Next at the bottom of the page.\n\nOn the Review and create simulation job page, scroll down to the bottom and choose Create. It may take 5-10 minutes for the status of the job to transition to Running. Proceed to Step 3 once the simulation job is in the Running state.\nFor more details on other options when creating AWS RoboMaker simulation jobs, please refer to the AWS RoboMaker Developer Guide.\nStep 2a (Optional): Export a simulation JSON file to launch simulations via the AWS CLI\nWhile the job is launching, you can export a JSON file that can be used with the AWS CLI aws robomaker create-simulation-job command to launch simulations from the command line.\nFirst, copy the job ARN by choosing the copy icon to the left of the ARN in the Details section of the simulation job: \nFrom a terminal enter the following command, replacing <JOB ARN> with the ARN copied above:\naws robomaker describe-simulation-job --job <JOB ARN> >> launch-simulation.json\nYou can now edit this JSON file as desired and launch similar simulations from the command line with a command like:\naws robomaker create-simulation-job --cli-input-json file://<path to the JSON file>\nFor more details on launching AWS RoboMaker simulations from the command line, please refer to the AWS RoboMaker Developer Guide.\nStep 3: Load a simulation environment in the simulation application\nIn this step, you will run NVIDIA Isaac Sim in the simulation application on AWS RoboMaker. You can proceed with the following steps once the simulation job launched in Step 2 is in the Running state.\n\nIf you\u2019re not already on the simulation details page, choose the ID link for the running simulation job. \nChoose Connect on the Simulation application tool \u2013 this will launch the Isaac Sim UI. \nResize the pop-up browser window to fill your entire screen. If you see the message \u201cRTX Loading\u201d, please wait until it disappears, which could take several seconds.\nFrom the Isaac Sim UI top menu, choose Isaac Examples > ROS > Navigation. The example may take a few minutes to load. \nWhen the high-resolution navigation example is loaded choose the Play button on the left of the Isaac Sim UI. \nYou should see the perspective change to a first-person view from the robot, facing a shelf with boxes. \n\nStep 4: Load and run navigation with RViz in the robot app\nIn this step, you will navigate the NVIDIA Carter robot using RViz.\n\nFrom the AWS RoboMaker simulation detail page, choose Connect on the Robot application tool. \nResize the pop-up browser window showing RViz to fill your screen again: \nChoose the Navigation2 Goal button at the top and then click and drag the mouse at the desired location in the map to set the target position and pose for the robot to navigate to. ROS 2 Navigation (Nav2) will now generate a trajectory, and the robot will start moving towards its destination. You can observe the Isaac Sim UI to see the robot moving from the first-person perspective in NVIDIA Isaac Sim in the AWS RoboMaker simulation app.\n\nTo learn more about how to use NVIDIA Isaac Sim, please refer to the tutorials in the NVIDIA Isaac Sim overview. You can use the xterm tool in the AWS RoboMaker robot app to perform command line tasks described in the tutorials. (Since Isaac Sim is already running on AWS RoboMaker with ROS 2 Foxy, you don\u2019t need to perform the installation steps in the tutorials.)\nCleaning up\nWhen you\u2019ve completed the tutorial, remove any resources you created to avoid incurring additional charges:\n\nFrom the simulation job detail page, choose Cancel from Actions drop down, and then choose Continue.\nDelete the robot and simulation applications\nDelete the AWS IAM role created in step 1 of this tutorial\nDelete the Amazon ECR repository\n\nConclusion\nIn this blog you have learned how to run high-fidelity simulations using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and ROS 2 Navigation on AWS RoboMaker, leveraging the new capability to load container images, including one from a public repository, into AWS RoboMaker. Running simulations in the cloud using pre-packaged container images saves time setting up the sophisticated tools for high-fidelity simulation. In addition, it provides a very cost-effective way to tap the considerable compute, storage, and networking resources required to run realistic simulations, paying for only what you use. Finally, containers can promote standardization across teams, increasing efficiency and repeatability in the design and testing phases.

Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and her financier husband intentionally sold 25,000 shares of Nvidia at a loss last July to avoid public scrutiny, leaving behind millions of dollars in unrealized profit had they held onto the chipmaker stock amid its meteoric rise this year.\nThe Pelosis' ill-fated Nvidia sale last summer was no accident.Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\n\nPaul Pelosi sold 25,000 shares of Nvidia at a share price of $165.05 on July 26, 2022, his politician wife disclosed in a regulatory filing at the time, taking a $341,365 loss on a stake worth $4.1 million.\n\n\n\nThat same position was worth $10.5 million Friday, when Nvidia traded at $422 per share, meaning Pelosi left more than $6 million on the table by closing his position on the chipmaker when he did.\n\n\n\nBut the ill-timed trade was intentional: Drew Hammill, Nancy Pelosi\u2019s then-deputy chief of staff, told Forbes last year that Paul Pelosi \u201cdecided to sell the shares at a loss rather than allow the misinformation in the press regarding this trade to continue,\u201d alluding to the sale coming shortly before the Senate\u2019s passage of legislation aimed at boosted domestic chipmakers like Nvidia.\n\n\n\nNvidia shares are up about 155% since Pelosi\u2019s trade, making it by far the best-performing stock on the S&P 500, according to FactSet data, riding the artificial intelligence boom to by far the highest share price in the company\u2019s 24-year trading history.\n\n\n\n\nKey Background\nThe Pelosis still own between $15 million and $75 million million worth of American tech giants Alphabet, Amazon and Apple despite holding no Nvidia, according to their annual financial disclosure. Paul Pelosi exercised $2.6 million worth of stock options in Apple and Microsoft last week. Headquartered just south of Pelosi\u2019s congressional district in Santa Clara, Nvidia became the seventh $1 trillion company earlier this year after beating Wall Street\u2019s expectations for recent sales and sharing \u201ccosmological\u201d profit forecasts due largely to its generative AI segment.\n\nTangent\nEight members of Congress have bought Nvidia stock over the last year, making it one of the most popular stocks on the Hill, according to Quiver Quantitative\u2019s tracker. They include Sens. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) and Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) and Reps. Daniel Goldman (D-N.Y.), Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), Jonathan Jackson (D-Ill.), Kathy Manning (D-N.C.) and Morgan McGarvey (D-Ky.). Several Democratic and Republican politicians have supported a ban on all trading activity among Congress members and their direct relatives, though legislation has yet to move forward in a meaningful way.\n\nFurther Reading\nPelosi Unloads Millions In Nvidia Stock At A Loss Before Senate Passes Massive Tech Subsidies (Forbes)\nPelosi Exercises $2.6 Million Of Apple And Microsoft Stock Options (Forbes)\n\nBigger Than Amazon?

NVIDIA has a BlueField-3 DPU paired with an NVIDIA A100 GPU in a massive card. One way to look at the card is that it is \u201csimply\u201d an accelerator card. The other way to look at the NVIDIA AX800 is it is a server with 16x Arm cores, 32GB of memory and 40GB of storage, an ASPEED BMC, an A100 GPU, and over 400Gbps of total networking, plus NVLink on a single card.\nNVIDIA AX800 High-End Arm Server on a PCIe Card\nThe new NVIDIA AX800 combines two main components:\n\nA NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPU\nA NVIDIA A100 80GB\n\nBoth of these are combined into a single dual-slot card with a 350W TDP and a minimum of only 150W TDP. This is up from the 300W of the previous generation NVIDIA A100X, but while the GPU remains the same, we get a much faster DPU.\nNVIDIA AX800 A100X A30X Specs\nThe fun part about this card is that the I/O panel looks like a NIC with the two QSFP56 ports and the out-of-band management port for a 1GbE connection to the ASPEED AST2600 BMC. We will quickly note here that NVIDIA is using two QSFP56 cages each at 200Gbps VPI so they can run in Ethernet or InfiniBand mode. We recently did our\u00a0NVIDIA ConnectX-7 400GbE and NDR Infiniband Adapter Review and that utilized OSFP cages which were less than exciting to work with.\nNVIDIA AX800 With Heatsink And NVLink Covers\nAs much as the rear looks like a NIC or a DPU, the rest of the card looks like a professional NVIDIA GPU even with features like NVLink on top. The NVLink on this card needs to be linked directly to another card and is not meant to link to multiple GPUs simultaneously.\nStill, the card has some impressive specs. From what we can understand, this is not an integrated DPU-GPU at the die level since we can see two packages on the board. Instead, this is a PCIe-connected card that combines the specs of a GPU and DPU onto a single card. Here are some of the highlights:\nKey NVIDIA A100 GPU Specs\n\n\nGPU generation: NVIDIA A100 \u201cAmpere\u201d\nGPU base clock: 840MHz\nGPU maximum boost clock: 1.41GHz\nGPU memory clock: 1.593GHz\nGPU memory type: HBM2e\nGPU memory size 80GB\nGPU memory bus width 5,120-bits\nGPU peak memory bandwidth Up to 2,039GB/s\n\n\nKey NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPU Specs\n\n\nDPU generation: NVIDIA BlueField-3\nDPU core generation: Arm v8.2 A78\nDPU core quantity: 16\nDPU memory clock: 5,600MHz\nDPU memory type: DDR5\nDPU memory size: 32GB\nDPU memory bus width: 128-bits\nDPU peak memory bandwidth:\u00a0Up to 89.6GB/s\nDPU storage: 40GB eMMC\nDPU accelerators:\n\nHardware root of trust\nRegEx\nIPsec/TLS data-in-motion encryption\nAES-XTS 256/512-bit data-at-rest encryption\nSHA 256-bit hardware acceleration\nHardware public key accelerator\nTrue random number generator\n\n\nDPU BMC: ASPEED AST2600\n\n\n\nThese are some big specs for a DPU or a GPU, let alone a converged product. It also appears to be one of the lower-TDP NVIDIA A100 implementations out there.\n\nFinal Words\nTo recap, this card has:\n\nA 16-core Arm CPU, with its own 32GB of memory, and a 40GB eMMC boot drive\nDual 200Gbps Ethernet/ InfiniBand networking\nA NVIDIA A100 80GB GPU\nNVLink for a high-speed interconnect\nA BMC for out-of-band management\nA PCIe connector\n\nIn most cases, we would consider that a complete server and a fairly high-end one at that. This is one of the most unique DPUs or GPUs out there that really does not fit neatly into a segment. NVIDIA is targeting these at the Telco markets, but it is one of those products that we wish had broader availability because it feels like something that could have a PCIe switch chip hung off of it to make amazing AI-enabled edge server nodes.\nNVIDIA AX800 Drawing\nAs a fun aside, we are covering it in June 2023, but we have had this draft in progress since Computex 2023 in May. It just, somehow, was released and got no coverage. Hopefully, this helps the card get a bit more exposure.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n TAGSA100AmpereBlueField-3DPUNVIDIA \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleQNAP TS-1655 12-Bay Plus 4-Bay NAS Revew with an Intel Atom C5125Next articleIntel Manufacturing Gets its Own Profit and Loss Potentially Gearing Up for a Spin-Off Rohit Kumar  \n \nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAcemagic F3A an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 Mini PC with up to 128GB of RAM \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASUS ESC8000A-E13P Review an 8x PCIe GPU Server \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASRock Rack 4U8G-TURIN2 A Fresh Take on a Classic AI Server Design \n\n  \n\n\n\n5 COMMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nemerth\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            June 20, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            11:07 am                                            \n\n\n\nDoes it run it\u2019s own OS image separate from the host server?\nAt some point nV has to just give up on the PCIe appendage and admit these things are servers outright.

I would expect a refresh of this using the newer generation parts to arrive in 12-18 months.  The real question is if the next generation arrives before Hopper\u2019s replacement.\nWhat is interesting is that this card does have three nvLink interfaces which presumably can link to three other cards like this or three A100 PCIe cards.  What is interesting is that while BlueField has direct access to the A100, mixing this with a normal A100 would also add the host system into the mix.  Essentially room for some interesting heterogenous computing and memory mapping topologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nssnseawolf\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            June 20, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            8:22 pm                                            \n\n\n\n@Kevin G If I recall correctly, all three bridges must be connected to the same sibling. Using one card\u2019s three NVLink bridges to connect to more than one sibling isn\u2019t a supported configuration.

In the specs it says \u201c40GB eMMC boot drive\u201d which seems to imply that it\u2019s capable of running an operating system. If it was just scratch storage it would not say boot drive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nabufrejoval\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            June 28, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            7:38 pm                                            \n\n\n\nI guess these are basically designed for passive PCI[e] backplane systems which hark back to S100 or VME bus systems for industrial use or simply predate \u201cmotherboards\u201d, which are a microcomputer invention.\nI guess the main disadvantage is that you can\u2019t use these to build your own home-brew DGX and that they are really designed for the most advanced edge AI surveillance inference systems they seem to run in Mellanox\u2019 home country.\nThere have been plenty of CPU plug-in boards for PCs over the decades, even including a small IBM mainframe at one point. But just putting one of these in a server might not get you very far as the motherboard and this \u201cadd-in\u201d card may not agree on who is the PCIe root.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEAVE A REPLY\n\n\nPlease enter your comment!\n\n\nPlease enter your name here\n\n\n\nYou have entered an incorrect email address!\nPlease enter your email address here\n\n\n\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign me up for the STH newsletter! \n\n\u0394 \nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Vaughan-Nichols \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you think about artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), the OpenStack Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud, and its object storage component, Swift is not the first technology to come to mind. But that\u2019s exactly what trillion-dollar-plus chip and AI powerhouse Nvidia uses to power its ML efforts.\nJohn Dickinson, Nvidia\u2019s Principal Systems Software Engineer, explained at the recent OpenInfra Summit that ML requires speedy, robust storage solutions. \u201cWith the rise of AI and ML technologies, our primary role as storage providers is to fuel the engine with as much data as possible, as quickly as possible,\u201d said Dickinson. To keep up with the increasing demand, storage solutions must offer high capacity, availability, and aggregate throughput.\nEnter Swift\nTrue, Dickinson continued, \u201cWhile Nvidia\u2019s Grace and Hopper chips and spectrum switches are pushing the boundaries in the computing and networking domains, storage speed is also vital.\u201d Open source Swift, a distributed object storage system designed to scale from a single machine to thousands of servers, is optimized for multitenancy and high concurrency. A simple, REST-based API is normally used to access Swift.\nDuring his keynote at the conference, Dickinson illustrated the ML workflow, emphasizing the significance of understanding data access patterns while building the supporting storage systems. After all, ML demands massive datasets that are much too large to fit into GPU memory or server flash storage.\nAccording to Dickinson, the answer lies in object storage. This offers high-throughput and large capacity, albeit with differing APIs. While object storage presents its own set of challenges, including caching complexities and varying APIs, he firmly stated that the goal is to \u201cenable users to do what was previously impossible.\u201d\nTwo Key Concepts \u2014 Inner and Outer\nNvidia, he disclosed, is implementing two key concepts to tackle these issues \u2014 an \u201cinner ring\u201d and an \u201couter ring\u201d. The inner ring is characterized by high speed, low latency, and its connection to a specific GPU cluster, resembling file storage for the end users. The outer ring, on the other hand, offers large capacity, high throughput, and high availability. For the outer ring, Nvidia uses Swift, thanks to its suitability for large capacity and high throughput storage.\nImplementing these storage concepts has enabled Nvidia to support massive datasets that were previously impossible to handle, improve performance, and increase workload portability. Swift also delivers improved I/O performance with a single read from the outer ring on the ML first epoch, This outer ring data is also accessible from every compute cluster. In addition, since Swift supports many standard APIs such as POSIX and NFS for file access and S3, Azure, and native Swift for object access, it\u2019s very easy to work with the datasets regardless of how you need to access them.\nThe strategy continues beyond providing inner and outer rings. Acknowledging the increasing difficulty of data exploration as datasets grow, Nvidia has created a dataset service aiming to simplify this process. In a live demonstration, Dickinson showcased how these storage services facilitate large-scale machine learning, highlighting how a user can load a dataset into Swift, explore it in a Jupyter notebook, and run an ML task without worrying about the down and dirty details of accessing that storage.\nThis live demo impressed the OpenInfra audience of about 750 users. It\u2019s rare that a technical audience is impressed by a demo. They\u2019ve seen it all, and they know all the tricks. But this one caught their attention. OpenStack and Swift have a clear role to play in serious work with massive ML datasets.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tTRENDING STORIES\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup\nCreated with Sketch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSteven J.

It's a beast. It has 528 GPU tensor cores, supports up to 480GB of CPU RAM and 96GB of GPU RAM, and boasts a GPU memory bandwidth of up to 4TB per second.\nWe've previously covered the Nvidia H100 Hopper chip, which is currently Nvidia's most powerful data center GPU. It powers AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT, and it marked a significant upgrade over 2020's A100 chip, which powered the first round of training runs for many of the news-making generative AI chatbots and image generators we're talking about today.\nFaster GPUs roughly translate into more powerful generative AI models because they can run more matrix multiplications in parallel (and do it faster), which is necessary for today's artificial neural networks to function.\nThe GH200 takes that \"Hopper\" foundation and combines it with Nvidia's \"Grace\" CPU platform (both named after computer pioneer Grace Hopper), rolling it into one chip through Nvidia's NVLink chip-to-chip (C2C) interconnect technology. Nvidia expects the combination to dramatically accelerate AI and machine-learning applications in both training (creating a model) and inference (running it).\n\u201cGenerative AI is rapidly transforming businesses, unlocking new opportunities and accelerating discovery in healthcare, finance, business services and many more industries,\u201d said Ian Buck, vice president of accelerated computing at Nvidia, in a press release. \u201cWith Grace Hopper Superchips in full production, manufacturers worldwide will soon provide the accelerated infrastructure enterprises needed to build and deploy generative AI applications that leverage their unique proprietary data.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the company, key features of the GH200 include a new 900GB/s coherent (shared) memory interface, which is seven times faster than PCIe Gen5. The GH200 also offers 30 times higher aggregate system memory bandwidth to the GPU compared to the aforementioned Nvidia DGX A100. Additionally, the GH200 can run all Nvidia software platforms, including the Nvidia HPC SDK, Nvidia AI, and Nvidia Omniverse.\nNotably, Nvidia also announced that it will be building this combo CPU/GPU chip into a new supercomputer called the DGX GH200, which can utilize the combined power of 256 GH200 chips to perform as a single GPU, providing 1 exaflop of performance and 144 terabytes of shared memory, nearly 500 times more memory than the previous-generation Nvidia DGX A100.\nThe DGX GH200 will be capable of training giant next-generation AI models (GPT-6, anyone?) for generative language applications, recommender systems, and data analytics. Nvidia did not announce pricing for the GH200, but according to Anandtech, a single DGX GH200 computer is \"easily going to cost somewhere in the low 8 digits.\"\nOverall, it's reasonable to say that thanks to continued hardware advancements from vendors like Nvidia and Cerebras, high-end cloud AI models will likely continue to become more capable over time, processing more data and doing it much faster than before. Let's just hope they don't argue with tech journalists.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Nvidia\u2019s powerful H100 GPU will ship in October\n          \n\n            Nvidia's \"Hopper\" AI chip is in full production, eight major vendors shipping products soon.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Hungry for AI?

Antony reviews and covers the latest PC hardware and laptop technologyFollow AuthorJun 30, 2023, 12:43pm EDTSave ArticleCommentNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has revealed it has no plans to release a new GPU architecture for PC gamers until at least 2025. The news comes as a blow to PC gamers hoping future upgrades might land sooner than that and offer more of a performance increase than current RTX 40-series graphics cards.\n\nThe latter are suffering from slow sales, in part due to higher prices for some models compared to previous generations, but many suspect the average performance gains over older models to be a reason too. Nvidia has touted its frame rate-boosting DLSS technology as a major feature, and in game titles it's available for, it does provide great performance.\n\nNvidia's RTX 40-seriesNvidia\nHowever, the vast majority of games out there do not support it and with the modest gains in some instances over previous generation cards outside of DLSS, the RTX 40-series cards such as the RTX 4060, RTX 4060 Ti and RTX 4070 don't always offer huge gains over the RTX 30-series.\n\nNvidia's next GPU architecture may not arrive till 2025Nvidia via Hardwareluxx.de\nThis is where future architectures come in, but according to the above slide shared by Hardwareluxx.de, we could be in for a long wait when it comes to an architecture-based performance boost. It clearly shows Ada Lovelace-Next, which is the next GPU architecture, will not arrive until 2025. With a usual time span of two years between architectures pointing at a fall 2024 launch, 2025 is a lot longer than gamers are used to.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\n\n\nHowever, this likely won't mean zero launches from Nvidia till then. First and foremost we have more launches for the RTX 40-series inbound, starting with the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB in July, followed by what will likely be an RTX 4050. There may also be refreshes of current models too, like we saw with the RTX 20-series 'Super' models as well as a rumored RTX 4090 Ti.\n\nWhether its down to sluggish sales or attempts to meet sales targets, we can't be sure yet, but in the meantime GPU prices are at least starting to fall as the pressure of new models sits on older ones with the hope that those holding out for upgrades may take the plunge over the summer. We have yet to see AMD plug the huge gap between the RX 7600 and RX 7900 XT too, which should put further pressure on prices.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAda Lovelace\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nAs a demonstration of the Nvidia H100's (Hopper) AI training prowess, an army of only 3,584 Hopper GPUs trained a GPT-3-based model in just 11 minutes. During that press briefing, Nvidia shared an updated roadmap detailing the company's next-generation products, including the successor to the GeForce RTX 40-series Ada Lovelace GPUs, some of the best graphics cards for gaming available today.According to the roadmap, Nvidia plans to unleash \"Ada Lovelace-Next\" graphics cards in 2025. Assuming the chipmaker continues with the current naming scheme, the next-generation GeForce products should hit the market as the GeForce RTX 50 series. For obvious reasons, Nvidia didn't reveal the codename for Ada Lovelace's successor. Some believe it could be Blackwell, a familiar codename from the Nvidia hack. However, we think Blackwell is likely the successor to Hopper, which Nvidia has labeled as \"Hopper Next\" on the roadmap.Nvidia has typically adhered to a two-year cadence for consumer graphics cards. For instance, the chipmaker launched Pascal in 2016, Turing in 2018, Ampere in 2020, and not so long ago, Ada Lovelace in 2022. If Nvidia launches Ada Lovelace's successor in 2025, the company would be breaking the usual rhythm and pushing the cadence closer to three years, or 30 months if the chipmaker aims for an early 2025 release.(Image credit: Nvidia)That said, Nvidia's AI business is flourishing. The recent AI trend has generated significant demand for Nvidia's GPUs, such as the latest H100 or the previous-generation A100. ByteDance has reportedly ordered $1 billion worth of Nvidia GPUs just this year. Despite the export restrictions, Nvidia has continued to grow its AI business in China, one of the world's biggest markets. The restrictions have forced Nvidia to nerf some of its best AI products and release particular SKUs like the H800 or A800 to meet the export requirements.\n\nBut let's look at it in another way. The export regulations have favored Nvidia since it means the chipmaker's customers must buy more GPUs to get the equivalent performance from the vanilla variants.It's understandable why Nvidia may prioritize compute GPU production over gaming GPUs. A recent report claims that the chipmaker has allegedly increased the production of its compute GPU products. Nvidia isn't facing tough competition from AMD's RDNA 3 product stack, and Intel doesn't currently pose a serious threat to the GPU duopoly. In other words, Nvidia has the luxury of procrastinating a bit on the consumer side.Nvidia recently expanded its GeForce RTX 40-series product stack to (or at least close to) the bottom of the ladder with the GeForce RTX 4060 and GeForce RTX 4060 Ti. There's the potential for a GeForce RTX 4050 as well as additional options at the top like an RTX 4080 Ti or GeForce RTX 4090 Ti. Nvidia could also offer up a Titan RTX Ada. The ongoing leaks of an Nvidia quad-slot cooler suggest that at least one of these monsters exists.\u00a0And if push ever comes to shove, Nvidia could always take a play out of its old Turing playbook and refresh Ada Lovelace, giving it the 'Super' treatment, extending its Ada lineup even further. But one thing seems clear: No one should expect a true follow-up to the Lovelace architecture anytime this year or next.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nrdna\nAda Lovelace\nGeForce\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (20)\n\n\n\nZhiye LiuSocial Links NavigationNews Editor and Memory ReviewerZhiye Liu is a news editor and memory reviewer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

Some believe it could be Blackwell, a familiar codename from the Nvidia hack. However, we think Blackwell is likely the successor to Hopper, which Nvidia has labeled as \"Hopper Next\" on the roadmap.\nYeah, Blackwell is most likely to be an HPC and AI-only GPU architecture. The successor to Ada Lovelace is currently labeled as 'Ada Lovelace-Next' , so that should come a year later in 2025.\n\nSo the most obvious guess would be that Nvidia can release the AD103, AD104, & AD106 chips with higher core counts and higher VRAM as either a \"Ti\" or a \"SUPER\" refresh.\n\nLet's not count AD102 GPU die here, because the green team already have the fastest card around, the RTX 4090, and due to no competition in this segment, there is no need to launch the RTX 4090 Ti at the moment.\n\nBut maybe when AMD's RDNA 4 Radeon RX 8000 series cards arrive ? \n\nAlso, since the RTX 4080 and 4060 Ti both utilize a cut-down chip, AD103 and AD106 die, there might be a possibility that these chips can be used in the full-fat version as well. Obviously, with faster clocks and faster memory dies to make for a decent refresher in mid-2024 before the company rolls out its brand-new architecture for gamers in 2025.\n\nKeep Pressing F5 for refresh !\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmdlova\n\n\nwith the price of silicon too high... waiting will be good for consumer... maybe use intel new fabs\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFantastic news! That means 4090 is gonna last even longer in high-end gaming! Which makes it an even better investment!\n\nNvidia, is more than dominant in the GPU market, and it shows. No need to rush, when there's no competition.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit_user\n\n\nMeanwhile, AMD could do a RDNA3 refresh on N4. I'm not saying they will, but it seems like a relatively low-cost option for them to improve their competitiveness without a wholesale new generation.\n\nTBH, I was kinda hoping they would do that with Zen4, also. Release a Zen4+, late this year, to counter Raptor Refresh and Emerald Rapids. They could hopefully improve their heatspreader situation, while they're at it.\n\nBeing realistic, AMD is getting beaten up so badly in the consumer market that it's hard to see how any near-term investment would be justified. More likely, we'll just see continued focus on drivers and AI.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotonaxon\n\n\nAI is just a marketing (BS) fad, like cloud computing a few years back. If you think AI is real, you don't know much about computing.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwatzupken\n\n\nThis shows a few things,\n1. Gaming market is secondary if not tertiary to Nvidia - this is the same story during the mining craze where all GPUs and focus was diverted to miners. The prove is really post the mining craze, there was a flood of GPUs that still remained unsold till now, which means that the supply has always been there, but just diverted to miners through the back door. The light hash rate bifurcation is just a facade. \n2. Lack of competition - AMD and Intel are just too uncompetitive. AMD in particular tends to try and solve the problem by dropping price which is great. But the perception of less stable driver persist. And to be honest, it is factual given that there are known day 1 issues that still remains on their \u201cknown issue\u201d list even till now. \n\nThe PC gaming market is in my opinion, slowly dying. What was previously an affordable gaming platform is no longer the case. Understand that it costs more to produce anything now, but does not negate the fact that it is getting costly to game on PC. The better hardware is also immediately negated by the burden of the OS and games that is so taxing. I think it is a record that the flagship GPU, the RTX 4090 in this case, already struggles to deliver to 60 FPS at native 4K in some of the new rebooted titles within 6 months. Stretching it to 3 years for a refresh is not going to help. And I do expect whatever replacement in 2025 will run into the same problem, on top of increasing cost. At the lower end that can benefit from a newer and better GPU architecture, instead now we get planned obsolescence by means of limiting VRAM/ memory bus, on top of higher cost for the higher performance.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwatzupken\n\n\nbit_user said:Meanwhile, AMD could do a RDNA3 refresh on N4.

The media don\u2019t help either because a lot of them are likely paid to try and paint a very bad picture of the driver and FSR. In reality, as a user of AMD GPUs now and then, I rarely find teething issues, and FSR generally works ok for me. Visual artefacts are there, but it wasn\u2019t terrible in my opinion, when you are considering between dropping graphic settings or just switching on FSR to maintain a level of FPS on older GPUs. It is not that AMD drivers are close to perfect because it is very clear they are behind Nvidia. Things like higher idle power for example have been on their \u201cknown issues\u201d list for a long time, but still sits there for whatever reasons 6 to 7 months after the product release. While annoying, it does not affect the performance of games.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmdlova\n\n\nThe amd sell well on third world... but with this launch \"RX 7600\" who drooped the prices one day before... make the people holding the wallet. AMD has the inferior product, make some people rage about that. Here the rx 7600 have price point of 400$ in some weeks will be at 300$ or ever lower. Why spend money in something you will lost 50% of value in weeks. For other hand every nvidia card has the value unchanged over months. \nI'am waiting the 4060 review before decide where to throw the wallet.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgentBirdnest\n\n\nbit_user said:TBH, I was kinda hoping they would do that with Zen4, also.

I'll probably afford one around the holidays, and am hoping that waiting patiently might let me get a better card for the money. If not, either way, I'll still get a video card and be really happy with it.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit_user\n\n\nPhotonaxon said:AI is just a marketing (BS) fad, like cloud computing a few years back.Like cloud computing?

Gold Rush\n\n\nBy\n      \nEmily Peck\n\n\nJune 09, 202310:15 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n  \n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nComment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n  \n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nComment\n    \n\n\n\n\nNvidia, the company that dominates the market for graphics processing units, was once known mostly in the video game world. But these days, Nvidia GPUs are also the go-to source for the massive computing power needed to run generative A.I. systems\u2014and the recent explosion in A.I. hype has propelled the company\u2019s stock into the stratosphere. Nvidia briefly hit a trillion-dollar valuation, putting itself in league with tech giants like Alphabet and Apple and launching a bit of a frenzy in the markets. Nvidia is looking like the first big stock win of the A.I. era, and investors are salivating.\nOn Sunday\u2019s episode of What Next: TBD, I spoke with Don Clark, a freelance reporter who specializes in the chips industry, about how Nvidia rode the A.I. revolution, became the hottest chipmaker in the world, and made the entire A.I. craze suddenly seem very real. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\n\n\n\nEmily Peck: In 1993, Nvidia was just an idea that CEO Jensen Huang and a couple of his friends were mapping out inside a Denny\u2019s\u2014the stuff of Silicon Valley myth. At that moment, what were they focused on?\nDon Clark: They basically set out to do the graphics job. Gaming was a big thing. CPUs didn\u2019t do it very well, so they started in that business and they rode it really hard\u2014basically anything that\u2019s visual about computing, they were there. They were always involved in the chips that made movies, chips that scientists use to visualize things. Anything that involves painting images on a screen, Nvidia has just been pushing the envelope constantly. They\u2019ve spent $37 billion in research since the company\u2019s inception.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there something about Jensen that makes him at the forefront of this, something that is making him take risks that others aren\u2019t?\nGenerally speaking, when your CEO is very deep technically, those are the glory days of any company. When Bill Gates was running Microsoft, they were kicking ass; when Steve Jobs was running Apple, they were kicking ass. The great leaders who have really helped the industry, no engineer can snow them about, \u201cOh, it\u2019s too complicated,\u201d or \u201cWe can\u2019t do it.\u201d Jensen is very, very deep technically, and he reads all the scientific literature, he talks to the scientists directly. He was a young maverick in 1993, and now he\u2019s 60\u2014but he still gives off that energy.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the A.I. rush. Their chips are some of the most advanced on the market, and they\u2019ve been the leading chipmaker that powers A.I. systems for almost a decade now. What does that mean for the company?\nThere\u2019s an argument to be made that A.I. is going to change every single bit of software. Think of every single thing that has intelligence in it, from your toaster to your car\u2014it all has software in it. Jensen describes basically how the many trillions of dollars of investment in the data centers of the world are all going to be changed to do this kind of A.I. way of working. Nvidia famously was in phones and decided to get out of it; they just decided to focus on data centers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Nvidia has seen immense growth on the back of a new technology it powers. During the crypto boom, Nvidia GPUs were highly sought-after by crypto miners, and as crypto went gangbusters, Nvidia\u2019s stocks soared, only to crash back down to earth along with the crypto markets. What makes the A.I. boom distinct?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nBasically, crypto miners were competing with gamers for the same kind of GPUs used to power video games, and so the stock got this bubble. It was very hard to quantify because nobody quite knew how much of Nvidia\u2019s numbers reflected the crypto boom, and so they got hit when it all sort of unwound. But the A.I. boom is about changing everything we do. I mean, every Google search you do now is powered by A.I.; every time you look up somebody on Facebook and people are recommended, that\u2019s A.I. It\u2019s not a fad, it is inevitable.\nI cover markets for Axios and we\u2019ve been watching Nvidia stock do really well this year. But when it recently touched a trillion-dollar valuation\u2014in league with Apple, Amazon, Microsoft\u2014that felt like it came out of nowhere. Did it surprise you?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nI knew it was going to be a big quarter, but I did not expect it was going to be like that. The markets are always six months ahead of predicting these cycles. Last year was a terrible year for semiconductor stocks. But then, if you think the cycle\u2019s going to turn, you want to be the first person to bet on getting in there\u2014so basically there was a lot of premature betting that there was going to be this turnaround.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated From Slate\n\n\n\n\n\nEmily Peck\nCan the U.S. Bring Chip Manufacturing Home?\nRead More\n\n\n\nNvidia has seen a rush of orders for its chips\u2014why is that? Was it the introduction of ChatGPT that kind of upped the level of competition in the overall A.I. market and pushed companies to ramp up?\nThat\u2019s basically what happened. Microsoft and OpenAI did this deal, and it was announced last year, with Nvidia saying tens of thousands of GPUs were involved. So everyone else realized they had to up their generative A.I. game. All these cloud providers are basically using GPUs in two ways. They have their own A.I. jobs that they\u2019re doing internally for themselves, and then, with the exception of Meta, they\u2019re also selling computing cycles to other people. So if you\u2019re a startup and you want to do A.I., what you\u2019re usually doing is not buying a GPU, you\u2019re going to AWS and using their Nvidia-powered computing service.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nBut because of how much companies rely on Nvidia for their infrastructure, Nvidia\u2019s biggest competitors are also their biggest customers, right?\nI would say the most serious competition to Nvidia is the internally developed A.I. chips at Google and Amazon, and because they know the job pretty specifically and they can tailor their software for it, they can get a pretty good cost reduction in doing this A.I. work.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle\u2019s most famous for doing it. They do some of their own work and sell some work on their own TPU chips. Amazon, which has done a lot of its own chips for other parts of the computing jobs, recently introduced a couple of A.I. chips itself, which it says are starting to get traction, although it\u2019s pretty early days.\n\n\n        Popular in\n        \n          Technology\n        \n\n\n\n\n                        \n            Want to Protect Your Stock Market Investments? Do This One Very Boring Thing.\n          \n\n\n\n                        \n            Yes, RFK Jr., Some Studies Suggest That Vitamin A Protects Against Measles. But There\u2019s a Major Catch That Parents Need to Know.\n          \n\n\n\n                        \n            I Spent a Day Looking Only at What Donald Trump Fans See Online. Sure Does Look Nice From Here.\n          \n\n\n\n                        \n            He Used to Make Videos About NYC Real Estate. Then He Became Radicalized by the Right.\n          \n\n\n\nI believe you that everything\u2019s going to be running on A.I., and it\u2019s the future\u2014but it still has this feeling, looking at the stock market, looking at Nvidia\u2019s stock price and all the coverage right now \u2026 it has bubble vibes. It reminds me of the dot-com boom.\nI\u2019m not defending the current stock price of Nvidia, because there\u2019s all kinds of speculative stuff in there. And the money flows like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m a fund and I need to get some A.I. in my portfolio, who can I buy?\u201d So if we\u2019re having this conversation two years from now, would I think Nvidia\u2019s stock price would be where it is now? I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s guaranteed at all.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nI wouldn\u2019t discount anything about the revenue they\u2019re going to get from A.I. The question is going to be how is that factored into how much the stock price is already inflated. That\u2019s one of the things about this whole semiconductor space: It\u2019s not enough to build one great chip, you have to have a roadmap of better, better, better, and each one of those things costs hundreds of millions of dollars to develop. So it\u2019s not a game for the faint of heart.\n\n\n\nView Transcript\n\nHow has Nvidia simplified getting into the A.I. business?\nPeople underestimate the software. Nvidia makes it so easy, relatively speaking, to get into A.I. They have a university to teach people how to do stuff, they have their own supercomputers that sell cycles to other people, they sell reference designs for other server makers to make things, they have all these pretrained A.I. models that they give you for specific jobs and specific industries. They have built up just a huge software moat around their business.\n\nFuture Tense\n    is a partnership of\n    Slate,\n    New America, and\n    Arizona State University\n    that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society.\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n  \n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nComment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n              Artificial Intelligence\n            \n\n\n              Video Games\n            \n\n\n              Stock Market\n            \n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nWork With Us\nContact\nPitch Guidelines\nSend Us Tips\nCorrections\nCommenting\nReprints\n\n\n\nSubscriptions\n\nSubscribe\nGroup Subscriptions\nSign In\nAccount\nSubscription FAQs\nPodcast FAQs\nNewsletters\nCustomer Support\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\nAdChoices\nCookie Preferences\n\n\n\n\nThe Slate Group logo\n\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n            Facebook\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Twitter\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Instagram\n          \n\n\n\n\n            YouTube\n          \n\n\n\n\n            RSS Feed\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\n\nAll contents \u00a9\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

For GeForce RTX gamers, the update also includes support for NVIDIA DLSS 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIME BREAKER Available Now With DLSS 2\nDLSS 2 and 3 can be added to many games with just a few clicks thanks to engine plugins, giving GeForce RTX gamers faster performance and an even better experience. On Steam, there are dozens of indie games leveraging DLSS 2 and its plugins, including SHK Interactive\u2019s TIME BREAKER, a first-person puzzle game with time control. Players tackle impossible puzzles by thinking how and when the time can be slowed down to complete challenge rooms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIME BREAKER also features ray-tracing ambient occlusion, ray-traced reflections, and ray-traced shadows - activate DLSS 2 to accelerate your frame rate and enable you to enjoy all of these effects at high resolutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 4060 Available Now\nIn May we announced the GeForce RTX 4060 Family, and launched the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti. Today, the GeForce RTX 4060 goes on sale, with prices starting at $299. For gamers playing on previous-gen GPUs, the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture at the heart of the GeForce RTX 4060 delivers a massive upgrade, multiplying your performance, and supercharging creative apps. And thanks to the Ada architecture\u2019s industry-leading efficiency, you\u2019ll use measurably less power, your graphics card will run cooler, and fans will run at quieter speeds or even idle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cUnleash the GeForce RTX 4060 in Dying Light 2 Stay Human and high frame rates at max settings is no sweat\" - Tomasz Sza\u0142kowski, Techland. See the performance and efficiency of the new GeForce RTX 4060 in these clips from Dying Light 2 Stay Human, Returnal, and Warhammer 40,000: Darktide.\u00a0\nBased on the May 2023 Steam Hardware Survey, 9 of the top 10 most used GPUs on Steam are 60 Class or lower, and 77% of Steam gamers play at 1080p or lower resolutions. For these gamers, the new GeForce RTX 4060 is a great upgrade, enabling them to play new, more demanding games at 1080p at excellent levels of fidelity. For gamers coming from a GeForce RTX 2060, performance is multiplied by an average of 2.3X across a suite of 18 games, and for GeForce GTX 1060 users, in addition to higher frame rates, they also get ray tracing and DLSS acceleration for the first time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese substantial improvements enable you to enjoy the majority of games at high frames with max settings including ray tracing. And thanks to NVIDIA DLSS 3, you can experience some of the industry\u2019s most advanced games running at over 100 FPS, at the highest possible detail levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to the Ada architecture\u2019s industry-leading efficiency, the average gamer playing 10-20 hours a week could save a significant amount at recent energy prices, while having a vastly superior gaming experience. In Germany, for example, a gamer playing 20 hours a week could save up to $132 in energy costs over the course of 4 years, when upgrading from an RTX 3060 to an RTX 4060.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources: Euronews (Germany, UK), energysage (US)\nAll GeForce RTX GPU owners can also tap into an ecosystem of apps and technologies to further enhance gaming, work and creativity. Get the fastest ray tracing performance with GeForce RTX 40 Series and its dedicated 3rd gen Ray Tracing Cores. Make gameplay in over 70 titles more responsive with Reflex.

Don\u2019t miss Marvelous Designer\u2019s upcoming community livestream demonstrating a workflow with the new Omniverse Connector on Wednesday, June 14.\nOne for the (Stone) Ages\nA 14-year veteran in the creative community, Bangalore-based Sathya has long been enamored by animals and the concept of extinction. \u201cAnimals become extinct for various reasons,\u201d he said. This fact inspired Sathya to create an environment design and tell a unique story using materials, lighting and animation.\nGathering reference material is 3D modeling 101.\n\u201cTraditional polygon modeling isn\u2019t my cup of tea,\u201d Sathya admitted. Instead, he used Adobe Substance 3D Modeler to seamlessly sculpt his models in 3D. His NVIDIA Studio HP ZBook laptop with NVIDIA RTX 5000 graphics unlocked GPU-accelerated filters to speed up material creation.\n\u201cSculpting in virtual reality is so much fun, and so fast,\u201d said the artist. \u201cI could finalize models in just a few hours, all while eliminating all those pesky anatomy details!\u201d\nHe also deployed Substance 3D Modeler\u2019s automatic UV wrapping feature to generate UV islands once models were imported, making it easier to apply paints, textures and materials.\nSculpting in virtual reality with Adobe Substance 3D Modeler.\nSathya then moved the project to Autodesk 3ds Max to use retopology tools for automatic optimization geometry of his high-resolution models to create a clean, quad-based mesh. This is useful for removing artifacts and other mesh issues before animation and rigging.\nGPU-enabled, RTX-accelerated AI denoising with the default Autodesk Arnold renderer in the viewport allowed for smoother, highly interactive modeling.\nSathya used retopology tools in Autodesk 3ds Max.\n\u201cMy NVIDIA GPU is an integral part of the artwork I create. Modeling, texturing, staging, painting and lighting is all accelerated by RTX.\u201d \u2014 Keerthan Sathya\n\nAdobe Substance 3D Painter was a \u201cgame changer\u201d allowing super-fast asset painting, Sathya said. RTX-accelerated light and ambient occlusion bakes and optimizes assets in mere seconds.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily need to create everything from scratch,\u201d Sathya said. \u201cSubstance 3D Painter offers a wide range of materials, smart materials and smart masks which I used in my project, along with a whole collection of materials that helped me save a lot of time.\u201d\n\u201cYou can even paint multiple channels on multiple UDIMs in real time,\u201d said Sathya. This means textures on various models can have different resolutions. For example, 4K-resolution textures can be used for priority details, while 2K resolution can be tapped for less important touches.\nTextures were applied quickly and efficiently in Adobe Substance 3D Painter powered by an NVIDIA RTX GPU.\nSathya imported Tiny Mammoth into NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for developing and building industrial metaverse applications, via the USD Composer app. This is where the artist accomplished staging, environment preparation, lighting and rendering.\n\u201cNVIDIA Omniverse is a great platform for artists to connect their desired 3D apps and collaborate. Plus, I really like AI-driven apps and features.\u201d \u2014 Keerthan Sathya\n\nSathya marveled at the ease of setting up the scene in USD Composer. \u201cJust using a few assets \u2014 instancing, arranging and kitbashing them to make a huge environment \u2014 is so satisfying and efficient,\u201d he said.\nSathya said OpenUSD is \u201cso much more than just a file format.\u201d\n\u201cThe OpenUSD workflow is great to work with,\u201d he said. \u201cI used OpenUSD pretty much for the whole project: environment assets and textures, foliage, lighting, still camera and adjustment of layers for each shot if necessary.\u201d\nOpenUSD files neatly organized.\nWith each OpenUSD layer and file stacked and authored accordingly, Sathya had the option to plug and play assets and creative workflow stages. Such versatility in 3D creative workflows is enabled by Omniverse and OpenUSD.\nScene tweaks in Omniverse USD Composer.\nThe artist heightened realism by painting moss trees with USD Composer\u2019s paint tool. \u201cIt was easy to add those tiny details to make my artwork look better,\u201d he said. Sathya then rotated the camera and adjusted the lighting until he met his desired result.\nDue to the sheer size of the scene, Sathya used real-time rendering to add animations, a bit of fog and corrections for limited renders. \u201cI like the idea of render passes, where you have a complete control of the scene while compositing, but it wasn\u2019t necessary here,\u201d he said.\nSathya exported the scene into Adobe After Effects for post-processing and additional visual effects, using more than 30 GPU-accelerated features and effects to add even more detail.\nMore visual effects in Adobe After Effects.\nThe artist reviewed video feedback in Adobe Rush. \u201cIt\u2019s more convenient when I\u2019m traveling or on my couch to arrange the shots and do some quick edits on my phone,\u201d he said. Sathya completed advanced edits and final renders in Adobe Premiere Pro.\nExquisite detail with multiple woolly mammoths on a single rock.\n\u201cLife is all about contrast,\u201d Sathya said. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced failures and successes, complex and simple, good and bad, many more contrasts, all of which drip into my artwork to make it unique!\u201d\nSenior technical artist Keerthan Sathya.\nCheck out additional details on Tiny Mammoth and view Sathya\u2019s complete portfolio on Behance.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

We\u2019re also deep diving on new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.\nWith over 900,000 subscribers on her YouTube channel, editor and filmmaker Sara Dietschy creates docuseries, reviews and vlogs that explore the intersection of technology and creativity. The Los Angeles-based creator shares her AI-powered workflow this week In the NVIDIA Studio, and it\u2019s just peachy \u2014 a word that happens to rhyme with her last name.\nDietschy explained in a recent video how five AI tools helped save over 100 hours of work, powered by NVIDIA Studio technology.\n\n\u201cIf you do any kind of 3D rendering on the go, a dedicated NVIDIA RTX GPU is nonnegotiable.\u201d \u2014 Sara Dietschy\n\nShe shows a practical approach to how these tools, running on laptops powered by GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, tackle the otherwise manual work that can make nonlinear editing tedious. Using tools like AI Relighting, Video Text Editing and more in Davinci Resolve software, Dietschy saves time on every project \u2014 and for creators, time is money, she said.\nThe NVIDIA Studio team spoke with Dietschy about how she uses AI, how technology can simplify artists\u2019 processes, and how the NVIDIA Studio platform supercharged her creativity and video-editing workflows.\nDietschy takes a break to sit down with the Studio team.\nStudio team: What AI features do you use most commonly?\nDietschy: In DaVinci Resolve, there\u2019s neural engine text-based editing, automatic subtitles, Magic Mask and Detect Scene Cuts \u2014 all AI-powered features I use daily. And the relighting feature in DaVinci Resolve is crazy good.\nIn addition, ChatGPT and Notion AI sped up copywriting for my website and social media posts, so I could focus on video editing.\nNow you see Dietschy, now you don\u2019t \u2014 Magic Mask in DaVinci Resolve.\nStudio team: How do you use Adobe Premiere Pro?\u00a0\nDietschy: In the beta version, my entire video can be transcribed quickly, and Premiere Pro can even detect silence. Just click on the three dots in the text, hit delete and boom \u2014 AI conveniently edits out that awkward pause. No need for me to hop back and forth.\nPlus, Auto Reframe and Unsharp Mask are popular AI features in Premiere Pro that are worth looking into.\nAI detects pauses and jump cuts.\nStudio team: What prompted the regular use of AI-powered tools and features?\u00a0\nDietschy: My biggest pet peeve is when a program offers really cool features but requires uploading everything to a web app or starting a completely new workflow. Once these features were made available directly in the apps I already use, things became so much more efficient, which is why I now use them on the daily.\nAccess numerous AI-powered features in DaVinci Resolve.\nStudio team: For the non-technical people out there, why does GPU acceleration in creative apps matter?\nDietschy: For video editors, GPU acceleration \u2014 which is basically a graphics card making the features and effects in creative apps faster \u2014 especially in DaVinci Resolve, is everything. It scrubs through footage and playback, and crushes export times. This ASUS Zenbook Pro 14 OLED Studio laptop exported a recent hour-plus-long 4K video in less than 14 minutes. If you release new content every week, like me, time saved is gold.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 GPU-accelerated encode (NVENC) speeds up video exporting up to 5x.\nStudio team: Would you recommend GeForce RTX GPUs to other video editors?\nDietschy: Absolutely. A big unlock for me was getting a desktop computer with a nice processor and an NVIDIA GPU. I was just amazed at how much smoother things went.\nThe ASUS Zenbook Pro 14 OLED NVIDIA Studio laptop.\nStudio team: If you could go back to the beginning of your creative journey, what advice would you give yourself?\nDietschy: Don\u2019t focus so much on quantity. Instead, take the time to add structure to your process, because being a \u201cmessy creative\u201d only seems cool at first. Organization is already paying crazy dividends in better sleep and mental health.\nFor more AI insights, watch Dietschy\u2019s video on the dozen-plus AI tools creators should use:\n\nFind more on Sara Dietschy\u2019s YouTube channel.\nInfluencer and creator Sara Dietschy.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

Nearly 15% of hospital patients in the U.S. are readmitted within 30 days of their initial discharge, which is often associated with worse outcomes and higher costs for both patients and hospitals.\nResearchers at NYU Langone Health, the academic medical center of New York University, have collaborated with NVIDIA experts to develop a large language model (LLM) that predicts a patient\u2019s risk of 30-day readmission, as well as other clinical outcomes.\nDeployed in the healthcare system\u2019s six inpatient facilities, the NYUTron model \u2014 featured today in the scientific journal Nature \u2014 provides doctors with AI-driven insights that could help them identify patients in need of a clinical intervention to reduce the likelihood of readmission.\n\u201cWhen you discharge a patient from the hospital, you don\u2019t expect them to need to return, or you probably should have kept them in the hospital longer,\u201d said Dr. Eric Oermann, assistant professor of radiology and neurosurgery at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and a lead collaborator on NYUTron. \u201cUsing analysis from the AI model, we could soon empower clinicians to prevent or fix situations that put patients at a higher risk of readmission.\u201d\nThe model has so far been applied to more than 50,000 patient discharged in NYU\u2019s healthcare system, where it shares predictions of readmission risk with physicians via email notifications. Oermann\u2019s team is next planning a clinical trial to test whether interventions based on NYUTron\u2019s analyses reduce readmission rates.\nTackling the Threat of Rapid Readmission and More\u00a0\nThe U.S. government tracks 30-day readmission rates as an indicator of the quality of care hospitals are providing. Medical institutions with high rates are fined \u2014 a level of scrutiny that incentivizes hospitals to improve their discharge process.\nThere are plenty of reasons why a recently discharged patient may need to be readmitted to the hospital \u2014 among them, infection, overprescription of antibiotics, surgical drains that were removed too early. If these risk factors can be spotted earlier, doctors could intervene by adjusting treatment plans or monitoring patients in the hospital for longer.\n\u201cWhile there have been computational models to predict patient readmission since the 1980s, we\u2019re treating this as a natural language processing task that requires a health system-scale corpus of clinical text,\u201d Oermann said. \u201cWe trained our LLM on the unstructured data of electronic health records to see if it could capture insights that people haven\u2019t considered before.\u201d\nNYUTron was pretrained on 10 years of health records from NYU Langone Health: more than 4 billion words of clinical notes representing nearly 400,000 patients. The model achieved an accuracy improvement of more than 10 percent over a state-of-the-art machine learning model to predict readmission.\nOnce the LLM was trained for the initial use case of 30-day readmission, the team was able to spin out four other predictive algorithms in around a week. These include predicting the length of a patient\u2019s hospital stay, the likelihood of in-hospital mortality, and the chances of a patient\u2019s insurance claims being denied.\n\u201cRunning a hospital is in some ways like managing a hotel,\u201d said Oermann. \u201cInsights that help hospitals operate more efficiently means more beds and better care for a greater number of patients.\u201d\nTaking an LLM From Training to Deployment\nNYUTron is an LLM with hundreds of millions of parameters, trained using the NVIDIA NeMo Megatron framework on a large cluster of NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs.\n\u201cMuch of the conversation around language models right now is around gargantuan, general-purpose models with billions of parameters, trained on messy datasets using hundreds or thousands of GPUs,\u201d Oermann said. \u201cWe\u2019re instead using medium-sized models trained on highly refined data to accomplish healthcare-specific tasks.\u201d\nTo optimize the model for inference in real-world hospitals, the team developed a modified version of the NVIDIA Triton open-source software for streamlined AI model deployment using the NVIDIA TensorRT software development kit.\n\u201cTo deploy a model like this in a live healthcare environment, it has to run efficiently,\u201d Oermann said. \u201cTriton delivers everything you want in an inference framework, making our model blazing fast.\u201d\nOermann\u2019s team found that after pretraining their LLM, fine-tuning it onsite with a specific hospital\u2019s data helped to significantly boost accuracy \u2014 a trait that could help other healthcare institutions deploy similar models.\n\u201cNot all hospitals have the resources to train a large language model from scratch in-house, but they can adopt a pretrained model like NYUTron and then fine-tune it with a small sample of local data using GPUs in the cloud,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s within reach of almost everyone in healthcare.\u201d\nTo learn more about NYUTron, read the Nature paper and watch this NVIDIA and NYU talk on demand.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | ResearchTags: Artificial Intelligence | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inference | NVIDIA NeMo | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  As a marine biology student, Josef Melchner always dreamed of spending his days cruising the oceans to find dolphins, whales and fish \u2014 but also \u201cwanted to do something practical, something that would benefit the world,\u201d he said. When it came time to choose a career, he dove head first into aquaculture.\nHe\u2019s now CEO of GoSmart, an Israel-based company using AI and machine learning to make fish farming more efficient and sustainable.\nA member of the NVIDIA Metropolis vision AI partner ecosystem and the NVIDIA Inception program for cutting-edge startups, GoSmart offers fully autonomous, energy-efficient systems \u2014 about the size of a soda bottle \u2014 that can be attached to aquaculture cages, ponds or tanks.\nPowered by the NVIDIA Jetson platform for edge AI, these systems analyze the average weight and population distribution of the fish within the environment, as well as its temperature and oxygen levels.\nThis information is then provided to users through GoSmart\u2019s software-as-a-service, which helps fish farmers more accurately and efficiently determine how much \u2014 and when best \u2014 to feed their fish and harvest them, all in real time.\n\n\u201cThe parameters that GoSmart systems analyze are crucial for the fish feed regime,\u201d Melchner said. \u201cManaging the right levels of fish feed saves a lot of money for the farmers and reduces organic matter from excessive debris in the aqua environment.\u201d\nGoSmart systems have been deployed by Skretting, one of the world\u2019s largest fish feed producers, as part of its initiative to sustainably expand production pipelines across eight countries in southern Europe and provide farmers with personalized, digitalized information.\nPrecision Farming for Sustainability\nFounded in 2020, GoSmart is focused on fish farming because it\u2019s focused on helping the environment.\n\u201cThe world faces a lack of protein, and yet marine protein is often acquired the way it\u2019s always been, with boats going out with fishing nets and long lines,\u201d Melchner said. \u201cWhile many alternative sources of protein \u2014 like cattle, pigs and chicken \u2014 are almost always farmed, about half of marine production still comes from wildlife.\u201d\nOverfishing in this manner negatively impacts the planet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a critical issue that could affect us all eventually,\u201d Melchner said. \u201cAlgae is one of the largest carbon sinks in the world. It consumes carbon from the atmosphere and releases oxygen, and overfishing impacts levels of algae in the ocean.\u201d\nUnderstanding this is what led Melchner to devote his life\u2019s work to aquaculture, he said.\nThe GoSmart system uses lithium-ion batteries charged by solar panels, and is equipped with its own power-management software that enables it to autonomously enter sleep mode, shut down, wake up and conduct its work as appropriate.\nFarming Efficiency Boosted With AI\nGoSmart systems are built with sensors, cameras and NVIDIA Jetson modules, which enable AI at the edge to analyze factors of an environment that impact fish feeding, growth, health and welfare, as well as environmental pollution due to excessive organic matter dispersed in the water because of inefficient or inaccurate operations.\n\u201cWe wanted to use the best processor for AI with high performance in a system that\u2019s compact, submersible underwater and affordable for fish farmers, which is why we chose the Jetson series,\u201d Melchner said.\nGoSmart is now training its systems to analyze fish behavior and disease indicators \u2014 adding to current capabilities of determining fish weight, population distribution, temperature and oxygen levels. Since Jetson enables multiple AI algorithms to run in parallel, all of these characteristics can be analyzed simultaneously and in real time.\nThe company is also evaluating the powerful new Jetson Orin lineup of modules to take these capabilities to the next level.\nTo train its AI algorithms, the GoSmart team measured thousands of fish manually before deploying cameras to analyze millions more. \u201cThere was a lot of diving and many underwater experiments,\u201d Melchner said.\nFor high-performance deep learning inference, GoSmart is looking to use the NVIDIA TensorRT software development kit and open-source NVIDIA Triton Inference Server software.\nAnd as a member of the NVIDIA Metropolis and Inception programs, GoSmart works closely with NVIDIA engineers and is exploring latest-generation technologies. \u201cThis will help make our algorithms quicker and more efficient,\u201d Melchner said.\nGoSmart could help farmers reduce fish feed by up to 15%, according to Melchner. For some customers, GoSmart technology has shortened fish growth time and subsequent time to market by an entire month.\nA Tidal Wave of Possibilities\nMelchner predicts that in a few years, aquaculture will look completely different from how it is today.\n\u201cOur goal is to have our systems in every cage, every pond, every tank in the world \u2014 we want to cover the entire aquaculture industry,\u201d he said.\nIn addition to integrating AI models that analyze fish behavior and disease, GoSmart is looking to expand its systems and eventually integrate its solution with an autonomous feeding barge that can give fish the exact amount of food they need, exactly when they need it.\nLearn more about the NVIDIA Metropolis application framework, developer tools and partner ecosystem.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | Inception | Jetson | Machine Learning | Metropolis | Smart Spaces | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Moore28 Jun 20234 min readSamuel K. Moore is IEEE Spectrum\u2019s semiconductor editor.Computers using Nvidia's H100 GPU dominated the MLPerf training benchmarks, including the first benchmark test for training the large language model GPT-3.\n        Nvidia\n    \n\tFor the first time, a large language model\u2014a key driver of recent AI hype and hope\u2014has been added to \n\tMLPerf, a set of neural-network training benchmarks that have previously been called the Olympics of machine learning. Computers built around Nvidia\u2019s H100 GPU and Intel\u2019s Habana Gaudi2 chips were the first to be tested on how quickly they could perform a modified train of GPT-3, the large language model behind ChatGPT.\n\n\tA 3,584-GPU computer run as a collaboration between \n\tNvidia and cloud provider CoreWeave performed this task in just under 11 minutes. The smallest entrant, a 256-Gaudi2 system, did it in a little over 7 hours. On a per-chip basis, H100 systems were 3.6-times as fast at the task as Gaudi2. However, the Gaudi2 computers were operating \u201cwith one hand tied behind their back,\u201d says Jordan Plawner, senior director of AI products at Intel, because a capability called mixed precision has not yet been enabled on the chips.\nBy one estimate, Nvidia and CoreWeave\u2019s 11-minute record-setting training time would scale up to about two days of full-scale training.\n\tComputer scientists have found that for GPT-3\u2019s type of neural network, called a \n\ttransformer network, training can be greatly accelerated by doing parts of the process using less-precise arithmetic. Versions of 8-bit floating point numbers (FP8) can be used in certain layers of the network, while more precise 16-bit or 32-bit numbers are needed in others. Figuring out which layers are which is the key. Both H100 and Gaudi2 were built with mixed-precision hardware, but it\u2019s taken time for each company\u2019s engineers to discover the right layers and enable them. Nvidia\u2019s system in the H100 is called the transformer engine, and it was fully engaged for the GPT-3 results.\n\n\tHabana engineers will have Gaudi2\u2019s FP8 capabilities ready for GPT-3 training in September, says Plawner. At that point, he says, Gaudi2 will be \u201ccompetitive\u201d with H100, and he expects Gaudi2 to beat H100 on the combination of price and performance. Gaudi2, for what it\u2019s worth, is made using the same process technology\u20147 nanometers\u2014as the H100\u2019s predecessor, the A100.\nMaking GPT-3 work\n\tLarge language models \u201cand generative AI have fundamentally changed how AI is used in the market,\u201d says Dave Salvatore, Nvidia\u2019s director of AI benchmarking and cloud computing. So finding a way to benchmark these behemoths was important.\n\n\tBut turning GPT-3 into a useful industry benchmark was no easy task. A complete training of the full 1.75-billion parameter network with an entire training dataset could take weeks and cost millions of dollars. \u201cWe wanted to keep the runtime reasonable,\u201d says \n\tDavid Kanter, executive director of MLPerf\u2019s parent organization, MLCommons. \u201cBut this is still far and away the most computationally demanding of our benchmarks.\u201d Most of the benchmark networks in MLPerf can be run on a single processor, but GPT-3 takes 64 at a minimum, he says.\n\n\tInstead of training on an entire dataset, participants trained on a representative portion. And they did not train to completion, or convergence, in industry parlance. Instead, the systems trained to a point that indicated further training would lead to convergence.\nSystems built using the Habana Gaudi2 were the only non-Nvidia-based systems that participated in MLPerf\u2019s initial GPT-3 benchmark.Intel\n\tFiguring out that point, the right fraction of data, and other parameters so that the benchmark is representative of the full training task took \u201ca lot of experiments,\u201d says \n\tRitika Borkar, senior deep-learning architect at Nvidia and chair of the MLPerf training working group.\n\n\tOn Twitter, \n\tAbhi Venigalla, a research scientist at MosaicML, estimated that Nvidia and CoreWeave\u2019s 11-minute record would scale up to about two days of full-scale training.\nH100 training records\n\tThis round of MLPerf wasn\u2019t just about GPT-3, of course; the contest consists of seven other benchmark tests: image recognition; medical-imaging segmentation; two versions of object detection; speech recognition; natural-language processing; and recommendation. Each computer system is evaluated on the time it takes to train the neural network on a given dataset to a particular accuracy. They are placed into three categories: cloud-computing systems, available on-premises systems, and preview systems, which are scheduled to become available within six months.\n\n\tFor these other benchmarks, Nvidia was largely involved in a proxy fight against itself. Most of the entrants were from system makers such as Dell, Gigabyte, and the like, but they nearly all used Nvidia GPUs. Eighty of 88 entries were powered by them, and about half of those used the H100, a chip made using Taiwan Semiconductors Manufacturing Co.\u2019s 5-nanometer process that went to customers in the fourth quarter of 2022. Either Nvidia computers or those of CoreWeave set the records for each of the eight categories.\n\n\tIn addition to adding GPT-3, MLPerf significantly upgraded its recommender system test to a benchmark called DLRM DCN-V2. \u201cRecommendation is really a critical thing for the modern era, but it\u2019s often an unsung hero,\u201d says Kanter. Because of the risk surrounding identifiable personal information in the dataset, \u201crecommendation is in some ways the hardest thing to make a benchmark for,\u201d he says.\n\n\tThe new DLRM DCN-V2 is meant to better match what industry is using, he says. It requires five times the memory operations, and the network is similarly more computationally complex. The size of the dataset it\u2019s trained on is about four times as large as the 1 terabyte its predecessor used.\n\n\tYou can see all the results \n\there.\nFrom Your Site ArticlesMeta\u2019s Challenge to OpenAI\u2014Give Away a Massive Language Model \u203aWhen AI\u2019s Large Language Models Shrink \u203aOpenAI's GPT-3 Speaks!

The wrong predictions came from fog, rain and smudges on the lenses of a network of cameras they used.\nSo, in a pilot project, Chooch linked its fire detection software to the camera network. It analyzed snapshots every 15 minutes, seeking signs of smoke or fire.\nGenerative AI Sharpens Computer Vision\nThen, the team led by Hakan Gultekin \u2014 Emrah\u2019s brother, a software wiz and Chooch\u2019s CTO \u2014 had an idea.\nThey built a generative AI tool that automatically created descriptions of each image, helping reviewers discern when smoke is present. False positives dropped from 2,000 a week to eight.\nChooch detects smoke and fire despite bad weather or dirty camera lenses.\n\u201cFire chiefs were excited about launching the technology in their monitoring centers and what it could achieve,\u201d said Michael Liou, the president of Chooch, who detailed the project in a recent webinar.\nChooch\u2019s generative AI tool gives fire fighters in California\u2019s Kern County a dashboard on their smartphones and PCs, populated in real time with alerts, so they can detect wildfires fast.\nIn 2020, California experienced 9,900 wildfires that burned 4.3 million acres of forest and caused $19 billion in losses. Stopping one fire from spreading out of control would pay for the wildfire detection system for 50 years, the company estimates.\nA Vision for Gen AI\nChooch\u2019s CEO says it\u2019s also the shape of things to come.\nEmrah Gultekin\n\u201cThe fusion of large language models and computer vision will bring about even more powerful and accurate products that are easier to deploy,\u201d said Gultekin.\nFor example, utilities can connect the software to drones and fixed cameras to detect corrosion on capacitors or vegetation encroaching on power lines.\nThe technology could see further validation as Chooch enters an $11 million Xprize challenge on detecting and fighting wildfires. Sponsors include PG&E and Lockheed Martin that\u2019s building an AI lab to predict and respond to wildfires in a separate collaboration with NVIDIA.\nDashboards for PCs and smartphones can update firefighters with real-time alerts from Chooch\u2019s software.\nChooch applies its technology to a host of challenges in manufacturing, retail and security.\nFor example, one manufacturer uses Chooch\u2019s models to detect defects before products ship. Eliminating just 20% of the faults will pay for the system several times over.\nInception of a Partnership\nBack in 2019, a potential customer in the U.S. government asked for support with edge deployments it planned on NVIDIA GPUs. Chooch joined NVIDIA Inception, a free program that nurtures cutting-edge startups.\nUsing NGC, NVIDIA\u2019s hub for accelerated software, Hakan was able to port Chooch\u2019s code to NVIDIA GPUs over a weekend. Now its products run on NVIDIA Jetson modules and \u201chave been tested in the wild with full-motion video and multispectral data,\u201d Emrah said.\nSince then, the company rolled out support for GPUs in data centers and beyond. For example, the wildfire use case runs on NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs in the cloud.\nAlong the way, Chooch embraced software like Triton Inference Server and the NVIDIA DeepStream software development kit.\n\u201cThe combination of DeepStream and Triton increased our capacity 8x to run more video streams on more AI models \u2014 that\u2019s a huge win,\u201d Emrah said.\nA Wide Horizon\nNow Chooch is expanding its horizons.\nThe company is a member of the partner ecosystems for NVIDIA Metropolis for intelligent video analytics and NVIDIA Clara Guardian, edge AI software for smart hospitals. Chooch also works with NVIDIA\u2019s retail and telco teams.\nThe software is opening new doors and expanding the use cases it can address.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard work because there\u2019s so much uncharted territory, but that\u2019s also what makes it exciting,\u201d Emrah said.\nLearn more about generative AI for enterprises, and explore NVIDIA\u2019s solutions for power grid modernization.

And in the future, GeForce RTX gamers will have the fastest possible frame rates when playing Diablo IV with the game\u2019s upcoming ray-traced effects. Head here to see how GeForce RTX GPUs will enhance the hundreds of hours you\u2019ll spend in Diablo IV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatchet & Clank: Rift Apart Available July 26 With DLSS 3, Ray Tracing & More\nThe Ratchet & Clank franchise recently celebrated its 20th anniversary, and on July 26th PC gamers can experience the action and humor of the franchise for the first time with the PC release of the critically acclaimed Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart. Help the beautifully-rendered duo take on an evil emperor from another reality as you jump between action-packed worlds and beyond in this spectacular action-adventure-platformer, developed by acclaimed studio Insomniac Games, and brought to PC by the one and only Nixxes Software.\nBuilding upon their work on other Sony Interactive Entertainment PC conversions, Nixxes is loading Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart with every possible technology, giving PC gamers an incredible experience that leverages the full capabilities of their systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards and laptops can multiply performance using NVIDIA DLSS 3, while GeForce RTX 20 and 30 Series users can accelerate frame rates with NVIDIA DLSS 2. All GeForce RTX gamers can maximize image quality with NVIDIA DLAA, for the highest possible picture quality. And GeForce GTX 900 Series and newer gamers can make Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart gameplay even more responsive with NVIDIA Reflex.\nThrough a process detailed in full in our DLSS 3 article, DLSS 3 combines DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Frame Generation to reconstruct 7/8ths of the displayed pixels, accelerating performance significantly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn GPU-limited games, DLSS 2 Super Resolution technology can increase your frame rates by up to 2X. With DLSS 3, we can boost them by up to 4X (compared to brute-force rendering) in fully ray-traced worlds.\nCertain games make extensive use of the CPU which can limit performance. DLSS 3 operates on the GPU, bypassing CPU bottlenecks and boosting frame rates.\nDLSS 3 games are backwards compatible with DLSS 2 technology - developers simply integrate DLSS 3, and DLSS 2, also known as DLSS Super Resolution, is supported by default. Additionally, integrations of DLSS 3 also include NVIDIA Reflex, reducing system latency for all GeForce RTX users, making games more responsive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatchet & Clank: Rift Apart also features ray-traced reflections with a variety of quality levels to choose from, as well as newly added ray-traced shadows, for natural light in outdoor areas. Gamers with GeForce RTX GPUs can enjoy these at the highest frame rates thanks to their dedicated ray tracing cores that greatly accelerate ray tracing performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, there\u2019s support for 21:9, 32:9 and 48:9 resolutions, and triple-monitor Surround gaming. There\u2019s the usual assortment of options to ensure you can play the way that best suits your style, and when using a DualSense controller on a wired connection, you can feel in-game actions coming to life in your hands with haptic feedback and dynamic trigger effects.\nRatchet & Clank: Rift Apart launches July 26th on PC - wishlist or pre-order now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTower of Fantasy DLSS 3 Update Available Now\nSet hundreds of years in the future after humanity has escaped the collapsing environment of earth and fled to the distant planet of Aida, the cross-platform, shared open-world MMORPG action of Tower of Fantasy invites gamers around the world to join in on the thrilling action.

The new Omniverse Connector enables creators to save time with Marvelous Designer\u2019s improved import and export capabilities through OpenUSD.\nIn a recent livestream, 3D designer Brandon Yu shared how he\u2019s using the new Connector and OpenUSD to improve his collaborative workflow, enhance productivity, expand creative possibilities and streamline his design process.\n\nMike Shawbrook, who has more than 150,000 subscribers on his MH Tutorials YouTube channel,\u00a0walks through using the new Connector in the tutorial below. Shawbrook demonstrates how he set up a live session between Marvelous Designer and Omniverse to create a simple cloth blanket.\n\nFor more, check out this tutorial on using the new Connector and see how OpenUSD can improve 3D workflows:\n\nImproved USD Compatibility\nWith the Marvelous Designer Omniverse Connector, users can harness the real-time rendering capabilities of Omniverse to visualize their garments in an interactive environment. This integration empowers creators to make informed design decisions, preview garments\u2019 reactions to different lighting conditions and simulate realistic fabric behavior in real time.\n\nThe Connector\u2019s expanded support for OpenUSD enables seamless interchange of 3D data between creative applications.\n\nIn the graphic above, an artist uses the new connector to adjust 3D-animated fish fins, a key digital material in an underwater scene.\nGet Plugged Into the Omniverse\u00a0\nTo learn more about how OpenUSD can improve 3D workflows, check out a new video series on the file framework. The first installment covers four OpenUSD \u201csuperpowers.\u201d\nAnyone can build their own Omniverse extension or Connector to enhance their 3D workflows and tools.\nShare your Marvelous Designer and Omniverse creations to the Omniverse gallery for a chance to be featured on NVIDIA social media channels.\nGet started with NVIDIA Omniverse by downloading the standard license free, or learn how Omniverse Enterprise can connect your team.

The aim is to double the bloc\u2019s share of global chip output from 10% to 20% by 2030.\nAs part of the Chips Act, the EU agreed to a \u20ac43bn ($47bn) subsidy package to boost its chip industry, and in June, the act triggered a further \u20ac22bn in funding to support microelectronics and communication technologies across the European semiconductor supply chain.\nOn 19 June, after negotiating a subsidy package valued at around \u20ac10bn, Intel signed a deal with the German Government that will see the US company spend more than \u20ac30bn to build a chip manufacturing site in the eastern city of Magdeburg. Three days prior, Intel announced a \u20ac4.2bn investment in Wroc\u0142aw, Poland, which Mateusz Morawiecki, the country\u2019s prime minister, called \u201cthe largest greenfield investment in the history of Poland\u201d.\nNvidia has a more limited FDI footprint, with most of its foreign investments ploughed into its Israel operations following its 2019 acquisition of Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies. Indeed, the company reveals in its financial statements that it pays rock-bottom tax rates in its home country, with an income tax expense of $189m for 2022 against a revenue of $26.91bn. This is largely due to federal tax benefits that the company receives for attracting significant FDI into the US tech market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for our weekly news round-up!\nGive your

Scientists Call for Climate Collaboration\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThree researchers describe plans to build digital twins of Earth to help people understand and adapt to the effects of global warming.\t\t\t\n\n\nJune 28, 2023 by Stan Posey \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  A trio of top scientists is helping lead one of the most ambitious efforts in the history of computing \u2014 building a digital twin of Earth.\nPeter Bauer, Bjorn Stevens and Francisco \u201cPaco\u201d Doblas-Reyes agree that a digital twin of Earth needs to support resolutions down to a kilometer so a growing set of users can explore the risks of climate change and how to adapt to them. They say the work will require accelerated computing, AI and lots of collaboration.\nTheir Herculean efforts, some already using NVIDIA technologies, inspired Earth-2, NVIDIA\u2019s contribution to the common cause.\n\u201cWe will dedicate ourselves and our significant resources to direct NVIDIA\u2019s scale and expertise in computational sciences, to join with the world\u2019s climate science community,\u201d Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA, had said when he announced the Earth-2 initiative in late 2021.\nCollaborating on an Unprecedented Scale\nHuang\u2019s commitment signaled support for efforts like Destination Earth (DestinE), a pan-European project to create digital twins of the planet.\n\u201cNo single computer may be enough to do it, so it needs a distributed, international effort,\u201d said Bauer, a veteran with more than 20 years at Europe\u2019s top weather forecasting center who now leads the project that aims to make planet-scale models available by 2030.\nLast year, he co-authored a Nature article that said the work \u201crequires collaboration on an unprecedented scale.\u201d\nBauer calls for broad international cooperation on a new Earth information system.\nIn a March GTC talk, Bauer envisioned a federation that \u201cmobilizes resources from many countries, including private players, and NVIDIA could be one that would be very interesting.\u201d\nPeter Bauer\nSuch resources would enable the enormous work of developing new numeric and machine-learning models, then running them in massive inference jobs to make predictions that stretch across multiple decades.\nDestinE has its roots in a 2008 climate conference. It\u2019s the fruit of a number of programs, including many Bauer led in his years with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts \u2014 based in Reading, England \u2014 which develops some of the most advanced weather forecast models in the world.\nConsuming a Petabyte a Day\nThe collaboration is broad because the computing requirements are massive.\nFrancisco Doblas-Reyes\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about producing petabytes of data a day that have to be delivered very quickly,\u201d said Doblas-Reyes, director of the Earth sciences department at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, a lead author at Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \u2014 a group that creates some of the most definitive reports on climate change \u2014 and a contributor to the DestinE program.\nThe digital twin effort will turn the traditional approach to weather and climate forecasting \u201cupside down so users can be the drivers of the process,\u201d he said in a March talk at GTC, NVIDIA\u2019s developer conference. The goal is to \u201cput the user at the helm of producing climate information that\u2019s more useful for climate adaptation,\u201d he said.\nHis talk described the new models, workflows and systems needed to capture in detail the chaotic nature of climate systems.\nArticulating the Vision\nThe vision for a digital twin crystalized in a keynote at the SC20 supercomputing conference from Stevens, a director at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, in Hamburg. He leads work on one of the world\u2019s top weather models for climate applications, as well as an effort to enable simulations at kilometer-level resolution, an order of magnitude finer than today\u2019s best work.\n\u201cWe need a new type of computing capability \u2026 for planetary information systems that let us work through the consequences of our actions and policies, so we can build a more sustainable future,\u201d he said.\nStevens\u2019 landmark talk at SC20 crystallized the vision of a digital twin of Earth.\nStevens described a digital twin that\u2019s accurate and interactive. For example, he imagined people querying it to see how a warming climate could affect flooding in northern Europe or food security in Africa.\nAI Enables Interactive Simulations\nAI will play a lead role in giving users that level of interactivity, he said in a talk at GTC last year.\n\u201cWe need AI to get to where we need to be,\u201d he said, giving shout-outs to NVIDIA and colleagues, including Bauer and Doblas-Reyes. \u201cReal steps forward come from people bringing their different perspectives together and rethinking how we work.\u201d\nClimate simulations pursue ultra-high resolution for greater accuracy.\nDoblas-Reyes agreed in his GTC talk this year.\n\u201cIn my opinion, AI is a necessary complement for the digital twin \u2014 it\u2019s the only way to offer true interactivity to users and help provide a good trajectory of what\u2019s to come in our climate,\u201d he said.\nOn a Journey Together\nAll three scientists gave examples of how NVIDIA technologies have been used in a wide variety of projects addressing climate change.\nIn his GTC talk, Stevens took a characteristically playful turn. He showed a cartoon version of Huang, like Isaac Newton, struck with a falling apple and an insight for how to engage with the scientific effort.\n\u201cWe need you Jensen, and you need us,\u201d Stevens said.\nStevens playfully portrayed Huang as Isaac Newton in his GTC talk.\nThe MareNostrum 5 system coming to the Barcelona center provides one example. It\u2019s expected to accelerate some of the DestinE work on NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs.\nBuilding a digital twin of Earth is \u201can exciting opportunity to re-think the future of HPC with AI on top,\u201d said Mike Pritchard, a veteran climate scientist who directs climate research at NVIDIA.\nNVIDIA Omniverse for connecting 3D tools and developing metaverse applications, NVIDIA Modulus for physics-informed machine learning and NVIDIA Triton for AI inference all have roles to play in the broad effort, he said.\nIt\u2019s a long and evolving collaboration, Bauer said in his GTC talk. \u201cI sent my first email to NVIDIA on these issues 14 years ago, and NVIDIA has been with us on this journey ever since.\u201d\nTo learn more, read the concept paper developed for the Berlin Summit for Earth Virtualization Engines and discover how AI is powering the future of clean energy.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Digital Twin | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | NVIDIA in Europe | NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo | NVIDIA Triton | Omniverse | Science | Scientific Visualization \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The first card to hit with the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 8GB model, which we recently evaluated, but today NVIDIA pushes its leading Ada Lovelace GPU architecture to its lowest price point yet with the GeForce RTX 4060.\n\r\nThe GeForce RTX 4060 targets 1080p gamers and creators looking for a competitive graphics card with leading edge feature support. It\u2019ll require some testing to see if the GeForce RTX 4060 is such a card, but of course we were up for the task. Without further delay, let\u2019s check out some specs and other particulars, and then we\u2019ll take the GeForce RTX 4060 for a spin to see what it can (or can\u2019t) do.

Although the AD107 is based the same Ada Lovelace GPU architecture as all of the previously-launched cards in the GeForce RTX 40 series, the other cards in the series all use different chips. The flagship RTX 4090 is built around the largest AD102 GPU, the GeForce RTX 4080 uses the smaller (but still large) AD103, the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti and 4070 use the smaller AD104, and the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti uses the AD106. The AD107, however, is NVIDIA's smallest Ada GPU yet.\n\n\nFull-Featured AD106 (Left), GeForce RTX 4060 Ti (Middle), AD107 GeForce RTX 4060 (Right) - Note The Different NVENC / NVDEC Configs And SMs\n\r\nIn terms of feature support, the AD107 is identical to its larger siblings. All of the GPUs offer the entirety of features inherent to the Ada Lovelace architecture, like\u00a0DLSS 3 and other NVIDIA technologies like NVIDIA Reflex latency reduction, hardware AV1 encoing, NVIDIA Broadcast, Ansel, G-SYNC, Omniverse, optional Studio drivers, and GeForce Experience, to name just a few. For a more detailed explanation of the Ada Lovelace GPU architecture, we suggest reading this article and checking out our launch coverage of the flagship GeForce RTX 4090 while you\u2019re at it. There's lots of foundational information in those two pieces that will help you better understand all of the new features offered by NVIDIA latest architecture which we won't be duplicating again today.\n\n\nFour Generations Of xx60 Series GPUs Compared...\n\r\nThe AD107 GPU as configured on the GeForce RTX 4060 is scaled down in a few key ways.\u00a0The AD102 on the RTX 4090 has 11 GPCs, 64 TPCs, 16,384 CUDA cores, 512 Tensor cores, and 128 RT cores, with a 384-bit memory interface. The smaller AD103 has 7 GPCs, 38 TPCs, 9,728 CUDA cores, 304 Tensor cores, and 76 RT cores, with a 256-bit memory interface. In its full configuration, the AD104\u00a0has 5 GPCs, 30 TPCs, 7,680 CUDA cores, 240 Tensor cores, and 60 RT cores, with a 192-bit memory interface.\u00a0 Which brings us to the AD106.\n\r\nThe AD107 as configured on\u00a0the GeForce RTX 4060 has\u00a03 GPCs, 12 TPCs, 24 SMs, 3,072 CUDA cores, 96 Tensor cores, and 24 RT cores, with a 128-bit memory interface, whereas the AD106 on the RTX 4060 Ti has\u00a03 GPCs, 17 TPCs, 34 SMs, 4,352 CUDA cores, 136 Tensor cores, and 34 RT cores, with a 128-bit memory interface. The AD107 chip\u00a0is scaled down in almost every way that affects compute and rasterization performance.\u00a0Scaling back the AD107 brings its transistor count down significantly, though; whereas the AD104 used on the RTX 4070 packs 35.8 billion transistors, and the AD106 on the 4060 Ti comes in at 22.9B, the AD107 is \"only\" 18.9B. For reference, the AD103 is 45.6B and the AD102 a whopping 76.3B.\n\r\nThe GeForce RTX 4060's typical boost clock should hover in the 2,460MHz range and the 8GB of GDDR6 memory on the card operates at an effective data rate of 17Gbps, which equates to just over 272GB/s of memory bandwidth over the card's 128-bit memory interface. The much larger L2 cache in the GPU versus previous-gen offerings, however, results in far more efficient use of that memory bandwidth. NVIDIA says that the GeForce RTX 4060's memory bandwidth is roughly equivalent to an Ampere GPU with 453GB/s of bandwidth.\n\r\nVersus the previous-gen GA104-based GeForce RTX 3060, the AD106 powering the GeForce RTX 4060 also appears to be scaled back in a few ways. The newer AD107, as configured on the RTX 4060, has fewer cores but operates and higher frequencies. It has fewer ROPs and a narrower memory interface (128-bit vs. 192-bit) too. These apparent deficiencies could be mostly mitigated, however, due to enhancements in the more advanced Ada Lovelace architecture, like its larger caches, and higher clocks, etc. One area where a 12GB GeForce RTX 3060 will always have an advantage though is frame buffer size -- there's no making up for a 50% larger frame buffer (8GB vs. 12GB) if a game consumes all of that memory for assets.\nMeet The ASUS GeForce RTX 4060 DUAL\r\nNVIDIA isn\u2019t launching a Founders Edition GeForce RTX 4060 and is counting on its partners for both \u201cstock\u201d clocked RTX 4060s and \u201chot\u201d clocked versions (which we\u2019ll be covering tomorrow). \n\n\n\r\nFor the purposes of today\u2019s review, we got our hands on an ASUS GeForce RTX 4060 DUAL, which should be hitting store shelves at NVIDIA\u2019s stated MSRP. As its name suggests, the ASUS GeForce RTX 4060 DUAL has a pair of cooling fans, which sit atop a large aluminum heatsink, with quad heat pipes. The cooler on the card actually extends about an inch and a half. The extended area of the cooler allows some air from the rear cooling fan to pass all the way through, whereas the rest is directed over the heatsink fins and ejected from the top and bottom, or out of the chassis through vents in the bracket.\n\n\n\r\nAlthough the GPU powering the GeForce RTX 4060 is relatively small and quite power friendly, the ASUS GeForce RTX 4060 DUAL is still 2.5 slots wide. The card is not particularly heavy or unwieldy, like some higher-powered behemoths, but it seems consuming 2.5 slots is a bit overkill for the lowest power xx60-series card yet. The overall dimensions of the card are about 9\u201d long and 4.75\u201d high.\n\n\n\n\r\nIn terms of its specifications and features, the ASUS GeForce RTX 4060 DUAL is right in-line with NVIDIA recommendations posted above, though ASUS does customize the card in a couple of ways. First, it requires only a single, standard 8-pin PCI Express power feed. NVIDIA\u2019s specs suggest some boards may use dual PCIe 8-pin connectors or a 12VHPWR ATX 3.0 connector, but all of the boards we\u2019ve seen thus far have only a single connector, which should be more than enough for even overclocked RTX 4060s. The ASUS GeForce RTX 4060 DUAL also has a dual-BIOS switch for performance and silent modes, but it\u2019s mostly unnecessary. This card is super quiet all the time, regardless of which mode is used.\n\n\n\r\nLike most of the other members of the GeForce RTX 40-series, the RTX 4060 also has triple full-sized DisplayPorts and a single HDMI output on its case bracket. That HDMI port is HDMI 2.1-compliant, which enables 120Hz 4K with G-Sync on some of the latest OLED TVs and monitors and allows for 8K resolution over a single cable. The DisplayPorts are only DP1.4, however.\n\r\nAnd with all of that out of the way, let\u2019s get into some benchmarks...\r\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, GeForce, Gaming, graphics, GPU, (nasdaq:nvda), ada lovelace, geforce rtx 4060, ad107\n\n\n\nRelated content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon Pro W7900 And W7800 Review: Potent Pro-Vis Graphics Punch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRazer Hammerhead Pro HyperSpeed Review: Sleek ANC Gaming Earbuds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon Pro W7600 And W7500 Review: Value-Driven Pro-Vis Graphics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolidigm D5-P5336 SSD Review: Monster 61TB Data Center Storage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnePlus Keyboard 81 Pro Review: Customizable Mechanical Marvel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT STUFF IN PC COMPONENTS\n\nAMD Radeon Pro W7900 And W7800 Review:...\nRazer Hammerhead Pro HyperSpeed Review:...\nAMD Radeon Pro W7600 And W7500 Review:...\nSolidigm D5-P5336 SSD Review: Monster...\nOnePlus Keyboard 81 Pro Review:...\nAMD Bergamo And Genoa-X Performance...\nMSI GeForce RTX 4060 Gaming X Review:...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKEEP INFORMED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSITE\n\nHome\n\n\nReviews\n\n\nNews\n\n\nBlogs\n\nFull Site\n\nSitemap\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nPC Components\n\n\nSystems\n\n\nMobile\n\n\nIT Infrastructure\n\n\nLeisure\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nCOMPANY\n\nAbout\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\nNews Tips\n\n\nContact\n\n\nPrivacy And Terms\n\n\nHotTech\n\n\n\nMORE\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nShop\n\n\n\nSTAY CONNECTED\n\nTwitter\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n            As an Amazon and Howl Technologies Associate, HotHardware earns a commission from qualifying purchases made on this site.

Priced at $299, the 8GB RTX 4060 targets those who\u2019ve been waiting to upgrade from one of the predecessor cards, and wants to take advantage of the latest GeForce feature set \u2013 including niceties such as DLSS 3. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA has just launched its latest Ada Lovelace-based GeForce: RTX 4060 8GB. Unlike most launches, which NVIDIA (and others) like to keep under wraps until the last minute, anyone who pays attention to the PC hardware space won\u2019t be surprised by this one, as NVIDIA itself revealed the GPU last month.\nThe GeForce RTX 4060 rounds-out NVIDIA\u2019s current-gen GeForce lineup. We inquired as to whether or not the RTX 3050 is still considered part of the \u201ccurrent\u201d GeForce lineup, and it seems that no, not really. It might still be a good option for your particular use case, but as far as the Ada Lovelace generation goes, the RTX 4060 might be the final Ada SKU until NVIDIA decides to inject some SUPER or Ti into the lineup.\n\nWhen we covered the RTX 4060 Ti last month, we mentioned that one of the biggest selling-points was its inclusion of DLSS 3, and especially the Frame Generation feature. Not a single thing changes with this RTX 4060 \u2013 it just happens to be an even lower-end part.\nFrom a specs perspective, the single-precision performance rating implies that the RTX 4060 is about 18% faster than the RTX 3060, which is roughly what we\u2019d expect gen-on-gen. If that\u2019s not impressive enough, that\u2019s where DLSS 3 and FG come in to try to sway you.\n\nWe\u2019re hitting this RTX 4060 launch with a look at a creator angle, but one that\u2019s a lot more focused than we intended it to be. In recent weeks, we\u2019ve overhauled a few of our video encode tests, and some odd results found while benchmarking forced us to shelve them for now, and dig deeper after this is posted.\nOn the gaming side, NVIDIA talks of the RTX 4060 being a perfect upgrade for anyone on a previous generation same-series card, eg: GTX 1060, RTX 2060, or RTX 3060. We\u2019d wager the first two are far more appropriate to upgrade from; anyone wanting to move off of an RTX 3060 should look at something like the RTX 4060 Ti at least.\nOne change worth noting between the RTX 3060 and RTX 4060 is that the older card launched with 12GB of memory. For creators, this might mean that the RTX 3060 ends up being the safer bet, because while performance can be worked around in some ways, memory limits can be a real roadblock. We\u2019ve even seen examples where a simpler workload like Adobe Lightroom Classic JPG export allows an RTX 3060 12GB to outperform an RTX 3070 Ti 8GB.\nWhile it would have been nice to see 12GB on the RTX 4060, NVIDIA\u2019s safe for the fact that it\u2019d be hard to expect that much memory on a $299 SKU. Even when the RTX 3060 12GB launched at $329, its SRP felt like it was fiction, because at no point in the months following its launch did we see the card be available for close to that price. If only the memory on our GPUs was modular like our motherboards!\nAs mentioned above, we\u2019re taking a super-quick look at the RTX 4060 in rendering tests first, as we\u2019re working to refine and update video-related and other tests. Much of the performance here was gathered from our previous look at the RTX 4060 Ti, as sanity tests with updated drivers proved that nothing\u2019s changed performance-wise since then. We were thankfully able to add in OctaneRender and Redshift results this time around, though.\n\n\n\n\n\nTechgage Creator GPU Testing PC\n\n\nProcessor\nIntel Core i9-13900K (3.0GHz, 24C/32T)\n\n\nMotherboard\nASUS ROG STRIX Z690-E GAMING WIFI\nCPUs tested with 2305 BIOS (March 10, 2023)\n\n\nMemory\nG.SKILL Trident Z5 RGB (F5-6000J3040F16G) 16GB x2\nXMP-enabled w/ freq. set to DDR5-6000 (30-40-40-96, 1.35V)\n\n\nAMD Graphics\nAMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX (24GB; Adrenalin 23.4.1)\nAMD Radeon RX 7900 XT (20GB; Adrenalin 23.4.1)\nAMD Radeon RX 7600 (8GB; Beta 23.10.01.16)\nAMD Radeon RX 6950 XT (16GB; Adrenalin 23.4.1)\nAMD Radeon RX 6800 XT (16GB; Adrenalin 23.4.1)\nAMD Radeon RX 6800 (16GB; Adrenalin 23.4.1)\nAMD Radeon RX 6750 XT (12GB; Adrenalin 23.4.1)\nAMD Radeon RX 6600 XT (8GB; Adrenalin 23.4.1)\nAMD Radeon RX 6600 (8GB; Adrenalin 23.4.1)\nAMD Radeon RX 6500 XT (4GB; Adrenalin 23.4.1)\n\n\nIntel Graphics\nIntel Arc A770 (16GB; Arc 31.0.101.4311)\nIntel Arc A750 (8GB; Arc 31.0.101.4311)\nIntel Arc A380 (6GB; Arc 31.0.101.4311)\n\n\nNVIDIA Graphics\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 (24GB; Studio 531.61)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 (16GB; Studio 531.61)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti (12GB; Studio 531.61)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 (12GB; Studio 531.61)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Ti (8GB; Beta 531.93)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060\u00a0(8GB; Beta 536.20)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 (24GB; Studio 531.61)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti (12GB; Studio 531.61)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 (10GB; Studio 531.61)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti (8GB; Studio 531.61)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 (8GB; Studio 531.61)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti (8GB; Studio 531.61)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 (12GB; Studio 531.61)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 (8GB; Studio 531.61)\n\n\nStorage\nWD Blue 3D NAND 1TB x3 (SATA 6Gbps)\n\n\nPower Supply\nCorsair RM1000x (1000W)\n\n\nChassis\nCorsair 4000X Mid-tower\n\n\nCooling\nCorsair H150i ELITE CAPELLIX (360mm)\n\n\nEt cetera\nWindows 11 Pro 22H2, Build 22621\nIntel Chipset Driver: 10.1.19222.8341\nIntel ME Driver: 2242.3.34.0\n\n\nAll product links in this table are affiliated, and help support our work.\n\n\n\nChaos V-Ray\n\n\n\nOctaneRender\n\n\nAutodesk Arnold\n\n\nMaxon Redshift\n\n\nBlender\n\n\n\nLuxMark\n\n\n(Semi-)Final Thoughts\nWhile a creator angle of any GPU is going to involve more than just rendering, rendering is one of the best types of workloads to showcase what any one GPU can do against another. After poring over these results, we can see that the new RTX 4060 easily beats out its RTX 3060 predecessor, and often surpasses either the RTX 3070 or RTX 3070 Ti, depending on the render engine.\nWhen we compare against the last-gen parts, the RTX 4060 looks quite good, in some cases even able to match the RTX 3070 Ti, which SRP\u2019d for $599. That said, there are are variations in performance strengths of the RTX 4060, with it out-performing the RTX 3070 Ti one moment (in Arnold), while other times slides in behind RTX 3070 and just ahead of RTX 3060 Ti.\nOne performance gain that stood out was with Blender. In both of the Cycles renders, the RTX 4060 leaped quite a bit ahead of the RTX 3060. Note that we didn\u2019t have the full set of last-gen Ampere-based cards in those charts, but results from those can be found here.\nOne thing we didn\u2019t talk about yet \u2013 and it\u2019s largely because we haven\u2019t tested it hands-on \u2013 is that the RTX 4060 is spec\u2019d for far less power usage than the RTX 3060 \u2013 a difference of 110W vs. 170W. Power use might be one of the least interesting things about a new GPU launch, but we love seeing components improve performance while using less power \u2013 it\u2019s a win-win.\nFor now, this is all we can really say about the RTX 4060. First impressions are good overall, although we know that on the gaming side of the fence, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is going to revolve around DLSS 3 and its frame generation feature, which can boost the overall and percentile frame rates with the help of AI. This feature is best used when the base-line (with DLSS, but not FG) FPS is suitable for regular play, as a 100 FPS game with 30 FPS input latency is going to feel disjointed.\nWith a handful of our tests undergoing overhauls, we\u2019re going to revisit this RTX 4060 and the rest of the current-gen lineup in the weeks ahead, so stay tuned.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport our efforts!

With 88% of the GPU market, Nvidia\u2019s cutting-edge chips are enabling the AI boom as its industry struggles to keep up with exploding demand. Nvidia\u2019s flagship AI chip, the H100, has been fetching $40,000 on eBay\u2014well over its retail price. After touching a $1 trillion market cap in May, the company announced that an even more powerful GPU-CPU combo chip, the GH200 (named after computing pioneer Grace Hopper), has entered full production. Meanwhile, Nvidia\u2019s new supercomputer cloud service lets anyone train their own AI models for $36,999 per month. \n  More from TIME \n\n\n \n A weekly newsletter featuring conversations with the world\u2019s top CEOs, managers, and founders.

A closer look at Nvidia's vision for the data center, and the past, present and future of hardware acceleration.David ChernicoffNvidia The Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip brings together the Arm-based NVIDIA Grace CPU and Hopper GPU architectures using NVIDIA NVLink interconnect technology.      Jensen Huang, the CEO of chipmaker Nvidia, has a vision for data centers that run faster and greener. As he outlined stellar first-quarter earnings, Huang asserted that the orders driving Nvidia's sales numbers are a downpayment on a much longer transition in the data center  sector, in which the shift to specialized computing transforms the industry.\"Generative AI is driving exponential growth in compute requirements,\" said Huang in Nvidia's earnings call. \"You're seeing the beginning of\u00a0 a 10-year transition to basically recycle or reclaim the world's data centers and build it out as accelerated computing. You'll have a pretty dramatic shift in the spend of the data center from traditional computing, and to accelerated computing.\"Although generative AI is driving the interest in Nvidia hardware, Huang believes that spending on accelerated computing will become a sustainability story.\u00a0In his keynote at Computex 2023, Huang made the case that using GPU acceleration to train your large language model (LLM )will allow users to complete the work more quickly and use less energy.His specific example used a $10 million spend as an example. Previously, he pointed out, that money would buy 960 CPU-based servers, and to train a single LLM, would require 11 GW of power. Spending that same money today, would buy just 48 GPU-based servers, but that using one-third the energy, they could train 44 LLMs. To just train a single LLM, he suggested ,you could use two GPU-based servers, spending only $400,000, just 4% of the previous expense for the same result. The space saving and reduction in power and cooling need to provide comparable results is clear.The Evolution of Accelerated Computing\u00a0Nvidia's $7.2 billion in first-quarter sales included $4.3 billion in its data center segment, up 18% from the previous quarter. So it's no surprise that Huang is bullish on the sector. In assessing Nvidia's vision for the data center, it's helpful to understand acceleration technology and its evolution.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Accelerated computing is not a new concept. The  original idea, of offloading specific workloads to purpose-built hardware,  from custom ASICs and FPGAs to dedicated server and networking devices, spread  fairly rapidly through the industry, as the advantages were obvious. From  desktops to servers, technologies such as GPU acceleration were adopted and  applied, speeding up everything from gameplay to video editing to 3D rendering. Data centers have long seen storage and networking accelerators added as part  of the IT infrastructure, from dedicated network performance gateways to all  flash array storage becoming standard. And then came machine learning and  training, areas where GPUs excelled in rapid manipulation of the necessary  data.Nvidia is a pioneer in accelerated  computing, having released its first GPU accelerator in 1999 to assist 3D rendering, moving the tasks from only the CPU to let the GPU help out. Over the next two decades, GPU acceleration became  the standard for scientific computing, with the fastest supercomputers in the  world combining CPUs and GPUs to now reach exaflop (one quintillion floating- point operations per second) performance levels.Reimagining the Entire InfrastructureFor the accelerated data center, Nvidia is looking  at a unified infrastructure that includes their Grace CPUs, or Grace Hopper  Superchip, their A100 and H100 GPUs, in various packages, and their BlueField  data processing units, designed to provide a software defined, hardware  accelerated infrastructure for networking, storage, and security services. At  the Nvidia GTC 2023, earlier this year, the company put a stake in the ground,  announcing everything from their DGX deep learning supercomputer, and it\u2019s  availability as the DGX Cloud via public cloud providers, to its own Omniverse  Cloud, platform-as-a-service, as well as the underlying hardware, from the  Grace Hopper Superchip, which combines the Grace CPU and Hopper GPU  architectures in a single package, to the third-generation BlueField  DPUs and their deployment in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. The clear  goal is building unified data center architectures that address the demands of  high performance and AI computing.These products and announcements certainly fit the  trends we have been reporting on. The accelerated data center, be it  Nvidia\u2019s vision or a competitor, with a focus on performance and efficiency,  both in workload processing and energy, is certainly a direction that the  industry will be taking. But none of this happens on its own. The need  continues for a solid supporting infrastructure addressing space, power, and  cooling in effective, efficient, and sustainable ways.For an entertaining view of the integrated and accelerated Nvidia data center and a 3D rendered Jensen Huang, check out this video About the Author David ChernicoffDavid Chernicoff is an experienced technologist and editorial content creator with the ability to see the connections between technology and business while figuring out how to get the most from both and to explain the needs of business to IT and IT to business.Continue ReadingSchneider Sustainability Framework Offers Roadmap for Climate ResponseThe Eight Themes That Will Shape the Data Center Industry in 2024Sponsored RecommendationsOptimizing AI Infrastructure: The Critical Role of Liquid CoolingIn this executive brief, we discuss the growing need for liquid cooling in data centers due to the increasing power demands of AI and high-performance computing.

That excellence is delivered both per-accelerator and at-scale in massive servers.\nFor example, on a commercially available cluster of 3,584 H100 GPUs co-developed by startup Inflection AI and operated by CoreWeave, a cloud service provider specializing in GPU-accelerated workloads, the system completed the massive GPT-3-based training benchmark in less than eleven minutes.\n\u201cOur customers are building state-of-the-art generative AI and LLMs at scale today, thanks to our thousands of H100 GPUs on fast, low-latency InfiniBand networks,\u201d said Brian Venturo, co-founder and CTO of CoreWeave. \u201cOur joint MLPerf submission with NVIDIA clearly demonstrates the great performance our customers enjoy.\u201d\nTop Performance Available Today\nInflection AI harnessed that performance to build the advanced LLM behind its first personal AI, Pi, which stands for personal intelligence. The company will act as an AI studio, creating personal AIs users can interact with in simple, natural ways.\n\u201cAnyone can experience the power of a personal AI today based on our state-of-the-art large language model that was trained on CoreWeave\u2019s powerful network of H100 GPUs,\u201d said Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Inflection AI.\nCo-founded in early 2022 by Mustafa and Kar\u00e9n Simonyan of DeepMind and Reid Hoffman, Inflection AI aims to work with CoreWeave to build one of the largest computing clusters in the world using NVIDIA GPUs.\nTale of the Tape\nThese user experiences reflect the performance demonstrated in the MLPerf benchmarks announced today.\n\nH100 GPUs delivered the highest performance on every benchmark, including large language models, recommenders, computer vision, medical imaging and speech recognition. They were the only chips to run all eight tests, demonstrating the versatility of the NVIDIA AI platform.\nExcellence Running at Scale\nTraining is typically a job run at scale by many GPUs working in tandem. On every MLPerf test, H100 GPUs set new at-scale performance records for AI training.\nOptimizations across the full technology stack enabled near linear performance scaling on the demanding LLM test as submissions scaled from hundreds to thousands of H100 GPUs.\n\nIn addition, CoreWeave delivered from the cloud similar performance to what NVIDIA achieved from an AI supercomputer running in a local data center. That\u2019s a testament to the low-latency networking of the NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking CoreWeave uses.\nIn this round, MLPerf also updated its benchmark for recommendation systems.\nThe new test uses a larger data set and a more modern AI model to better reflect the challenges cloud service providers face. NVIDIA was the only company to submit results on the enhanced benchmark.\nAn Expanding NVIDIA AI Ecosystem\nNearly a dozen companies submitted results on the NVIDIA platform in this round. Their work shows NVIDIA AI is backed by the industry\u2019s broadest ecosystem in machine learning.\nSubmissions came from major system makers that include ASUS, Dell Technologies, GIGABYTE, Lenovo, and QCT. More than 30 submissions ran on H100 GPUs.\nThis level of participation lets users know they can get great performance with NVIDIA AI both in the cloud and in servers running in their own data centers.\nPerformance Across All Workloads\nNVIDIA ecosystem partners participate in MLPerf because they know it\u2019s a valuable tool for customers evaluating AI platforms and vendors.\nThe benchmarks cover workloads users care about \u2014 computer vision, translation and reinforcement learning, in addition to generative AI and recommendation systems.\nUsers can rely on MLPerf results to make informed buying decisions, because the tests are transparent and objective. The benchmarks enjoy backing from a broad group that includes Arm, Baidu, Facebook AI, Google, Harvard, Intel, Microsoft, Stanford and the University of Toronto.\nMLPerf results are available today on H100, L4 and NVIDIA Jetson platforms across AI training, inference and HPC benchmarks. We\u2019ll be making submissions on NVIDIA Grace Hopper systems in future MLPerf rounds as well.\nThe Importance of Energy Efficiency\nAs AI\u2019s performance requirements grow, it\u2019s essential to expand the efficiency of how that performance is achieved. That\u2019s what accelerated computing does.\nData centers accelerated with NVIDIA GPUs use fewer server nodes, so they use less rack space and energy. In addition, accelerated networking boosts efficiency and performance, and ongoing software optimizations bring x-factor gains on the same hardware.\nEnergy-efficient performance is good for the planet and business, too. Increased performance can speed time to market and let organizations build more advanced applications.\nEnergy efficiency also reduces costs because data centers accelerated with NVIDIA GPUs use fewer server nodes. Indeed, NVIDIA powers 22 of the top 30 supercomputers on the latest Green500 list.\nSoftware Available to All\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise, the software layer of the NVIDIA AI platform, enables optimized performance on leading accelerated computing infrastructure. The software comes with the enterprise-grade support, security and reliability required to run AI in the corporate data center.\nAll the software used for these tests is available from the MLPerf repository, so virtually anyone can get these world-class results.\nOptimizations are continuously folded into containers available on NGC, NVIDIA\u2019s catalog for GPU-accelerated software.\nRead this technical blog for a deeper dive into the optimizations fueling NVIDIA\u2019s MLPerf performance and efficiency.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Cloud Services | Computer Vision | Conversational AI | Customer Stories | Hardware | Machine Learning | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | Recommender Systems \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

These can be challenging and costly to obtain, especially with increasing demands both of and for AI.\nThe Rendered.ai platform-as-a-service helps to solve this issue by generating physically accurate synthetic data \u2014 data that\u2019s created from 3D simulations \u2014 to train computer vision models.\n\u201cReal-world data often can\u2019t capture all of the possible scenarios and edge cases necessary to generalize an AI model, which is where SDG becomes key for AI and machine learning engineers,\u201d said Nathan Kundtz, founder and CEO of Rendered.ai, which is based in Bellevue, Wash., a Seattle suburb.\n\nRegister for NVIDIA GTC, which takes place March 17-21, to hear how companies like Rendered.ai are using the latest innovations in AI and graphics.\u00a0Join OpenUSD Day to learn how to build generative AI-enabled 3D pipelines and tools using Universal Scene Description.\n\nA member of the NVIDIA Inception program for cutting-edge startups, Rendered.ai has now integrated into its platform NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator, a core extension of the Omniverse platform for developing and operating industrial metaverse applications.\nOmniverse Replicator enables developers to generate labeled synthetic data for many such applications, including visual inspection, robotics and autonomous driving. It\u2019s built on open standards for 3D workflows, including Universal Scene Description (\u201cOpenUSD\u201d), Material Definition Language (MDL) and PhysX.\nSynthetic images generated with Rendered.ai have been used to model landscapes and vegetation for virtual worlds, detect objects in satellite imagery, and even test the viability of human oocytes, or egg cells.\nSynthetic imagery generated using Omniverse Replicator. Image courtesy of Rendered.ai.\nWith Rendered.ai tapping into the RTX-accelerated functionalities of Omniverse Replicator \u2014 such as ray tracing, domain randomization and multi-sensor simulation \u2014 computer vision engineers, data scientists and other users can quickly and easily generate synthetic data through a simple web interface in the cloud.\n\u201cThe data that we have to train AI is really the dominant factor on the AI\u2019s performance,\u201d Kundtz said. \u201cIntegrating Omniverse Replicator into Rendered.ai will enable new levels of ease and efficiency for users tapping synthetic data to train bigger, better AI models for applications across industries.\u201d\nRendered.ai will demonstrate its platform integration with Omniverse Replicator at the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), running June 18-22 in Vancouver, Canada.\nSynthetic Data Generation in the Cloud\nRendered.ai, now available through AWS Marketplace, brings to the cloud a collaborative web interface for developers and teams to design SDG applications that can be easily configured by computer vision engineers and data scientists.\nIt\u2019s a one-stop shop for people to share workspaces containing SDG datasets, tasks, graphs and more \u2014 all through a web browser.\nA view of the Rendered.ai platform-as-a-service, available on a web browser. Image courtesy of Rendered.ai.\nOmniverse Replicator tutorials, examples and other 3D assets can now be easily tapped in a Rendered.ai channel running on AWS infrastructure. This gives developers a starting point for building their own SDG capabilities in the cloud. And the process will be especially seamless for Omniverse Replicator users who are already familiar with these tools.\nRendered.ai focuses on offering physically accurate synthetic data through the platform, as this enables introducing new information to AI systems based on how physical processes work in the real world, according to Kundtz.\n\u201cIn the future, every company using AI is going to have a synthetic data engineering team for physics-based modeling and domain-specific AI-model building,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s often not good enough to simulate something once, as complex AI tasks require training on large batches of data covering diverse scenarios \u2014 this is where synthetic data becomes key.\u201d\nHear more from Kundtz on the NVIDIA AI Podcast.\nLearn more about Omniverse Replicator and the new cloud capability on the Rendered.ai site.\u00a0Sign up for a 30-day trial of the Rendered.ai Developer account using the content code \u201cOVDEMO\u201d \u2014 which will enable access to the new Rendered.ai Channel for Omniverse.\nFeatured image courtesy of Rendered.ai.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Pro GraphicsTags: Computer Vision | Inception | Machine Learning | Omniverse | Simulation and Design | Synthetic Data Generation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Voxels can be identified as free, occupied or unknown.\nWatch the NVIDIA DRIVE Labs video on 3D occupancy prediction:\n\nCritical to the development of safe and robust self-driving systems, 3D occupancy grid prediction provides information to autonomous vehicle (AV) planning and control stacks using state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks and transformer models, which are enabled by the NVIDIA DRIVE platform.\n\u201cNVIDIA\u2019s winning solution features two important AV advancements,\u201d said Zhiding Yu, senior research scientist for learning and perception at NVIDIA. \u201cIt demonstrates a state-of-the-art model design that yields excellent bird\u2019s-eye-view perception. It also shows the effectiveness of visual foundation models with up to 1 billion parameters and large-scale pretraining in 3D occupancy prediction.\u201d\nPerception for autonomous driving has evolved over the past years from handling 2D tasks, such as detecting objects or free spaces in images, to reasoning about the world in 3D with multiple input images.\nThis now provides a flexible and precise fine-grained representation of objects in complex traffic scenes, which is \u201ccritical for achieving the safety perception requirements for autonomous driving,\u201d according to Jose Alvarez, director of AV applied research and distinguished scientist at NVIDIA.\nYu will present the NVIDIA Research team\u2019s award-winning work at CVPR\u2019s End-to-End Autonomous Driving Workshop on Sunday, June 18, at 10:20 a.m. PT, as well as at the Vision-Centric Autonomous Driving Workshop on Monday, June 19, at 4:00 p.m. PT.\nIn addition to winning first place in the challenge, NVIDIA will receive at the event an Innovation Award, recognizing its \u201cfresh insights into the development of view transformation modules,\u201d with \u201csubstantially improved performance\u201d compared to previous approaches, according to the CVPR workshop committee.\nRead NVIDIA\u2019s technical report on the submission.\nSafer Vehicles With 3D Occupancy Prediction\nWhile traditional 3D object detection \u2014 detecting and representing objects in a scene, often using 3D bounding boxes \u2014 is a core task in AV perception, it has its limitations. For example, it lacks expressiveness, meaning the bounding boxes might not represent enough real-world information. It also requires defining taxonomies and ground truths for all possible objects, even ones rarely seen in the real world, such as road hazards that may have fallen off a truck.\nIn contrast, 3D occupancy prediction provides rich information about the world to a self-driving vehicle\u2019s planning stack, which is necessary for end-to-end autonomous driving.\nSoftware-defined vehicles can be continuously upgraded with new developments that are proven and validated over time. State-of-the-art software updates that evolve from research initiatives, such as the ones recognized at CVPR, are enabling new features and safer driving capabilities.\nThe NVIDIA DRIVE platform offers a path to production for automakers, providing full-stack hardware and software for safe and secure AV development, from the car to the data center.\n\nMore on the CVPR Challenge\n\nThe 3D Occupancy Prediction Challenge at CVPR required participants to develop algorithms that solely used camera input during inference. Participants could use open-source datasets and models, facilitating the exploration of data-driven algorithms and large-scale models. The organizers provided a baseline sandbox for the latest state-of-the-art 3D occupancy prediction algorithms in real-world scenarios.\nNVIDIA at CVPR\nNVIDIA is presenting nearly 30 papers and presentations at CVPR. Experts who\u2019ll discuss autonomous driving include:\n\nJose Alvarez on emerging challenges for 3D perception in AVs during the End-to-End Autonomous Driving Workshop: Emerging Tasks and Challenges Workshop; and on optimizing large deep models for real-time inference at the Embedded Vision Workshop.\nNikolai Smolyanskiy, director of deep learning at NVIDIA, on real-time traffic prediction for AVs during the End-to-End Autonomous Driving Workshop: Perception, Prediction, Planning and Simulation.\nRobin Jenkin, distinguished engineer at NVIDIA, on image quality in fisheye cameras at the OmniCV Workshop, held in conjunction with CVPR.\nXinshuo Weng, research scientist for AV research at NVIDIA, on vision solutions for autonomous driving during the Vision-Centric Autonomous Driving Workshop.\n\nView other talks on the agenda and learn more about NVIDIA at CVPR, which runs June 18-22.\nFeatured image courtesy of OccNet and Occ3D.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: 3D | Events | NVIDIA DRIVE | NVIDIA Research | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

That\u2019s an order of magnitude more than it generated in 2012 when two of its experiments uncovered the Higgs boson, a subatomic particle that validated scientists\u2019 understanding of the universe.\nThe Call of Geneva\nGirone loved science from her earliest days growing up in Southern Italy.\n\u201cIn college, I wanted to learn about the fundamental forces that govern the universe, so I focused on physics,\u201d she said. \u201cI was drawn to CERN because it\u2019s where people from different parts of the world work together with a common passion for science.\u201d\nTucked between Lake Geneva and the Jura mountains, the European Organization for Nuclear Research is a nexus for more than 12,000 physicists.\nA map of CERN and the LHC below it on the French-Swiss border. (Image courtesy of CERN)\nIts 27-kilometer ring is sometimes called the world\u2019s fastest racetrack because protons careen around it at 99.9999991% the speed of light. Its superconducting magnets operate near absolute zero, creating collisions that are briefly millions of times hotter than the sun.\nOpening the Lab Doors\nIn 2016, Girone was named CTO of CERN openlab, a group that gathers academic and industry researchers to accelerate innovation and tackle future computing challenges. It works closely with NVIDIA through its collaboration with E4 Computer Engineering, a specialist in HPC and AI based in Italy.\nIn one of her initial acts, Girone organized the CERN openlab\u2019s first workshop on AI.\nIndustry participation was strong and enthusiastic about the technology. In their presentations, physicists explained the challenges ahead.\n\u201cBy the end of the day we realized we were from two different worlds, but people were listening to each other, and enthusiastically coming up with proposals for what to do next,\u201d she said.\nA Rising Tide of Physics AI\nToday, the number of publications on applying AI across the whole data processing chain in high-energy physics is rising, Girone reports. The work attracts young researchers who see opportunities to solve complex problems with AI, she said.\nMeanwhile, researchers are also porting physics software to GPU accelerators and using existing AI programs that run on GPUs.\n\u201cThis wouldn\u2019t have happened so quickly without the support of NVIDIA working with our researchers to solve problems, answer questions and write articles,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been extremely important to have people at NVIDIA who appreciate how science needs to evolve in tandem with technology, and how we can make use of acceleration with GPUs.\u201d\nEnergy efficiency is another priority for Girone\u2019s team.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working on experiments on a number of projects like porting to lower power architectures, and we look forward to evaluating the next generation of lower power processors,\u201d she said.\nDigital Twins and Quantum Computers\nTo prepare for the HL-LHC, Girone, named head of CERN openlab in March, seeks new ways to accelerate science with machine learning and accelerated computing. Other tools are on the near and far horizons, too.\nThe group recently won funding to prototype an engine for building digital twins. It will provide services for physicists, as well as researchers in fields from astronomy to environmental science.\nA look inside the accelerator. (Image courtesy of CERN)\nCERN also launched a collaboration among academic and industry researchers in quantum computing. The technology could advance science and lead to better quantum systems, too.\nA Passion for Diversity\nIn another act of community-making, Girone was among four co-founders of a Swiss chapter of the Women in HPC group. It will help define specific actions to support women in every phase of their careers.\n\u201cI\u2019m passionate about creating diverse teams where everyone feels they contribute and belong \u2014 it\u2019s not just a checkbox about numbers, you want to realize a feeling of belonging,\u201d she said.\nGirone was among thousands of physicists who captured some of that spirit the day CERN announced the Higgs boson discovery.\nShe recalls getting up at 4 a.m. to queue for a seat in the main auditorium. It couldn\u2019t hold all the researchers and guests who arrived that day, but the joy of accomplishment followed her and others watching the event from a nearby hall.\n\u201cI knew the contribution I made,\u201d she said. \u201cI was proud being among the many authors of the paper, and my parents and my kids felt proud, too.\u201d\nCheck out other profiles in this series:\n\nScientist Sharpens Weather Forecasts With AI\nScientist Explores Quantum Worlds With HPC, AI\nAI, HPC Help Fuel Breakthrough in Nuclear Fusion\n\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | Digital Twin | GPU Computing | High-Performance Computing | HPC Stories | Machine Learning | NVIDIA in Europe | Science | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It focuses on creating unique visual identities to help clients express themselves.\nThe creative duo behind the studio, based in New York, said they\u2019ve always been fascinated with blurring the boundary between fantasy and reality in their work.\nTogether, they created the 3D video Somewhere in the World and a summer-themed series of artwork this week In the NVIDIA Studio, using Adobe After Effects, Autodesk 3ds Max and Unreal Engine 5.\n\nGeForce RTX 4060 graphics cards are now available to order, starting at $299. The state-of-the-art NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture supercharges creative apps and productivity, while delivering immersive, AI-accelerated gaming with ray tracing and DLSS 3.\nThe GeForce RTX 4060 GPU has arrived.\nPlus, Chaos Vantage 2 is now available, offering new benefits for creators on RTX GPUs \u2014 like the GeForce RTX 4060 \u2014 including NVIDIA AI Denoiser for smoother image quality, as well as the direct light reservoir sampling feature powered by NVIDIA RTX Direct Illumination (RTXDI) technology.\nChaos Vantage 2 Powered by NVIDIA RTX\nChaos Vantage is a high-quality 3D visualization tool for artists who use the V-Ray rendering software. It enables users to quickly explore and present their work in a fully ray-traced environment that can handle massive scenes based on large models. Vantage 2 adds powerful new capabilities, enabling architectural-visualization and visual-effects artists to convey their designs more effectively.\n\nVantage 2 features the new NVIDIA AI Denoiser, which automatically removes noise from images when rendering high-quality output. Its upscaling mode increases frame rates and responsiveness in interactive rendering for a smoother, more efficient experience in the viewport.\nThe update also adds direct light reservoir sampling, powered by NVIDIA RTXDI technology, enabling artists to scale multiple dynamic light sources to sizable scenes \u2014 lightning fast \u2014 with no impact on performance.\nRendered in Chaos Vantage 2. Image courtesy of \u00a9 Brick Visual.\nRounding out the Vantage update are new scene states to turn design-validation presentations into interactive storyboards; support for realistic vegetation movement in the wind and interaction with animated characters; and enhancements for popular render elements like back to beauty, material and object masks for compositing in image-editing apps.\nLearn more about Vantage 2, available now.\nEnter the Minds of MUE Studio\nWhen designing an environment, MUE Studio aims to create a minimalistic space that invites viewers \u201cto enter and take a break,\u201d said Kim.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/bubble.mp4\n\u00a0\nThis is the foundation of Somewhere in the World, as well as the studio\u2019s summer-themed series of artwork. By intentionally setting the time of day, placing a specific object or choosing a remote location, the artists ensure these pieces can become a viewer\u2019s personal path to tranquility.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/curtain.mp4\n\u00a0\n\u201cOur purpose is to provide comfort and inspire people to dream of a better world,\u201d said Kang. \u201cWe really appreciate comments we\u2019ve received, saying things like, \u2018These images are calm,\u2019 and \u2018I would like to be present in that space.\u2019 Such words fuel us as artists.\u201d\nIdyllic environments created by MUE Studio.\nThe visuals\u2019 minimalist aesthetic was brought to life through systems powered with GeForce RTX graphics.\nThe duo began sculpting and modeling in Autodesk 3ds Max. RTX-accelerated AI denoising with the default Autodesk Arnold renderer made movement in the viewport highly interactive.\nFeel the calm of MUE Studio\u2019s artwork.\nMUE Studio is especially interested in the human element of their art, the founders said. Kang focuses on the artistic tension between presence and absence, and Kim explores unique human cultures throughout the pieces.\nThe artists completed texture application, lighting and animations in Unreal Engine 5. RTX acceleration unlocked high-fidelity interactive visualization, leading to stunning photorealistic render quality.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chair.mp4\n\u00a0\nKim said MUE Studio\u2019s go-to creative app for post-production is Adobe After Effects, which includes 30+ GPU-accelerated effects. The duo applied the app\u2019s Sharpen, Brightness and Contrast and Gradient Ramp features when putting the finishing touches on their marvelous masterpieces.\nTake a summer vacation.\n\u201cOur series of art provides an opportunity for viewers to momentarily escape reality, creating a safe, digital space where the community can relax and interact with one another,\u201d Kang said.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/summer.mp4\n\u00a0\nCheck out more of MUE Studio\u2019s 3D creations on Instagram.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

Take on the latest games and apps with the ultra-efficient NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture and DLSS 3.\nTo download and install, head to the Drivers tab of GeForce Experience or GeForce.com, and read on for further details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For The GeForce RTX 4060\nIn May we announced the GeForce RTX 4060 Family, and launched the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti. Today, the GeForce RTX 4060 goes on sale, with prices starting at $299. For gamers playing on previous-gen GPUs, the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture at the heart of the GeForce RTX 4060 delivers a massive upgrade, multiplying your performance, and supercharging creative apps. And thanks to the Ada architecture\u2019s industry-leading efficiency, you\u2019ll use measurably less power, your graphics card will run cooler, and fans will run at quieter speeds or even idle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cUnleash the GeForce RTX 4060 in Dying Light 2 Stay Human and high frame rates at max settings is no sweat\" - Tomasz Sza\u0142kowski, Rendering Director, Techland.\nBased on the May 2023 Steam Hardware Survey, 9 of the top 10 most used GPUs on Steam are 60 Class or lower, and 77% of Steam gamers play at 1080p or lower resolutions. For these gamers, the new GeForce RTX 4060 is a great upgrade, enabling them to play new, more demanding games at 1080p at excellent levels of fidelity. For gamers coming from a GeForce RTX 2060, performance is multiplied by an average of 2.3X across a suite of 18 games, and for GeForce GTX 1060 users, in addition to higher frame rates, they also get ray tracing and DLSS acceleration for the first time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese substantial improvements enable you to enjoy the majority of games at high frames with max settings including ray tracing. And thanks to NVIDIA DLSS 3, you can experience some of the industry\u2019s most advanced games running at over 100 FPS, at the highest possible detail levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"DLSS 3 enables the RTX 4060 to deliver amazing ray-traced performance in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide\" - Mikael Hansson, Chief Technical Officer, Fatshark\nThanks to the Ada architecture\u2019s industry-leading efficiency, the average gamer playing 10-20 hours a week could save a significant amount at recent energy prices, while having a vastly superior gaming experience. In Germany, for example, a gamer playing 20 hours a week could save up to $132 in energy costs over the course of 4 years, when upgrading from an RTX 3060 to an RTX 4060.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRTX 4060 with DLSS 3 is incredibly power efficient even in Returnal\u2019s bullet hell-fuelled combat\u201d - Mikael Haveri, Brand Director, Housemarque.

If you've been holding onto an older card and are looking at getting into 1080p gaming - especially with ray tracing, it's a no brainer\u2026\u201d - MMORPG.com\n\u201cFor gamers who haven't upgraded, if you want the best GPU feature set available today on the Ada Lovelace chips, then the RTX 4060 is worth its mainstream pricing\u201d - Wccftech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Game Ready Driver - Download Now\nLearn more about GeForce Game Ready Drivers here; download the new GeForce Game Ready 536.40 WHQL driver through GeForce Experience.\nIf you experience any technical issues with the new Game Ready drivers please post a detailed report on the GeForce.com Driver Feedback Forum, where our Customer Care team can better assist you.

He also touched on the ways AI can enhance creators\u2019 abilities, as well as the importance of responsible AI development.\n\u201cYou can do content generation at scale, but infinite content doesn\u2019t imply infinite creativity,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough our thoughts, we have to direct this AI to generate content that has to be aligned to your values and your brand tone.\u201d\nThe discussion followed Huang\u2019s recent keynote at COMPUTEX, where NVIDIA and WPP announced a collaboration to develop a content engine powered by generative AI and the NVIDIA Omniverse platform for building and operating metaverse applications.\nDriving Forces of the Generative AI Era\nNVIDIA has been pushing the boundaries of graphics technology for 30 years and been at the forefront of the AI revolution for a decade. This combination of expertise in graphics and AI uniquely positions the company to enable the new era of generative AI applications.\nHuang said that \u201cthe biggest moment of modern AI\u201d can be traced back to an academic contest in 2012, when a team of University of Toronto researchers led by Alex Krizhevsky showed that NVIDIA GPUs could train an AI model that recognized objects better than any computer vision algorithm that came before it.\nSince then, developers have taught neural networks to recognize images, videos, speech, protein structures, physics and more.\n\u201cYou could learn the language of almost anything,\u201d Huang said. \u201cOnce you learn the language, you can apply the language \u2014 and the application of language is generation.\u201d\nGenerative AI models can create text, pixels, 3D objects and realistic motion, giving professionals superpowers to more quickly bring their ideas to life. Like a creative director working with a team of artists, users can direct AI models with prompts, and fine-tune the output to align with their vision.\n\u201cYou have to give the machine feedback like the best creative director,\u201d Read said.\nThese tools aren\u2019t a replacement for human creativity, Huang emphasized. They augment the skills of artists and marketing professionals to help them feed demand from clients by producing content more quickly and in multiple forms tailored to different audiences.\n\u201cWe will democratize content generation,\u201d Huang said.\nReimagining How We Live, Work and Create With AI\nGenerative AI\u2019s key benefit for the creative industry is its ability to scale up content generation, rapidly generating options for text and visuals that can be used in advertising, marketing and film.\n\u201cIn the old days, you\u2019d create hundreds of different ad options that are retrieved based on the medium,\u201d Huang said. \u201cIn the future, you won\u2019t retrieve \u2014 you\u2019ll generate billions of different ads. But every single one of them has to be tone appropriate, has to be brand perfect.\u201d\nFor use by professional creators, these AI tools must also produce high-quality visuals that meet or exceed the standard of content captured through traditional methods.\nIt all starts with a digital twin, a true-to-reality simulation of a real-world physical asset. The NVIDIA Omniverse platform enables the creation of stunning, photorealistic visuals that accurately represent physics and materials \u2014 whether for images, videos, 3D objects or immersive virtual worlds.\n\u201cOmniverse is a virtual world,\u201d Huang said. \u201cWe created a virtual world where AI could learn how to create an AI that\u2019s physically based and grounded by physics.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cThis virtual world has the ability to ingest assets and content that\u2019s created by any tool, because we have this interface called USD,\u201d he said, referring to the Universal Scene Description framework for collaborating in 3D. With it, artists and designers can combine assets developed using popular tools from companies like Adobe and Autodesk with virtual worlds developed using generative AI.\nNVIDIA Picasso, a foundry for custom generative AI models for visual design unveiled earlier this year, also supports best-in-class image, video and 3D generative AI capabilities developed in collaboration with partners including Adobe, Getty Images and Shutterstock.\n\u201cWe created a platform that makes it possible for our partners to train from data that was licensed properly from, for example, Getty, Shutterstock, Adobe,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThey\u2019re respectful of the content owners. The training data comes from that source, and whatever economic benefits come from that could accrete back to the creators.\u201d\nLike any groundbreaking technology, it\u2019s critical that AI is developed and deployed thoughtfully, Read and Huang said. Technology to watermark AI-generated assets and to detect whether a digital asset was modified or counterfeited will support these goals.\n\u201cWe have to put as much energy into the capabilities of AI as we do the safety of AI,\u201d Huang said. \u201cIn the world of advertising, safety is brand alignment, brand integrity, appropriate tone and truth.\u201d\nCollaborating on Content Engine for Digital Advertising\nAs a leader in digital advertising, WPP is embracing AI as a tool to boost creativity and personalization, helping creators across the industry craft compelling messages that reach the right consumer.\n\u201cFrom the creative process to the customer, there\u2019s going to have to be ad agencies in the middle that understand the technology,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThat entire process in the middle requires humans in the loop. You have to understand the voice of the brand you\u2019re trying to represent.\u201d\nUsing Omniverse Cloud, WPP\u2019s creative professionals can build physically accurate digital twins of products using a brand\u2019s specific product-design data. This real-world data can be combined with AI-generated objects and digital environments \u2014 licensed through partners such as Adobe and Getty Images \u2014 to create virtual sets for marketing content.\n\u201cWPP is going to unquestionably become an AI company,\u201d Huang said. \u201cYou\u2019ll create an AI factory where the input is creativity, thoughts and prompts, and what comes out of it is content.\u201d\n\nEnhanced by responsibly trained, NVIDIA-accelerated generative AI, this content engine will boost creative teams\u2019 speed and efficiency, helping them quickly render brand-accurate advertising content at scale.\n\u201cThe type of content you\u2019ll be able to help your clients generate will be practically infinite,\u201d Huang said. \u201cFrom the days of hundreds of examples of content that you create for a particular brand or for a particular campaign, it\u2019s going to eventually become billions of generated content for every individual.\u201d\nLearn more about NVIDIA\u2019s collaboration with WPP.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AITags: Art | Artificial Intelligence | Cloud Services | Consumer Internet | Media and Entertainment | Metaverse | Omniverse | Retail \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

MagiScan is available for download on iOS and Android devices.\n\u201cIt can help everyone from individuals to large corporations save time and money in digitalization,\u201d said Sidarchuk, who claims his first word as a toddler was \u201cmoney.\u201d\nThe business-oriented developer started his first company at age 16. It was a one-man endeavor, buying fresh fruits and vegetables from a small village and selling them in Minsk, the capital of Belarus. \u201cThat\u2019s how I earned enough to buy my first car,\u201d he mused.\nMore than a dozen years later, when he\u2019s not working to \u201cenhance human capabilities through augmented-reality technologies,\u201d he said, Sidarchuk now spends his free time with his five-year-old daughter, Aurora.\nWatch Sidarchuk discuss 3D modeling, AI and AR on a replay of his Omniverse livestream on demand, and learn more about the MagiScan extension for Omniverse.\n\nJoin In on the Creation\nAnyone can build their own Omniverse extension or Connector to enhance their 3D workflows and tools.

But with generative AI, Insilico accomplished them for one-tenth of the cost and one-third of the time \u2014 reaching the first phase of clinical trials just two and a half years after beginning the project.\n\u201cThis first drug candidate that\u2019s going to Phase 2 is a true highlight of our end-to-end approach to bridge biology and chemistry with deep learning,\u201d said Alex Zhavoronkov, CEO of Insilico Medicine. \u201cThis is a significant milestone not only for us, but for everyone in the field of AI-accelerated drug discovery.\u201d\nInsilico is a premier member of NVIDIA Inception, a free program that provides cutting-edge startups with technical training, go-to-market support and AI platform guidance. The company uses NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs in its generative AI drug design engine, Chemistry42, to generate novel molecular structures \u2014 and was one of the first adopters of an early precursor to NVIDIA DGX systems in 2015.\nAI Enables End-to-End Preclinical Drug Discovery\nInsilico\u2019s Pharma.AI platform includes multiple AI models trained on millions of data samples for a range of tasks. One AI tool, PandaOmics, rapidly identifies and prioritizes targets that play a significant role in a disease\u2019s effectiveness \u2014 like the infamous spike protein on the virus that causes COVID-19.\nThe Chemistry42 engine can design within days new potential drug compounds that target the protein identified using PandaOmics. The generative chemistry tool uses deep learning to come up with drug-like molecular structures from scratch.\n\u201cTypically, AI companies in drug discovery focus either on biology or on chemistry,\u201d said Petrina Kamya, head of AI platforms at Insilico. \u201cFrom the start, Insilico has been applying the same deep learning approach to both fields, using AI both to discover drug targets and generate chemical structures of small molecules.\u201d\nOver the years, the Insilico team has adopted different kinds of deep neural networks for drug discovery, including generative adversarial networks and transformer models. They\u2019re now using NVIDIA BioNeMo to accelerate the early drug discovery process with generative AI.\nFinding the Needle in the AI Stack\nTo develop its pulmonary fibrosis drug candidate, Insilico used Pharma.AI to design and synthesize about 80 molecules, achieving unprecedented success rates for preclinical drug candidates. The process \u2014 from identifying the target to nominating a promising drug candidate for trials \u2014 took under 18 months.\nDuring Phase 2 clinical trials, Insilico\u2019s pulmonary fibrosis drug will be tested in several hundred people with the condition in the U.S. and China. The process will take several months \u2014 but in parallel, the company has more than 30 programs in the pipeline to target other diseases, including a number of cancer drugs.\n\u201cWhen we first presented our results, people just did not believe that generative AI systems could achieve this level of diversity, novelty and accuracy,\u201d said Zhavoronkov. \u201cNow that we have an entire pipeline of promising drug candidates, people are realizing that this actually works.\u201d\nLearn more about Insilico Medicine\u2019s Chemistry42 platform for AI-accelerated drug candidate screening in this talk from NVIDIA GTC.\nSubscribe to NVIDIA healthcare news and generative AI news. \n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Genomics | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | NVIDIA NeMo | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Learn more.\nStreaming and entertainmentStreaming hardwareAfter 3 years with a Chromecast, I just want Nvidia to make a new Shield TVNVIDIA is a trillion-dollar company now. It can surely spare a few millions on a new Shield TV project. (Please?)By Rita El Khoury\u2022Published onJune 2, 2023\u20220\u2022\nEvery time I sit down in front of my TV and pick up the remote, I am reminded of the mistake that I made a couple of years ago when I decided that Google\u2019s then-new Chromecast was good enough for my use. At the time, I was moving from Lebanon to France and I was faced with a decision: carry my 2017 NVIDIA Shield TV or my 2020 Chromecast with Google TV (4K)? I picked the latter and I\u2019ve since regretted that choice many times. The Shield TV was near perfect and now all I really want is for NVIDIA to make a new Shield TV.Three reasons made me go with the Chromecast with Google TV as my Android TV box of choice: it was newer, it was running the more modern Google TV experience, and it was guaranteed to be the first one to get Google\u2019s new features and experiments. Since I write about Android for a living, the last argument made everything else moot.\nDo you want NVIDIA to make a new Shield TV?8915 votesYes.97%No.3%David Imel / Android AuthorityLittle did I know that, as time passed, most of Google\u2019s updates for Google TV would be borderline uninteresting to me \u2014 and mostly revolve around recommendations instead of adding new features. Or that the Chromecast would become a bit more annoying to use with each passing day. The paltry 2GB of RAM and 8GB of storage make for a randomly sluggish experience. Sometimes, everything flies and I see no skips or hiccups, then it slows down to a crawl all of a sudden. Usually when I try to use Google Assistant or any kind of voice input. Sigh.I kept the Chromecast because I thought I'd appreciate the updates and new Google TV experience. I didn't imagine that storage would be a bigger problem.And even now, after Google has rolled out speed, performance, and storage improvements, I still have trouble keeping all the streaming apps installed without running into storage problems. Back in Lebanon, I used Plex, YouTube, and Spotify. Here in France, if I only want to watch some football (the \u26bd\ufe0f kind) and tennis, I need at least four extra streaming services and apps installed. So when I hit the storage limit on my Chromecast, I gravitated towards my Xiaomi Android TV and nearly stopped using the Chromecast altogether. It\u2019s not an ideal experience, but it provides me with more storage for the apps I need.Storage was never an issue on my 2017 Shield TV. Hiccups used to happen, but they weren\u2019t as frequent. (At least until I stopped using it.) I could download and play powerful and demanding games on it too, without an issue. Since I\u2019m not a heavy gamer, the Shield TV played the role of a make-shift console for me, providing me with a fun gaming experience at a fraction of the price.And NVIDIA has impressively kept its Shield TV units up to date all the way back to the first 2015 model, negating most of my worries about being left with older software. That level of support on top of excellent hardware is the reason why I\u2019m currently yearning for a new Shield TV.I\u2019ve rarely seen companies treat their products as well as NVIDIA did for its Shield line-up so it\u2019s a bit of a shame that we haven\u2019t seen anything new since the Shield TV 2019 which, let\u2019s face it, wasn\u2019t a winner on all fronts.Few companies have treated their Android products as well as NVIDIA has done with the Shield TV.\nIn an ideal world, there\u2019s a lab in a back alley inside NVIDIA\u2019s headquarters where someone has been cooking up a follow-up Shield TV with more storage and RAM, a faster processor, HDMI 2.1, and support for all the new streaming formats, codecs, and technologies. And maybe, with its new trillion-dollar valuation and stock surge, there are enough green bills lying around to justify pursuing a side project that\u2019ll keep us, Android users, happy.The current streaming box market is gravitating toward cheap, disposable, sub-$50 streaming sticks and boxes which are fine for a year, maybe two, and then become dead weight. Even Google has decided that the Chromecast was too powerful and went for a more affordable and lower-specced Chromecast with Google TV (HD). If we want a more powerful Android TV box, it\u2019s unlikely that Google or Xiaomi will provide it. NVIDIA was the only one that did this right in the past decade. I\u2019d love if it did it again this year.\nYou might likeFeaturesAndroid TVGoogle ChromecastGoogle TVNVIDIANVIDIA ShieldFollow"

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Chief Analyst & CEO, NAND Research. Follow AuthorJun 27, 2023, 02:39pm EDTShareSaveCommentNVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUNVIDIA Corporation\nTo know how a system performs across a range of AI workloads, you look at its MLPerf benchmark numbers. AI is rapidly evolving, with generative AI workloads becoming increasingly prominent, and MLPerf is evolving with the industry. Its new MLPerf Training v3.0 benchmark suite introduces new tests for recommendation engines and large language model (LLM) training.\n\nMLPerf Training v3.0NVIDIA Corporation\nMLCommons, which oversees MLPerf, released the latest MLPerf benchmark results today. The NVIDIA H100 dominated nearly every category and was the only GPU used in the new LLM benchmarks.\n\n\nThe top numbers for LLM and BERT natural language processing (NLP) benchmarks belonged to a system jointly developed by NVIDIA and Inflection AI and hosted by CoreWeave, a cloud services provider specializing in enterprise-scale GPU-accelerated workloads. To say that the numbers are impressive is an understatement.\n\nNVIDIA H100 Dominates Every Benchmark\nThe MLPerf LLM benchmark is based on OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 LLM trained with 175 billion parameters (GPT-3 was the latest generation GPT available when the benchmark was created last year). Training LLMs is a computationally expensive task, with Lambda Labs estimating that training GPT-3 with 175 billion parameters requires about 3.14E23 FLOPS of computing. That\u2019s a lot of expensive horsepower.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nNVIDIA designed the H100 Tensor Core GPU for exactly these workloads, and it is quickly becoming one of the most popular accelerators for training large language models. This is for a good reason. NVIDIA introduced a new transformer engine in the H100, explicitly designed to accelerate transformer model training and inference (NVIDIA provides an excellent description of the device's full capabilities in a blog post). Transformers are at the heart of generative AI, so it's expected that the H100 should perform better than previous generations. NVIDIA says everything is faster on the H100, with its new transformer engine boosting training up to 6x.\n\nOf the 90 systems included in today\u2019s results, 82 used NVIDIA accelerators (of the 8 non-NVIDIA systems tested, all but one were submitted by Intel). Just under half of all results were based on the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU. The NVIDIA H100 set records on every workload in the MLPerf training and inference benchmarks, while NVIDIA\u2019s A100 and L4 GPUs provided healthy inference results.\n\n NVIDIA MLPerf v3.0 ResultsNVIDIA Corporation\nLooking deeper into the metrics, the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU yielded a per-accelerator LLM training time of 548 hours (about 23 days). The GPU also set per-accelerator records on every benchmark tested.NVIDIA H100 MLPerf Results, across benchmarksNVIDIA Corporation\nLLM at Scale: NVIDIA + Inflection AI + CoreWeave\nLooking at per-accelerator results is interesting, but real-world production workloads are rarely built using single accelerators. There are efficiencies of scale that emerge in a clustered system with multiple GPUs, something NVIDIA designed in from the start with its ongoing focus on GPU-to-GPU communication using its NVLink technology. Understanding real-world performance requires looking at results on a system level.\nNVIDIA and Inflection AI co-developed a large-scale GPU cluster based on the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU, hosted and tested by Coreweave. The system combines 3,584 NVIDIA H100 accelerators with 896 4th generation Intel Xeon Platinum 8462Y+ processors. The results are staggering, setting new records on every workload tested.NVIIDA H100 Results across workloads.NVIDIA Corporation\nDelving into the LLM benchmarks shows off the full capabilities of NVIDIA\u2019s technology. The 3,854 GPU cluster completed the massive GPT-3-based training benchmark in less than eleven minutes, while a configuration containing half that number of GPUs completed in nearly 24 minutes, demonstrating the non-linear scalability potential of the NVIDIA H100 GPU.\nIntel was the only other entity to report LLM benchmark results. Intel's systems combined 64-96 Intel Xeon Platinum 8380 processors with 256-389 Intel Habana Gaudi2 accelerators. Intel reported LLM training times of 311 minutes for its top-end configuration.\nAnalyst\u2019s Take\nBenchmarks provide a point-in-time comparison of systems. That nearly every submitted result was based on an NVIDIA accelerator speaks to the continued dominance of NVIDIA within the AI ecosystem. While this dominance is largely based on its accelerator technology, the stickiness of NVIDIA within the ecosystem is still very much governed by the reliance on its software by the AI community.\nNVIDIA doesn't just provide the low-level CUDA libraries and tools upon which nearly every AI framework is based, the company has moved up the stack to provide full-stack AI tools and solutions. Beyond enabling AI developers, NVIDIA continues to invest in enterprise-level tools for managing workloads and models. NVIDIA\u2019s software investment is unmatched in the industry and will keep NVIDIA in the driver\u2019s seat for the foreseeable future. There will be non-NVIDIA solutions for training, but those will continue to be the exception.\nMy biggest takeaway from the MLPerf results isn't the raw performance of NVIDIA's new H100 Tensor Core Accelerators but rather the power and efficiency of running AI training workloads in the cloud. Building a training cluster of any size is an expensive and complex undertaking. NVIDIA doesn't release pricing for its H100 accelerator, but it's estimated to be between $30,000-$40,000/each. CoreWeave will rent one to you for $2.23/hour, delivering training results as well as any on-site installation (in a further plug for CoreWeave, I'll point out that it's not yet possible to get time on an H100 from any of the top public cloud providers; no CSP has an H100-based instance generally available today).\nAI is changing the way we engage with technology. It's changing how businesses operate and how we understand the data surrounding us. NVIDIA sits at the center of this revolution, rapidly expanding its presence into nearly every element of the data center. NVIDIA isn't the gaming graphics company we grew up with. It's instead quickly becoming a key enabler for our collective future. Keep watching, but they're just getting started.\nDisclosure: Steve McDowell is an industry analyst, and NAND Research an industry analyst firm, that engages in, or has engaged in, research, analysis, and advisory services with many technology companies, which may include those mentioned in this article.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nChinese tech giants ByteDance (TikTok), Tencent, Baidu and Alibaba simply can't get enough of Nvidia's High Performance Computing (HPC) products. This news comes from Chinese media, which reports that TikTok creator, ByteDance, alone, has already caught up (in pure dollar terms) to what the entire Chinese market ordered from Nvidia in 2022.\u00a0Chinese publication Jitwei revealed that ByteDance has already ordered around $1 billion worth of Nvidia GPUs in 2023 so far, which amounts to around 100,000 units split between Nvidia's A100 (ordered before the US government told Nvidia to stop selling its top-performing HPC cards to China, back in August 2022) and H800 cards - that last series number corresponding to a Hopper-based custom accelerator Nvidia built to comply with export restrictions \u2014 a nerfed cameo of the H100 accelerator. Nerfed or not, Nvidia's Average Sale Price (ASP) seems to sit at around $10,000 per accelerator.Nvidia made some noise back when the export restrictions were first placed, saying it would lose roughly $400 million \u2014 and that such a loss could impair its H100 chip development. We'll never know whether the H100 accelerator's development would or wouldn't have actually been completed, though, since the U.S. government moved the export ban to September, allowing NVIDIA to cram in some of the extra shipments (and revenue) necessary for the H100.The perspective is staggering, really, considering the remaining Chinese tech giants who have also heavily increased their investment into HPC hardware. If ByteDance alone has already eclipsed Nvidia's sales in China for an entire year, what can be said for the Chinese market? According to Chinese industry sources, the country's tech giants' volume and product demands are too much for China's own distributor chain to handle; which explains why at least ByteDance and Alibaba have been reported as directly negotiating product with Nvidia (as if the H800's existence allowed any doubt on that).The increased investments are obvious, as is part of its motivation: from its perspective, China can't afford to let the West race ahead with complete dominance in the field of AI. China's interest is buoyed not only by the promise of the $4.4 trillion dollars that AI can bring to the world's economy (that's according to McKinsey, by the way). Remember that there are also political and sociological choices here, in that China's state control apparatus (like the West's) needs a stream of high-tech solutions constantly feeding into it. We may be forgetting about them in the chaotic soup of Generative AI and Large Language Models we see ourselves in, but AI also powers things such as CCTV analytics and facial recognition tech (just as offered through Nvidia's FaceDetect technology, by the way).This particular bit is also interesting: since Nvidia's H800 cards only started production on March this year, there can't have been a huge proportion of them delivered by Nvidia yet \u2014 it's expected deliveries of the H800 will actually last throughout the year. It's unclear if the $1 billion figure being reported refers to already-delivered or ordered-only shipments.

Apart from a probable RTX 4050 and potential RTX 4090 Ti, this GeForce RTX 4060 is shaping up to be one of the final RTX 40-series offerings. It's a major release\u2014as the de facto mass-market Ada Lovelace GPU\u2014and an important piece of the larger PC gaming puzzle. Should the RTX 4060 be a good performer it has the potential to drive a wave of upgrades, or conversely, deter them if it is weak.At $299 / \u00a3289 / AU$545, on paper the RTX 4060 looks like a good value offering and it will sell well. But how well? After the chilly reception the more expensive RTX 4060 Ti received at $399 / \u00a3389 / AU$699, the question is whether the RTX 4060 is good enough to appeal to gamers waiting for a worthwhile and affordable Nvidia upgrade.Nvidia is positioning the RTX 4060 as a capable 1080p card with excellent power efficiency, and support for Nvidia's key technologies, including DLSS 3 with Frame Generation. In fact, it's really pushing DLSS 3 as the killer feature of the RTX 4060.\u00a0\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5070 Founders Edition review\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5070 Ti review (MSI Ventus 3X)\n\n\n\nAMD's Radeon RX 7600 and Intel's Arc A750 are the RTX 4060's logical competitors, but they've not without their flaws. Last generation cards remain perfectly viable too. GPUs such as the AMD RX 6700 XT and Nvidia's own RTX 3060 Ti are still capable gaming cards, and they're available at prices that justifiably keep them in the conversation.As there is no RTX 4060 Founders Edition, I have MSI's RTX 4060 Ventus Black 2X OC on hand for review. It's priced at $299, the same as other base tier RTX 4060 cards. Let's see how it stacks up.Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 quick verdict(Image credit: Future)The MSI Ventus Black 2X Is a compact dual fan card with a particularly impressive 115W TDP. That kind of power puts little pressure on modern coolers and it means there's simply no need to spend lots of money on more expensive triple fan coolers that deliver little, if any benefit.The RTX 4060's compact size, very low idle and load power consumption, AI features, and 8th Gen NVENC with AV1 support will surely appeal to users looking for a video card as much as a graphics card. DisplayPort 2.1 support is missing, though in reality, that's an unticked checkbox on this class of card where 4K and 8K performance is really beyond it.Buy if...\u2705 You're upgrading from a card that's a few years old: If you've got an older card or one with low VRAM that struggles to hold playable frame rates in modern and demanding titles, the RTX 4060 will certainly bring an improvement.\n\n\u2705 You're building a compact gaming rig: RTX 4060s with dual fans are compact and don't use much power. It's well suited for a small form factor build or a living room PC that doesn't have lots of airflow.Don't buy if...\u274c You already own a mid range RX 6000 or RTX-30 series GPU. The RTX 4060 doesn't set the world alight with its relative performance. Last gen mid tier cards are still highly capable and the RTX 4060's 8GB frame buffer is likely to become a bottleneck in the years ahead.Perhaps the biggest question, controversy, or triviality depending on how you look at it, is the inclusion of 8GB of VRAM. As is the case with the RTX 4060 Ti 8GB or the RX 7600 8GB, there's no doubt that 8GB will eventually become a bottleneck, as it is increasingly becoming for the RTX 2060 6GB and even more so for 4GB cards. Given its predecessor, the RTX 3060, came with 12GB and a 192-bit bus, the RTX 4060 certainly feels like a step backwards.If you game at 1080p, you'll be fine for now, but will that be the case if millions of gamers download Grand Theft Auto 6 and find they cannot enjoy it at its fullest? Future proofing is a dirty phrase in the world of tech, but 12GB of VRAM would definitely have been welcome.For now, the RTX 4060 is a reasonable performer. Not everyone plays the latest games with every ray tracing detail turned up to the max. If you're one of the millions of gamers playing the likes or WoW, Fortnite or MOBA games and esport titles, the RTX 4060 will be a fantastic upgrade, but only if you're upgrading from a card that's a few years old.For anyone with a mid range RTX 30-series or Radeon RX 6000-series card or higher, the gains simply aren't worth it. Unless you factor in DLSS 3 and Frame Generation, that is; they really do add value and free performance. If you're faced with a purchase choice of an RTX 4060, 3060, or RX 6600 XT, the newer RTX 4060 is the way to go. Unless you need extra VRAM.\u00a0Oh, VRAM. That's a topic of discussion that won't be going away anytime soon.Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 specs(Image credit: Future)What's inside the RTX 4060?The RTX 4060 is built around the AD107 GPU. It's made with a custom TSMC 4N process, which has been tweaked for Nvidia GPUs. As an Ada Lovelace generation GPU, the RTX 4060 supports 3rd generation RT cores with shader execution reordering support, 4th generation Tensor cores, the 8th gen NVENC encoder with support for AV1, and of course, DLSS 3 with Frame Generation capabilities.\u00a0Swipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 RTX 4060RTX 3060 12GBGPUAD107GA106ArchitectureAda LovelaceAmpereLithographyTSMC 4NSamung 8NCUDA cores30723584Streaming Multiprocessors2428RT Cores2428Tensor Cores96112ROPs4848L2 cache24 MB3 MBBoost clock2,460 MHz1,777 MHzMemory8GB GDDR612GB GDDR6Memory interface128-bit192-bitMemory bandwidth272 GB/s360 GB/sDie size187.8mm\u00b2276mm\u00b2Transistors22.9B12BTGP115W170WPrice$299$329The architecture shares the same building blocks of the much more powerful RTX 4090. It's well worth having a read of our RTX 4090 Founders Edition review for more information on what was changed between the Ampere and Ada Lovelace generations. All of the aforementioned core and shader hardware has been upgraded. Add to that higher clock speeds and power efficiency improvements and in most cases, RTX 40-series cards are significantly faster than their relative predecessors.The AD107 GPU of the RTX 4060 comes with 24 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) giving it 3072 CUDA cores, 24 RT cores and 96 Tensor cores. These counts are actually lower than those of the RTX 3060 12GB, though both share the same number of ROPs, at 48.(Image credit: Nvidia)The biggest disappointment is the inclusion of just 8GB of VRAM. It's the same criticism we've leveled at the RTX 4060 Ti 8GB and RX 7600. After all, the RTX 3060 had 12GB over a 192-bit bus, giving it both a capacity and bandwidth advantage. Nvidia says that the inclusion of 24MB of L2 cache (compared the 3MB of the RTX 3060) significantly reduces VRAM calls and reliance on a large memory buffer. I have no reason to doubt that, but more L2 cache and architectural tweaks can only do so much if we're talking about large texture files greater than 24MB in scale.\u00a0As system requirements seemingly increase to infinity, and major games like Starfield, Grand Theft Auto 6 are released, 8GB is shaping up to be adequate at best in the mid-term. Future games may not be too 8GB friendly without some quality compromises. It's about time we had non-binary GDDR memory. 12GB over a 128-bit bus would be a step in the right direction.(Image credit: Future)The card connects to the system via a PCIe 4.0 x8 interface. Again that's a step back from the full x16 connection offered by the RTX 3060 12GB. Essentially, the RTX 4060 could easily have ended up as the RTX 4050, while the RTX 4060 Ti should be the real 4060.Arguably the most impressive feature of the RTX 4060 is its power consumption. At just 115W with an average gaming power of 110W (and a 7W idle figure), the RTX 4060 is an amazingly efficient graphics card. The performance per watt of the Ada Lovelace architecture shines through yet again. In the case of the MSI RTX 4060 Ventus 2X, there's a single 8-pin power connector. That's a smart choice as the 12VHPWR connector common to most RTX 40-series cards is complete overkill and most potential RTX 4060 buyers are going to have more modest power supplies without 12HPWR connectors anyway.I can't recommend spending more on a premium tier RTX 4060 for any reason other than aesthetics. The MSI Ventus Black 2X deserves a few words too. It's a solidly built card with dual fans, a full length backplate and a discrete all-black design. It features a mild factory overclock of 30MHz over the base RTX 4060 specification. MSI offers its Gaming range too should you wish for a higher factory OC and a bit more of a premium finish with RGB lighting. However, given the characteristics of the AD107 GPU, I can't recommend spending more on a premium tier RTX 4060 for any reason other than a preference for aesthetics.\u00a0Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 performance(Image credit: Future)How does the RTX 4060 perform?At $299, the RTX 4060 shouldn't be expected to drive a 144Hz 4K monitor but it absolutely should be able to play all games at 1080p with good frame rates at high settings.\u00a0Some games like Cyberpunk 2077 with full ray tracing are challenging for much more expensive cards even at 1080p, but with the wizardry of DLSS 3 and Frame Generation, even the relatively humble RTX 4060 can put on a good show.I ran the card through a set of 1440p benchmarks too. Though high FPS at 1440p is more in RTX 4070 territory, the RTX 4060 should be able to perform at 1440p too, and it will do with ease in games that aren't so demanding, a bit older, or at least well optimized!1080p gaming performanceImage 1 of 7The RTX 4060 is most comfortable at 1080p, as is to be expected. In the games I tested, with the exception of the ultra punishing Cyberpunk 2077, the RTX 4060 is capable of the all-important 60 fps or higher. That's its purpose really.It comfortably pulls ahead of the RTX 3060 12GB (notably an overclocked MSI Gaming X model) particularly in heavily ray traced titles.Things get more interesting when comparing the RTX 4060 to the RX 7600. In ray traced games, the RTX 4060 pulls ahead quite comfortably, but in traditional raster rendered titles, the RX 7600 draws right alongside the RTX 4060.And interestingly, if the $299 price of the RTX 4060 feels a little steep, don't write off the Intel Arc A750. After a few months of driver improvements, It's capable of a surprise or two at 1080p.\u00a01440p gaming performanceImage 1 of 7PCG test rigCPU: Intel Core i9 12900K\nMotherboard: Asus ROG Z690 Maximus Hero\nCooler: Corsair H100i RGB\nRAM: 32GB G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB DDR5-5600\nStorage: 1TB WD Black SN850, 4TB Sabrent Rocket 4Q\nPSU: Seasonic Prime TX 1600W\nOS: Windows 11 22H2\nChassis: DimasTech Mini V2\nMonitor: Dough Spectrum ES07D03At 1440p, the RTX 4060 begins to run into limitations. It's still possible to get 60 fps in most titles, but doing that can require a dialing back of some quality settings.The RTX 3060 Ti retains a notable lead over the RTX 4060 here. When viewed in that context, the RTX 4060 is on the disappointing side. We'd usually expect a card from a new generation to match a card a tier up from the previous generation, in this case, that would be the RTX 3070, but since even the 3060 Ti is out of reach, the 3070 remains completely unchallenged.Against the RX 7600, the results are much the same as those at 1080p. The RTX 4060 is stronger at ray tracing, while the RX 7600 draws nearly level in games without it.DLSS performanceImage 1 of 3Nvidia is very keen to promote DLSS 3 as RTX 4060's major selling point, and it's easy to understand why. Who doesn't love free performance? There are those who argue that DLSS can add input latency, but any latency penalty gets offset by the higher frame rate. In short, if you want a higher frame rate, enable DLSS if you can.For this section I chose three different games. The first and obvious choice is Cyberpunk 2077. It can bring even the mighty RTX 4090 to its knees. It's joined by F1 22 which also features DLSS 3 support. Finally there's Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition. It's still punishing, but limited to DLSS 2 support without Frame Generation.Starting with Cyberpunk 2077, and wow! Enabling DLSS 3's quality mode effectively doubles the frame rate, while adding Frame Generation to the mix adds another 50% on top of that. 3x the performance? That's pretty crazy. To my eyes I couldn't tell much of a difference between the different modes, though perhaps the image looked a little less sharp. Not that I care much if I'm trying to nail a headshot.F1 22 performed much the same, with huge frame rate boosts after enabling DLSS 3 and Frame Generation. Moving from around 40 fps to over 60 fps allows you to hit that all important 60 fps threshold and allows you to enjoy smoother gameplay with an adaptive sync screen.I'm a fan of DLSS and Frame Generation. A powerful card like an RTX 4090 delivers huge frame rates already making it less useful in general, but with a less powerful GPU like the RTX 4060, its value really comes to the fore. Be sure to have a play with it if you pull the trigger on an RTX 4060.System performanceImage 1 of 7(Image credit: Future)The synthetic benchmarks didn't throw up any surprises. But the power and temperature results are stellar. The performance per watt of the RTX 4060 is excellent, as it is for the Ada Lovelace generation in general.A shout out here to MSI too. The Ventus Black 2X cooler hits a very good sweet spot for temperatures, clock speeds and noise levels. I've seen sub 150W cards run cooler, but that doesn't matter if it doesn't result in higher boost clocks. There's no point in having higher fan speeds and noise levels for no gain. 70\u00b0C is bang on where I'm happy with the RTX 4060. It never gets too hot, noise levels remain low, and the card is able to maintain high boost clocks.Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 analysis(Image credit: Future)How does the RTX 4060 stack up?So, there we have it. Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4060 has arrived. There are a few ways of looking at it\u2014both positive and negative.First, the good. The RTX 4060 is a very power efficient GPU. It's well suited to gamers with smaller cases or cases with poor airflow as it doesn't dump a lot of heat. MSI's Ventus Black 2X hits a good balance of cooling performance and low noise levels while maximizing the GPU's boost clocks.The card easily outperforms the RTX 3060 12GB, and it does so at a cheaper launch price. The RTX 4060 is launching at $299, while the RTX 3060 12GB cost $329. On paper at least. During the mining craze there were times the RTX 3060 was selling for a heck of a lot more than that.The card's low non-gaming power consumption combined with the 8th generation NVENC video engine mean it's a highly capable video card too. Its AV1 support means it's well suited for use with Nvidia's Broadcast software, OBS, YouTube or Discord streaming, even at 4K60. The card's CUDA or Tensor cores are supported by the likes of Adobe Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve.Then there's the effect of DLSS 3 and Frame Generation. Together they deliver incredible frame rate boosts in games that would otherwise struggle to hit a smooth 60 fps. Being able to double, if not triple frame rates with DLSS means the card is able to punch well above its weight class, allowing games to run at 1440p that would otherwise suffer from stuttering and poor 1% lows. DLSS 3 is simply awesome on a low to midrange GPU like the RTX 4060.(Image credit: Future)Of course, it's not all roses and chocolates. The base performance of the RTX 4060 with all the DLSS magic is rather underwhelming. It can't match the RTX 3060 Ti and that's particularly disappointing. The AD107 GPU's more appropriate comparison should be the GA107. That's the GPU powering the RTX 3050.If we were comparing the RTX 4060 8GB to the RTX 3050 8GB which launched at $249, then the RTX 4060 would be viewed in a much different light. As it is, Nvidia is taking what should be the RTX 4050 and calling it the RTX 4060. Is it for profit? Is it because it thinks DLSS is enough to position an entry level GPU one tier higher? I believe it to be both reasons.DLSS 3 is simply awesome on a low to midrange GPU like the RTX 4060.A 128-bit bus and 8GB of memory across a PCIe 4.0 x8 interface are entry level specs. With a die size of under 190mm\u00b2 I'm sure Nvidia is making a lot of profit on each card sold, and would do even if the card was cheaper at $249.So the RTX 4060 isn't a card that will drive a wave of upgrades. Those with RTX 30-series GPUs or RX 6000-series cards probably won't be compelled to upgrade unless\u00a0they play a DLSS 3 supporting game or two to really justify it.But the RTX 4060 will still sell well. If you're sitting on a 4GB or 6GB card that's on its last legs, the RTX 4060 will deliver a major upgrade in performance, even before enabling DLSS, while offering awesome performance per watt and cool running.(Image credit: Future)It feels like a good card fundamentally, but there's no getting away from the fact it really should be priced and named as the RTX 4050. But In the end, it is called the the RTX 4060 and at $299 it feels too overpriced to recommend to absolutely everyone. The AD107 GPU just isn't fast enough to match the likes of the RTX 3060 Ti, and it really should be beating that card in baseline performance. DLSS is wonderful, but it still requires developer support and until it's universally supported, it has to be considered a value add.Nvidia, please drop the price to $249 or less, and we'll talk.Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060: Price Comparison1 Amazon customer review\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 \u00a3259.99View \u00a3272.48View \u00a3279.99View \u00a3389.98 \u00a3293.99View \u00a3294ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by \n\n\n\nThe Verdict\n\n\n\n\n\n\n77\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead our review policy \n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4060\n\nThe RTX 4060 is fundamentally a good video card. Its stellar performance per watt, DLSS and frame generation support, and RTX 3060-beating performance are definite positives. It would be considered VERY good if it was a bit cheaper and called the RTX 4050. But the die is cast, it's the RTX 4060 by name, and it doesn't do enough to excite us at $299.\n\n\n\n\nChris SzewczykSocial Links NavigationHardware WriterChris' gaming experiences go back to the mid-nineties when he conned his parents into buying an 'educational PC' that was conveniently overpowered to play Doom and Tie Fighter.

That\u2019s especially true for graphics cards, where the next upgrade might be a tepid update or a literal game-changer. According to a recent presentation, Nvidia may be aiming for a 2025 release window for the next major upgrade to its GPUs, the RTX 50 series. \nThe info comes from a presentation given to the MLCommons (machine learning) consortium, of which Nvidia is a founding member. The slide spotted by German site HardwareLuxx (via VideoCardz) places the \u201cAda Lovelace-Next\u201d GPU architecture squarely, if imprecisely, in the first half of 2025. That would put an RTX 5090 release (or whatever the initial flagship is called) at a little less than three years after the Ada Lovelace-based RTX 4090. \n\n\nThat\u2019s a bit longer than Nvidia fans are used to, but given the general slowdown in new GPU designs, not entirely surprising. An initial release early in 2025 would also mean we\u2019re more likely to see more mainstream cards, presumably an RTX 5070, before the end of the calendar year. And, while this information comes directly from an Nvidia presentation, we should stress that corporate timelines like this are always subject to change. The best-laid plans of mice and international chip megacorps, you know. \nBeyond the date, all we can do is speculate, so trying to nail down anything like performance or price for eventual retail products is nigh on pointless. The same slide indicates an early 2024 refresh for the Hopper datacenter GPU and 2025 for the Grace ARM-based CPU architecture (the next-gen version of the Tegra chips that are found in the Nvidia SHIELD set-top box and Nintendo Switch), neither of which is particularly relevant for PC hardware. \n\n\n\n\nFor the sake of comparison, rumors place Intel\u2019s second-gen \u201cBattlemage\u201d cards at a mid-2024 release, and AMD\u2019s RDNA 4-based cards (RX 8000 series, presumably) aren\u2019t expected before 2025. Of course, new mid-tier and low-end cards in both series might pop up before then. \n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Michael Crider, Staff Writer, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael is a 10-year veteran of technology journalism, covering everything from Apple to ZTE.

As it turns out Nvidia's H100, a card that costs over $30,000 performs worse than integrated GPUs in such benchmarks as 3DMark and\u00a0Red Dead Redemption 2, as discovered by\u00a0Geekerwan.Nvidia's H100 card is based on the company's GH100 processor with 14,592 CUDA cores that support a variety of data formats used for AI and HPC workloads, including\u00a0FP64, TF32, FP32, FP16, INT8, and FP8. By contrast, Nvidia's consumer GPUs, such as Nvidia's AD102, only properly support FP32. Meanwhile, GH100 only has 24 raster operating (ROPs) units and does not have display engines or display outputs. Furthermore, Nvidia does not optimize Hopper drivers for gaming applications.\u00a0But apparently it is still possible to make Nvidia's H100 render graphics and even support ray tracing. Only it renders graphics rather slowly. One H100 board scores 2681 points in 3DMark Time Spy, which is even slower than performance of AMD's integrated Radeon 680M, which scores 2710.But running games on a card that costs over $30,000 does not make a lot of sense and Nvidia certainly did not design GH100 for rendering graphics. While Nvidia's GH100 has some graphics specific hardware inside, it is not made to offer any substantial performance in games, which is why it is slower than AMD's integrated Radeon 680M.Although Nvidia's flagship compute GPU is not meant for graphics, it outperforms everything in datacenter AI and HPC applications and this is exactly what it is made for.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nQualcomm\nCUDA\nBenchmark\nray tracing\nRadeon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (5)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

For display he had to use the GTX 1650 Ti graphics card as a secondary display card, since the H100 lacks display outputs. \n\nIf you watch the video carefully, it looks like using two H100s offered a 43% boost in content creation apps, but, 3-way and 4-way results showed diminishing returns and negative scaling. Looks like standard PCs just can't take advantage of multiple H100 GPUs.\n\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit_user\n\n\nMetal Messiah. said:H100 is actually structured so that only 2 of its TPCs/(Texture Processing Clusters are available for the standard graphics processing tasks, while the entire GPU block is primarily dedicated to compute tasks so that can lead to adverse results in gaming.Similar to the A100, from what I'd heard.

OMG, Legos!\n(lower left)\nYes, NVidia only enabled two TPCs in both the SXM5 and PCIe H100 GPUs which are graphics-capable, so that they can run vertex, geometry, and pixel shaders, which means 2 TPCs (4 SMs) out of 57 TPCs (114 SMs).\n\nBut by tradition, Nvidia still calls the H100 a graphics processing unit, but the term is clearly on its last legs: because just two out of the 50+ texture processing clusters (TPCs) in the device are actually cable of running vertex, geometry, and pixel shader maths required to render 3D graphics.\n\nHey, is that a real LEGO ? :smiley:\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 5 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm debuts new Snapdragon G handheld gaming PC chips to compete with Intel and AMD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina to spend $55 billion on R&D in 2025 \u2014 Semiconductor, AI and quantum computing fields to benefit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBambu Lab Announces New Printer: H2D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotherboard dies after marathon 100-hour BIOS update process, vigil attended by thousands online\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD boasts its Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is up to 12.2x faster than Lunar Lake in AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreeware image editor GIMP 3.0 arrives after seven years of incubation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle's Gemini 2.0 Flash is reportedly capable of removing watermarks \u2014 Also found to generate AI celebrity photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi and ChatGPT bring AI conversations to your retro rotary phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI Afterburner update enables RTX 50 series owners to push their GDDR7 VRAM up to 36 GT/s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD manager reports 45% GPU retail market share in Japan \u2014 Eyes 70% as the next target\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

With two recent acquisitions, Neeva and Streamlit, it will make it easier to search and build applications on top of the data. Today, the company announced a new container service and a partnership with Nvidia to make it easier to build generative AI applications making use of all that data and running them on Nvidia GPUs.\nSnowflake senior VP of products Christian Kleinerman says the goal is to let people make use of the data without having to copy and move it to an external application. \u201cWe want to enable our customers to bring computation to their enterprise data, and not have to be shipping their enterprise data to all sorts of external systems,\u201d Kleinerman told TechCrunch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company is introducing the Snowpark Container Services along with the ability to run containerized applications on top of Nvidia GPUs, all without moving any data outside of Snowflake.\n\u201cWe\u2019re providing the ability for both customers and partners to run Docker containers inside the security perimeter of Snowflake, giving them controlled access to the enterprise data that lives in Snowflake,\u201d Kleinerman said.\n\u201cAnd the way we\u2019re surfacing this container services is by providing broader instance flexibility through what Snowflake has provided traditionally, and obviously the single biggest vector of flexibility that we\u2019ve been getting requests for is access to GPUs,\u201d he said, which is where the Nvidia partnership comes into play.\nNvidia VP of enterprise computing, Manuvir Das says that he sees Snowflake as a place where companies are storing their key data, and when you can build applications on top of that data, and then run those applications on top of Nvidia GPUs, it becomes a very powerful combination, especially when you bring generative AI into the equation.\nHe says that when you combine Nvidia\u2019s GPU power along with its NeMo framework, companies can take the data in Snowflake and begin to build refined machine learning models based on their own unique data.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why this partnership is beautiful, because Snowflake has all that data, and now for the first time has the execution engine to run different pieces of software with that data. We\u2019ve got that execution agent in NeMo that Nvidia has built for training, for fine tuning, for reinforcement learning and all of that,\u201d Das said.\n\u201cAnd so the integration we\u2019re doing together is we\u2019re taking that agent and we\u2019re bringing it to Snowflake\u2019s platform and integrating it in so that all Snowflake customers who have the data now have sort of a first-class capability from the Snowflake platform that they can do their model making on using the data, which produces these custom models for them,\u201d he said.\nHe says that bringing together customer data, the models they created using that data and then the applications that they\u2019re running that are going to access those models all happening in one place will make it easier to keep secure and govern that data, and the Nvidia technology just makes it all run faster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnowflake\u2019s Snowpark Container Services is available in private beta starting today.\n\n\nTopics\n\nAI, containers, Enterprise, Generative AI, nvidia, Snowflake \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRon Miller\t\n\n\n\nEnterprise Reporter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRon Miller was an enterprise reporter at TechCrunch.\nPreviously, he was a long-time Contributing Editor at EContent Magazine.

The move was the company's way of distinguishing its commercial aerospace dealings from its defence-based activities. But Nvidia did get there first.RTX in the world of PC gaming has always been synonymous with Jensen Huang and his brand of ray tracing associated technologies. In other words, the thing that makes your reflections look gorgeous, and your GPU go brrr.The company RTX, on the other hand, deals with the likes of aeroplanes, advanced materials, and, uh, missiles. To put the scale of RTX into perspective, we're talking about a company whose products cater to 90% of all US Department of Defense and commercial space launches, and whose products currently \"protect\" approximately half the world's population.\u00a0\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 50-series and dev kit show that rasterization is old news and we're now firmly in the era of AI rendering\n\n\n\n\nNvidia denounces Biden administration's 'rigged' and 'misguided' new AI chip export restrictions\n\n\n\nNvidia spotting this name change is the equivalent of a kindergartener watching the beefiest kid on the playground rocking up wearing the same Fortnite T-shirt as them. Nightmare.In other words, despite Nvidia having around a $1 trillion market cap against RTX's only slightly more humble $149 billion, the RTX with the literal big guns might just have the upper hand if it ever came to fisticuffs.Right now Nvidia has a trademark for GeForce RTX specifically, though it's interesting to note that its status is currently \"Opposition Pending.\" Meaning the trademark application is under examination by the office and one or more companies are claiming against Nvidia's right to use it, though a verdict is yet to be decided.Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest gaming motherboard: The right boards\nBest graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the restIt's been this way since 2020, however, and we can't confirm if Raytheon has anything to do with it.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.By the looks of things, Nvidia has had dealings with the former Raytheon Technologies before\u2014the company having made use of Nvidia GPUs within the defense industry. Nvidia does use RTX for its enterprise Ada GPUs and and Quadro offerings, too, so Raytheon is well aware of the nomenclature.\u00a0I'd like to think RTX got permission to use the green team's acronym, though knowing big tech companies it's not always the case for them to be so courteous.\u00a0To be fair, trademark issues are less likely to arise in this case since generally, as long as the products in question are in different enough industries, there's no risk of them ever being mistaken for one another. You never know. Someone might one day order what they thought was a GPU and end up with a battleship helm motherboard.There is however a big focus on AI for both companies, with a large segment of both the RTX site talking about machine learning. Pit that against Nvidia's well known AI obsession, and we could see the companies bashing heads somewhere down the line in that regard.\n\n\nKatie WickensSocial Links NavigationHardware WriterScrew sports, Katie would rather watch Intel, AMD and Nvidia go at it.

On June 29th, the GeForce RTX 4060 will go on sale, with prices starting at $299. For gamers playing on previous-gen GPUs, the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture at the heart of the GeForce RTX 4060 delivers a massive upgrade, multiplying your performance, and supercharging creative apps. And thanks to the Ada architecture\u2019s industry-leading efficiency, you\u2019ll use measurably less power, your graphics card will run cooler, and fans will run at quieter speeds or even idle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cUnleash the GeForce RTX 4060 in Dying Light 2 Stay Human and high frame rates at max settings is no sweat\" - Tomasz Sza\u0142kowski, Techland. See the performance and efficiency of the new GeForce RTX 4060 in these clips from Dying Light 2 Stay Human, Returnal, and Warhammer 40,000: Darktide. \nBased on the May 2023 Steam Hardware Survey, 9 of the top 10 most used GPUs on Steam are 60 Class or lower, and 77% of Steam gamers play at 1080p or lower resolutions. For these gamers, the new GeForce RTX 4060 is a great upgrade, enabling them to play new, more demanding games at 1080p at excellent levels of fidelity. For gamers coming from a GeForce RTX 2060, performance is multiplied by an average of 2.3X across a suite of 18 games, and for GeForce GTX 1060 users, in addition to higher frame rates, they also get ray tracing and DLSS acceleration for the first time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese substantial improvements enable you to enjoy the majority of games at high frames with max settings including ray tracing. And thanks to NVIDIA DLSS 3, you can experience some of the industry\u2019s most advanced games running at over 100 FPS, at the highest possible detail levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough a process detailed in full in our NVIDIA DLSS 3 article, DLSS 3 combines DLSS Super Resolution technology, DLSS Frame Generation and NVIDIA Reflex to multiply performance while maintaining great responsiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers have adopted DLSS 3 seven times faster than DLSS 2, meaning more games boast support each month. DLSS 3 is available or coming to over 50 games and apps, DLSS Super Resolution is supported in over 310 games and apps, and over 400 games and apps feature support for RTX technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile outpacing previous-generation GPUs by a considerable margin, the GeForce RTX 4060 reduces power consumption across the board, whether you\u2019re gaming, watching videos, or hanging with friends on Discord.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt recent energy prices, the average gamer playing 10-20 hours a week could save a significant amount, while having a vastly superior gaming experience. In Germany, for example, a gamer playing 20 hours a week could save up to $132 in energy costs over the course of 4 years, when upgrading from an RTX 3060 to an RTX 4060.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources: Euronews (Germany, UK), energysage (US)\nAll GeForce RTX GPU owners can also tap into an ecosystem of apps and technologies to further enhance gaming, work and creativity. Get the fastest ray tracing performance with GeForce RTX 40 Series and its dedicated 3rd gen Ray Tracing Cores. Make gameplay in over 70 titles more responsive with Reflex.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Founder and Principal Analyst,\nCambrian-AI Research LLCFollow AuthorJun 13, 2023, 07:13pm EDTShareSaveCommentAMD disclosed a few more details on the MI300 GPU, due later this year, with support for 192GB of memory on the MI300X. Here\u2019s what we know.\n\nIn today\u2019s world of ChatGPT, everyone keeps asking if the NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs are the only platforms that can deliver the computational and large memory requirements of Large Language Models (LLMs). And the answer is yes, at least for now. But AMD intends to change that later this year with a new GPU, the MI300x. CEO Lisa Su was visibly excited to announce a few more details on her company\u2019s upcoming data center GPU at a data center event today.\n\n\nWhat Is The AMD MI300X?\nDr. Su announced a version of the CPU/GPU APU MI300, teased at CES earlier this year, that replaces 3 EPYC compute dies with two more GPU dies, adding more compute and HBM memory capacity. The MI300X will be the flagship AMD offering for large AI, so this is a very big deal for the company and its investors.\nThe AMD MI300 will have 192GB of HBM memory for large AI Models, 50% more than the NVIDIA H100.The Author\n\nIt will be available in single accelerators as well as on an 8-GPU OCP-compliant board, called the Instinct Platform, similar to the NVIDIA HGX. However it will use the Infinity Fabric to connect the GPUs, and will run the ROCm AI software stack.\nThe Instinct Platform is a reference design of 8 MI300X GPUs. The Author\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nWhen Compared To The NVIDIA H100, The MI300X Has Some Issues.\nLet\u2019s do a sanity check on AMD\u201ds ambitions. First, I must say that the MI300 is an amazing chip, a tour de force of applying chiplet technology. I see why Dr. Su says she loves it! But it will face a few challenges when compared to the NVIDIA H100.\n\nFirst and foremost, the NVIDIA H100 is shipping in full volume today. In fact, NVIDIA can sell all that TSMC can make and then some. And NVIDIA has, by far, the largest ecosystem of software and researchers in the AI industry.\n\n\nSecondly, while the new high-density HBM chiplets offer 192GB of very much needed memory, I suspect that NVIDIA will offer the same memory, probably in the same time frame or perhaps even earlier. So that will not be an advantage. We point out that this new higher-density version of HBM3 will be pricey; here\u2019s an analysis by Dylan Patel of Semianalysis that indicates AMD will not have a significant cost advantage versus an NVIDIA H100.\nThird, and this is the real kicker, the MI300 does not have a transformer engine like the H100, which can triple performance for the popular LLM AI models. If it takes thousands of GPUs a year to train a new model, I doubt that anyone will say its ok to wait 2-3 more years to get their model to market, or throw 3 times as many GPUs at the problem.\nFinally, AMD has yet to disclose any benchmarks. And that\u2019s ok; it has not yet been launched! But performance when training and running LLMs depends as much on the system design as the GPU, so we look forward to being able to see some real apple to apple comparisons later this year.\nIs the MI300X Dead-on-Arrival?\nCertainly not! It will probably become the preferred second choice to NVIDIA Hopper, at least until Hopper\u2019s replacement (the 3 nm Blackwell) is available. NVIDIA has implied Blackwell will launch next Spring at GTC, and probably will ship late 2024 or early 2025.\nBut companies like OpenAI and Microsoft need to have an alternative to NVIDIA, and we suspect that AMD will give them an offer they can\u2019t refuse. But don\u2019t expect it to take a lot of share from NVIDIA.\nConclusions\nAMD is justified in its excitement about having a competitive GPU to compete in the skyrocketing AI market. And the MI300X looks to be a solid contender. But let\u2019s not get carried away!\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Disclosures: This article expresses the opinions of the author(s), and is not to be taken as advice to purchase from nor invest in the companies mentioned.

As in past years, Nvidia scored top marks across the board in the MLPerf tests.\u00a0  With competitors Google, Graphcore and Advanced Micro Devices not submitting entries this time around, Nvidia's dominance across all eight tests was complete.\u00a0  Also: AI will change software development in massive waysHowever, Intel's Habana business brought meaningful competition with its Guadi2 chip, and the company pledges to beat Nvidia's top-of-the-line H100 GPU by this fall.\u00a0  The benchmark test, Training version 3.0, reports how many minutes it takes to tune the neural \"weights\", or parameters, until the computer program achieves a required minimum accuracy on a given task, a process referred to as \"training\" a neural network.\u00a0The main Training 3.0 test, which totals eight separate tasks, records the time to tune a neural network by having its settings refined in multiple experiments. It is one half of neural network performance, the other half being so-called inference, where the finished neural network makes predictions as it receives new data. Inference is covered in separate releases from MLCommons.\u00a0Along with training on server computers, MLCommons Tuesday released a companion benchmark test, MLPerf Tiny version 1.1, which measures performance when making predictions on very-low-powered devices.Also: Nvidia, Dell, and Qualcomm speed up AI results in latest benchmark testsNvidia took the top spot in all eight tests, with the lowest time to train. Two new tasks were added. One is testing the GPT-3 large language model (LLM) made by OpenAI. Generative AI using LLMS has become a craze due to the popularity of OpenAI's ChatGPT program, which is built upon the same LLM. In the GPT-3 task, Nvidia took the top spot with a system it assembled with the help of partner CoreWeave, which rents cloud-based instances of Nvidia GPUs.\u00a0  The Nvidia-CoreWeave system took just under eleven minutes to train using a data set called the Colossal Cleaned Common Crawl. That system made use of 896 Intel Xeon processors and 3,584 Nvidia H100 GPUs. The system carried out the tasks using Nvidia's NeMO framework for generative AI.\u00a0  The training happens on a portion of the full GPT-3 training, using the \"large\" version of GPT-3, with 175 billon parameters. MLCommons restricts the test to 0.4% of the full GPT-3 training in order to keep the runtime reasonable for submitters.\u00a0  Also new this time around was an expanded version of the recommender engines that are popular for things such as product search and social media recommendations. MLCommons replaced the training data set that had been used, which was a one-terabyte data set, with a four-terabyte data set called the Criteo 4TB multi-hot. MLCommons decided to make the upgrade because the smaller data set was becoming obsolete.\u00a0\"Production recommendation models are increasing in scale -- in size, compute, and memory operations,\" noted the organization.      Intel HabanaThe only vendor of AI chips to compete against Nvidia was Intel's Habana, which submitted five entries with its Gaudi2 accelerator chip, plus one entry submitted by computer maker SuperMicro using Habana's chip. Those systems collectively submitted in four of the eight tasks. In every case, the Habana systems came in far below the top Nvidia systems. For example, in the test to train Google's BERT neural network on Wikipedia data to answer questions, Habana came in fifth place, taking two minutes to complete the training versus eight seconds for a 3,072-GPU Nvidia-CoreWeave machine.\u00a0  However, Intel's Jordan Plawner, head of AI products, noted in an interview with ZDNET that for comparable systems, the difference in time between Habana and Nvidia is close enough it may be negligible to many companies.\u00a0  For example, on the BERT Wikipedia test, an 8-part Habana system, with two companion Intel Xeon processors, came in at just over 14 minutes to train. That result was better than two dozen other submissions, many with double the number of Nvidia A100 GPUs. \u00a0 Also:\u00a0To measure ultra-low power AI, MLPerf gets a TinyML benchmark\"We invite everyone to look at the 8-device machines,\" said Plawner. \"We have a considerable price advantage with Gaudi2, where we are priced similar to a similarly spec'd A100, giving you more training per dollar.\"\u00a0  Plawner noted that not only is the Gaudi2 able to beat some similar configurations of Nvidia A100, but the Gaudi2 runs with a slight handicap. Nvidia submitted their MLPerf entries using a data format to train called \"FP-8,\" for floating point, 8-bit, whereas Habana used an alternate approach called BF-16, for B-float, 16-bit. The higher arithmetic precision of the BF-16 hampers the training somewhat in terms of time to complete.\u00a0  Later this year, said Plawner, Gaudi2 will be using FP-8, which he said will allow for greater performance. It will even allow Habana to beat Nvidia's newer H100 system on performance, he predicted.\u00a0  \"The industry needs an alternative\" to Nvidia, said Plawner. Customers, while traditionally reluctant to switch from the trusted brand, are now being pushed by a sudden tightness in the supply of Nvidia's parts. CEO Jensen Huang said last month that Nvidia is having a hard time filling demand for H100 GPUs.  \"Now they're motivated,\" Plawner told ZDNET of customers frustrated by lack of Nvidia supply.  \"This is what we are hearing from them, that they have things they want to do tomorrow, that the CEO is mandating, and they cannot do it because they cannot get GPUs, period.\"\u00a0  \"Trust me, they're making far more than they're spending [on generative AI]. If they can put 50 people on a Gaudi project to literally get the same time to train, if the answer is, I have no GPUs, and I'm waiting, or, I have Guadi2, and I can launch my new service tomorrow, they will go buy Gaudi2s to launch their new service.\" \u00a0  Intel is the world's second-largest factory for chips, or, \"fab\", after Taiwan Semiconductor, noted Plawner, which gives the company an ability to control its own supply.\u00a0  Also: These mushroom-based chips could power your devicesAlthough Nvidia builds multi-thousand-GPU systems to take the top score, Habana is capable of the same, said Plawner. \"Intel is building a multi-thousand Guadi2 cluster internally,\" he said, with the implicit suggestion that such a machine could be an entry in a future MLPerf round.  Tuesday's results are the second quarter in a row for the training test in which not a single alternative chip maker showed a top score against Nvidia.\u00a0  A year ago, Google split the top score with Nvidia thanks to its TPU chip. But Google didn't show up in November of last year, and was again absent this time. And startup Graphcore has also dropped out of the running, focusing on its business rather than showing off test results.  In a phone conversation, MLCommons director David Kanter, asked by ZDNET about the no-show by competitors, remarked, \"The more parties that participate, the better.\"\u00a0  Google did not reply to an inquiry from ZDNET at press time asking why the company did not participate this time around. Advanced Micro Devices, which competes with Nvidia on GPUs, also did not reply to a request for comment.\u00a0  Also: These are my 5 favorite AI tools for workAMD did, however, have its CPU chips represented in systems that competed. However, in a surprising turn of events, every single winning Nvidia system used Intel Xeon CPUs as the host processor. In the year-earlier results, all eight winning entries, whether from Nvidia or Google, were systems using AMD's EPYC server processors. The switch shows that Intel has managed to recoup some lost ground in server processors with this year's release of Sapphire Rapids.  Despite the absence of Google and Graphcore, the test continues to attract new system makers making submissions. This time around, first-time submitters included CoreWeave, but also IEI and Quanta Cloud Technology.

I cover successful businesspeople and billionaires in Asia.Follow AuthorJun 21, 2023, 06:30am EDTShareSaveAt Cortical Labs, CEO Hon Weng Chong and his team have trained human brain cells on a computer chip to play the classic video game Pong. Chong is now turning the Australian startup\u2019s technology into biological computers that he hopes will not just surpass AI, but supercharge growth of other companies.\n\nHon Weng Chong got a Christmas surprise last year when Amazon\nAMZN\n called and said its chief technology officer wanted to visit Cortical Labs\u2019 base in Melbourne. The CTO of the world\u2019s largest cloud provider, Werner Vogels, was intrigued by the four-year-old startup\u2019s sci-fi innovation: A living human brain cell-powered computer chip, dubbed DishBrain, that has learned to play Atari\u2019s Pong game while apparently using energy equivalent to a pocket calculator.\n\n\u201cWerner told us the biggest cost out of any data center or cloud provider is the energy that they pay for running the equipment and cooling the system,\u201d recalls Chong, cofounder and CEO of Cortical Labs. \u201cAnd we have a system that consumes hardly any energy and outputs very little heat. The unit economics completely flips on its head, especially if you can start training it to do AI tasks.\u201d\n\nTraining lab-grown living brain cells atop a chip to play the tennis-like video game is just the start. By combining the extraordinary learning ability of human brains and the processing power of silicon chips, Chong is building biological computers that he claims could potentially work smarter and more efficiently than today\u2019s AI. The 35-year-old doctor-turned-entrepreneur is commercializing the innovation, hoping that it could one day upend various applications\u2014from testing novel drugs for brain diseases to slashing the enormous energy bill for training AI.\n\n\u201cUltimately, the goal for Cortical Labs is to be like Nvidia, which is to enable the creativity of other users to build on this technology,\u201d Chong says in a video interview from his office in Melbourne. \u201cIn five years, we\u2019d love to have five, 10 successful companies or startups running their own businesses, but built using our technology.\u201d\n\nAmazon CTO Werner Vogels (left) made a visit to Cortical Labs' base in Melbourne in early 2023.Cortical Labs\nIn April, Cortical Labs netted $10 million in a funding round led by Horizons Ventures, the private investment arm of Hong Kong\u2019s richest person Li Ka-shing. Joining the round was existing investor Blackbird Ventures, one of Australia\u2019s largest venture capital funds, as well as In-Q-Tel, the venture capital arm of the Central Intelligence Agency, among others.\nArmed with fresh capital, Cortical Labs aims to start generating revenue by the end of this year when it kicks off sales of its biological computers. The company has already signed up Bit Bio, a spinoff of the University of Cambridge that provides human cells for research, to experiment with its product, says Chong. And by the end of 2024, Cortical Labs will start to provide cloud services, having clusters of 120 biological computers for companies to program brain cells for different tasks, he adds. Chong reveals Cortical Labs is in negotiations with several U.S. cloud providers to plug in its services.\nTo be sure, Chong faces a tall task. Scientists have been trying to fuse living cells with silicons for two decades, hoping they could build an AI system that works like a human brain while advancing applications in medicine and other fields. Back in 2004, a biomedical engineer from the University of Florida said he had trained rat brain cells arranged over a grid of electrodes to control an F-22 jet flight simulator. Yet, no one has so far succeeded in building a biological computer that could even compete with a conventional one.\nCortical Labs has already gone further than most in trying to commercialize biological computers. A rare example is Koniku, a California-based company that combines living cells with computer chips to create sensors mimicking sniffer dogs\u2019 ability to detect explosives and drugs. It has partnered with European aircraft maker Airbus to deploy its devices for aviation security.\nBut not everyone is impressed. Playing Pong is something that a high-school calculator could do decades ago, notes Madeline Lancaster, a researcher at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge who pioneered lab-grown mini human brains. \u201cNeurons (the information messengers inside human brains) in a dish seem to be stuck, without major improvements in their computing power in 20 years,\u201d she says in a written response. \u201cHow exactly Cortical Labs plans to get past that barrier, and enable the same kind of exponential increase that was needed for computers, is unclear, so it is hard for me to see real feasibility yet.\u201d\nApart from technical hurdles, Cortical Labs is also facing ethical questions\u2014whether the lab-grown brain cells will become conscious, if they can feel pain and pleasure, and so on and so forth. The company has said its brain cells are \u201csentient,\u201d which it defined as being \u201cresponsive to sensory impressions.\u201d\nChong says Cortical Labs has been working closely with bioethicists and will continue to engage in conversation with society on ethical concerns. As for the technical side, however, Chong admits there\u2019s a \u201chumongous technical moat\u201d for anyone to enter the space and that the field is full of uncertainties.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult at Cortical Labs because not only do we have to be the Nvidia to make the hardware, but also be the OpenAI to write the software,\u201d says Chong. \u201cOn top of that, we have to prove that this biological computer can still extend further, that we can make it do more tasks than just playing Pong.\u201d\nCortical Labs\u2019 biological computer is \u201ca body in a box,\u201d Chong jokes. The human brain cells are created by engineering stem cells from adults\u2019 skin or blood. They are then integrated into a chip and placed inside a big shoe box-like device, which comprises a system to supply the cells with nutrients and air, and remove waste from them. The brain cells essentially act like the central processing unit (CPU) of a conventional computer, Chong adds.\nTHE BIOLOGICAL COMPUTER Cortical Labs/Forbes Asia\n\nTo train the brain cells for Pong, Cortical Labs connected the hybrid chip with a computer running the video game. The computer would send electrical signals revealing where the bouncing ball was and how far it was from the paddle. The cells made its own decision on how to move, and learned to improve its performance through feedback from electrical signals.\nChong says Cortical Labs\u2019 biological computer could help test the efficacy and side effects of drugs targeting neurological disorders, such as dementia and epilepsy. This could be done through the human brain cells\u2019 performance in programs like Pong, he says. The former doctor hopes to work with pharmaceutical companies like Biogen\nBIIB\n and Eli Lilly to replace animals with human cells in drug tests.\n\u201cIn the short-term, Cortical Labs\u2019 biological computer brings forth compelling in-vitro solutions that can give further insight into how drugs affect neurons,\u201d Jonathan Tam, an investor at Cortical Labs\u2019 backer Horizons Ventures who leads AI-related investments, says in a written response. \u201cIn the long-term, these synthetic neurons will offer unprecedented insight into how our brains function, which will unlock pathways into treating neurological disorders that were previously unsolvable.\u201d\nCortical Labs\u2019 biological computer can also help with a more grounded issue: High electricity bills. Chong says biological computers could significantly cut the energy cost for training AI, which requires a great deal of electricity using cloud computing as it needs to read through mountains of data. It also requires lots of cooling to keep the learning process going.\nTraining GPT-3, the brain behind OpenAI\u2019s viral chatbot, for example, consumed 1.287 gigawatt-hours of electricity, according to a 2021 research paper. This equals to electricity consumed by around 120 homes in the U.S. in 2021. The human brain, on the other hand, is said to run on about 20 watts, or the energy enough to power an LED light bulb.\nWith Cortical Labs\u2019 innovation, cloud computing platforms for AI could cut energy consumption by \u201cthe order of magnitude of 10 to the power of six to eight watts,\u201d Chong claims. \u201cThe hope really is that with this kind of technology, energy will no longer be a bottleneck,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s potentially more sustainable as well because we\u2019re not feeding the brain cells with electricity, but with simple sugars\u2014glucose\u2014as a compound.\u201d\nTHE COMPUTER CLUSTER Cortical Labs/Forbes Asia\nIt\u2019s not the first time Chong pursued an ambitious project. When Chong was a student at Melbourne Medical School, he developed a low-cost stethoscope that could plug into a smartphone, after seeing the need for diagnosis in places with scarce healthcare resources.\nAfter graduation and a short stint as a doctor, Chong in 2014 picked up the idea again and cofounded CliniCloud to commercialize a digital stethoscope that allows anyone to take readings at home and consult doctors online. The medtech startup received funding from the likes of Chinese tech giant Tencent, as well as the venture arm of Chinese financial conglomerate Ping An.\nYet, a lack of health consciousness before Covid, coupled with the uncertainty under former President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system, killed CliniCloud\u2019s business in 2018. \u201cClinicCloud was way ahead of its time. Had we survived a couple more years, we would have really taken off because of the pandemic,\u201d says Chong. \u201cIn fact, I had a lot of people calling me at the start of the pandemic asking me for thermometers and stethoscopes, and literally writing me a blank check.\u201d\nBy then, Chong had already kicked off his AI pivot. Inspired by a research paper by Alphabet-owned Google DeepMind, Chong cofounded Cortical Labs in 2019 with Andy Kitchen, the former head of AI research at CliniCloud. The startup\u2019s futuristic vision to build an AI system using human brain cells drew a A$1 million ($673,000) seed investment from Blackbird Ventures, followed by a S$1.2 million ($895,000) extension round from investors including Singapore-based January Capital.\nNow, amid the AI craze, Chong is busy getting Cortical Labs\u2019 biological computers into production. Chong says he gets inquiries from companies asking what else the brain cells can do. One of the inquiries was \u201cludicrous,\u201d which was whether the cells could learn to trade bitcoin, Chong says with a laugh. As crazy as it sounds, Chong didn\u2019t dismiss the idea. Instead, he offered to build a software code so that the inquirer could feed the brain cells with bitcoin prices and experiment.\n\u201cIf it works, this is great. This is your technology, this is your IP. Go make a lot of money that way,\u201d Chong says. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be outright dismissive because a lot of ideas start out sounding really stupid, but you never know where it could go.\u201d\n\nMORE FROM FORBESForbesHow Alexandr Wang Turned An Army Of Clickworkers Into A $7.3 Billion AI UnicornBy Kenrick CaiForbesThe AI Founder Taking Credit For Stable Diffusion's Success Has A History Of ExaggerationBy Kenrick CaiForbesInside ChatGPT's Breakout Moment And The Race To Put AI To WorkBy Alex Konrad\n\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

The benefit is that we're now using data from our full gaming suite, rather than just a couple of specific tests. The charts are the geometric mean across all 15 games, though we'll also have full tables showing the individual results \u2014 some games are more taxing than others, as you'd expect.\n\nOur new testing approach also provides data on GPU clock speeds and temperatures (but not fan speeds), and we'll have separate charts for 1080p medium, 1080p ultra, 1440p ultra, and 4K ultra. Besides the power testing, we also check noise levels using an SPL meter. This is done at a distance of 10cm from in order to minimize noise pollution from other sources (like the CPU cooler).Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Starting with power consumption, the RTX 4060 has a nominal TGP (Total Graphics Power) of 115W. However, the Asus RTX 4060 Dual OC appears to have a slightly higher power limit of around 130W, based on our testing. On average, at 1080p ultra the Asus card consumed 125W. The other resolutions and settings don't change that too much, with average power use of 126\u2013127 watts.\n\nThe result is a good overall efficiency score of 0.537 FPS/W at 1080p ultra, but that's not as good as the RTX 4060 Ti's 0.597 FPS/W. AMD's RX 7600 meanwhile lands at 0.361 FPS/W, while the RX 6700 XT only achieves 0.320 FPS/W. Overclocking doesn't change the efficiency too much either, with the 4060 OC still getting 0.525 FPS/W. Anyway, depending on where you live and how much you pay for power, these metrics can be an important factor.\n\nConsider a moderate 15 hours per week of gaming (an hour or two on weekdays and then some longer sessions on the weekend). AMD's RX 6700 XT might be generally faster, but it consumes 80W more power. Over time, that adds up to 62 kWh per year. If you're lucky and only pay $0.10 per kWh, that's only $6, but some places like California can pay up to $0.30 per kWh, or $18 per year, and various places in Europe are in the $0.50 per kWh range \u2014 $30 per year.\n\nSure, that's spread out over twelve months, but it's something to think about. You could potentially buy a more efficient GPU and end up paying less in power costs. If you play a lot of games, which we know some people do, the difference in electricity costs could be even wider. It's food for thought, anyway.Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)GPU clocks aren't super meaningful, in and of themselves, but the Asus RTX 4060 averages about 2750 MHz across our test suite. That's roughly 200 MHz higher than the rated boost clock, which is typical of what we've seen with Nvidia's RTX 40-series GPUs. Our +200 MHz overclock, with a 120% power limit, boosts average GPU clocks to just under 3GHz, a rather impressive result.\n\nIt's nice to finally see Nvidia GPUs breaking the 2GHz barrier with ease. Higher clocks can reduce overall efficiency in some cases, but the combination of the Ada Lovelace architecture and TSMC's 4N process node proves potent. You have to wonder if we could start seeing 3GHz and even 4GHz GPUs with the next generation parts.Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Temperatures are very good on the Asus RTX 4060 Dual OC. We expected as much, considering the relatively large heatsink, quality fans, and low TGP. On average across our test suite, the Asus card landed just under 60C, with the worst result being 61C in Control.\n\nOverclocking didn't make things worse, thanks to our aggressive fan speed curve, with temperatures still staying under 60C. But temperatures don't exist in a vacuum; we also have to look at noise levels.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)With an average power draw of 125W, the Asus card shouldn't have to work too hard to keep temperatures in check. For our noise testing, we run Metro Exodus for over 15 minutes and let things setting down. It's typically one of the most demanding games in our test suite, as far as GPU power draw goes, which means this should be a worst-case scenario for fan speed and noise.\n\nWe use an SPL (sound pressure level) meter placed 10cm from the card, with the mic aimed at the center of the right fan on the Asus card. This helps minimize the impact of other noise sources like the fans on the CPU cooler. The noise floor of our test environment and equipment is around 31\u201332 dB(A).\n\nThe Asus RTX 4060 Dual OC settled in at a fan speed of 47% after a few minutes. As expected, it doesn't make too much noise, registering 42.1 dB(A) on our meter. It's not the quietest card around, and we do have to wonder if some company might be daring enough to try a passively cooled RTX 4060. We've seen such cards in the past, and a 125W TGP ought to be manageable, assuming you have a bit of airflow from case fans.\n\nWe also tested with a static fan speed of 75%, and the Asus RTX 4060 generated 51.6 dB(A) of noise.\u00a0The card shouldn't need to hit such a high fan speed under normal use, or even with overclocking, but it does give you some idea of what you can expect in warmer environments.Image 1 of 19(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Here's the full rundown of all of our test results, including performance per watt and performance per dollar columns. We've covered most of this information elsewhere, though the value aspect isn't something we've addressed directly.\n\nAs you'd expect, lower priced cards like the RTX 4060 rank higher on the value scale than more expensive cards, though that's only looking at the cost of the GPU and not the full system. Based on current online prices, it's the best value Nvidia GPU, just edging out the RTX 4060 Ti... and the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3060. Those last two are basically on clearance now, though, and any sales are unlikely to last long.\n\nThat doesn't mean the RTX 4060 is the best value overall, however. AMD's RX 6600, 6600 XT, and 6650 XT all have slightly better value rankings, and the RX 6700 XT is only a hair behind the 4060. Prices on previous generation graphics cards have also been fluctuating quite a bit, so a good sale could easily push some other card to the top for a bit. Still, the 4060 does offer a good combination of features, price, and efficiency.MORE:\u00a0Best Graphics CardsMORE:\u00a0GPU Benchmarks and HierarchyMORE:\u00a0All Graphics Content\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n6\n\n\n7\n\n\n8\n\n\n9\n\n\n\nCurrent page:\n\nNvidia RTX 4060: Power, Clocks, Temps, and Noise\n\n\n\nPrev Page Nvidia RTX 4060: Professional Content Creation and AI Performance\n\n\nNext Page Nvidia RTX 4060: Mainstream Compromises\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nasus\n4K\nAda Lovelace\ngtx\nBenchmark\nGeForce\nrtx\nRadeon\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (112)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

That means the 4060 should perform somewhere between a 3060ti and 3070. It doesn't. It can't even meet the abilities of the 3060ti. This card should not receive a positive review because it fails at meeting the minimum performance standard.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noofdragon\n\n\nUtterly crap.. can't even match a 3060Ti, but of course since that amazing accomplishment goes to the failure 4060Ti.
