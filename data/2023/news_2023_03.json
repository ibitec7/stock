NVDA shares rose 1.8% to\u00a0$260, its highest price in nearly a year, after Morgan Stanley upgraded shares of the chip designer due to overwhelming optimism regarding demand for its chips in light of the artificial intelligence (AI) \"megatrend\".\u00a0\nThe market was less excited though as negativity surrounding the bank-led bailout of First Republic Bank (FRC) and the quadruple witching day led futures to drop. NASDAQ futures were a bit better than its counterparts at -0.3%, while Dow futures tanked -0.7%.\nNvidia stock news: Analyst places NVDA price target at $304\nMorgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore surprisingly changed his rating from Equal-weight to Overweight. This is surprising since Nvidia stock has\u00a0already run up more than 90% in the past six months. Moore also raised the Nvidia price target to $304 from the prior $255 \u2013 a 19% raise.\nMoore's reasoning targeted Nvidia's central place in the future of artificial intelligence computing. Arguing that the semiconductor industry's weakness in gaming and data center would largely be forgotten by the second half of the year, Moore said the AI megatrend was likely to become an extremely large part of Nvidia's growth story over the next few years.\n\"The high capital intensity of these [AI] workloads, particularly on the training side, is now a major part of the calculus for the largest companies in technology, with NVIDIA having dominance in the training market that is likely to persist for several years even with a relatively fixed number of model developers, model complexity plus multiple languages should still drive 3-5x growth in training over 5 years,\" Moore wrote.\nAlready on Monday Microsoft (MSFT) unveiled its new AI virtual machines, which allow customers to test AI protocols without resorting to purchasing the extremely expensive and large amount of\u00a0hardware required. Microsoft utilizes Nvidia's H100 Tensor Core GPUs, as well as its Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking architecture.\nCEO Jensen Huang, who has been championing Nvidia's edge on the future of AI computing for years, will be among the major speakers at next week's GTC Nvidia conference for developers. The conference runs from March 20th to 22nd, and the market is expecting more new announcements to come from the event.\nNvidia stock forecast\nNvidia stock has been able to overcome long-term resistance at $260. This resistance stems from all the way back in November of 2021 and again in early 2022. The latter time period also gave rise to the importance of $266 and $283.50. Both of those price levels worked as resistance one year ago during separate range highs. Bulls will now attempt to reach both levels, but first they will need to contend with an overheated Relative Strength Index (RSI). NVDA stock is back above the 70 overbought threshold on the daily RSI, like it was in late January and early February. Expect a pullback at some point in the next two weeks. Nvidia traders will discover long-term support at $225.\n\nNVDA daily chart\n\u00a0\n\nShare:\n\n  Feed news\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

New algorithms generally require a rigorous review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but Medtronic said it may help some developers win that approval.\u00a0\nThe companies said Tuesday that they plan to incorporate Nvidia\u2019s healthcare platforms into Medtronic\u2019s GI Genius endoscopy device, to start.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOur wish is to have millions of developers across the globe taking a look at the opportunity to improve some of the challenging real-time procedures and decision-making that our customers need to take every day,\u201d Giovanni Di Napoli, president of Medtronic\u2019s gastrointestinal business, said in an interview. \nNvidia Vice President of Healthcare Kimberly Powell said in an interview that more medical device companies are becoming interested in real-time AI applications, which can give physicians timely insights that can help inform their clinical decisions.\n\n\nRecommended Reading\n\n\n\n                        Nvidia, American College of Radiology partner on AI platform\n                    \n\nBy\n        \n            \n            \n                Susan Kelly\n            \n        \n        \u2022\n    \nApril 8, 2019\n\n\n\n\n                        Medtronic, GE, Philips embrace AI amid regulatory limbo around algorithms\n                    \n\nBy\n        \n            \n            \n                Greg Slabodkin\n            \n        \n        \u2022\n    \nDec. 21, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npurchase licensing rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled Under:\nDigital Health, \nMedical Devices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedTech Dive news delivered to your inbox\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect user consent:\n\n\n\n\n    By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our\n    Terms of Use and\n    Privacy Policy.

Equipment maker ASML is working closely with NVIDIA on GPUs and cuLitho, and is planning to integrate support for GPUs into all of its computational lithography software products.\nThe advance will enable chips with tinier transistors and wires than is now achievable, while accelerating time to market and boosting energy efficiency of the massive data centers that run 24/7 to drive the manufacturing process.\n\u201cThe chip industry is the foundation of nearly every other industry in the world,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cWith lithography at the limits of physics, NVIDIA\u2019s introduction of cuLitho and collaboration with our partners TSMC, ASML and Synopsys allows fabs to increase throughput, reduce their carbon footprint and set the foundation for 2nm and beyond.\u201d\nRunning on GPUs, cuLitho delivers a performance leap of up to 40x beyond current lithography \u2014 the process of creating patterns on a silicon wafer \u2014 accelerating the massive computational workloads that currently consume tens of billions of CPU hours every year.\nIt enables 500 NVIDIA DGX H100 systems to achieve the work of 40,000 CPU systems, running all parts of the computational lithography process in parallel, helping reduce power needs and potential environmental impact.\nIn the near term, fabs using cuLitho could help produce each day 3-5x more photomasks \u2014 the templates for a chip\u2019s design \u2014 using 9x less power than current configurations. A photomask that required two weeks can now be processed overnight.\nLonger term, cuLitho will enable better design rules, higher density, higher yields and AI-powered lithography.\nSupport From Industry Leaders\r\nNVIDIA is working with key partners to smooth the speedy adoption of these new technologies.\n\u201cThe cuLitho team has made admirable progress on speeding up computational lithography by moving expensive operations to GPU,\u201d said Dr. C.C. Wei, CEO of TSMC. \u201cThis development opens up new possibilities for TSMC to deploy lithography solutions like inverse lithography technology and deep learning more broadly in chip manufacturing, making important contributions to the continuation of semiconductor scaling.\u201d\u200b\n\u201cWe are planning to integrate support for GPUs into all of our computational lithography software products,\u201d said Peter Wennink, CEO of ASML. \u201cOur collaboration with NVIDIA on GPUs and cuLitho should result in tremendous benefit to computational lithography, and therefore to semiconductor scaling. This will be especially true in the era of high NA extreme ultraviolet lithography.\u201d\u200b\n\u201cComputational lithography, specifically optical proximity correction, or OPC, is pushing the boundaries of compute workloads for the most advanced chips,\u201d said Aart de Geus, chair and CEO of Synopsys. \u201cBy collaborating with our partner NVIDIA to run Synopsys OPC software on the cuLitho platform, we massively accelerated the performance from weeks to days! The team-up of our two leading companies continues to force amazing advances in the industry.\u201d\nEnabling Semiconductor Scaling\r\nThe cost of the computational time needed for the largest workloads in semi manufacturing has in recent years been outpacing Moore\u2019s law, due to both the larger number of transistors in newer nodes and more stringent accuracy requirements. Future nodes require more detailed calculations, not all of which can feasibly fit into the available computational bandwidth provided by the current platforms, slowing the pace of innovation in semiconductors.\nA fab process change often requires an OPC revision, creating bottlenecks. cuLitho helps remove these bottlenecks, and it makes possible novel solutions and innovative techniques like curvilinear masks, high NA EUV lithography, and sub-atomic photoresist modeling needed for new technology nodes.\nTo learn more, watch Huang\u2019s GTC 2023 keynote and attend the conference session \u201cAccelerating Computational Lithography\u201d presented by NVIDIA cuLitho architect Vivek K. Singh. Registration for GTC is free.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

GI Genius is the first FDA-cleared, AI-assisted colonoscopy tool to help physicians detect polyps that can lead to colorectal cancer.\nGI Genius has been designed to host a suite of AI algorithms and integrating the NVIDIA Clara\u2122 healthcare platform could allow Medtronic to scale development of algorithms for real-time procedures, potentially accelerating AI innovation for better patient care.\n\u201cArtificial intelligence is a powerful tool that can increase the speed, efficiency and effectiveness of global health systems,\u201d said Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA. \u201cWe\u2019re collaborating with Medtronic to accelerate AI innovation by enabling a software-defined business model, with the goal of improving clinical decision making, reducing medical variability and driving better patient outcomes.\u201d\n\u201cWe believe that collaborating with AI companies and developers like NVIDIA and Cosmo is essential to driving innovation within the medical device industry,\u201d said Giovanni Di Napoli, president of Gastrointestinal Business at Medtronic. \u201cWe are committed to working with the best and brightest minds in the field of AI to develop new technologies that can improve patient outcomes and transform the way we approach healthcare.\u201d\nMedtronic intends to integrate NVIDIA Holoscan \u2014 a real-time AI computing software platform for building medical devices \u2014 and NVIDIA IGX, an industrial-grade edge AI hardware platform, to run with its GI Genius AI-assisted colonoscopy system to support physicians with AI-enhanced diagnostic images. Holoscan helps bring the latest AI applications into clinical settings by providing the full-stack infrastructure needed for scalable, software-defined processing of streaming data at the edge.\nThe NVIDIA Holoscan and IGX platform makes software-defined medical devices possible by enabling developers to efficiently train and validate AI models within the Cosmo Innovation Center, and then host the AI-powered applications on Medtronic\u2019s GI Genius AI Access\u2122 Platform, a marketplace for software-as-a-medical-device (SaMD) applications.\nThe first GI Genius systems built with the NVIDIA technology will be available later this year.\nWatch NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang discuss the Medtronic collaboration in his GTC keynote.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

The price is $1.08 million higher than the guide price of $60 million set for the properties when they were launched for sale by tender in mid-February.  Read also:\u00a0Freehold bungalows at Chancery Hill up for estate sale at $60 mil The properties are being purchased by a subsidiary of Sustained Land, a property developer owned and funded by Douglas Ong. Projects by Sustained Land include the 262-unit Sky Everton at Everton Road and luxury freehold condos One Meyer at Meyer Place and 3 Cuscaden at Cuscaden Walk. The deal was brokered by Cushman & Wakefield, who says the estate sale drew more than 10 offers. Bids came from developers and high-net-worth families looking to redevelop the site for their use. \u201cWe received an overwhelming response, with close to 100 enquiries since we launched the tender,\u201d adds Shaun Poh, executive director of capital markets at Cushman & Wakefield.    Map of 12 Chancery Hill Road (Source: EdgeProp LandLens) The three bungalows are currently vacant and occupy a land area of about 32,148 sq ft. The land is zoned for residential, two-storey mixed-landed use. The homes were put up for sale by Peter and John Lee, brothers who are co-executors for the estate of their late aunt, Agnes Tan. Proceeds from the sale will go to registered charities named estate beneficiaries. \u201cOur aunt Agnes was always an active and visionary philanthropist, and we think this is a fitting outcome for someone who had not only been extremely generous in her life but who had bequeathed everything she owned towards charitable causes,\u201d says Peter.  He adds that the donations from selling the properties to the chosen beneficiaries will be made in memory of Agnes Tan's father, Tan Cheng Lock, a prominent figure in Singapore and Malaysia, the latter being where he founded the Malaysian Chinese Association. Agnes is also the aunt of\u00a0Singapore singer-songwriter Dick Lee. Sustained Land\u2019s Ong says: \u201cWe respect and admire the decision of having the proceeds going to charity, and hence we set forth on this purchase. This decision to give back to society is a meaningful element in this sale transaction.

It's the year that shares of Nvidia (NVDA -2.56%) traded publicly for the first time.\u00a0\nThe company started out with a vision to deliver 3D computing graphics in 1993, and today, 30 years later, it stands ready to revolutionize the business world through artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe company's stock has soared since its debut, and despite a 31% decline from its all-time high, investors who bought in early are still sitting on monumental gains.\nHere's exactly how much their patience has been rewarded.\u00a0\n\nNvidia has truly changed the world\nNvidia was founded in 1993 by a trio that includes Jensen Huang, the company's president and CEO from the start. With the onset of personal computing, the team set out to deliver 3D graphics to the gaming and multimedia world, and it delivered its first graphics chip in 1995.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy 1999, the company had produced the world's first GPU (graphics processing unit). It was 50% more powerful than its prior chip, and it could run some of the best PC games at the time.\nMore importantly, it was the first-ever product released under the GeForce banner, a brand that has become the most recognized name in graphics hardware. \nNvidia has never stopped innovating since, and it now produces some of the most sought-after graphics chips for gaming, and especially data centers that serve as training grounds for AI. The company is regarded as a pioneer of AI technology, and its chips are responsible for training platforms like ChatGPT, which have recently taken the tech world by storm.\u00a0\nNvidia has built some of the world's most powerful AI supercomputers and software applications. Last month, Huang announced the company would deliver some of those applications -- and access to its DGX supercomputer -- in the cloud, through partnerships with Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThose deals will put AI within reach of millions of businesses around the world, placing Nvidia at the epicenter of yet another technological revolution.\u00a0\nNvidia has become a financial powerhouse\nThe semiconductor industry is cyclical, which means its revenue ebbs and flows alongside the business cycle. When times are good, organizations spend more on upgrading their systems, and when times are bad, they make do with what they have.\u00a0\nThe chart below shows Nvidia's annual revenue since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1999. You'll notice it's quite lumpy year to year, which reflects its cyclical nature. But the trajectory is absolutely clear: The company generated $158 million in revenue in fiscal 1999, and it has since soared to $26.9 billion in fiscal 2023 (ended Jan. 29). \n\n\n\nGaming and the data center make up the overwhelming majority of Nvidia's revenue today. But its automotive segment is one to watch, because while it generated only $294 million in sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, that was a 135% jump year over year. \n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's Drive platform is an end-to-end (hardware and software) solution for car manufacturers that want self-driving technology. So far, the company has lined up a sales pipeline worth at least $11 billion between now and 2028. But industries like autonomous ride-hailing could be a $14 trillion opportunity by then, according to an estimate by Cathie Wood's Ark Invest. \nTherefore, the company is still in the very early innings of that opportunity.\nHere's how much a $1,000 investment in Nvidia's IPO is worth today\nNvidia completed its IPO on Jan. 22, 1999, at $12 per share. The company's stock has since grown so significantly that management conducted five stock splits to ensure the price remained low enough that shares were accessible to small investors. \nHad you invested $1,000 at its IPO, you would have acquired 83 shares at $12 per share. Adjusting for the stock splits, you would actually have 3,984 shares today, with a cost basis of $0.25 per share.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that Nvidia trades at $235.01 per share as of this writing, that translates to a return of 94,000%. In dollar terms, that initial $1,000 outlay in 1999 would be worth a whopping $940,000 today.\nBut there's more; Nvidia has paid a small dividend since fiscal 2012, so assuming you never sold a single share along the way, you would have also collected a total of $5,325.01 in dividends.\u00a0\nInvestors who don't own Nvidia stock yet might be wondering if it's still a buy. According to an estimate by Ark Invest, technologies like AI could add $200 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Since Nvidia is a leader in the field, it stands to reap significant rewards if that prediction comes to fruition.\u00a0\nNvidia stock is down 31% from its all-time high right now, so this could be a great opportunity to buy in for the long term.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

The partnership will continue to push the frontiers of virtual integration and virtual tooling for the next generation of smart-connected factories around the world,\u201d Huang said during the GTC keynote.\nOmniverse \u2014 the culmination of over 25 years of NVIDIA graphics, accelerated computing, simulation and AI technologies \u2014 enables manufacturing companies to plan and optimize multibillion-dollar factory projects entirely virtually. This means they can get to production faster and operate more efficiently, improving time to market, digitalization and sustainability.\nThe keynote demo highlights a virtual planning session for BMW\u2019s Debrecen EV plant. With Omniverse, the BMW team can aggregate data into massive, high-performance models, connect their domain-specific software tools and enable multi-user live collaboration across locations. All of this is possible from any location, on any device.\nStarting to work in the virtual factory two years before it opens enables the BMW Group to ensure smooth operation and optimal efficiency.\nVirtual Integration for Real-World Efficiencies\u00a0\u00a0\nBMW Group\u2019s virtual Debrecen plant illustrates the power and agility of planning AI-driven industrial manufacturing plants with the Omniverse platform.\nIn the EV factory demo, Nedeljkovi\u0107 invites Huang into an update in which the BMW team seeks to include a robot in a constrained floor space. The team solves the problem on the fly, with logistics and production planners able to visualize and decide the ideal placement.\n\u201cThis is transformative \u2014 we can design, build and test completely in a virtual world,\u201d said Nedeljkovi\u0107.\nIt\u2019s a lens into the future of BMW Group\u2019s journey into digital transformation. It\u2019s also a blueprint for reducing risks and ensuring success before committing to massive construction projects and capital expenditures.\nThis kind of digital transformation pays off. Putting in change orders and flow reoptimizations on existing facilities is extremely costly and causes production downtime. So having the ability to pre-optimize virtually eliminates such costs.\nBMW Group Transforming Production Worldwide\nBMW Group\u2019s production network is poised to benefit from the digital transformation opportunities brought by Omniverse.\nWith factories and factory planners all over the world, BMW has a complex planning process. The automaker uses many software tools and processes to connect people across geographies and time zones, which comes with limitations.\nWith Omniverse, a development platform based on Universal Scene Description (USD), a 3D language that creates interoperability between software suites, BMW is able to bridge existing software and data repositories from leading industrial computer-aided design and engineering tools such as Siemens Process Simulate, Autodesk Revit, and Bentley Systems MicroStation.\nWith this unified view, BMW is powering its internal teams and external partners to collaborate and share knowledge and data from existing factories to help in the planning of new ones.\nAdditionally, the BMW team is developing a suite of custom applications with Omniverse, including a new application called Factory Explorer, based on Omniverse USD Composer, a customizable foundation application of the Omniverse platform. BMW used core components of USD Composer and added custom-built extensions tailored to its factory-planning teams\u2019 needs, including finding, constructing, navigating, and analyzing factory data.\nOmniverse Platform Accelerates Digital Twin Collaboration\nThe Omniverse platform enables BMW teams to collaborate across virtual factories from everywhere. A unified approach to data, allowing global changes in real time, lets BMW share updates across its teams.\nWith these new capabilities, BMW can now validate and test entirely in a virtual world, accelerating its time to production and improving efficiency across all of its plants.\nTo learn more about the latest in digitalization, watch NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s GTC keynote and these sessions featuring speakers from BMW:\n\nAre We There Yet?

Additionally, L4 GPUs will be available with optimized support on Vertex AI, which now supports building, tuning and deploying large generative AI models.\nDevelopers can access the latest state-of-the-art technology available to help them get new applications up and running quickly and cost-efficiently. The NVIDIA L4 GPU is a universal GPU for every workload, with enhanced AI video capabilities that can deliver 120x more AI-powered video performance than CPUs, combined with 99% better energy efficiency.\n\u201cSurging interest in generative AI is inspiring a wave of companies to turn to cloud-based computing to support their business models,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cWe are working with Google Cloud to help ensure that the capabilities they require are easily available and able to help fuel the incredible new tools and applications they will create.\u201d\n\u201cGenerative AI represents a new era of computing \u2014 one that demands the speed, scalability and reliability we provide on Google Cloud,\u201d said Amin Vahdat, vice president of Systems & Services Infrastructure at Google Cloud. \u201cAs our customers begin to explore the possibilities of generative AI, we\u2019re proud to offer them NVIDIA\u2019s latest L4 GPU innovation as part of our workload-optimized Compute Engine portfolio.\u201d\nHelping New Generative AI Applications Come to Life\r\nGoogle Cloud provides the infrastructure for a wide variety of organizations offering generative AI applications, many of which are designed to help professionals do their work better and faster. Rapid inference is key to successfully running their applications.\nGenerative AI is also driving a number of new apps that help people connect and have fun. WOMBO, which offers an AI-powered text to digital art app called Dream, has had early access to NVIDIA\u2019s L4 inference platform on Google Cloud.\n\u201cWOMBO relies upon the latest AI technology for people to create immersive digital artwork from users\u2019 prompts, letting them create high-quality, realistic art in any style with just an idea,\u201d said Ben-Zion Benkhin, CEO at WOMBO. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s L4 inference platform will enable us to offer a better, more efficient image-generation experience for users seeking to create and share unique artwork.\u201d\nDescript offers AI-powered editing features that let creators remove filler words, add captions and make social-media clips in a few clicks. Or they can use Descript\u2019s generative-AI voice cloning to fix audio mistakes \u2014 even create entire voiceover tracks \u2014 just by typing.\n\u201cDescript uses NVIDIA TensorRT to optimize models to accelerate AI inferencing,\u201d said Andrew Mason, CEO of Descript. \u201cIt allows users to replace their video backgrounds and enhance their speech to produce studio-quality content, without the studio.\u201d\nAvailability\r\nNVIDIA L4 GPUs are available in private preview on Google Cloud. Apply for access.\nWatch Huang discuss the integration of NVIDIA\u2019s inference platform for generative AI into Google Cloud in his GTC keynote.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

They carry data and calculations over parallel paths on a lightning journey to actionable results.\nGPU and CPU processors are the resources along the way, and their onramps are fast interconnects. The gold standard in interconnects for accelerated computing is NVLink.\nSo, What Is NVLink?\nNVLink is a high-speed connection for GPUs and CPUs formed by a robust software protocol, typically riding on multiple pairs of wires printed on a computer board. It lets processors send and receive data from shared pools of memory at lightning speed.\n\nNow in its fourth generation, NVLink connects host and accelerated processors at rates up to 900 gigabytes per second (GB/s).\nThat\u2019s more than 7x the bandwidth of PCIe Gen 5, the interconnect used in conventional x86 servers. And NVLink sports 5x the energy efficiency of PCIe Gen 5, thanks to data transfers that consume just 1.3 picojoules per bit.\nThe History of NVLink\nFirst introduced as a GPU interconnect with the NVIDIA P100 GPU, NVLink has advanced in lockstep with each new NVIDIA GPU architecture.\n\nIn 2018, NVLink hit the spotlight in high performance computing when it debuted connecting GPUs and CPUs in two of the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputers, Summit and Sierra.\nThe systems, installed at Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, are pushing the boundaries of science in fields such as drug discovery, natural disaster prediction and more.\nBandwidth Doubles, Then Grows Again\nIn 2020, the third-generation NVLink doubled its max bandwidth per GPU to 600GB/s, packing a dozen interconnects in every NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU.\nThe A100 powers AI supercomputers in enterprise data centers, cloud computing services and HPC labs across the globe.\nToday, 18 fourth-generation NVLink interconnects are embedded in a single NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU. And the technology has taken on a new, strategic role that will enable the most advanced CPUs and accelerators on the planet.\nA Chip-to-Chip Link\nNVIDIA NVLink-C2C is a version of the board-level interconnect to join two processors inside a single package, creating a superchip. For example, it connects two CPU chips to deliver 144 Arm Neoverse V2 cores in the NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip, a processor built to deliver energy-efficient performance for cloud, enterprise and HPC users.\nNVIDIA NVLink-C2C also joins a Grace CPU and a Hopper GPU to create the Grace Hopper Superchip. It packs accelerated computing for the world\u2019s toughest HPC and AI jobs into a single chip.\nAlps, an AI supercomputer planned for the Swiss National Computing Center, will be among the first to use Grace Hopper. When it comes online later this year, the high-performance system will work on big science problems in fields from astrophysics to quantum chemistry.\nThe Grace CPU packs 144 Arm Neoverse V2 cores across two die connected by NVLink-C2C.\nGrace and Grace Hopper are also great for bringing energy efficiency to demanding cloud computing workloads.\nFor example, Grace Hopper is an ideal processor for recommender systems. These economic engines of the internet need fast, efficient access to lots of data to serve trillions of results to billions of users daily.\nRecommenders get up to 4x more performance and greater efficiency using Grace Hopper than using Hopper with traditional CPUs.\nIn addition, NVLink is used in a powerful system-on-chip for automakers that includes NVIDIA Hopper, Grace and Ada Lovelace processors. NVIDIA DRIVE Thor is a car computer that unifies intelligent functions such as digital instrument cluster, infotainment, automated driving, parking and more into a single architecture.\nLEGO Links of Computing\nNVLink also acts like the socket stamped into a LEGO piece. It\u2019s the basis for building supersystems to tackle the biggest HPC and AI jobs.\nFor example, NVLinks on all eight GPUs in an NVIDIA DGX system share fast, direct connections via NVSwitch chips. Together, they enable an NVLink network where every GPU in the server is part of a single system.\nTo get even more performance, DGX systems can themselves be stacked into modular units of 32 servers, creating a powerful, efficient computing cluster.\nNVLink is one of the key technologies that let users easily scale modular NVIDIA DGX systems to a SuperPOD with up to an exaflop of AI performance.\nUsers can connect a modular block of 32 DGX systems into a single AI supercomputer using a combination of an NVLink network inside the DGX and NVIDIA Quantum-2 switched Infiniband fabric between them. For example, an NVIDIA DGX H100 SuperPOD packs 256 H100 GPUs to deliver up to an exaflop of peak AI performance.\nTo get even more performance, users can tap into the AI supercomputers in the cloud such as the one Microsoft Azure is building with tens of thousands of A100 and H100 GPUs. It\u2019s a service used by groups like OpenAI to train some of the world\u2019s largest generative AI models.\nAnd it\u2019s one more example of the power of accelerated computing.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | ExplainerTags: GPU | Hardware | High-Performance Computing | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture | NVIDIA DGX | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | NVLink | Recommender Systems | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Today, creators and artists are transforming VFX using advanced capabilities in graphics, like real-time ray tracing, simulation, AI and virtual production \u2014 all powered by NVIDIA RTX technologies.\nDiving Into Natural Wonders With Cutting-Edge Graphics\nAward-winning studio W\u0113t\u0101 FX created the stunning visuals for director James Cameron\u2019s much-anticipated sequel, Avatar: The Way of Water. The film is one of W\u0113t\u0101\u2019s largest VFX projects to date. The team created 3,240 shots \u2014 which is 98% of the total shots in the film, more than two-thirds of which featured water.\nIn computer graphics (CG), making water look natural and realistic \u2014 from how it moves off a character\u2019s skin to how it drips from clothing \u2014 is one of the biggest challenges for visual effects artists. But for this film, W\u0113t\u0101 developed and implemented a new water toolset that advanced their capabilities across simulation, rendering and more.\nThe team started with pre-production and performance capture using a real-time, GPU-based ocean spectrum deformer, which served as a consistent, physically based starting point for water on set. From there, W\u0113t\u0101 created a new suite of water solvers \u2014 many of them within Loki, the studio\u2019s in-house multiphysics simulation framework. Loki allows coupling of multiple solvers in any configuration. For example, hair, cloth, air and water can all be simulated together.\nOther key innovations from W\u0113t\u0101 centered on both dry and wet performance capture, new deep learning models to process stereo camera images and generate depth maps for compositing, and neural networks to assist with facial animation and muscle systems.\nCreating Captivating Car Chases Through Gritty Gotham\nW\u0113t\u0101 FX was also behind the cinematic visuals for The Batman. The team, led by VFX supervisor Anders Langlands, worked on the gripping highway chase between Batman and the infamous villain, the Penguin. As they race through the city of Gotham under heavy rainfall, the Penguin sets off a sequence of car crashes and explosions.\nTo create a feeling of danger and exhilaration, the team put the car chase scene together through heavily enhanced live action and completely CG shots. Rendering the proper lighting; simulating realistic raindrops colliding with multiple surfaces, hydroplaning and wheel spray; and illuminating rain through headlights and streetlights all added to the complexity of these shots. W\u0113t\u0101 also worked on background environments for scenes in the Batcave and Gotham\u2019s City Hall.\nTaking CGI to the Sky\nThe practical effects and cinematography behind Top Gun: Maverick was an instant highlight of this heart-pounding Hollywood blockbuster film. But to add more layers of realism to those outstanding aerial shots, VFX Supervisor Ryan Tudhope and the team at Method Studios partnered with the camera department, aerial coordinators and the United States Navy to film extensive air-to-air and ground-to-air footage of real jets. They captured over 800 hours of aerial stunts, mounts and plates to provide their team with a practical foundation for the visual effects work.\nThe Top Gun: Maverick team implemented various VFX techniques, creating a surprising 2,400 VFX shots for the movie. The visual effects included creating and adding CG planes in scenes, as well as adding missiles, smoke and explosions in various action sequences. The invisible nature of the visual effects in Top Gun: Maverick make it a top contender for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.\nA New Swimlane for Underwater Worlds\nIn Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, W\u0113t\u0101 FX further demonstrated its leadership in creating photorealistic underwater sequences. Chris White, visual effects supervisor for the film, was tasked with creating the Mesoamerican-inspired Talokan underwater kingdom.\nTo get a realistic look for the characters in this undersea world, W\u0113t\u0101 used a combination of live-action sequences shot in water tanks and dry-for-wet shots that helped capture realistic underwater motion for the characters, clothes and hair.\nW\u0113t\u0101 also reflected how various skin tones would react to light with the added complexity of a murky underwater environment. The bar for realistic water simulation has once again been raised by W\u0113t\u0101 FX in Blank Panther: Wakanda Forever.\nAll Action on the VFX Front\nMovie magic is made when visual effects are so seamless that the audience remains completely immersed in the story, not realizing that what they\u2019re seeing is an effect. This is how VFX supervisor Markus Frank and production company Cine Chromatix earned their Best Visual Effects nomination for All Quiet on the Western Front.\nTo authentically tell the story of two young soldiers during World War I, Cine Chromatix and the film\u2019s visual effects teams focused on the fine details needed to craft VFX that are hidden in plain sight.\nThe result is stunning.

The effort is poised to accelerate Japan\u2019s $100 billion pharma industry, the world\u2019s third largest following the U.S. and China.\n\u201cJapanese pharma companies are experts in wet lab research, but they have not yet taken advantage of high performance computing and AI on a large scale,\u201d said Yuhi Abe, general manager of the digital healthcare business department at Mitsui. \u201cWith Tokyo-1, we are creating an innovation hub that will enable the pharma industry to transform the landscape with state-of-the-art tools for AI-accelerated drug discovery.\u201d\nThe project will provide customers with access to NVIDIA DGX H100 nodes supporting molecular dynamics simulations, large language model training, quantum chemistry, generative AI models that create novel molecular structures for potential drugs, and more. Tokyo-1 users can also harness large language models for chemistry, protein, DNA and RNA data formats through the NVIDIA BioNeMo drug discovery software and service.\nXeureka, a Mitsui subsidiary focused on AI-powered drug discovery, will be operating Tokyo-1, which is expected to go online later this year. The initiative will also include workshops and technical training on accelerated computing and AI for drug discovery.\nInvigorating Drug Discovery Research With AI, HPC\nAccording to Abe, Japan\u2019s pharmaceutical environment has long faced drug lag: delays in both drug development and the approval of treatments that are already available elsewhere. The problem received renewed attention during the race to develop vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe nation\u2019s pharmaceutical companies see AI adoption as part of the solution \u2014 a key tool to strengthen and accelerate the industry\u2019s drug development pipeline. Training and fine-tuning AI models for drug discovery require enormous compute resources, such as the Tokyo-1 supercomputer, which in its first iteration will include 16 NVIDIA DGX H100 systems, each with eight NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs.\nThe DGX H100 is based on the powerful NVIDIA Hopper GPU architecture, which features a Transformer Engine designed to accelerate the training of transformer models, including generative AI models for biology and chemistry. Xeureka plans to add more nodes to the system as the project grows.\n\u201cTokyo-1 is designed to address some of the barriers to implementing data-driven, AI-accelerated drug discovery in Japan,\u201d said Hiroki Makiguchi, product engineering manager in the science and technology division at Xeureka. \u201cThis initiative will uplevel the Japanese pharmaceutical industry with high performance computing and unlock the potential of generative AI to discover new therapies.\u201d\nCustomers will be able to access a dedicated server on the supercomputer, receive technical support from Xeureka and NVIDIA, and participate in workshops from the two companies. For larger training runs that require more computational resources, customers can request access to a server with more nodes. Users can also purchase Xeureka\u2019s software solutions for molecular dynamics, docking, quantum chemistry and free-energy perturbation calculations.\nBy using NVIDIA BioNeMo software on the Tokyo-1 supercomputer, researchers will be able to scale state-of-the-art AI models to millions and billions of parameters for applications including protein structure prediction, small molecule generation and pose prediction estimation.\nTokyo-1 Accelerates Japanese Companies in Pharma and Beyond\u00a0\nMajor Japanese pharma companies including Astellas Pharma, Daiichi-Sankyo and Ono Pharmaceutical are already making plans to advance their drug discovery projects with Tokyo-1.\nTokyo-based Astellas Pharma is pursuing innovative digital solutions across its business \u2014 including in sales, manufacturing, and research and development \u2014 to maximize outcomes for patients and reduce the costs of healthcare. With Tokyo-1, the company will accelerate its research with molecular simulations and large language models for generative AI through NVIDIA BioNeMo software.\n\u201cAI and large-scale simulations can be used for applications including small molecule compounds, antibodies, gene therapy, cell therapy, targeted protein degradation, engineered phage therapy and mRNA medicine,\u201d said Kazuhisa Tsunoyama, head of digital research solutions, advanced informatics and analytics at Astellas. \u201cBy enabling us to take full advantage of recent advances in AI and simulation technology, Tokyo-1 will be one of the foundations on which Astellas can achieve its VISION for the future of pharmaceutical research.\u201d\nTokyo-based Daiichi Sankyo will use Tokyo-1 to establish a drug discovery process that fully integrates AI and machine learning.\n\u201cBy adopting AI and the cutting-edge GPU resources of Tokyo-1, we will be able to perform large-scale computations to accelerate our drug discovery efforts,\u201d said Takayuki Serizawa, senior researcher at Daiichi Sankyo. \u201cThese advancements will provide new value to patients by improving drug delivery and potentially enabling personalized medicine.\u201d\nOno Pharmaceutical, based in Osaka, focuses on drug discovery in the fields of oncology, immunology and neurology.\n\u201cTraining AI models requires significant computational power, and we believe that the massive GPU resources of Tokyo-1 will solve this problem,\u201d said Hiromu Egashira, director of the Drug Discovery DX Office in the drug discovery technology department at Ono. \u201cWe envision our use of the DGX supercomputer to be very broad, including high-quality simulations, image analysis, video analysis and language models.\u201d\nBeyond the pharmaceutical industry, Mitsui plans to make the Tokyo-1 supercomputer accessible to Japanese medical-device companies and startups \u2014 and to connect Tokyo-1 customers to AI solutions developed by global healthcare startups in the NVIDIA Inception program. NVIDIA will also connect Tokyo-1 users with the hundreds of global life science customers in its developer network.\nDiscover the latest in AI and healthcare at GTC, running online through Thursday, March 23.

Users could employ the models to create a custom image or video in seconds, simply by typing in a concept.\n\u201cWith our high quality and often unique imagery and videos, this collaboration will give our customers the ability to create a greater variety of visuals than ever before, helping creatives and non-creatives alike fuel visual storytelling,\u201d Farhall said.\nGetty Images is a unique partner, not only for its stunning images and video, but also its rich metadata, with appropriate rights. Its creative team and research bring a wealth of expertise that can deliver impactful outputs.\nFor artists, generative AI adds a new tool that expands their canvas. For content creators, it\u2019s an opportunity to create a custom visual tailored to a brand or business they\u2019re building.\n\u201cMore often than not, it\u2019s a visual that cuts through the noise of a busy world to capture your attention, and being able to stand out from the crowd is crucial for businesses of all shapes and sizes,\u201d Farhall said.\nBuilding Responsible AI\nBut, as in lacrosse, you need to play by the rules.\nThe models will be trained on Getty Images\u2019 fully licensed content, and revenue generated from the models will provide royalties to content creators.\n\u201cBoth companies want to develop these tools in a responsible way that returns benefits to creators and doesn\u2019t pass risks on to customers, and this collaboration is testament to the fact that\u2019s possible,\u201d he said.\nA Time-Tested Relationship\nIt\u2019s not the first inning for this collaboration.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been fostering and growing a relationship for some time \u2014 NVIDIA brings the tech expertise and talent, and we bring the high quality and unique content and marketplace,\u201d said Farhall.\nThe technology, values and connections are catalysts for experiences that wow creators and users. It\u2019s a feeling Farhall shares, sitting in front of his mic on a Saturday night.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an adrenaline rush when the live action of a game becomes your singular focus and you\u2019re just in the moment,\u201d he said.\nAnd by training a custom model with NVIDIA Picasso, Getty Images aims to help storytellers everywhere create more moments that perfectly capture their audiences\u2019 attention.\nTo learn more about what NVIDIA is doing in generative AI and beyond, watch company founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s GTC keynote below.\nImage at top courtesy Roberto Moiola/Sysaworld/Getty Images.\n\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AITags: Art | Artificial Intelligence | Cloud Services | Creators | Customer Stories | GTC 2023 | GTC Digital | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

(NYSE: SSTK), a leading creative platform for transformative brands and media companies, today announced it is partnering with NVIDIA to train custom 3D models to create generative 3D assets from simple text prompts. Through a first of its kind collaboration, 3D models will be trained with Shutterstock assets using NVIDIA Picasso generative AI cloud services to convert text into high-fidelity 3D content,\u00a0reducing creation time from hours to minutes.\nWhen the models are introduced in the coming months on Shutterstock.com, the new NVIDIA-powered generative AI capabilities will be the latest addition to Creative Flow, an extensive toolkit designed to power the most seamless creative experience possible. The text-to-3D features will also be offered on Turbosquid.com and is planned to be introduced on the NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122 platform for building and operating 3D industrial metaverse applications.\n\u201cOur generative 3D partnership with NVIDIA will power the next generation of 3D contributor tools, greatly reducing the time it takes to create beautifully textured and structured 3D models,\u201d said Shutterstock CEO Paul Hennessy. \u201cThis first of its kind partnership furthers our strategy of leveraging Shutterstock\u2019s massive pool of metadata to bring new products, tools, and content to market. By combining our 3D content with NVIDIA\u2019s foundation models, and utilizing our respective marketing and distribution platforms, we can capitalize on an extraordinarily large market opportunity.\u201d\nWith today\u2019s professional software tools, building a high quality, detailed 3D model from scratch is often a challenging and time-consuming task for creators. In the case of a content being created for use as a digital twin, where absolute precision is required, the complexity of the job can take days or even longer depending on the specifics of the model. By creating custom models with the NVIDIA Picasso generative AI cloud service, Shutterstock will help 3D artists create object shapes, assist with object unwrapping, generate textures and materials and, for non-3D users, will even produce complete 3D models ready for use in a wide variety of applications and platforms.\n\u201dThe transformative capabilities of generative AI make it possible for software makers and enterprises to build tools that use simple text prompts to create 3D assets for digital twins, simulation and design, saving artists enormous amounts of time and effort,\u201d said NVIDIA Vice President of Developer Programs Greg Estes. \u201cTraining a custom Shutterstock model with the NVIDIA Picasso generative AI cloud services will give developers a tool that can automate much of the tedious work for artists, freeing them to spend more time exploring new concepts and refining their ideas.\u201d\nAs part of its responsible AI focus and in correlation with sales of the customized 3D models on Shutterstock\u2019s platform, Shutterstock will compensate artists through its Contributor Fund for the role their IP plays in training the generative technology.\n\n\n\n\nABOUT NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company\u2019s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling the creation of the metaverse. NVIDIA is now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.

This includes enhancing its data processing using the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite, which includes the NVIDIA RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark; enabling real-time vehicle routing and optimization with NVIDIA cuOpt; adopting digital avatars with NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine\u00a0and NVIDIA Tokkio; and utilizing conversational AI with NVIDIA Riva.\n\u201cWe strive each day to deliver the most efficient global network, as we drive towards net zero emissions in our operations,\u201d said Andy Markus, chief data officer at AT&T. \u201cWorking with NVIDIA to drive AI solutions across our business will help enhance experiences for both our employees and customers.\u201d\n\u201cIndustries are embracing a new era in which chatbots, recommendation engines and accelerated libraries for data optimization help produce AI-driven innovations,\u201d said Manuvir Das, vice president of Enterprise Computing at NVIDIA. \u201cOur work with AT&T will help the company better mine its data to drive new services and solutions for the AI-powered telco.\u201d\nThe Data Dilemma\r\nAT&T, which has pledged to be carbon neutral by 2035, has instituted broad initiatives to make its operations more efficient. A major challenge is optimizing energy consumption while providing network infrastructure that delivers data at high speeds.\nAT&T processes more than 590 petabytes of data on average a day. That is the equivalent of about 6.5 million 4K movies or more than 8x the content housed in the U.S. Library of Congress if all its collections were digitized.\nTelecoms aiming to reduce energy consumption face challenges across their operations. Within networks, the radio access network (RAN) consumes 73% of energy, while core network services, data centers and operations use 13%, 9% and 5%, respectively, according to the GSMA, a mobile industry trade group.\nAT&T first adopted NVIDIA RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark to capitalize on energy-efficient GPUs across its AI and data science pipelines. This helped boost its operational efficiency across everything from training AI models and maintaining network quality and optimization, to reducing customer churn and improving fraud detection.\nOf the data and AI pipelines targeted with Spark-RAPIDS, AT&T saves about half of its cloud computing spend and sees faster performance, while enabling reductions in its carbon footprint.\nEnhanced Field Dispatch Services \r\nAT&T, which operates one of the largest field dispatch teams to service its customers, is currently testing NVIDIA cuOpt software to enhance its field dispatch capabilities to handle more complex technician routing and optimization challenges.\nRouting requires trillions of computations to factor in a variety of factors, from traffic and weather conditions to customer change of plans or a technician\u2019s skill level, where a complicated job might then require an additional truck roll.\nIn early trials, cuOpt delivered solutions in 10 seconds, while the same computation on x86 CPUs took 1,000 seconds. The results yielded a 90% reduction in cloud costs and allowed technicians to complete more service calls each day. NVIDIA cuOpt allows AT&T to run nearly continuous dispatch optimization software by combining NVIDIA RAPIDS with local search heuristics algorithms and metaheuristics such as Tabu search.\nPleasing Customers, Speeding Network Design\r\nAs part of its efforts to improve productivity for its more than 150,000 employees, AT&T is moving to adopt NVIDIA Omniverse ACE and NVIDIA Tokkio, cloud-native AI microservices, workflows and application frameworks for developers to easily build, customize and deploy interactive avatars that see, perceive, intelligently converse and provide recommendations to enhance the customer service experience.\nFor conversational AI, the carrier also uses the NVIDIA Riva software development kit and is examining other customer service and operations use cases for digital twins and generative AI.\nAT&T also is taking advantage of fast 5G and its fiber network to deliver NVIDIA GeForce NOW\u2122 cloud gaming at 120 frames per second on mobile and 240 FPS at home.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company\u2019s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling the creation of the metaverse. NVIDIA is now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industries.

The company is also publicly releasing the DLSS Frame Generation plug-in to further ease developer adoption of the technology.\n\u201cNeural graphics has revolutionized gaming since its introduction with NVIDIA DLSS, and we\u2019re now taking it to new heights,\u201d said Matt Wuebbling, vice president of global GeForce marketing at NVIDIA. \u201cPC gaming super-franchises such as Diablo and Forza Horizon and Bethesda\u2019s new Redfall are raising the bar for image quality with stunning graphics while using DLSS to keep gameplay smooth as silk.\u201d\nSince its launch in 2018, NVIDIA DLSS has driven a neural graphics revolution in PC gaming. Neural graphics intertwines AI and graphics to create an accelerated rendering pipeline that continuously learns and improves. Instead of natively rendering every pixel in a frame, DLSS allows the game to render 1/8th of the pixels then uses AI and GeForce RTX\u2122 Tensor Cores to reconstruct the rest of the pixels, dramatically multiplying frame rates, while delivering crisp, high-quality images that rival native resolution.\nDiablo IV, Forza Horizon 5, Redfall \u2014 DLSS 3 is in the Biggest Games and Biggest Franchises\r\nTo date, over 270 games and applications use NVIDIA DLSS as an AI-powered performance accelerator. DLSS 3, the latest version of the technology, is available in 28 released games and has been adopted 7x faster than DLSS 2 in the first six months of their respective launches.\nAmong the highly anticipated games being added to the DLSS roster is Forza Horizon 5, named the best open-world racing game of all time by several media outlets and currently holding the highest rating of any racing game tracked by OpenCritic. Forza Horizon 5, which already supports ray tracing, will update to DLSS 3 on March 28.\nRedfall, Bethesda\u2019s highly anticipated, open-world, co-op first-person shooter from Arkane Austin, the award-winning team behind Prey and Dishonored, is launching on May 2 with DLSS 3.\nIn addition, Diablo IV, the latest installment of the genre-defining Diablo franchise \u2014 multiple games of which are considered among the best of all time \u2014 will be launching on June 6 with DLSS 3.\n\u201cSupporting smooth gameplay in Diablo IV is a priority for Blizzard,\u201d said Michael Bukowski, Diablo IV technical director at Blizzard Entertainment. \u201cWe\u2019re excited by the high frame rate of Diablo IV running on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series hardware and DLSS 3.\u201d\nAdditional PC games announcing support of NVIDIA DLSS at GDC include Deceive Inc., Gripper, Smalland: Survive the Wilds and THE FINALS. View the complete list of 270 games and apps that support DLSS.\nDLSS Frame Generation Publicly Available for Developers at GDC\r\nNVIDIA will make DLSS Frame Generation plug-ins publicly available during GDC, allowing even more developers to integrate the framerate boosting technology into their games and applications.\nDLSS Frame Generation will be available to access via NVIDIA Streamline, an open-source, cross-vendor framework that simplifies the integration of super-resolution technologies in 3D games and apps.\nDLSS technology is always improving through ongoing training on NVIDIA\u2019s AI supercomputer. The public release will incorporate the latest DLSS enhancements made earlier this year, including:\n\nDLSS Frame Generation takes better advantage of game engine data, improving user interface stability and image quality during fast movement.\nDLSS Super Resolution improves Ultra Performance mode, with finer detail stability and overall better image quality.\nDLAA improves image quality, reduces ghosting and improves edge smoothness in high-contrast scenarios.\n\nUnreal Engine 5.2 Integration, Adding DLSS 3 to Unreal Engine Games Simpler Than Ever \r\nNVIDIA and Epic announced the integration of NVIDIA DLSS 3 into the popular Unreal Engine (UE) game engine. Unreal Engine is an open and advanced real-time 3D creation tool that gives game developers and creators the freedom and control to deliver cutting-edge real-time 3D content, interactive experiences and immersive virtual worlds. The DLSS 3 plug-in will debut in UE 5.2, making it simpler for any developer to accelerate the performance of their game or application.\n\u201cNVIDIA DLSS 3 introduces truly impressive frame generation technology and the Unreal Engine 5.2 plug-in will offer developers a great choice for increased quality and performance of their games,\u201d said Nick Penwarden, vice president of engineering at Epic Games.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company\u2019s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling the creation of the metaverse.

(AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today announced a multi-part collaboration focused on building out the world's most scalable, on-demand artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure optimized for training increasingly complex large language models (LLMs) and developing generative AI applications.\nThe joint work features next-generation Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) P5 instances powered by NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs and AWS\u2019s state-of-the-art networking and scalability that will deliver up to 20 exaFLOPS of compute performance for building and training the largest deep learning models. P5 instances will be the first GPU-based instance to take advantage of AWS\u2019s second-generation Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) networking, which provides 3,200 Gbps of low-latency, high bandwidth networking throughput, enabling customers to scale up to 20,000 H100 GPUs in EC2 UltraClusters for on-demand access to supercomputer-class performance for AI.\n\u201cAWS and NVIDIA have collaborated for more than 12 years to deliver large-scale, cost-effective GPU-based solutions on demand for various applications such as AI/ML, graphics, gaming, and HPC,\u201d said Adam Selipsky, CEO at AWS. \u201cAWS has unmatched experience delivering GPU-based instances that have pushed the scalability envelope with each successive generation, with many customers scaling machine learning training workloads to more than 10,000 GPUs today. With second-generation EFA, customers will be able to scale their P5 instances to over 20,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, bringing supercomputer capabilities on demand to customers ranging from startups to large enterprises.\u201d\n\u201cAccelerated computing and AI have arrived, and just in time. Accelerated computing provides step-function speed-ups while driving down cost and power as enterprises strive to do more with less. Generative AI has awakened companies to reimagine their products and business models and to be the disruptor and not the disrupted,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cAWS is a long-time partner and was the first cloud service provider to offer NVIDIA GPUs. We are thrilled to combine our expertise, scale, and reach to help customers harness accelerated computing and generative AI to engage the enormous opportunities ahead.\u201d\nNew Supercomputing Clusters\r\nNew P5 instances are built on more than a decade of collaboration between AWS and NVIDIA delivering the AI and HPC infrastructure and build on four previous collaborations across P2, P3, P3dn, and P4d(e) instances. P5 instances are the fifth generation of AWS offerings powered by NVIDIA GPUs and come almost 13 years after its initial deployment of NVIDIA GPUs, beginning with CG1 instances.\nP5 instances are ideal for training and running inference for increasingly complex LLMs and computer vision models behind the most-demanding and compute-intensive generative AI applications, including question answering, code generation, video and image generation, speech recognition, and more.\nSpecifically built for both enterprises and startups racing to bring AI-fueled innovation to market in a scalable and secure way, P5 instances feature eight NVIDIA H100 GPUs capable of 16 petaFLOPs of mixed-precision performance, 640 GB of high-bandwidth memory, and 3,200 Gbps networking connectivity (8x more than the previous generation) in a single EC2 instance. The increased performance of P5 instances accelerates the time-to-train machine learning (ML) models by up to 6x (reducing training time from days to hours), and the additional GPU memory helps customers train larger, more complex models. P5 instances are expected to lower the cost to train ML models by up to 40% over the previous generation, providing customers greater efficiency over less flexible cloud offerings or expensive on-premises systems.\nAmazon EC2 P5 instances are deployed in hyperscale clusters called EC2 UltraClusters that are comprised of the highest performance compute, networking, and storage in the cloud. Each EC2 UltraCluster is one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world, enabling customers to run their most complex multi-node ML training and distributed HPC workloads. They feature petabit-scale non-blocking networking, powered by AWS EFA, a network interface for Amazon EC2 instances that enables customers to run applications requiring high levels of inter-node communications at\u00a0 scale on AWS. EFA\u2019s custom-built operating system (OS) bypass hardware interface and integration with NVIDIA GPUDirect RDMA enhances the performance of inter-instance communications by lowering latency and increasing bandwidth utilization, which is critical to scaling training of deep learning models across hundreds of P5 nodes. With P5 instances and EFA, ML applications can use NVIDIA Collective Communications Library (NCCL) to scale up to 20,000 H100 GPUs. As a result, customers get the application performance of on-premises HPC clusters with the on-demand elasticity and flexibility of AWS. On top of these cutting-edge computing capabilities, customers can use the industry\u2019s broadest and deepest portfolio of services such as Amazon S3 for object storage, Amazon FSx for high-performance file systems, and Amazon SageMaker for building, training, and deploying deep learning applications. P5 instances will be available in the coming weeks in limited preview. To request access, visit https://pages.awscloud.com/EC2-P5-Interest.html.\nWith the new EC2 P5 instances, customers like Anthropic, Cohere, Hugging Face, Pinterest, and Stability AI will be able to build and train the largest ML models at scale. The collaboration through additional generations of EC2 instances will help startups, enterprises, and researchers seamlessly scale to meet their ML needs.\nAnthropic builds reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems that will have many opportunities to create value commercially and for public benefit. \u201cAt Anthropic, we are working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. While the large, general AI systems of today can have significant benefits, they can also be unpredictable, unreliable, and opaque. Our goal is to make progress on these issues and deploy systems that people find useful,\u201d said Tom Brown, co-founder of Anthropic. \u201cOur organization is one of the few in the world that is building foundational models in deep learning research. These models are highly complex, and to develop and train these cutting-edge models, we need to distribute them efficiently across large clusters of GPUs. We are using Amazon EC2 P4 instances extensively today, and we are excited about the upcoming launch of P5 instances. We expect them to deliver substantial price-performance benefits over P4d instances, and they\u2019ll be available at the massive scale required for building next-generation large language models and related products.\u201d\nCohere, a leading pioneer in language AI, empowers every developer and enterprise to build incredible products with world-leading natural language processing (NLP) technology while keeping their data private and secure. \u201cCohere leads the charge in helping every enterprise harness the power of language AI to explore, generate, search for, and act upon information in a natural and intuitive manner, deploying across multiple cloud platforms in the data environment that works best for each customer,\u201d said Aidan Gomez, CEO at Cohere. \u201cNVIDIA H100-powered Amazon EC2 P5 instances will unleash the ability of businesses to create, grow, and scale faster with its computing power combined with Cohere\u2019s state-of-the-art LLM and generative AI capabilities.\u201d\nHugging Face is on a mission to democratize good machine learning. \u201cAs the fastest growing open source community for machine learning, we now provide over 150,000 pre-trained models and 25,000 datasets on our platform for NLP, computer vision, biology, reinforcement learning, and more,\u201d said Julien Chaumond, CTO and co-founder at Hugging Face. \u201cWith significant advances in large language models and generative AI, we\u2019re working with AWS to build and contribute the open source models of tomorrow. We\u2019re looking forward to using Amazon EC2 P5 instances via Amazon SageMaker at scale in UltraClusters with EFA to accelerate the delivery of new foundation AI models for everyone.\u201d\nToday, more than 450 million people around the world use Pinterest as a visual inspiration platform to shop for products personalized to their taste, find ideas to do offline, and discover the most inspiring creators. \u201cWe use deep learning extensively across our platform for use-cases such as labeling and categorizing billions of photos that are uploaded to our platform, and visual search that provides our users the ability to go from inspiration to action,\" said David Chaiken, Chief Architect at Pinterest. \"We have built and deployed these use-cases by leveraging AWS GPU instances such as P3 and the latest P4d instances. We are looking forward to using Amazon EC2 P5 instances featuring H100 GPUs, EFA and Ultraclusters to accelerate our product development and bring new Empathetic AI-based experiences to our customers.\u201d\nAs the leader in multimodal, open-source AI model development and deployment, Stability AI collaborates with public- and private-sector partners to bring this next-generation infrastructure to a global audience. \u201cAt Stability AI, our goal is to maximize the accessibility of modern AI to inspire global creativity and innovation,\u201d said Emad Mostaque, CEO of Stability AI. \u201cWe initially partnered with AWS in 2021 to build Stable Diffusion, a latent text-to-image diffusion model, using Amazon EC2 P4d instances that we employed at scale to accelerate model training time from months to weeks. As we work on our next generation of open-source generative AI models and expand into new modalities, we are excited to use Amazon EC2 P5 instances in second-generation EC2 UltraClusters. We expect P5 instances will further improve our model training time by up to 4x, enabling us to deliver breakthrough AI more quickly and at a lower cost.\u201d\nNew Server Designs for Scalable, Efficient AI\r\nLeading up to the release of H100, NVIDIA and AWS engineering teams with expertise in thermal, electrical, and mechanical fields have collaborated to design servers to harness GPUs to deliver AI at scale, with a focus on energy efficiency in AWS infrastructure. GPUs are typically 20x more energy efficient than CPUs for certain AI workloads, with the H100 up to 300x more efficient for LLMs than CPUs.\nThe joint work has included developing a system thermal design, integrated security and system management, security with the AWS Nitro hardware accelerated hypervisor, and NVIDIA GPUDirect\u2122 optimizations for AWS custom-EFA network fabric.\nBuilding on AWS and NVIDIA\u2019s work focused on server optimization, the companies have begun collaborating on future server designs to increase the scaling efficiency with subsequent-generation system designs, cooling technologies, and network scalability.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company\u2019s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling the creation of the metaverse. NVIDIA is now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.

It enables researchers to fine-tune generative AI applications on their own proprietary data, and to run AI model inference directly in a web browser or through new cloud application programming interfaces (APIs) that easily integrate into existing applications.\n\u201cThe transformative power of generative AI holds enormous promise for the life science and pharmaceutical industries,\u201d said Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s long collaboration with pioneers in the field has led to the development of BioNeMo Cloud Service, which is already serving as an AI drug discovery laboratory. It provides pretrained models and allows customization of models with proprietary data that serve every stage of the drug-discovery pipeline, helping researchers identify the right target, design molecules and proteins, and predict their interactions in the body to develop the best drug candidate.\u201d\nAmgen Among Early Users\r\nAmgen, one of the world\u2019s leading biotechnology companies, is already using the service to advance its research and development efforts.\n\u201cBioNeMo is dramatically accelerating our approach to biologics discovery,\u201d said Peter Grandsard, executive director of Biologics Therapeutic Discovery, Center for Research Acceleration by Digital Innovation at Amgen. \u201cWith it, we can pretrain large language models for molecular biology on Amgen\u2019s proprietary data, enabling us to explore and develop therapeutic proteins for the next generation of medicine that will help patients.\u201d\nGenerative AI Supercharges Drug Discovery Pipeline \r\nBioNeMo Cloud service includes pretrained AI models to help researchers build AI pipelines for drug development. It has been adopted by drug-discovery companies including Evozyne and Insilico Medicine to support data-driven drug design for new therapeutic candidates.\nGenerative AI models can rapidly identify potential drug molecules \u2014 in some cases designing compounds or protein-based therapeutics from scratch. Trained on large-scale datasets of small molecules, proteins, DNA and RNA sequences, these models can predict the 3D structure of a protein and how well a molecule will dock with a target protein.\nNew Generative AI Models Available With BioNeMo Service Early Access\r\nBioNeMo now has six new optimized, open-source models, in addition to its previously announced MegaMolBART generative chemistry model, ESM1nv protein language model and OpenFold protein structure prediction model. They include:\n\nAlphaFold2:\u00a0A deep learning model that reduces the time it takes to determine a protein\u2019s structure from years to minutes or even seconds, just by using its amino acid sequence, developed by\u00a0DeepMind and already used by over a million researchers.\nDiffDock: To help researchers understand how a drug molecule will bind with a target protein, this model predicts the 3D orientation and docking interaction of small molecules with high accuracy and computational efficiency.\nESMFold: This protein structure prediction model, using Meta AI\u2019s ESM2 protein language model, can estimate the 3D structure of a protein based on a single amino acid sequence, without requiring examples of several similar sequences.\nESM2: This protein language model is used for inferring machine representations of proteins which are useful for downstream tasks such as protein structure prediction, property prediction and molecular docking.\nMoFlow: Used for molecular optimization and small molecule generation, this generative chemistry model creates molecules from scratch, coming up with diverse chemical structures for potential therapeutics.\nProtGPT-2: This language model generates novel protein sequences to help researchers design proteins with unique structures, properties and functions.\n\nThe BioNeMo Service makes these generative AI models easily accessible through a browser-based interface for interactive inference and protein structure visualization. And by pairing BioNeMo with the supercomputing resources in NVIDIA DGX\u2122 Cloud, researchers can customize their models on a fully managed software service using NVIDIA Base Command\u2122 Platform and the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite.\nPharma Companies, Startups Tap BioNeMo to Optimize AI Workflows\r\nPharmaceutical companies and drug discovery startups are using BioNeMo today and, in many cases, seeing significant results.\nAmgen pretrained and fine-tuned BioNeMo\u2019s ESM model architecture using its own proprietary data on antibodies. It was able to slash the time it takes to train five custom models for molecule screening and optimization from three months to a few weeks on DGX Cloud.\nResearchers at Evozyne, a Chicago-based biotechnology company and member of the NVIDIA Inception program for cutting-edge startups, have collaborated with NVIDIA to develop a BioNeMo-based deep learning model called the Protein Transformer Variational AutoEncoder. The generative AI model, fine-tuned on Evozyne\u2019s proprietary protein data, enables the design of synthetic variants with significantly improved performance compared to enzymes found in nature.\nInsilico Medicine, a premier member of NVIDIA Inception, is using BioNeMo to accelerate the early drug discovery process, which traditionally takes more than four years and costs around $500 million. Using generative AI from end to end, Insilico was able to identify a preclinical candidate drug in one-third of the time and for one-tenth of the cost. The drug is expected to soon enter phase 2 clinical trials with patients.\nSign up for early access to BioNeMo.\nDiscover the latest in AI and healthcare \u2014 including three sessions with speakers from Amgen, a session from Evozyne and another from DeepMind on AlphaFold \u2014 at GTC, running online through Thursday, March 23. Registration is free.\nWatch NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang discuss the BioNeMo Cloud service in his GTC keynote on demand.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company\u2019s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling the creation of the metaverse.

The service makes it possible for every enterprise to access its own AI supercomputer using a simple web browser, removing the complexity of acquiring, deploying and managing on-premises infrastructure.\nEnterprises rent DGX Cloud clusters on a monthly basis, which ensures they can quickly and easily scale the development of large, multi-node training workloads without having to wait for accelerated computing resources that are often in high demand.\n\u201cWe are at the iPhone moment of AI. Startups are racing to build disruptive products and business models, and incumbents are looking to respond,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cDGX Cloud gives customers instant access to NVIDIA AI supercomputing in global-scale clouds.\u201d\nNVIDIA is partnering with leading cloud service providers to host DGX Cloud infrastructure, starting with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Its OCI Supercluster provides a purpose-built RDMA network, bare-metal compute and high-performance local and block storage that can scale to superclusters of over 32,000 GPUs.\nMicrosoft Azure is expected to begin hosting DGX Cloud next quarter, and the service will soon expand to Google Cloud and more.\nIndustry Titans Adopt NVIDIA DGX Cloud to Speed Success\r\nAmgen, one of the world\u2019s leading biotechnology companies, insurance technology leader CCC Intelligent Solutions (CCC), and digital-business-platform provider ServiceNow are among the first AI pioneers using DGX Cloud.\nAmgen is using DGX Cloud with NVIDIA BioNeMo\u2122 large language model software to accelerate drug discovery, including NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, which includes NVIDIA RAPIDS\u2122 data science acceleration libraries.\n\u201cWith NVIDIA DGX Cloud and NVIDIA BioNeMo, our researchers are able to focus on deeper biology instead of having to deal with AI infrastructure and set up ML engineering,\u201d said Peter Grandsard, executive director of Research, Biologics Therapeutic Discovery, Center for Research Acceleration by Digital Innovation at Amgen. \u201cThe powerful computing and multi-node capabilities of DGX Cloud have enabled us to achieve 3x faster training of protein LLMs with BioNeMo and up to 100x faster post-training analysis with NVIDIA RAPIDS relative to alternative platforms.\u201d\nCCC, a leading cloud platform for the property and casualty insurance economy, is using DGX Cloud to speed and scale the development and training of its AI models. These models power the company\u2019s innovative auto claims resolution solutions, helping to accelerate the intelligent automation of the industry and improve the claims experience for millions of business users and their consumers every day.\nServiceNow is using DGX Cloud with on-premises NVIDIA DGX supercomputers for flexible, scalable hybrid-cloud AI supercomputing that helps power its AI research on large language models, code generation, and causal analysis. ServiceNow also co-stewards the BigCode project, a responsible open-science generative AI initiative, which is trained on the Megatron-LM framework from NVIDIA.\nOpen a Browser to NVIDIA AI Supercomputing and Software\r\nEnterprises manage and monitor DGX Cloud training workloads using NVIDIA Base Command\u2122 Platform software, which provides a seamless user experience across DGX Cloud, as well as on-premises NVIDIA DGX supercomputers. Using Base Command Platform, customers can match their workloads to the right amount and type of DGX infrastructure needed for each job.\nDGX Cloud includes NVIDIA AI Enterprise, the software layer of the NVIDIA AI platform, which provides end-to-end AI frameworks and pretrained models to accelerate data science pipelines and streamline the development and deployment of production AI. New pretrained models, optimized frameworks and accelerated data science software libraries, available in NVIDIA AI Enterprise 3.1 released today, give developers an additional jump-start to their AI projects.\nEach instance of DGX Cloud features eight NVIDIA H100 or A100 80GB Tensor Core GPUs for a total of 640GB of GPU memory per node. A high-performance, low-latency fabric built with NVIDIA Networking ensures workloads can scale across clusters of interconnected systems, allowing multiple instances to act as one massive GPU to meet the performance requirements of advanced AI training. High-performance storage is integrated into DGX Cloud to provide a complete solution for AI supercomputing.\nDGX Cloud features support from NVIDIA experts throughout the AI development pipeline. Customers can work directly with NVIDIA engineers to optimize their models and quickly resolve development challenges across a broad range of industry use cases.\nAvailability\r\nDGX Cloud instances start at $36,999 per instance per month. Organizations can contact their NVIDIA Partner Network representative for additional details.\nWatch Huang discuss NVIDIA DGX Cloud in his GTC keynote on demand, and tune in to the GTC panel with NVIDIA DGX Cloud pioneers.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

He announced new semiconductors and software libraries to enable fresh breakthroughs. And Huang revealed a complete set of systems and services for startups and enterprises racing to put these innovations to work on a global scale.\nHuang punctuated his talk with vivid examples of this ecosystem at work. He announced NVIDIA and Microsoft will connect hundreds of millions of Microsoft 365 and Azure users to a platform for building and operating hyperrealistic virtual worlds. He offered a peek at how Amazon is using sophisticated simulation capabilities to train new autonomous warehouse robots. He touched on the rise of a new generation of wildly popular generative AI services such as ChatGPT.\nAnd underscoring the foundational nature of NVIDIA\u2019s innovations, Huang detailed how, together with ASML, TSMC and Synopsis, NVIDIA computational lithography breakthroughs will help make a new generation of efficient, powerful 2-nm semiconductors possible.\nThe arrival of accelerated computing and AI come just in time, with Moore\u2019s Law slowing and industries tackling powerful dynamics \u2014sustainability, generative AI, and digitalization, Huang said. \u201cIndustrial companies are racing to digitalize and reinvent into software-driven tech companies \u2014 to be the disruptor and not the disrupted,\u201d Huang said.\nAcceleration lets companies meet these challenges. \u201cAcceleration is the best way to reclaim power and achieve sustainability and Net Zero,\u201d Huang said.\nGTC: The Premier AI Conference\nGTC, now in its 14th year, has become one of the world\u2019s most important AI gatherings. This week\u2019s conference features 650 talks from leaders such as Demis Hassabis of DeepMind, Valeri Taylor of Argonne Labs, Scott Belsky of Adobe, Paul Debevec of Netflix, Thomas Schulthess of ETH Zurich and a special fireside chat between Huang and Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT.\nMore than 250,000 registered attendees will dig into sessions on everything from restoring the lost Roman mosaics of 2,000 years ago to building the factories of the future, from exploring the universe with a new generation of massive telescopes to rearranging molecules to accelerate drug discovery, to more than 70 talks on generative AI.\nThe iPhone Moment of AI\nNVIDIA\u2019s technologies are fundamental to AI, with Huang recounting how NVIDIA was there at the very beginning of the generative AI revolution. Back in 2016 he hand-delivered to OpenAI the first NVIDIA DGX AI supercomputer \u2014 the engine behind the large language model breakthrough powering ChatGPT.\nLaunched late last year, ChatGPT went mainstream almost instantaneously, attracting over 100 million users, making it the fastest-growing application in history. \u201cWe are at the iPhone moment of AI,\u201d Huang said.\nNVIDIA DGX supercomputers, originally used as an AI research instrument, are now running 24/7 at businesses across the world to refine data and process AI, Huang reported.

This is owing to the many factors that have the potential to influence the stock\u2019s price, including demand for GPUs in gaming and data centers, advancements in AI and machine learning, and global economic conditions.\nThus, due to the multiple variables, Finbold posed the question to the AI tool ChatGPT and asked it to suggest a likely range for the price of NVDA stock by 2030. ChatGPT stated:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Picks for you\n  \n\n\n\n                  Here\u2019s why Bitcoin\u2019s pullback is a buy signal and not a bear market warning\n              \n1 hour ago\n\n\n\n                  Economist says the real Trump trade is ditching U.S. stocks for foreign markets\n              \n4 hours ago\n\n\n\n                  How Dogecoin could trigger next market crash, according to commodity strategist\n              \n7 hours ago\n\n\n\n                  Legal expert warns Ripple v.

By the end of 2030, NVDA is predicted to hit $1,195, a 426% increase from today to the year\u2019s end if the forecast is realized.\n2030 NVDA price prediction: Source: CoinPriceForecast\nNvidia has been assigned a recommendation of \u2018buy\u2019 by most analysts working on Wall Street. Significantly, 25 people have recommended a \u201cstrong buy,\u201d while just 4 people have recommended a \u2018buy.\u2019 Fourteen analysts had a \u2018hold\u2019 rating, and 2 with a \u2018strong sell\u2019 rating.\u00a0\nWall Street NVDA end-of-year price prediction: Source: TradingView\nThe average price projection for NVDA stock for the next 12 months is $247.07; this goal represents an 8.65% upside from its current price. It\u2019s interesting to note that the maximum price forecast for the next year is $350, representing a gain of 54.20% from the stock\u2019s current price of $226.\nIn recent years, Nvidia has experienced strong growth driven by the increasing demand for GPUs in gaming and data centers, as well as its investments in AI and machine learning technologies. The company has also expanded into new markets, such as autonomous vehicles and healthcare, which could support future growth.\nHowever, Nvidia also faces challenges, including increasing competition in its core markets, supply chain disruptions, and regulatory and legal risks. Investors should consider various factors before making any investment decisions involving Nvidia, especially with highly speculative future price ranges.\nBuy stocks now with Interactive Brokers \u2013 the most advanced investment platform\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Sandy Pramuji   \u00b7 Contributor  8 March 2023 2 min read            The Signboard of Central Provident Fund at CPF building.  \u00b7 catchlights_sg via Getty Images SINGAPORE \u2013 The Central Provident Fund (CPF) accounts of those who are not Singapore citizens or permanent residents will be closed from April 2024, the CPF Board said on Wednesday (8 March). The purpose of the system, CPF Board said, is to help Singapore citizens (SC) and Permanent Residents (PR) to retire with peace of mind. \"In line with this, CPF members who are not SC or PR will have to close their CPF accounts,\" CPF said.

Since 1987, changes have been progressively introduced to focus the CPF system on helping citizens and PRs meet their needs. Foreigners in Singapore have not been allowed to contribute to CPF since 2003, but according to CPF Board data, currently there around 300,000 non-citizens and non-PRs who still have CPF accounts. They include non-citizens and PRs who had received contributions from employers or made voluntary contributions before 2003, as well as former citizens and PRs who have since relinquished their citizenship or permanent residency. Most of these accounts have low CPF balances with more than two-thirds of them having less than S$5,000 in their CPF account.  \"The automatic closure of CPF accounts for all non-SC/PR in 2024 is the final step in ensuring that the CPF system focuses on its core objective of catering to the retirement, housing and healthcare needs of SC and PR,\" said the CPF Board. When such non-citizen or non-PR members close their CPF accounts, their participation in CPF schemes will cease and they will be asked to transfer their CPF savings to personal bank accounts. These account holders have up to 31 March 2024 to close their CPF accounts, failing which these accounts will be automatically closed.

Picture taken April 30, 2018. (REUTERS/Thomas White)  \u00b7 Thomas White / reuters By Bloomberg News (Bloomberg) \u2014 Issues with Singapore\u2019s immigration systems are causing delays at Changi airport and land crossings just before the start of the weekend, with travelers being told to delay non-essential travel. Off-duty immigration officers are being called in to manually process departing passengers at Changi with all the automated lanes affected, the border authority said. So far there haven\u2019t been any flight cancellations, according to data from Flightradar24.com.  Rated the world\u2019s top airport for the 12th time by Skytrax earlier this month, Changi handled 68.3 million passengers in 2019, before the Covid pandemic decimated the global travel industry. Known for its indoor waterfall, butterfly garden and plethora of shopping outlets, Changi has also embraced automation to handle the large volume of passengers passing through the Southeast Asian hub. \u201cAn immigration system disruption has affected the auto-lanes for departing and arriving passengers across the terminals,\u201d Changi Airport officials said in a tweet, and advised fliers to arrive earlier for their flights. \u201cPassengers should expect delays and approach our ground staff if assistance is needed.\u201d A representative for Singapore Airlines said flights are currently operating as scheduled. Live images from a government website showed dozens of cars lined up on Singapore\u2019s Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints on its land border with Malaysia, although that\u2019s not unusual. The system slowness added to wait times at the land checkpoints which can see as many as 400,000 commuters each day to get to work as well as deliver produce across the Singapore-Malaysia causeway. Traffic tends to be heavier on Fridays as workers return home for the weekend.

The incoming ship, which will port for at least five years starting 2025, is Disney's first to be based in Asia. In a press release, Disney and STB said that the collaboration is also expected to bring \"significant spillover benefits for the wider economy\" that include more demand for port and ship-related services, as well as on-ground spending in Singapore for the lifestyle and hospitality sectors.  \u201cThe new Disney cruise ship will be an attraction itself and is expected to boost the tourism sector in Singapore for many years to come,\u201d said Keith Tan, STB's chief executive. Having a passenger capacity of approximately 6,000, and staffed by 2,300 crew members, Disney Cruise Line said green methanol, a lower carbon-emitting fuel, will fuel the ship. The new ship is said to feature innovative Disney experiences along with entertainment and world-class dining.

However, the focus has shifted to the banking sector because of multiple major banking failures in March sending throughout the financial world.\nThe turn of events could be a silver lining for growth stocks, as analysts predict a more dovish stance from the Federal Reserve. Moreover, many growth stocks offer comparable value to defensive stocks. Some companies are trading at just a few times earnings due to margin compression and lackluster year-over-year results compared to 2021. But as the business climate eventually pivots towards a conducive environment, and companies no longer have to compete against tough comparable metrics, there\u2019s potential for significant upside.\nKeeping this in mind, let\u2019s dive into seven growth stocks poised to boom, offering savvy investors a chance to seize long-term opportunities.\n\n\n\n\nV\nVisa\n$222.41\n\n\nADBE\nAdobe\n$380.64\n\n\nDDOG\nDatadog\n$68.06\n\n\nSQM\nSociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile\n$81.13\n\n\nFVRR\nFiverr\n$33.40\n\n\nTSM\nTaiwan Semiconductor\n$92.46\n\n\nNVDA\nNvidia\n$273.08\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisa (V)\nSource: Tendo / Shutterstock\nVisa\u00a0(NYSE:V)\u00a0is a dominant credit card player with a leadership position in financial transactions. It boasts a rock-solid business, marked by over 50% net income margins in the past five years on average.\nThe firm saw a healthy transaction bump during the pandemic, with people opting for touch-free payment and eCommerce solutions. However, the one door closing, the other opened for Visa in the form of resurgent travel and tourism. The robust profit margins on cross-border payments helped the firm to post incredible top and bottom-line growth in the past few quarters.\nThough growth rates are expected to normalize, forward estimates are at an eye-catching 14.2%, more than 30% higher than its 5-year averages. Moreover, according to analysts at Tipranks, V stock is trading at an 18% discount to its intrinsic value.\n\nAdobe (ADBE)\nSource: Khakimullin Aleksandr / Shutterstock\nAdobe\u00a0(NASDAQ:ADBE)\u00a0has established itself as a juggernaut in the graphics space with industry-leading software tools, including Premiere Pro and PhotoShop. Its software stack is virtually irreplaceable in fields like graphic design, video editing, marketing, and others.\u00a0In recent years, the firm has widened its moat by buying other pieces of software to build its content cloud for creative professionals. Last year, creative cloud subscribers grew by nearly 30 million, a run rate of one million subscriptions per quarter.\nAdditionally, Adobe is looking to cash in on the artificial intelligence (AI) trend, having released a Beta version of its art generator called Firefly. The editing software allows content creators to effectively improve their photos and videos using the help of AI. With the proliferation of AI, the tool could prove to be another money-spinner down the line.\n\nDatadog (DDOG)\nSource: MEE KO DONG / Shutterstock\nDatadog\u00a0(NASDAQ:DDOG)\u00a0offers cloud monitoring and security features via a software-as-a-service model. In contrast to other solutions, Datadog\u2019s clients can effectively monitor and secure their digital infrastructure from a single location. Having these functions in place significantly reduces blind spots and vulnerabilities.\nThe firm has been one of the most talked-about success stories in its niche, growing its revenues from $101 million in 2017 to a whopping $1.7 billion in 2022. Moreover, analysts expect the firm to continue growing by over 30% for the foreseeable future. Though it continues to invest heavily in its business each year, the scale at which its growing points to a break-even scenario in the not-so-distant future.\nThe stock market rout last year saw DDOG stock losing over 50% of its value. It trades at around 13 times trailing-twelve-month sales, roughly 64% lower than its 5-year average.\n\nSociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM)\nSource: Shutterstock\nSociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile\u00a0(NYSE:SQM)\u00a0is a specialty chemical giant establishing itself as the world\u2019s leading lithium producer. That\u2019s reflected in its recent results, which show triple-digit growth in lithium sales. \nAcross virtually every metric, SQM offers robust value. Its A-graded profitability profile is a sight to behold, more so in the past year, with double-digit growth over historical metrics. Its earnings per share grew by a whopping 585% last year, with a 730% bump in free cash flows. Based on higher sales volumes and average prices, expect SQM stock to continue performing remarkably well over the long run.\nHaving said that, SQM stock trades at just 2.3 times forward sales estimates, a 50% discount to its 5-year average. Therefore, investing in this growth stock seems like a no-brainer.\n\nFiverr International (FVRR)\nSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.com\nFiverr International\u00a0(NYSE:FVRR) is a popular online freelancer marketplace that has taken off in line with the burgeoning gig economy. Its top-line growth has averaged more than 50% over the past five years, an incredible feat, to say the least. However, it\u2019s only scratching the surface with its $337 million revenue base, considering how the worldwide freelancer marketplace is expected to reach $18.3 billion by 2031.\nFiverr boasts a highly sticky user base that continues to deliver double-digit revenue growth for the business in the current economic climate. During the fourth quarter, spending-per-buyer reached $262, compared to $242 last year. As we advance, it remains in an excellent position to continue tapping into powerful workplace trends. Its stock dipped over 50% last year, and investing at current levels is mighty attractive.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM)\nSource: Shutterstock\nTaiwan Semiconductor\u00a0(NYSE:TSM) is a bellwether in the semiconductor space, generating multi-bagger returns for its investors over the past decade. Bloomberg Intelligence data shows that TSM has over 57% market share in the semiconductor market, head, and shoulders above its competition.\nTSM saw record growth in its top line due to a robust chip pricing environment last year. Revenue growth is over 42.6% on a year-over-year basis, almost 170% higher than its five-year average.\u00a0However, it expects revenues to slow down in the first half of the year due to the softness in the market. It should pick up the pace again in the second half of 2023, though, because of a strong recovery in the semiconductor market. Analysts expect the firm to generate 20%+ growth in 2024, following a relatively anemic 2023.\n\nNvidia\u00a0(NVDA)\nSource: REDPIXEL.PL / Shutterstock.com\nTech powerhouse Nvidia\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is arguably the pick of the growth stocks to buy. The California-based GPU giant never ceases to amaze in having its finger on the pulse of virtually every popular tech trend over the past several years.

Based in the UK, the exchange holds crypto licenses in various European countries, Canada, and the United States, making it available to customers worldwide. The exchange supports USD as fiat currency to buy crypto from all over world.\nShiba Inu Progress\nShiba Inu is making progress in gaining more mainstream acceptance through partnerships and new initiatives. One of the most recent developments is the collaboration between KillerPay and SmartTab, allowing customers to use Shiba Inu and other cryptocurrencies to pay at various nightlife merchants in San Francisco.\nAdditionally, Binance has collaborated with CityPay.io, a prominent crypto payment gateway based in Georgia, to enable Shiba Inu holders to purchase at Wendy\u2019s and over 600 other vendors in Georgia.- Advertisement -\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Shiba Inu team is working on the launch of Shibarium Beta, which aims to provide fast and low-cost transactions to users worldwide, further increasing the token\u2019s utility. However, in a recent Twitter thread, Shiba Inu\u2019s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, hinted that he would no longer follow potential Shibarium projects on Twitter. He emphasized that some influencers promoting different projects on Shibariium do not necessarily reflect that the SHIB team is behind those projects. He urged community members to conduct their research before investing in any project.\nDisClamier: This content is informational and should not be considered financial advice.

Lime is a 91.65% subsidiary of Rex that was established in 2012 in Oslo. It was pre-qualified as a partner company in February 2013. The organisation deals with oil and gas exploration both from Norway and internationally. Lars H\u00fcbert, chief executive officer of Lime, says: \u201cThe pre-qualification as operator marks an important milestone for Lime, as it is a confirmation that Lime has built a competent organisation for all major functional areas. We have grown from strength to strength over the years, from a pure oil and gas exploration company with partner status, to one with production assets, and now with operator pre-qualification. We aim to expand on this trust and will continue to build a stronger presence on the NCS, actively seeking new opportunities to enhance our asset portfolio. Lime now also looks forward to using this operator status for further value creation.\u201d Shares in Rex International closed 0.3 cents higher, or 2.05% up, at 15 cents on March 30.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Motley Fool's 5 High Growth Stock Picks.\u00a0 According to JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists, the significant outperformance of cheaper, value stocks over growth stocks from the previous year is expected to reverse soon as the pace of economic recovery slows down. The value trade, which was a popular investment strategy in 2022, is beginning to lose its appeal. As a result, JPMorgan\u2019s team led by Mislav Matejka suggested that investors may need to consider reducing their exposure to value stocks compared to growth stocks in the next one or two months. They recommend going \"outright underweight value versus growth,\" as stated in a note. Mislav Matejka further wrote in a note:\u00a0 \u201cOur core view is that in the second half, market will be moving back to the recession trade, but even if the opposite scenario gains traction, value might not be the best place to be.\u201d  After significantly outperforming growth stocks last year by the largest margin since the dotcom bubble in 2000, the performance of value stocks has begun to slow down in comparison. Although value stocks received a boost from rising bond yields and inflation, investors are becoming more cautious due to concerns about a potential hawkish policy. This may lead to a decrease in support for the value trade as bond yields reach their peak. The current pace of economic activity is likely to reach its peak and could start to decline soon. Additionally, the stall in inflation expectations implies that the value factor may not perform as well relative to growth in the future.  Motley Fool Asset Management prioritizes investing in high-quality companies with strong growth potential.

The list is ranked according to the revenue growth rate, from lowest to highest. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around the securities as of Q4 2022, which was assessed from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of holdings of 943 elite funds.\u00a0   Story Continues   Motley Fool's High Growth Stock Picks  Motley Fool's High Growth Stock Picks10. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)3-year Revenue Growth: 45.3%Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is an American multinational financial technology firm. Securities filings for the fourth quarter of 2022 reveal that Motley Fool Asset Management owned 96,997 shares of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) worth $33.7 million, representing 3.80% of the total 13F portfolio.\u00a0On February 14, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) declared a $0.57 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on May 9, to shareholders of record on April 7.\u00a0Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev on January 30 raised the firm's price target on Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) to $405 from $380 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares following the \"solid\" Q4 results.According to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 139 hedge funds were long Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), compared to 146 funds in the prior quarter. Charles Akre\u2019s Akre Capital Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 5.86 million shares worth $2 billion.\u00a0Like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is one of the top high growth stock picks of Motley Fool.\u00a0Baron FinTech Fund made the following comment about Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:\u201cShares of global payment network Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) increased after reporting strong quarterly results, with 15% revenue growth and 13% EPS growth despite significant headwinds from currency movements and the suspension of operations in Russia. Payment volume grew 21% in local currency (excluding Russia) as consumer spending remained resilient and the international travel recovery continued as border restrictions were lifted. We continue to own the stock due to Mastercard\u2019s long runway for growth and significant competitive advantages.\u201d 9. Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY)3-year Revenue Growth: 51.8%Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY) provides cloud-based human capital management and payroll software solutions in the United States. In Q4 2022, Motley Fool reported owning 48,442 shares of Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY) worth $9.4 million. It is one of the firm\u2019s top high growth stock picks.\u00a0On February 2, Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY) reported a Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $1.12, beating market estimates by $0.38. Revenue for the period increased 39.3% year-over-year to $273 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $13.32 million.\u00a0Bryan Bergin, an analyst at Cowen, increased the price target for Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY) on February 3 from $231 to $265 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares. According to the analyst, Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY)\u2019s momentum continued in the second quarter, with the company surpassing its guidance by a significant margin and providing strong guidance for 2023, which includes impressive profitability despite investments in growth.According to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 33 hedge funds were long Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY), compared to 32 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company.\u00a0ClearBridge Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:\u201cPaylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY) also held up well against broad customer spending slowdowns earlier in the year but saw its share price weaken on broader macro headwinds during the quarter. The company\u2019s cloud-based human capital management and payroll software solutions help businesses manage through broad labor shortages and provide solutions to retain talent. However, as excess slack in the labor market has begun to be absorbed, investments in human resources solutions have declined. Additionally, we believe Paylocity continues to have a compelling long-term growth runway as it attracts new customers and gains market share against large, mature competitors.\u201d 8. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)3-year Revenue Growth: 54.9%Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a California-based customer relationship management technology firm. It is one of Motley Fool\u2019s top high growth stock picks. The hedge fund raised its stake in Salesforce, Inc.

(NYSE:CRM) to $185 from $172 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares ahead of its earnings. According to the analyst's research note, continued strong margins may be a significant factor in driving the stock higher as growth stabilizes at a high-single-digit rate.

(NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\u201cWe sold Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to reduce our weighting in the Information Technology sector. Salesforce held their investor day, and the company reiterated their organic Fiscal Year 2026 revenue target of $50 billion. This target remains more back-end loaded based on current slowing macroeconomic conditions and requires new annual contract growth well ahead of what the company has been averaging for the past few years. We are skeptical that the company will be able to achieve this revenue target organically and see Merger & Acquisitions (M&A) being key to achieving the growth. While we believe Salesforce has shown good success in growing its non-CRM clouds, we do see more competitive pressures emerging for the Marketing and Customer Service Clouds, specifically on the pricing side during a global economic slowdown.\u201d 7. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)3-year Revenue Growth: 55.0%Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the top high growth stocks in Motley Fool Asset Management\u2019s Q4 portfolio. The hedge fund owns 448,001 shares of the tech giant, worth nearly $40 million and representing 4.48% of the total 13F securities. The average 3-year revenue growth for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) between 2020 and 2022 came in at 55%.\u00a0On February 9, Wells Fargo analyst Brian Fitzgerald noted that the Bard rollout has been disappointing. However, there is an opportunity for investment in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) due to the excitement around Generation Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI), which has potential for deployment without disrupting search monetization. Additionally, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a leader in conversational AI technology and there is a misunderstanding of what drives search share. As a result, the firm recommends purchasing Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares, assigning the stock an Overweight rating and a target price of $150.According to Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 data, 152 hedge funds were bullish on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), compared to 156 funds in the prior quarter. Chris Hohn\u2019s TCI Fund Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 54.5 million shares worth $4.8 billion.\u00a0Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:\u201cOther bottom contributors included media and technology giant Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), apparel and footwear company V.F. Corporation and utility operator Dominion Energy. We believe Alphabet\u2019s shares underperformed on concerns of a weakening macroeconomic environment. The company also reported weaker-than-expected earnings and revenue for Q3 2022. Longer-term, we expect Alphabet\u2019s search engine advertising, YouTube advertising and other initiatives to continue driving revenue growth. As such, we used the share price weakness this quarter to add to our position.\u201d 6. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)3-year Revenue Growth: 61.7%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a California-based provider of graphics, semiconductors, and networking solutions in the United States, Taiwan, China, and internationally. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Motley Fool held 54,758 shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) worth $8 million, representing 0.9% of the total securities. It is one of the premier high growth stock picks of the hedge fund.\u00a0During Nvidia's fourth-quarter earnings report, CEO Jensen Huang openly expressed his belief in the significant role that artificial intelligence will play in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s future. Huang stated that the AI market has reached a turning point and that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is currently the main operating system for AI systems.On February 23, C.J. Muse, an analyst at Evercore ISI, increased the price target on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) from $245 to $300 while maintaining an Outperform rating on the shares. This decision comes after NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) beat expectations for the January quarter and provided an even more positive outlook for the April quarter. The firm expects data center revenues to accelerate throughout the entirety of 2023, which should be positively received given concerns about decelerating data center demand and the potential for a total revenue guide down for April, the analyst wrote in a research note.\u00a0According to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 106 hedge funds were long NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), compared to 89 funds in the earlier quarter.\u00a0Like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Motley Fool\u2019s high growth stock picks include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\u00a0O\u2019keefe Stevens Advisory made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:\u201cThe market and our portfolios had a challenging year as interest rates rose, and deteriorating fundamentals cut our largest position, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), in half. Since our initial purchase in 2013, NVDA has seen its stock decline 50% one other time, back in 2018. The best-performing businesses and stocks do not go up and to the right. Mr. Market gets moody, and even one of the highest quality companies in the world is not immune. Drawdowns of this magnitude are challenging to stomach, even though the stock is up 50x in less than ten years. While we consider ourselves old school value investors, we continue to hold this fantastic company even though, optically, it does not appear cheap. Our confidence in Jensen remains, and while gaming is no longer in hyper-growth mode, the Data Center segment continues to grow. AI, Automotive, and other small but rapidly growing industries are the next leg of the story. Chris Mayer discusses the position in greater detail with commentary from our CIO, Peter O\u2019Keefe.

As a result, Cathie Wood\u2019s back in the limelight. Taking a back seat to the bear market last year, Wood\u2019s Ark Invest\u00a0has been subjected to much scrutiny for its high-risk, high-reward investing style. But with investors ready to get speculative once again, they\u2019re heeding Wood\u2019s keen analysis on tech once again. Like most investors in recent weeks, Ark and Wood are descending heavily on the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. Wood\u2019s choice in AI stocks could certainly be some of the top performers when all is said and done.\nAI has blown the doors off of the tech industry. Of course, it has been around for a long time now \u2014 decades, in fact. But in the latter half of 2022, AI caught fire similarly to the blockchain explosion in early 2021. This hype comes thanks to the stock market seeing slight recovery from last year\u2019s downturn, making room for excitement in new speculative investment. The excitement is in turn charging up AI stocks with millions of dollars in new money.\nWood\u2019s Ark Invest recently published its 2023 edition of its Big Ideas report. AI played no small part of this year\u2019s report, naturally. Ark argues on behalf of AI\u2019s seemingly endless use-cases. And, the decreasing costs to train AI models as evidence that the industry will continue to thrive in the coming years. And of the many tech stocks lining Wood\u2019s balance sheet, there are five which investors would do well to keep aware of:\n\n\nC3.ai\u00a0(NYSE:AI)\nUiPath\u00a0(NYSE:PATH)\nExact Sciences\u00a0(NASDAQ:EXAS)\nUpstart\u00a0(NASDAQ:UPST)\nTesla\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\n\nThe AI Stocks Cathie Wood Thinks Will Lead 2023\nCathie Wood\u2019s top AI stocks for the rest of the year are both a bit expected and surprising. It\u2019s perhaps the stock Wood is\u00a0not\u00a0betting on that\u2019s most surprising \u2014\u00a0Nvidia\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA). Indeed, Ark Invest has been slowly but surely offloading its NVDA shares, and collecting quite the bag along the way with an impressive return-on-investment. Given NVDA\u2019s spotlight in the AI space right now, the move comes as unorthodox. But, there are plenty of others receiving a more bullish treatment by the firm.\nAs\u00a0InvestorPlace\u2019s\u00a0Muslim Farooque points out, Ark holds significant amounts of stock in companies C3.ai, Upstart and UiPath. These are some of the most obvious of AI picks on the market. C3.ai\u2019s AI stock remains one of Wall Street\u2019s flagship AI players, offering software-as-a-service (SaaS) to companies who want to employ AI tech at scale for any number of reasons.\nC3.ai counts among its clients the likes of oil companies, the U.S. military and multiple defense contractors, giving the company plenty of credibility around its model. UiPath works to similar ends, creating software for clients meant to help streamline various processes. Though, it works specifically in the niche of automating manual tasks with robotics.\nThese are very broad and promising businesses. But, Ark has also honed in on several companies with more specific goals in mind. Take, Upstart and its UPST stock, for example. The corporation uses AI technology in the field of credit assessment, automating the process of evaluating customers\u2019 creditworthiness. Or, take Exact Sciences \u2014 a company which Wood\u2019s firm has recently deepened its holding in.

But instead of AI, I decided to \u201cask\u201d investment resource Gurufocus.com what it believes to be the most resilient enterprise. Fortunately, the platform features a stock filter called \u201cProbability of Financial Distress (%).\u201d Naturally, I entered t the lowest range possible: 0% to 5% risk of distress. If this platform is worth anything, it should capture at least some of the best stocks to buy now.\u00a0Further, I entered no other filter aside from not including over-the-counter securities, trusts, and master limited partnerships (MLPs). Other than that, what you see is what you get. Below are the best stocks to buy for a sideways (or even declining) market.  AAPLApple$155.00 MSFTMicrosoft$279.43 GOOG GOOGLAlphabet$102.46 AMZNAmazon$98.95 BRK-BBerkshire Hathaway$293.51 NVDANvidia$257.25 TSLATesla$180.13  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Apple (AAPL)   Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.   Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com Unless you\u2019ve frozen yourself for later resuscitation, you\u2019re familiar with consumer technology giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). While the discretionary space typically isn\u2019t the arena to look for the best stocks to buy during a downturn, Gurufocus.com disagrees. Based on its distress probability indicator, Apple represents the public enterprise least likely to fail.\u00a0Financially, it\u2019s difficult to argue with the platform. Sure, it\u2019s not the discounted deal it once was. Presently, the market price of AAPL is at a forward multiple of 26.32. As a premium to earnings, Apple ranks worse than 84.26% of the competition.  That said, it delivers the goods operationally. For example, the company\u2019s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 20%, above 85.09% of the competition. Also, its free cash flow (FCF) growth rate during the same period is 29.2%.\u00a0Finally, Wall Street analysts support AAPL, pegging it a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target stands at $170.40, implying over 9% upside potential. Microsoft (MSFT)   The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.   Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com An all-around solid enterprise, I\u2019m not shocked at all to see Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) rank so highly for best stocks to buy. Sure, it\u2019s a tech company and the underlying sector doesn\u2019t always offer the greatest magnitude of safety. However, Microsoft has become so ingrained in everything that we do professionally and personally that it\u2019s a prudent choice.   Story Continues Financially, it\u2019s also difficult to argue with MSFT as one of the best stocks to buy during troubled circumstances. Sure, it\u2019s not a great deal anymore on an objective basis. For example, the market prices MSFT at a forward multiple of 25.52, which ranks a bit better than average.However, the company comes alive operationally.\u00a0Notably, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 17.4%, ranking above 71.36% of its peers. Its FCF growth rate during the same period comes in at 20.5%, beating out 62% of the industry. Also, Microsoft\u2019s a profitability machine, commanding a net margin of 33%.\u00a0Lastly, covering analysts peg MSFT as a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target stands at $292.07, implying nearly 6% upside potential.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)  Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.  Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comOnce a domineering presence in the charts, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) suffered some humbling recently. True, the Class C GOOG stock gained nearly 13% so far this year. However, in the past 365 days, GOOG gave up 25% of its equity value. Nevertheless, the underlying fundamentals of digitalized innovations may be too compelling to ignore.\u00a0Further, the financials provide more than enough justification for Alphabet\u2019s ranking among the best stocks to buy. Operationally, the tech giant features a three-year revenue growth rate of 22.9%, outpacing 74.35% of its peers. Further, its FCF growth rate during the same period pings at 27.2%, above 69.61% of the industry.In addition, its operating and net margins come in at 26.46% and 21.2%. Both stats rate among the industry\u2019s upper half. To boot, the company\u2019s Altman Z-Score is 9.11, indicating very low bankruptcy risk.\u00a0Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg GOOG as a unanimous strong buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $123.78, implying over 22% upside potential.Amazon (AMZN)  Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock  Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comSynonymous with the mercurial growth in the e-commerce space, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is frequently ranked among the best stocks to buy. However, since the fallout that began in late 2021/early 2022, AMZN ate some humble pie. Yes, shares gained almost 17% of equity value since the Jan. opener. However, in the trailing year, they\u2019re down more than 36%.Nevertheless, Gurufocus.com has confidence that AMZN will turn out to be one of the best stocks to buy. It\u2019s a system oddity because the platform also considers AMZN to be a possible value trap. Besides that, Amazon\u2019s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 21.9%, boxing out 84.24% of the competition. Also, its book growth rate during the same period is 31.8%, above 87.54% of sector rivals.\u00a0If there\u2019s one major knock against AMZN at the moment, it\u2019s the valuation. At a forward multiple of 60.11, it\u2019s a pricey affair.Still, covering analysts love AMZN, pegging it a consensus strong buy. Additionally, they anticipate shares hitting $136.86, implying nearly 37% upside potential.Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)  The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.  Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comI believe it\u2019s my InvestorPlace colleague Dana Blankenhorn that remarked something to the effect of if you\u2019re facing unknown circumstances, it\u2019s wise to place your bets across a wide canvas. That way, at least one of your wagers should rise higher. Fundamentally, that could be the selling point of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B). The industrial conglomerate under legendary investor Warren Buffett bets on practically everything viable. Thus, it\u2019s difficult to lose.As one of the most popular investments, I\u2019m not shocked in the slightest that Gurufocus.com identified it as a candidate for best stocks to buy. To be fair, Berkshire doesn\u2019t feature the runaway financial metrics that some of the star enterprise competitors do. However, it does hold its own on certain metrics, such as a three-year book growth rate of 7.4% outpacing 62.58% of the competition.\u00a0Primarily, I believe Berkshire got onto this list because of the proven wisdom and guidance of Warren Buffett. Few other investors can claim this man\u2019s extraordinary breadth of knowledge.As well, analysts peg BRK.B as a moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $353, implying nearly 17% upside potential.Nvidia (NVDA)  Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green trees  Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comFor the last two ideas for best stocks to buy, we have some controversial ideas, beginning with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Fundamentally, I can appreciate Nvidia\u2019s myriad strengths. Of course, most folks are familiar with the company\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming industry. Over the years, however, Nvidia also invested heavily in relevant segments such as AI and machine learning.Still, it\u2019s a controversial idea for the best stocks to buy because again, tech firms tend to be cyclical. Plus, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be one of my top choices for investors seeking stability. That said, Nvidia offers attractive financial metrics. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 34.5%, soaring above most of the competition. Also, its book growth rate during the same period came out to 21.6%, a robust figure.\u00a0In addition, the enterprise features a profitable framework. For example, its net margin is 16.19%, ranked better than 67% of semiconductor companies.Looking to the Street, covering analysts peg NVDA as a consensus moderate buy. However, their average price target is $257.88, implying only 1% upside potential.Tesla (TSLA)  Interior of the Tesla Model 3  Source: Khairil Azhar Junos/Shutterstock.comTo be honest, the inclusion of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as one of the best stocks to buy at this juncture surprised me. While Tesla represents the king of electric vehicles \u2013 and may hold onto this status for years to come \u2013 the segment also aligns with the consumer economy. Unfortunately, consumers just aren\u2019t feeling much motivation to buy pricey EVs, especially with the banking sector\u2019s fallout.Still, the operational stats may attract contrarian investors. For instance, Tesla\u2019s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 36.4%, which is simply monstrous. Its FCF growth rate during the same period came out to 81.4%, also a ridiculously high figure. In terms of profitability, the company\u2019s net margin is 15.45%, outpacing nearly 94% of its rivals.\u00a0If that wasn\u2019t enough, the EV maker also enjoys a stout balance sheet. Along with a cash-rich account, Tesla\u2019s Altman Z-Score hits 11.38, indicating extremely low bankruptcy risk.Finally, analysts peg TSLA as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $212.89, implying nearly 16% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

I mean that if/when we blow up The People\u2019s \u201cportfolios\u201d for the 2nd time in these #BubbleCaps, they may not come back to pay you to invest their hard earned money for another decade.\nYou know that happened post the Dot Bomb Bubble imploding, right? #NotGood.\nThose of you who not only survived the 2000-2002 period in the US stock market, but made money like I did (it\u2019s ok to say that, it\u2019s a track record and credentials thing), will recall the cadence to start 2001:\u00a0\n\n\u201cNASDAQ best JAN ever\u201d at +10% plus in January 2001\nThen the quick correction\nThen the echo ramp into March \u2026\n\nThen companies had to report Q1 and Q2 of 2001 reality.\u00a0\nIn other words, crowding into the prior #BubbleCaps that blew you up in either 2000 or 2022 isn\u2019t a new thing (it\u2019s ok to say that too, it\u2019s a Cycle Thing). For many in both eras, all they know is buying those things.\nOne can make the same argument for most of \u201cCrypto\u201d imploding again in FEB/MAR but Bitcoin ramping. Just like selling the > 1000 stocks in the Russell right now (which just closed at a YTD low), if you can\u2019t be long anything, just buy 1 thing?\nBut I won\u2019t go there this morning as one of their Storytelling Prophets, Do Kwon, is being charged with #CryptoFraud.\nInstead, let\u2019s go right back to the wood and do what I\u2019ll call Molten N-Squared MAGMA:\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) has $2.1 TRILLION in #BubbleCap and @Hedgeye TREND resistance at $191\nAmazon (AMZN) just got back to $1.0 TRILLION in #BubbleCap and TREND resistance at $131\nGoogle (GOOGL) ramped back to $1.4 TRILLION in #BubbleCap and TREND resistance at $114\nMeta (META) is a pipsqueak with only $530 BILLION in cap and is Bullish TREND (support = $165)\nApple (AAPL) is a nichy new idea with $2.5 TRILLION in #BubbleCap and Bullish TREND support = $152\nNVDA has the revived StorytellingCap of $671 BILLION after breaking out above TREND of $239\nNetflix (NFLX) is the half-pint cap at only $143 BILLION with @Hedgeye TREND resistance of $352\n\nIn summary, N-Squared (NVDA + NFLX) + MAGMA = $8.3 TRILLION in #BubbleCap leaning on the one side of the Titanic that still has the lights on. Jensen, can you tell me another bedtime story before they turn them off during the blackout period?\nAmi Joseph broke down Jensen\u2019s Storytelling on The Call @Hedgeye yesterday, so if you\u2019re an Institutional Client just ask us for that summary audio clip. He\u2019ll have his newly minted NVDA bear case in written form next week I think.\u00a0\nWhat struck me most about my conversation with Ami on NVDA was that I didn\u2019t really understand a damn thing. While you all know I was too dumb to understand the \u201cexponential age\u201d crypto thing, I really struggle with this AI thing.\nI know what it is (it\u2019s built into my stochastic algos that powers both my #VASP Signal and our #Quad outputs)\u2026\u00a0\nBut I don\u2019t know what it is in terms of what we\u2019re going to see from NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, etc. in the coming 2 quarters. You know that the next 2 quarters will be the 2 worst quarters of both US GDP and Corporate Profits of The Cycle, right?\nFor 15 months that\u2019s been my \u201ccatalyst\u201d for The Mother of All Bubbles to crash:\nA) Profit Recession #ReiteratedB) Credit Event #Reiterated\nSo it\u2019s all good and fine for Jenson or Elon or whoever to tell you a story about their stock until they have to report their actual numbers. Don\u2019t ever forget that these guys are in \u201cgreat businesses\u201d of selling you stock!\nAnd it\u2019s all good and fine for every American to \u201cown Apple\u201d, until it\u2019s @Hedgeye TREND Signal support of $152 breaks. Is Cook going to have a \u201cgreat quarter\u201d? He better\u2026\u00a0\nOr the Macro Aware will be reminding you of the catalyst that always gets all these guys and their sinking ships: gravity.\nImmediate-term Risk Range\u2122 Signal with @Hedgeye TREND signal in brackets\nUST 30yr Yield 3.57-3.81% (bearish)UST 10yr Yield 3.31-3.71% (bearish)UST 2yr Yield 3.64-4.54% (neutral)High Yield (HYG) 72.49-74.25 (bearish)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0SPX 3 (bearish)NASDAQ 11,003-11,990 (bearish)RUT 1 (bearish)Tech (XLK) 135-147 (bearish)Gold Miners (GDX) 27.42-31.98 (bullish)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shanghai Comp 3211-3299 (bullish)Nikkei 26,609-27,818 (bearish)DAX 14,603-15,390 (bearish)VIX 20.92-28.43 (bullish)USD 101.75-104.75 (bullish)EUR/USD 1.053-1.085 (bearish)Oil (WTI) 64.91-73.44 (bearish)Gold 1 (bullish)Silver 20.99-23.54 (bullish)MSFT 251-282 (bearish)AAPL 148-161 (bullish)AMZN 89-102 (bearish)META 183-213 (bullish)GOOGL 89-107 (bearish)NFLX 285-322 (bearish)TSLA 168-199 (bearish)NVDA 230-281 (bullish)Bitcoin 20,015-31,316 (bearish)\nBest of luck out there today,KM\nKeith R.

Source: Shutterstock Nvidia\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA), a reputable chip and software company, is at the forefront of developing technology for autonomous vehicles (AVs). It has a solid customer base of automotive partners, including Range Rover, Jaguar, and\u00a0XPeng\u00a0(NYSE:\u00a0XPEV) The semiconductor giant is partners with\u00a0Mercedes-Benz\u00a0(OTCMKTS:MBGYY), providing its AV technology to its current vehicle supply. Nvidia also partners\u00a0with\u00a0Amazon\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) subsidiary Zoox for its\u00a0fully autonomous taxi service.   Story Continues Nvidia\u2019s stock has been impacted by\u00a0disappointing quarterly results and tepid guidance, with the primary driver being declining demand for its gaming graphic processing units (GPUs). The company\u2019s management has noted that macroeconomic challenges continue to affect consumers. Hence, demand for high-quality gaming GPUs has begun to fall.However, demand for personal computers and related components has surged, as more consumers shift to working and learning from home. That said, the semiconductor shortage has made it difficult for manufacturers like Nvidia to keep up with this demand.Additionally, consumers are cutting back on spending due to inflation, leading to declining demand for gaming products.Despite the challenges faced by the gaming GPU segment, Nvidia\u2019s growth in other areas, such as data center and automotive, has remained strong. The company\u2019s recent partnership with\u00a0Foxconn\u00a0(OTCMKTS:HNHPF) to\u00a0develop automated and autonomous vehicle platforms\u00a0based on its NVIDIA DRIVE Orin and DRIVE Hyperion technologies highlights its continued commitment to expanding its presence in these areas.With a reported $566 million in revenue from its automotive department for the fiscal year 2022, Nvidia\u2019s automotive division will grow alongside the AV industry. Nvidia is developing chips not only for personal vehicles but also for complete AV commercialization.Ford (F)  Ford Go Electric Automobile Exhibition At Genoa, Italy. F stock  Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comFord\u00a0(NYSE:F) is pursuing AI initiatives in the automotive industry to enhance its products and services. In addition to its\u00a0Co-Pilot360 system, which uses machine learning to detect and respond to potential collision risks, the company is exploring ways to incorporate AI into its manufacturing processes to increase efficiency and reduce costs.Ford is also partnering with other companies in the tech and transportation sectors to explore new AI applications,\u00a0including working\u00a0with\u00a0Qualcomm\u00a0(NASDAQ:QCOM) on vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications technology that allows vehicles to communicate with other vehicles, traffic infrastructure, and pedestrians.Ford\u2019s BlueCruise technology is already incorporated in many of its production vehicles, with the company expecting connected advanced-driver-assistance systems to\u00a0generate $20 billion in revenue\u00a0annually by 2030.With these initiatives, Ford is positioning itself as a leader in AI innovation in the automotive industry. It comes at a critical time for the iconic automaker.Although Ford is a huge brand name, its stock is down over 17% over the last six months. A sharp decline began after the company reported its fourth-quarter earnings, during which CEO Jim Farley\u00a0expressed disappointment\u00a0over the missed profit expectations in 2022.However, we are seeing signs of a recovery. Ford reported a significant increase in February sales, 20% higher than the previous year. Sales totaled 157,606 vehicles, a 7.7% increase from the last month. Additionally, the company\u2019s F-Series pickups sales rose by 22%, including a significant increase in its electric F-150 Lightning sales.With shares trading at a bargain-basement price, the time to strike is now.General Motors (GM)  General Motors (GM) sign with blue and white logo and brick building in background  Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comGeneral Motors\u00a0(NYSE:GM) is perhaps the biggest player in automobiles on the world stage. Last year, it reclaimed its crown from Toyota (OTCMKTS:TOYOF) to become, once again, the largest automaker in the U.S. by sales volume.Due to its dominance in the internal combustion engine cars market, people forget GM is also focusing on AI.The iconic car maker wants to have a fleet of autonomous vehicles ready for sale by the middle of the decade, an ambitious target. It has already undertaken several initiatives to make this goal a reality.For example, General Motors is the first automaker to get approval for fully autonomous vehicle testing on public roads in San Francisco.In addition, GM is looking further to integrate its AV technology into other commercial vehicles. As technology is evolving, so is the automaker.The integration of AV technology into commercial and personal vehicles is expected to continue through features such as adaptive cruise control. The technology uses sensors to alter the vehicle\u2019s speed in response to traffic conditions.GM\u2019s Cruise autonomous vehicle division is looking at $50 billion in revenue by 2027. The additional revenue is expected to come with high-profit margins, considering the lack of overhead costs.In summary, the company\u2019s commitment to AV technology will transform the automotive industry. At the same time, it will enhance the bottom line.On the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Separately, NVIDIA today also announced new models for the NVIDIA BioNeMo\u2122 cloud service for biology.\n\u201cGenerative AI is driving the fast adoption of AI and reinventing countless industries,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA AI Foundations let enterprises customize foundation models with their own data to generate humanity\u2019s most valuable resources \u2014 intelligence and creativity.\u201d\nHelping Enterprises Build Customized Generative AI Applications\r\nThe NeMo and Picasso services run on NVIDIA DGX\u2122 Cloud, which is accessible via a browser. Developers can use the models offered on each service through simple application programming interfaces (APIs). Once models are ready for deployment, enterprises can run inference workloads at scale using the NVIDIA AI Foundations cloud services.\nEach cloud service includes six elements: pretrained models, frameworks for data processing, vector databases and personalization, optimized inference engines, APIs, and support from NVIDIA experts to help enterprises tune models for their custom use cases.\nNeMo Service Lets Enterprises Quickly Customize Foundation Language Models\r\nThe NeMo cloud service enables developers to make large language models (LLMs) more relevant for businesses by defining areas of focus, adding domain-specific knowledge and teaching functional skills.\nModels of varying sizes \u2014 from 8 billion to 530 billion parameters \u2014 available on the service are regularly updated with additional training data, giving enterprises broad options for building applications that align with business requirements for speed, accuracy and task complexity.\nUsing information retrieval capabilities included in the NeMo service, customers will be able to augment LLMs with their real-time proprietary data. This allows enterprises to customize models to power accurate generative AI applications for market intelligence, enterprise search, chatbots and customer service, and more.\nMorningstar, a leading provider of independent investment insights, is working with NeMo to research advanced intelligence services.\n\u201cLarge language models offer us the ability to collect insightful data from highly complex structured and unstructured content at a larger scale while prioritizing data quality and speed,\u201d said Shariq Ahmad, head of Data Collection Technology at Morningstar. \u201cOur quality framework includes a human-in-the-loop process that feeds into model retuning to ensure that we produce increasingly high-quality content. Morningstar is using NeMo in its Data Collection research and development on how LLMs can scan and summarize information from sources such as financial documents to quickly extract market intelligence.\u201d\nQuantiphi, an AI-first digital engineering company and one of NVIDIA\u2019s service delivery partners, is working with NeMo to build a modular generative AI solution. The offering, called baioniq, will enable enterprises to build customized LLMs that are equipped with up-to-date information to boost productivity for knowledge workers.\nNVIDIA Picasso Service Speeds Simulation and Creative Design Across Image, Video and 3D\nNVIDIA Picasso is a cloud service for building and deploying generative AI-powered image, video and 3D applications with advanced text-to-image, text-to-video and text-to-3D capabilities to supercharge productivity for creativity, design and digital simulation through simple cloud APIs.\nSoftware makers, service providers and enterprises can use Picasso to train NVIDIA Edify foundation models on their proprietary data to build applications that use natural text prompts to quickly create and customize visual content for hundreds of use cases, including product design, digital twins, storytelling and character creation.\nTo build custom applications, businesses can also start with Picasso\u2019s set of Edify models that are pretrained with fully licensed data. Additionally, they can use Picasso to optimize and run their own generative AI models.\nIndustry Leaders Team With NVIDIA to Advance Productivity for Creative Professionals\r\nLeading visual content companies are collaborating with NVIDIA to build custom models with the Picasso services to advance productivity for creative professionals.\nNVIDIA and Adobe today announced they will expand their longstanding research and development partnership to create the next generation of generative AI models. They will co-develop the models with a focus on transparency and Content Credentials, powered by Adobe\u2019s Content Authenticity Initiative. To accelerate the workflows of the world\u2019s leading creators and marketers, some of these models will be jointly developed and brought to market through Adobe Creative Cloud flagship products like Photoshop, Premiere Pro and After Effects, as well as through NVIDIA Picasso.\nNVIDIA and Getty Images, a global visual-content creator and marketplace, are collaborating to train responsible generative text-to-image and text-to-video foundation models. The models will allow the creation of images and video using simple text prompts and will be trained on Getty Images\u2019 fully licensed assets. Getty Images will provide royalties to artists on any revenues generated from the models.\nNVIDIA and Shutterstock, a global creative platform for brands and media companies, are collaborating to train a generative text-to-3D foundation model using the NVIDIA Picasso service to simplify the creation of detailed 3D models and reduce the time required to build 3D models from days to minutes. Fully licensed Shutterstock assets and metadata will be used for training, and Shutterstock will compensate artists via its Contributor Fund. Once the model is ready for deployment, Shutterstock plans to offer it on its platform to help simplify the creation of 3D assets for creative production, as well as to accelerate the development of industrial digital twins and 3D virtual world composition in NVIDIA Omniverse.\nAvailability\r\nDevelopers can apply to access the NeMo generative AI cloud service, which is in early access, and the Picasso service, which is in private preview.\nWatch Huang discuss NVIDIA AI Foundations in his GTC keynote on demand.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

But when investors choose wisely, they can be rewarded with a stock that turns into a compounding machine and grows money at a staggering rate. Consider that $1,000 invested in Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG/NASDAQ:GOOGL) 2004 initial public offering (IPO) would be worth $1.2 million today, and you can see the benefits of picking stocks of companies that are well-managed, have strong earnings, and are growth machines. While not every stock is going to be as successful as Alphabet and many picks may not pan out all, having a few winners can really help to supercharge a portfolio. And while the market remains rocky, there are still some strong stocks to buy for the long haul. Here are seven hot stocks to turn $1,000 into $10,000 by 2030.

FSLR stock   Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com As its name implies, First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is an American manufacturer of solar panels. And it is a leader in its industry. Consequently, the company and its stock are riding the wave that is building behind the transition to renewable energy in America. FSLR stock has gained 40% so far this year, has risen 165% over the last 12 months, and is up nearly 200% over the past five years. That kind of consistent growth and outperformance is certain to help turn $1,000 of FSLR\u2019s shares into $10,000 by 2030.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips FSLR stock recently got a boost after analysts at UBS lifted their rating on the security to \u201cbuy\u201d from \u201cneutral\u201d and raised their price target on the shares to $250 from $140 previously. UBS analyst Jon Windham said First Solar is well-positioned to benefit from the Biden administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, which provides tax credits that cover 30% of the cost of installing solar panels. The company also impressed investors with its latest earnings that showed its net sales rose 10% year-over-year while its net loss declined 85%. Tesla (TSLA)   Tesla Motors (TSLA) now an SP500 company with a busy Pond Springs location in northwest Austin, TX   Source: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com Electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is another company that is helping with America\u2019s energy transition. And while TSLA stock suffered a punishing decline last fall in the months immediately after CEO Elon Musk took control of Twitter, its share price is once again proving to be resilient. So far this year, Tesla\u2019s share price is up 56% and it has managed to recover much of the ground that it lost between Halloween and Christmas last year.   Story Continues TSLA stock has been a great compounder for shareholders. In the past five years, the share price has increased 883%. Investors will be hard pressed to find other stocks with that kind of growth since 2018.While Tesla CEO Elon Musk remains a polarizing figure and Tesla\u2019s stock continues to suffer through volatile periods, it continues to have an overwhelming, upward trajectory.The stock is also one of the most widely held tech securities, and the company continues to dominate the electric vehicle sector despite rising competition in the space.Intuit (INTU)  Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.comIt\u2019s tax season, and that should enable Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), the software company behind the popular TurboTax tax preparation application, to deliver great financial results this quarter. The company also markets personal finance app Mint, small business accounting program QuickBooks, and credit monitoring service Credit Karma. Taken together, these products have proven to be extremely popular with both businesses and consumers. This helps to explain why INTU stock has risen 148% over the past five years.The company has continued to consistently report better-than-expected earnings. Most recently, the company announced that its long-time Chief Financial Officer, Michelle Clatterbuck, is retiring this July after a 20-year career at Intuit. She will be succeeded by Sandeep Singh Aujla, who has been at Intuit for seven years in several different financial roles.Aujla\u2019s promotion will provide much-needed continuity to the company. While Intuit\u2019s stock has pulled back 11% in the last 12 months with the broader tech sector, INTU stock has grown more than 600% in the ten years since 2013.Nvidia (NVDA)  Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.  Source: ShutterstockIf you believe, as many people do, that artificial intelligence is the next frontier in tech,\u00a0 than you should take a bullish position in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company makes some of the most advanced microchips and semiconductors in the world, and\u00a0 the most advanced supercomputers and AI applications, including ChatGPT, use its chips.At a developer conference held on March 21, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made it clear that the company is increasingly focused on AI and helping to bring the technology to the masses.Nvidia unveiled a new DGX Cloud service that promises to provide its enterprise customers with the supercomputing capabilities needed to develop and train their own generative AI models that will be similar to ChatGPT.The notion that Nvidia is a key player in the AI space has helped propel the company\u2019s stock 92% higher so far in 2023. NVDA stock has more than doubled in the last six months alone.Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD)  A close-up of the blue and yellow Warner Bros (WBD) sign.  Source: Ingus Kruklitis / Shutterstock.comThe streaming industry is growing, maturing and diversifying. And one of the companies best positioned to come out a long-term winner in the sector is Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD). The strength of Warner Bros. Discovery comes from its roster of assets and brands, which include DC Comics, Home Box Office (HBO), CNN, Turner Broadcasting, the Food Network and Cooking Channel, and the streaming platforms HBO Max and Discovery+.While Warner Bros. Discovery is still a relatively new company that was formed only last year after WarnerMedia was spun off by AT&T (NYSE:T) and then merged with the Discovery Network, investors are warming to the stock and its future growth prospects.After a bumpy reception last year, WBD stock has gained 50% in 2023. The stock has been moving higher in recent weeks following several upgrades by analysts, who cited the company\u2019s strong position among streaming companies.Eli Lilly (LLY)  Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XI  Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comPharmaceutical company Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) has a potentially huge catalyst for its stock looming on the horizon in the form of a medication that treats obesity. The weight-loss drug, called \u201cTirzepatide,\u201d is in the final stages of approval with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and some analysts are saying it could be the biggest blockbuster prescription drug ever.Eli Lilly is wasting no time in preparing for the obesity medication\u2019s approval, expanding existing facilities so that it can manufacture and quickly get Tirzepatide to market.However, even if Tirzepatide runs into problems with the FDA, Eli Lilly still has a reliable stable of other blockbuster drugs that continue to drive its earnings and share price higher. These include antipsychotic medication Zyprexa, and diabetes treatment Trulicity.The sales of these medications have helped propel LLY stock 17% higher over the last 12 months and 343% higher in the past five years. Getting in on Eli Lilly\u2019s stock before the weight loss drug comes to market could be a genius move.Apple (AAPL)  Apple (AAPL) logo on an Apple store in Santa Monica, California.  Source: View Apart / Shutterstock.comConsumer tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is not just a growth stock, but it is also a safe haven that investors turn to in times of uncertainty. After a few regional banks failed in the U.S., AAPL stock nonetheless gained more than 5%. The stock now accounts for 7% of the weighting of the benchmark S&P 500 index, more than any other U.S. stock, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. While Apple\u2019s share price has largely traded sideways over the past six months due to choppy markets, it remains a juggernaut and long-term powerhouse.In the past five years, AAPL stock has gained nearly 300%. Over a decade, the share price is up 950%. And, Apple buys back more of its own stock than any other publicly traded company.Throw in several stock splits and a quarterly dividend payment of 23 cents a share and Apple\u2019s stock is a compounding machine. As for its business, Apple continues to grow and diversify into new areas ranging from streaming to buy now, pay later.Plus, some analysts are still calling for an iPhone sales supercycle as people upgrade to 5G wireless technology.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in GOOGL, NVDA, LLY and AAPL.

Each platform is optimized for in-demand workloads, including AI video, image generation, large language model deployment and recommender inference.\n\u201cThe rise of generative AI is requiring more powerful inference computing platforms,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cThe number of applications for generative AI is infinite, limited only by human imagination. Arming developers with the most powerful and flexible inference computing platform will accelerate the creation of new services that will improve our lives in ways not yet imaginable.\u201d\nAccelerating Generative AI\u2019s Diverse Set of Inference Workloads\r\nEach of the platforms contains an NVIDIA GPU optimized for specific generative AI inference workloads as well as specialized software:\n\nNVIDIA L4 for AI Video can deliver 120x more AI-powered video performance than CPUs, combined with 99% better energy efficiency. Serving as a universal GPU for virtually any workload, it offers enhanced video decoding and transcoding capabilities, video streaming, augmented reality, generative AI video and more.\nNVIDIA L40 for Image Generation is optimized for graphics and AI-enabled 2D, video and 3D image generation. The L40 platform serves as the engine of NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122, a platform for building and operating metaverse applications in the data center, delivering 7x the inference performance for Stable Diffusion and 12x Omniverse performance over the previous generation.\nNVIDIA H100 NVL for Large Language Model Deployment is ideal for deploying massive LLMs like ChatGPT at scale. The new H100 NVL with 94GB of memory with Transformer Engine acceleration delivers up to 12x faster inference performance at GPT-3 compared to the prior generation A100 at data center scale.\nNVIDIA Grace Hopper for Recommendation Models is ideal for graph recommendation models, vector databases and graph neural networks. With the 900 GB/s NVLink\u00ae-C2C connection between CPU and GPU, Grace Hopper can deliver 7x faster data transfers and queries compared to PCIe Gen 5.\n\nThe platforms\u2019 software layer features the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite, which includes NVIDIA TensorRT\u2122, a software development kit for high-performance deep learning inference, and NVIDIA Triton Inference Server\u2122, an open-source inference-serving software that helps standardize model deployment.\nEarly Adoption and Support\r\nGoogle Cloud is a key cloud partner and an early customer of NVIDIA\u2019s inference platforms. It is integrating the L4 platform into its machine learning platform, Vertex AI, and is the first cloud service provider to offer L4 instances, with private preview of its G2 virtual machines launching today.\nTwo of the first organizations to have early access to L4 on Google Cloud include: Descript, which uses generative AI to help creators produce videos and podcasts, and WOMBO, which offers an AI-powered text to digital art app called Dream.\nAnother early adopter, Kuaishou provides a content community and social platform that\u00a0leverages GPUs to decode incoming live streaming video, capture key frames, optimize audio and video. It then uses a transformer-based large-scale model to understand multimodal content and improve click-through rates for hundreds of millions of users globally.\n\u201cKuaishou recommendation system serves a community having over 360 million daily users who contribute millions of UGC videos every day,\u201d said Yue Yu, senior vice president at Kuaishou. \u201cCompared to CPUs under the same total cost of ownership, NVIDIA GPUs have been increasing the system end-to-end throughputs by 11x and reducing latency by 20%.\u201d\nD-ID, a leading generative AI technology platform, elevates video content for professionals by using NVIDIA L40 GPUs to generate photorealistic digital humans from text \u2014 giving a face to any content while reducing the cost and hassle of video production at scale.\n\u201cL40 performance was simply amazing. With it, we were able to double our inference speed,\u201d said Or Gorodissky, vice president of research and development at D-ID. \u201cD-ID is excited to use this new hardware as part of our offering that enables real-time streaming of AI humans at unprecedented performance and resolution while simultaneously reducing our compute costs.\u201d\nSeyhan Lee, a leading AI production studio, uses generative AI to develop immersive experiences and captivating creative content for the film, broadcast and entertainment industries.\n\u201cThe L40 GPU delivers an incredible boost in performance for our generative AI applications,\u201d said Pinar Demirdag, co-founder of Seyhan Lee. \u201cWith the inferencing capability and memory size of the L40, we can deploy state-of-the-art models and deliver innovative services to our customers with incredible speed and accuracy.\u201d\nCohere, a leading pioneer in language AI, runs a platform that empowers developers to build natural language models while keeping data private and secure.\n\u201cNVIDIA\u2019s new high-performance H100 inference platform can enable us to provide better and more efficient services to our customers with our state-of-the-art generative models, powering a variety of NLP applications such as conversational AI, multilingual enterprise search and information extraction,\u201d said Aidan Gomez, CEO at Cohere.\nAvailability\r\nThe NVIDIA L4 GPU is available in private preview on Google Cloud Platform and also available from a global network of more than 30 computer makers, including Advantech, ASUS, Atos, Cisco, Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, QCT and Supermicro.\nThe NVIDIA L40 GPU is currently available from leading system builders, including ASUS, Dell Technologies, GIGABYTE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro with the number of partner platforms set to expand throughout the year.\nThe Grace Hopper Superchip is sampling now, with full production expected in the second half of the year. The H100 NVL GPU also is expected in the second half of the year.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise is now available on major cloud marketplaces and from dozens of system providers and partners. With NVIDIA AI Enterprise, customers receive NVIDIA Enterprise Support, regular security reviews and API stability for NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, TensorRT and more than 50 pretrained models and frameworks.\u00a0\u00a0\nHands-on labs for trying the NVIDIA inference platform for generative AI are available immediately at no cost on NVIDIA LaunchPad.

To skip our detailed analysis of ChatGPT and developments in artificial intelligence, you can go directly to see the 5 Stocks ChatGPT Says Will Make Me Rich in 10 Years. One of the biggest developments in artificial intelligence (AI) seen so far is the emergence of ChatGPT and similar AI chatbots. ChatGPT was developed by OpenAI, an AI research and deployment company. The chatbot uses deep learning techniques to generate responses to text inputs in the form of a conversation with the user. Ever since its release, ChatGPT has taken the world by storm, making researchers, users, and even investors even more curious about the artificial intelligence sector and what it has to offer.  AI was first deployed in the finance sector years ago, but the speed of its incorporation in the sector was sped up during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, it is expected that AI in finance will drive competitive advantages for financial firms. According to a report published by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2021, AI can improve firms' efficiency through cost reduction and productivity enhancement, leading to higher profitability. It can also enhance the quality of financial services and products. Because of the benefits AI offers to the financial sector, global spending on AI in the private sector has been steadily increasing. Between 2020 and 2024, spending on AI was forecast to rise from $50.1 billion in 2020 to over $110 billion in 2024. Picking Stocks Using AI A recent example of AI deployment in the finance sector can be found in the ETF arena. According to a Bloomberg article published in January, the AI Powered Equity ETF is a $102 million ETF that managed to return about 9.9% in January 2023, while the S&P 500 Total Return Index returned a mere 4.7%. The ETF uses a quantitative model to assess over 6,000 American publicly-traded companies. Even before this more recent development, AI deployment was seen in the finance sector. A BarclayHedge Hedge Fund Sentiment Survey conducted in 2018 found that 56% of hedge fund respondents had used AI to inform their investment decisions. Hedge funds have been using AI to analyze data and forecast market movements for tactical asset allocation for years now. Some hedge funds known to use machine learning and AI algorithms in their business include Cerebellum Capital, Aidiya Holdings, and Taaffeite Capital Management. The AI Race Apart from the finance sector, public companies in the tech sector, such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), have also been joining the AI frenzy to keep up with changing trends. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), for instance, has begun incorporating generative AI technology in its Bing search engine. In competition, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has also announced plans to integrate the same technology into its own search engine. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has also been working with generative AI, attributing its increasing business to consumer demand for this technology in their networks. According to the Wall Street Journal in an article published this March, Broadcom Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AVGO) CEO, Hock Tan, expects sales from the company's Ethernet switch products deployed for AI uses to exceed $800 million in 2023, compared to $200 million in 2022. Tan also commented that the company's revenues from its compute offload accelerated business will also hit $3 billion in the fiscal year of 2023, compared to $2 billion the year before.   Story Continues Additionally, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is not alone in its attempts to capitalize on the recent AI boom. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), another chip maker, has also recently announced the rise of a new business aiming to provide greater access to AI software tools. These are merely a few examples of how companies across the globe, public and private, are swept away by the AI craze. With ChatGPT being one of the primary reasons behind this, we have attempted to use this AI chatbot to generate a list of profitable stocks to invest in to see just how far AI has advanced.

Many large tech companies, including Meta, install Nvidia's top-tier graphics processing units (GPUs) in their data centers to process complex machine learning and AI tasks.\nFor Meta, Nvidia's chips make it easier to craft targeted ads, make recommendations, learn languages, and identify harmful content. At other companies, they can be used to automate tasks, identify business trends, and make data-driven decisions. Nvidia's A100 chip also powers \"generative AI\" platforms -- including ChatGPT, Bing AI, and Stable Diffusion -- which are trained on existing information to create new content.\u00a0\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia and Meta both lost their luster in 2022 as rising interest rates pummeled the tech sector. But this year, Nvidia and Meta have risen about 60% and 40%, respectively, as the rise of ChatGPT and other AI services drove investors back toward AI-related stocks. Should investors buy either of these recovering tech stocks right now?\nNvidia is still in the middle of a cyclical slowdown\nNvidia's growth accelerated throughout the pandemic as more people upgraded their PCs to play video games, work online, attend remote classes, and mine cryptocurrencies. Its sales of data center chips also surged as companies upgraded their servers to address the rising usage of cloud-based services. That's why the chipmaker's revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) soared 61% and 78%, respectively, in fiscal 2022 (which ended in January 2022).\n\nBut those tailwinds quickly dissipated in a post-pandemic market. Sales of new PCs withered as the lockdowns ended, while macroheadwinds forced companies to rein in their spending on big cloud and data center deals. The collapse of the cryptocurrency market exacerbated that pain as miners flooded the market with their used GPUs. As a result, Nvidia's revenue remained roughly flat in fiscal 2023 as its adjusted EPS declined 25%. Its revenue also declined year over year in the third and fourth quarters, and it expects to experience another decline in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut on a sequential basis, Nvidia's gaming and data center businesses -- which together accounted for 90% of its revenue last quarter -- are both stabilizing. It expects the gaming business to stabilize as it resolves its inventory issues and the Chinese market recovers, and for the rise of generative AI services to boost sales of its data center chips. For the full year, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and adjusted EPS to increase 10% and 33%, respectively, as its cyclical decline finally ends.\nMeta faces tougher existential challenges\nMeta stumbled last year as four major challenges throttled its growth. First, Apple's (AAPL -0.87%) privacy changes on iOS -- which enabled users to opt out of data-tracking features -- made it difficult for Facebook and Instagram to craft targeted ads. Second, intense competition from ByteDance's TikTok further reduced its ad sales and forced it to ramp up its investments in its Reels short videos, which are more difficult to monetize than its News Feed ads.\nThird, the macroeconomic headwinds forced many companies to curb their ad spending. That was bad news for Meta, which generated 97% of its revenue from ads in 2022 and other ad-dependent companies. Lastly, Meta remained firmly committed to expanding its money-losing Reality Labs business with new virtual reality devices and services. That segment posted an operating loss of $13.7 billion in 2022 while only generating $2.2 billion in revenues.\n\nThat's why Meta's revenue and EPS declined 1% and 38%, respectively, in 2022. However, analysts expect its revenue and EPS to increase 5% and 11%, respectively, this year as its advertising business stabilizes, and it reins in its spending to offset the Reality Labs' segment's persistent losses. It already laid off 13% of its workforce last November, and it's reportedly gearing up for another round of layoffs this year. As Meta streamlines its business, it will focus on improving its first-party data capabilities to offset Apple's platform changes and expanding Reels to counter TikTok.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe valuations and verdict\nNvidia trades at 49 times forward earnings, while Meta has a much lower forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18. Nvidia is still trading at a premium to many of its peers because it dominates the discrete GPU market and has a clear path toward a long-term recovery. Meta is trading at a discount to many other tech companies because its problems with Apple, ByteDance, and Reality Labs represent existential challenges instead of cyclical ones. The social networking giant still served a whopping 3.7 billion people each month across its entire family of apps (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp), but it's unclear if it can continue to effectively monetize those users as the advertising market evolves.\nMeta faces a tougher uphill battle than Nvidia this year, but I believe its lower valuation makes it the more compelling buy right now. Nvidia's long-term prospects look bright, but its valuations have clearly been inflated by the market hype surrounding ChatGPT and other generative AI services. Therefore, investors should wait for Nvidia to cool off before pulling the trigger, but they can still consider investing in Meta as a value play.\n\n\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The enhanced partnership expands BYD\u2019s use of DRIVE Orin across the multiple models in its next-generation Dynasty and Ocean series of vehicles, bringing safe and intelligent vehicles to market.\n\u201cNVIDIA DRIVE Orin has been enormously successful with global mobility leaders that are building the software-defined future,\u201d said Rishi Dhall, vice president of automotive at NVIDIA. \u201cOur ongoing collaboration with BYD is a testament to the industry\u2019s confidence in DRIVE Orin as the centralized computer for today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s intelligent vehicles.\u201d\nNVIDIA and BYD share the belief that future cars will be programmable, evolving from being based on many embedded controllers to high-performance centralized computers \u2014 with functionalities delivered and enhanced through software updates over the life of the car. The compute horsepower from DRIVE Orin is critical for diverse, redundant sensor processing in real time, and provides automakers with the compute headroom to develop and support new software-driven services throughout the entire life of the vehicle.\nSince entering production last year, DRIVE Orin \u2014 the highest performance automotive-grade processor on the market \u2014 has become the transportation industry\u2019s AI engine of choice for the new generation of NEVs, robotaxis, shuttles and trucks. Designed to meet stringent industry safety standards, the scalable DRIVE Orin platform is capable of performing up to 254 trillion operations per second, enabling it to power AI cockpits, as well as automated driving functions \u2014 simultaneously running numerous deep neural networks to provide the ultimate safety and reliability.\nBeyond selecting NVIDIA DRIVE Orin for its EV fleets, BYD announced earlier this year that it is working with NVIDIA to enhance the in-vehicle experience by bringing the NVIDIA GeForce NOW\u2122 cloud gaming service to its vehicles.\nWith industry-leading technologies such as the Blade Battery, DM-i super hybrid technology and the e-platform, BYD has sold over 3.7 million NEVs globally as of February 2023, while creating a better mobility experience for consumers.\nTo learn more about the latest technology breakthroughs in automotive and other industries, watch NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s GTC keynote.

The company\u2019s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling the creation of the metaverse. NVIDIA is now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.

The stock has gained\u00a057%, driven by the company's better-than-expected fiscal 2023 fourth-quarter results (for the three months ended Jan. 29, 2023), which were released on Feb. 22.\nInvestors have chosen to focus on the semiconductor giant's progress in data centers and the artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity that could supercharge its growth in the long run. However, they seem to be ignoring a potential speedbump that could bring Nvidia's rally to a halt (at least in the short run) -- the gaming business.\n\nLet's see why the gaming business has the potential to wreck this semiconductor stock's terrific momentum.\nWeak graphics cards sales led to an alarming inventory buildup\nSales of personal computers (PCs) were down\u00a016.5% in 2022, according to IDC, and this weighed heavily on Nvidia's gaming business during the year. The company's gaming revenue plunged 27% in fiscal 2023 to $9 billion. Additionally, Nvidia's professional visualization revenue fell 27% year over year to $1.54 billion thanks to weak sales of graphics cards used in workstations. That's not surprising, as sales of discrete graphics cards fell to 38 million units in 2022 from 49 million units the year before.\nBut the impact of weak graphics card demand wasn't limited to just Nvidia's top line. The company\u00a0recorded \"$2.17 billion of inventory charges largely relating to excess supply of NVIDIA Ampere architecture Gaming and Data Center products as compared to the demand expectations for these products.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn short, Nvidia had to write down the value of its unsold inventory last fiscal year as its market value fell below the book value. Again, that's not surprising given that the company was resorting\u00a0to price cuts in a bid to boost graphics card sales in 2022. The inventory charges that Nvidia recorded last fiscal year took a heavy toll on the company's earnings.\nThat's evident from the fact that Nvidia's adjusted earnings fell\u00a025% year over year in fiscal 2023 to $3.34 per share even though its revenue remained flat. The inventory write-downs led to a contraction of 7.6 percentage points in Nvidia's adjusted gross margin last year to 59.2%. The bad news for Nvidia is that it is still sitting on a lot of unsold inventory, as the chart below shows.\n\nNVDA Inventories (Quarterly) data by YCharts\nWhat's more alarming is the fact that the company's inventory levels have been rising at a faster pace than its revenue over the past four quarters. In fact, Nvidia's inventory level has increased substantially, while its top line has been heading south.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA Inventories (Quarterly) data by YCharts\nThe above chart is an indication of Nvidia's inability to sell the graphics cards that it is producing, which can be attributed to the PC market's weakness. CFO Colette Kress pointed out on the company's February earnings conference call that the inventory correction \"is largely behind us,\" so investors can expect an improvement in sales of graphics cards going forward.\nBut at the same time, investors shouldn't forget that Nvidia is sitting on a lot of unsold inventory that it must move first, and that could turn out to be difficult given the PC market forecast for 2023. IDC is anticipating another weak year for PCs in 2023, anticipating a 10.7% drop in shipments this year. So Nvidia may not have enough room to move its unsold inventory, as the weakness in the PC market could be here to stay.\nNvidia's expensive valuation is another problem\nAnalysts anticipate a turnaround in Nvidia's fortunes this fiscal year. According to consensus estimates, Nvidia's revenue is forecast to increase by 9% in fiscal 2024 to $29.5 billion, while adjusted earnings are expected to jump to $4.46 per share from last year's $3.34 per share.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the gaming business produced a third of Nvidia's overall revenue last fiscal year. So weak graphics card sales and high inventory levels could continue weighing on Nvidia's performance this fiscal year, and that could keep the company from meeting Wall Street's growth targets. That's why investors who are looking to buy Nvidia stock right now considering its latest rally may want to hold off from doing so, especially considering its steep valuation.\nThe semiconductor stock is trading at a whopping 132 times earnings right now. That's more than double its five-year average earnings multiple of 59 and the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple\u00a0of 24, which means that if Nvidia fails to live up to Wall Street's expectations, the stock could be in trouble.\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Before the introduction of modern graphics processing units (GPUs), images were both boxy and grainy. Nvidia's (NVDA -2.56%) groundbreaking video rendering technology, introduced in the late 1990s was -- for lack of a better term -- a game changer. And the rest, as they say, is history.\nFrom those humble beginnings, Nvidia stock has soared a mind-boggling 105,772%, making it one of the best-performing stocks over the past 30 years. That means a $10,000 investment at its 1999 IPO would be worth more than $10.8 million today.\u00a0\nYet even investors who saw the writing on the wall much later have been richly rewarded. A similar $10,000 investment in early 2013 would have resulted in 8,615% gains, worth more than $871,000 today.\u00a0\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nGiven the stratospheric gains the stock generated, investors might be tempted to think that Nvidia's best days are behind it. However, like so many successful companies, Nvidia pivoted to embrace multiple new products and markets, suggesting the best is likely yet to come for Nvidia.\nSo. Many. Applications.\nJust to be clear, Nvidia's video game segment still represents a large chunk of Nvidia's revenue -- and it's a market the company dominates, with a commanding 85% of the discrete desktop GPU market. But Nvidia has expanded its semiconductor technology to embrace a number of other market opportunities -- each of which represents a massive opportunity for growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest potential drivers is the ongoing adoption of cloud computing. All the major cloud providers, including Alphabet's\u00a0Google Cloud, Amazon\u00a0Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft Azure, rely on Nvidia's processors and accelerators to power their cloud services, as do Alibaba\u00a0Cloud, Baidu\u00a0Cloud, and Tencent\u00a0Cloud.\u00a0\nNvidia's semiconductors also became the gold standard for a number of compute-intensive operations, including high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI), which represents another compelling opportunity. At the company's recent GPU Technology Conference, Nvidia rolled out a host of hardware that makes it easier for enterprises of all sizes to access AI technology.\n\nOne of the biggest announcements was for DGX Cloud, which can provide AI-as-a-service to any business with access to the internet. Nvidia also debuted a number of inference platforms that will help developers quickly ramp up generative AI applications, like those responsible for OpenAI's ChatGPT, which has captured the public imagination.\u00a0\nThere are a number of other opportunities in new verticals that are still in their infancy. For example, at this stage, it's unclear how big the metaverse -- or \"omniverse,\" as Nvidia calls it -- could be, but the company estimates its opportunity in the space at roughly $150 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, no one yet knows where the self-driving car market will go from here now that the initial hype has died down. Last year, Nvidia announced it had secured design wins resulting in an automotive pipeline that exceeded $11 billion, but the company estimates the total opportunity at $300 billion.\nIn all, Nvidia estimates its total addressable market at $1 trillion. While it's customary to take those estimates with a grain of salt, it does help illustrate the magnitude of the opportunity ahead.\u00a0\nWorth every penny\nWith this multipronged opportunity as a backdrop, it's worth noting that Nvidia has never been cheap, and it continues to trade at lofty heights. The stock currently sells for 14 times next year's sales, but that valuation can't be viewed in a vacuum. Even in the face of macroeconomic headwinds, analysts' consensus estimates call for Nvidia to grow revenue by 34% this year and 32% in 2024. But Wall Street has frequently underestimated the company's robust growth, so if history is any guide, the estimates could be conservative.\nGiven Nvidia's strong positions in the gaming and data center markets and multiple catalysts -- including AI -- fueling additional growth, its rich valuation seems pretty reasonable, given its massive opportunity.\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Similarly, shares of Microsoft have soared 382,700% since its IPO in 1986.\u00a0\nBut where will the next market leaders come from? Companies developing technologies like semiconductors, artificial intelligence (AI), and cybersecurity might be the best candidates. Through that lens, here are five stocks that could be among the world's most valuable by 2050.\n1. AMD: A leader in high-performance computing\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.80%) is one of the world's leading semiconductor companies. Its advanced computer chips power some of the hottest consumer products, from the infotainment systems in Tesla's electric vehicles to gaming consoles like the Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation.\u00a0\n\nBut the data center is the company's most valuable opportunity. AMD is a go-to chipmaker for the top providers of cloud computing services. Moreover, its $49 billion acquisition of Xilinx last year sets it up to lead the high-performance computing industry -- including areas like artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n\nXilinx's adaptive technology allows chips to be reconfigured after the manufacturing process, significantly shortening the upgrade cycle, which is exactly what the AI sector needs to speed up its progress. \nThe semiconductor industry was valued at $573 billion in 2022 with a 12.2% annual growth rate, according to Fortune Business Insights. If it continues to expand at that pace, AMD could be playing in a $14 trillion market by 2050. But that's not all, because the AI sector could absolutely trounce that opportunity (more on that later).\u00a0\n2. Meta Platforms: Building the future on connecting people\nIf you've never used one of Meta Platforms' (META -3.63%) social networks, chances are you know someone who has. Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp have a combined 3.7 billion monthly users, which is close to half the population on Earth. Meta is focused on maintaining that advantage and it's doing so in a few ways.\nFirst, it's investing in its Reels feature, which curates short-form video content using AI, primarily to fend off a competitive threat from ByteDance's TikTok. Second, it's pouring billions ($13.7 billion in 2022, to be precise) into building a virtual world called the metaverse. \n\n\n\n\n\nMeta thinks virtual reality could be the future of social and professional connection, so it's developing both the hardware and the software to cement its leadership position. Some estimates suggest the value of that opportunity could fall between $2 trillion and $30 trillion within the next decade, and it could grow even even more in the long term as the technology improves. \nIt will be difficult for a competitor to challenge Meta's current dominance, because it has already done the hard part of attracting such an enormous user base. So as long as the company continues to innovate to keep those users engaged, it should maintain its position among the most valuable companies in the world when 2050 rolls around.\u00a0\n3. Nvidia: Advancing AI, supercomputers, autonomous driving, and more\nLike AMD, Nvidia (NVDA -2.56%) makes some of the world's most advanced semiconductors. But it's focused on becoming a platform computing company, in which it also develops software, especially in segments like artificial intelligence, where it's already a widely recognized leader.\u00a0\n\nNvidia's graphics chips are extremely popular in the gaming community, but it's the data center segment that holds the most promise. Its hardware has turned data centers from a place to store information into a training ground for AI and machine learning models -- including OpenAI's ChatGPT. The company's chips also power the most advanced supercomputers on the planet, and for the first time ever, businesses will soon be able to access them online through cloud providers like Microsoft Azure.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nvidia Drive platform also holds long-term promise. It's an end-to-end hardware and software solution for car manufacturers wanting to build autonomous self-driving capabilities into their vehicles -- an industry that could generate $14 trillion in value as soon as 2027.\nSimply put, Nvidia has inserted itself into almost every aspect of the AI industry. End users will find it difficult to access the technology without an Nvidia hardware or software product, and that is going to drive substantial long-term value creation.\u00a0\n4. CrowdStrike: Cybersecurity is on the cusp of major growth\nCrowdStrike (CRWD -0.53%) is a cybersecurity industry leader thanks to its continued development of AI to improve accuracy and reduce response times. The corporate world continues to shift its day-to-day operations online using cloud computing technology, and it's leaving organizations more vulnerable than ever.\nHosting valuable assets and applications online leads to a much larger attack surface; hackers can effectively strike from anywhere on the planet. CrowdStrike offers a leading portfolio of solutions to protect the cloud, the endpoint, and user identities, the latter two of which are especially important for organizations with remote workforces.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company's AI and machine learning models are fed 2 trillion events per day, so they continue to improve at a rapid pace. CrowdStrike currently serves over 23,000 customers, and the more it attracts, the faster its models learn and the better its products become.\u00a0\nA 2022 survey by Morgan Stanley\u00a0revealed cybersecurity is the last expense corporate leaders plan to cut, even in the event of a recession. The fact is, this technology is absolutely critical, and as the world becomes increasingly digital, there's no going back.\u00a0\n5. C3.ai: A first-of-its-kind enterprise AI company\nLet it be known: C3.ai (AI -0.41%) is my riskiest, most outlandish\u00a0pick of this bunch, though it's packed with potential. The company is worth just $2.4 billion right now, but it has pioneered a brand-new industry called enterprise artificial intelligence. It sells AI applications to businesses, whether they need ready-made software or an entirely custom solution.\n\nI touched on the potential value of AI earlier in this piece. Ark Investment Management, led by tech investor Cathie Wood, thinks the technology could add $200 trillion in output to the global economy as soon as 2030 through productivity increases in areas like computer programming. If that happens, software providers like C3.ai will have a $14 trillion revenue opportunity.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nC3.ai already provides AI applications to the largest organizations in the world from fossil fuel giant Shell\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Defense. Moreover, the top three cloud computing platforms -- Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud -- have partnered with C3.ai to integrate its AI technology into their own services.\u00a0\nProgrammers using C3.ai on AWS, for example, can build applications 26 times faster than on AWS alone, with 99% less written code required. C3.ai is already delivering the productivity increases Ark is referring to.\nEven if I'm wrong about C3.ai becoming one of the world's most valuable companies by 2050 -- and I very well might be -- there's still room for significant upside in its stock given the disparity between its tiny valuation today and its enormous long-term opportunity.\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

It delivers up to 10x higher performance for applications running terabytes of data, giving quantum-classical researchers unprecedented power to solve the world\u2019s most-complex problems.\nOPX+ is a universal quantum control system, which brings real-time classical compute engines into the heart of the quantum control stack to maximize performance of any QPU and open new possibilities in quantum algorithms. Both the Grace Hopper and OPX+ systems can be scaled to fit the size of the system, from a few-qubit QPU to a quantum-accelerated supercomputer.\nDGX Quantum also equips developers with NVIDIA CUDA Quantum, a powerful unified software stack now available in open source. CUDA Quantum is a hybrid quantum-classical computing platform that enables integration and programming of QPUs, GPUs and CPUs in one system.\nNVIDIA announced a new group of partners integrating CUDA Quantum into their platforms, including quantum hardware companies Anyon Systems, Atom Computing, IonQ, ORCA Computing, Oxford Quantum Circuits, and QuEra; quantum software companies Agnostiq and QMware; and supercomputing centers National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, the IT Center for Science (CSC), and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA).\nWatch NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang discuss NVIDIA DGX Quantum and CUDA Quantum in his GTC keynote.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company\u2019s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling the creation of the metaverse.

NVIDIA has selected OCI as the first hyperscale cloud provider to offer NVIDIA DGX Cloud\u2122, an AI supercomputing service, at massive scale. In addition, NVIDIA is running NVIDIA AI Foundations, its new generative AI cloud services, which are available through DGX Cloud, on OCI.\n\u201cOCI is the first platform to offer an AI supercomputer at scale to thousands of customers across every industry. This is a critical capability as more and more organizations require computing resources for their unique AI use cases. To support this demand, we continue to expand our work with NVIDIA,\u201d said Clay Magouyrk, executive vice president, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\n\u201cThe limitless opportunities for AI-driven innovation are helping transform virtually every business. NVIDIA\u2019s collaboration with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure puts the extraordinary supercomputing performance of NVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing platform within reach of every enterprise,\u201d said Manuvir Das, vice president of enterprise computing, NVIDIA.\n\u00a0\nOCI\u2019s New Supercluster\nNVIDIA DGX Cloud and the NVIDIA AI Foundations services that run on it leverage OCI\u2019s unique Supercluster which was certified by NVIDIA to ensure it meets the high standards of DGX Cloud.\nOCI\u2019s Supercluster includes OCI Compute Bare Metal, an ultra-low latency RoCE cluster based on NVIDIA networking, and a choice of HPC storage. It has been deployed and validated by NVIDIA to support thousands of OCI Compute Bare Metal instances that can efficiently process massively parallel applications. OCI Supercluster networking can now scale up to 4,096 OCI Compute Bare Metal instances with 32,768 A100 GPUs. OCI Compute Bare Metal instances with NVIDIA H100 GPUs are now in limited availability.\nAdditionally, NVIDIA announced that Oracle is adding NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs to its networking stack.\n\u00a0\nGenerative AI Services for Building Custom Enterprise Models\nNVIDIA AI Foundations model-making services span language, images, video and 3D, as well as biology. Enterprises can use the NVIDIA NeMo\u2122 language service and the NVIDIA Picasso image, video and 3D services to build proprietary, domain-specific, generative AI applications for intelligent chat and customer support, professional content creation, digital simulation and more. For biology AI model training and inference, the NVIDIA BioNeMo\u2122 cloud service offers tools to quickly customize and deploy generative AI applications.\nOn OCI, custom models built with NVIDIA AI Foundations and model families like GPT-3 benefit from the OCI Supercluster, which includes purpose-built RDMA networking that delivers near line rate performance with microsecond latency and eliminates blocking issues for RDMA-dependent workloads.\n\u00a0\nAdditional Resources\n\nLearn more about Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\nLearn more about OCI Compute\nLearn more about OCI AI Infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarolin Bachmann\nOracle\ncarolin.bachmann@oracle.com\n+1.415.622.8466\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAbout Oracle\nOracle offers integrated suites of applications plus secure, autonomous infrastructure in the Oracle Cloud.

It had\u00a0too much already on its plate. CEO Jensen Huang brought down the house with his keynote address at the company's renowned GTC conference. Huang talked about the future of the omniverse and Nvidia's place at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI). It was enough for the stock to advance\u00a01% on Wednesday, while the NASDAQ Composite lost 1.6% on the Fed's refusal to cut rates this year. Following several high-profile upgrades to the NVDA price targets among analysts, NVDA has added another 2.2% in Thursday's premarket.\nNvidia stock news: Huang's GTC keynote renews faith in company\u00a0future\nJensen Huang used his keynote address at GTC to make the case that Nvidia is simply the most important company in the world. Whether he talked about generative AI or the sustainability of computing, Huang made a hard sell that Nvidia simply has no peers. Much of his talk focused on Nvidia's supercomputing platform that is housed in Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure data centres. This new product allows companies and researchers to have virtual access to\u00a0state-of-the-art advanced computing from their personal computers.\nAnother large section of the speech was devoted to Nvidia's offerings to the life sciences, manufacturing and physical design industries\u00a0\n\"Whether you're making cars or phones\u00a0or building factories or logistics warehouses, today you have to do things on paper and then translate it to the physical world. As you are building it, you make mistakes and have to do change orders. All of that doesn't have to happen. You can do all of that in digital,\" said Jensen Huang. \"You can then use generative AI to test your project before building it in the physical world,\" which reduces change orders, time to market and delays.\nHuang said that Nvidia is rapidly becoming the primary company that helps companies focused on the physical world build, test and optimize\u00a0their designs before creating anything in the physical world. By allowing testing in the digital world, Huang estimates that Nvidia will save the global economy \"hundreds of billions of dollars\" annually.\nBank of America's Vivek Arya hiked his price target on Nvidia stock from $275 to $310. Arya said Nvidia was now on the road to the \"trillion-dollar\" information technology and \"infrastructure as a service\" arenas. Although it has not been just a chip company for a while now, Arya said it has now solidified its lead in the non-semiconductor realm of industrial software.\nStacy Rasgon, an analyst at\u00a0Bernstein, was impressed by Nvidia's new platform offerings. These included platforms for\u00a0AI video,\u00a0AI image generation,\u00a0large language models\u00a0and\u00a0recommender engines. Many other analysts announced that Nvidia was the company to beat when it comes to the field of generative AI that includes OpenAI's ChatGPT technology.\u00a0\nNvidia stock forecast\nNvidia stock is now staring down the $283.50 resistance level from back in March 2022. The excitement seems real, and Nvidia really has mostly replaced Tesla (TSLA) as the top tech compounder for most long-term holders at this point. That is why it is up more than 145% since mid-October of last year. Support can be found at, or more likely between, $266 and $260. Both of those levels saw plenty of price action respect during 2022. Bears will, however, note that NVDA stock is well into the overbought territory on the Relative Strength Index (RSI). That could mean bulls will soon take profits.\n\nNVDA stock daily chart\n\nShare:\n\n  Feed news\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s range of Jetson boards are not typical Raspberry Pi alternatives. Nvidia\u2019s focus is on entry-level and mainstream AI based robotics, drones and cameras. Its latest board, the $499 Jetson Orin Nano ups the processing power while still keeping the kit compact.The Jetson Orin Nano improves on the Nvidia Maxwell GPU\u2019s 128 CUDA cores with 1024 Ampere GPU based CUDA cores. The extra cores and newer architecture means that the Orin Nano has up to 80 times the AI performance of the Jetson Nano. The six Arm A78AE CPU cores provide almost seven times the performance of the Jetson Nano. The same AI architecture that powers the Jetson AGX Orin module is used in the Orin Nano, but at a much more affordable price.Nvidia shipped me a Jetson Orin Nano sample for review, but due to some logistical issues, the unit arrived with little time for a full review, so here I\u2019ll provide a brief introduction to the board and remark on what I found. Unfortunately, I was unable to do any testing of the main use case for the Orin Nano, inference and machine learning, because what I tried on this beta-level software just did not work for me in the limited time I had it. We\u2019ll publish a full review with inference benchmarks in a few days, after we\u2019ve hopefully been able to get a newer build of the Orin Nano\u2019s software.\u00a0Note that JetPack software provided with the board is a private preview and does not reflect the final software that will be available to consumers. Once the final software release is made available, I\u2019ll provide a full review of the Orin Nano, including its powerful AI capabilities.Jetson Orin Nano Specifications(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Swipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 Jetson Orin NanoJetson NanoCPU6-core Arm Cortex-A78AE v8.2 64-bit CPUQuad-core ARM Cortex-A57 MPCore processor\u00a01.5MB L2 + 4MB L3\u00a0GPUNvidia Ampere architecture with 1024 Nvidia CUDA cores andNvidia Maxwell architecture with 128 Nvidia CUDA cores\u00a032 Tensor cores\u00a0Memory8GB 128-bit LPDDR54 GB 64-bit LPDDR4, 1600MHz 25.6 GB/s\u00a068 GB/s\u00a0StorageMicro SD16 GB eMMC 5.1\u00a0NVMe M.2 via Carrier BoardMicro SDPower7W to 15W (5V Input Voltage)20W (Max 5V at 4 Amps)Dimensions69 x 45 x 21 mm69.6 x 45 x 20 mmJetson Orin Nano Carrier Board Specifications(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Swipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 Jetson Orin NanoJetson NanoCamera2x MIPI CSI-2 22-pin Camera Connectors12 lanes (3x4 or 4x2) MIPI CSI-2 D-PHY 1.1M.2 Key Mx4 PCIe Gen 3\u00a0\u00a0x2 PCIe Gen3\u00a0M.2 Key EPCIe (x1), USB 2.0, UART, I2S, and I2C1 xUSB4 x USB 3.2 Gen24x USB 3.0\u00a01 x Type C for debug and device mode1 x USB 2.0 Micro-BNetworkingGigabit EthernetGigabit Ethernet\u00a0RTL8822CE 802.11ac PCIe Wireless Network Adapter\u00a0DisplayDisplayPort 1.2HDMI 2.0 and eDP 1.4GPIO40 Pin GPIO40 Pin GPIO\u00a012 Pin Button Header\u00a0\u00a04 Pin Fan Header\u00a0PowerDC 9-19V Barrel JackDC Barrel Jack 20W (Max 5V at 4 Amps)Dimensions100 x 79 x 21 mm (Height includes Orin Nano module and cooling solution)100 x 80 x 29mm (Height includes Jetson Nano module and cooling solution)At a passing glance, the Orin Nano and the Jetson Nano look identical. What gives the Orin Nano away are a fan built into a heatsink and the lack of HDMI port. The USB-C port replaces the micro USB of the Jetson Nano. The aforementioned fan is whisper quiet, even when we are running at the full 15W. We ran one of Nvidia\u2019s suggested inference benchmarks and the fan stayed quiet, unlike other fans we have tested on SBCs.Inference TestingRight now this section is short, and not very sweet. Nvidia\u2019s claims that the Orin Nano delivers almost 30 times the performance of the Jetson Nano (that it hopes to improve to 45 times) I was unable to verify.The root causes of this being a short timescale and the private software build. I wanted to demonstrate the Hello AI World example using a Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2, but I ran into camera issues which saw the software encoder not detecting the camera, despite it being listed as compatible. These issues have been raised to Nvidia, and I hope that a future JetPack OS release will resolve these issues.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The Desktop ExperienceRunning JetPack 5, a custom version of Ubuntu 20.04, the 8GB of LPDDR5 and six-core Arm CPU provide enough power for general desktop duties. However, we wouldn\u2019t recommend investing $500 in this board just to use it as a desktop PC.\u00a0First boot was a little slower than we hoped, but Nvidia has stated in the reviewer\u2019s guide that final production units will not have this issue. Another issue we spotted was that only 6.3GB of RAM was available in the preview build. The full 8GB will be available to end users via a fix. The Ubuntu experience was pleasant, with the minimal amount of customization made to the desktop, short of installing tools specific to the strengths of the Orin Nano.Installation of Chromium took a little longer than we would have expected. It seemingly installed the browser via Snap, Canonical's preferred packaging platform. Call us old fashioned, but we still have a lot of love for APT.\u00a0With the installation complete, we opened Chromium and then went to YouTube to watch a couple of HDR and 4K videos. First was LeePSPVideo\u2019s HDR video test, which we set to fullscreen and at 1440p. Video playback was great, as stats for nerds showed a tiny number of frames dropped for the 1440p 30fps video.\u00a0If we hadn't used stats for nerds, we would never have noticed. The next video, a trip around Costa Rica and its wildlife was played at 1440p fullscreen, but this 60 fps video fared worse. It dropped around 4% of the frames over its entire run, the vast majority being at the start of the video. Despite that issue, playback was great.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Missing from the Orin Nano is a dedicated hardware encoder (NVENC). Instead, Nvidia offers a software encoder using the six-core Arm A78AE CPU. This seems like a downgrade from the Jetson Nano, but perhaps the two additional Arm CPU cores are there to make up for it?\u00a0The lack of a hardware encoder also impacts how we use a camera with the Orin Nano. There are two 15 pin CSI connectors on the left side of the carrier board. These are compatible with CSI cables made for the Raspberry Pi Zero. We connected a Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2 to CAM0 and tested a quick script to record video. Sadly this wasn\u2019t to be with our preview build of the OS. Despite the IMX219 sensor of the Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2 being compatible, we never managed to get an image.\u00a0Using the GPIOImage 1 of 3(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The 40 pin GPIO of the Orin Nano is on the right hand side of the carrier board and here is our first issue. What pins are we connecting to? On the Jetson Nano we had the board reference printed as a silkscreen next to the pins.\u00a0For the Orin Nano, we have to flip over the board and perform a feat of mental dexterity to remember where each pin is. This was compounded by the Python examples using a Broadcom (BCM) mapping (Raspberry Pi also uses BCM mappings in all its official tutorials) which required further decoding. The Python module is RPi.GPIO, a module that Raspberry Pi fans will be intimately aware of. Created by Ben Croston, this Python module has powered thousands of Pi projects, and quite a few Jetson projects too. The module has been tweaked to run on the Jetson boards and is as familiar as ever to these eyes. To get around the BCM to BOARD pin mappings we chose the physical (BOARD) pin mappings, despite our years of experience teaching Raspberry Pi based content.\u00a0It worked and we had an LED flashing. The GPIO pins also provide the usual plethora of communication protocols. From simple digital IO to UART, SPI, I2C and I2S.

If a half-decent NVMe drive had instead been used in the M.2 slot, I expect it'd make quite a big difference. The A78 cores should each be multiple times as fast as a Raspberry Pi's A72 cores.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmegajynx\n\n\nMy Switch 2 senses are tingling.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuser7007\n\n\n$500 is disappointing given the jetson nano was more like $130.

My Switch 2 DLSSense is also tingling.\n\nActually, there's this rumor about it using Samsung 5nm.

With only a tiny fraction of the original's IOs, half the memory channels, half the CPU cores, half the GPU units at half the frequency and a quarter of the tensor cores, I doubt Nvidia is putting such a large chip in that just to cut over half its units.\n\nmegajynx said:My Switch 2 senses are tingling.I think this might actually be already shipping the Switch 2's SoC. The Jetson Nano that it replaces used the same Tegra X1 that went into the Switch.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaRoMeTrIc\n\n\nSeeing the price of this kit is dashing my hopes for a new Shield with an Ampere gpu, tensor cores, and a big/little config that can access cores independently. No way we're getting that in the shield now unless they nerf the ampere gpu by half the cuda & tensor cores.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 6 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina will enforce clear flagging of all AI generated content starting from September\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk and OpenAI to fast-track trial to December \u2014 suit aims to stop OpenAI's transition to a for-profit company\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Atari parts store still open after 41 years, has spent $100K+ designing new parts \u2014 last original Atari hardware launched 32 years ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Huawei Kirin X90 chip revealed in state report \u2014 possible server and PC chip set to replace the aging Kunpeng 920 design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoolIT unleashes 4kW single-phase DLC Cold Plate \u2014 Seemingly timed for Nvidia Blackwell Ultra chips\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAkira ransomware can be cracked with sixteen RTX 4090 GPUs in around ten hours \u2014 new counterattack breaks encryption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Flower\u2019s beastly 2800W power supply lands at $899 \u2014 enough juice to power a couple of RTX 5090 GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei's Microsoft Windows license for PCs expires this month, company launching PCs with Harmony OS: Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 50-series GPU scalping extends to system integrators \u2014 over $3,000 for a RTX 5090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel\u2019s new CEO gets a $1 million salary plus $68 million in bonuses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

We\u2019re also deep diving on new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.\nIt\u2019s a celebration, creators!\nBlender, the world\u2019s most popular 3D creation suite \u2014 free and open source \u2014 released its major version 3.5 update. Expected to have a profound impact on 3D creative workflows, this latest release features support for Open Shading Language (OSL) shaders with the NVIDIA OptiX ray-tracing engine.\nPlus, 3D artist and filmmaker Pablo Reche Beltr\u00e1n, aka AuraProds, joins the 50th edition of the In the NVIDIA Studio series this week to share his Jurassic Park-inspired short film. Thank you to the artists who\u2019ve contributed to the series, those who influence and inspire each day and those who will do so in the future.\nFinally, enter the Watch \u2018n Learn Giveaway hosted by creative community 80LV for a chance to win a powerful GeForce RTX 4080 GPU. Enter by watching an Omniverse for creators GTC session, filling out this form, and tagging #GTC23 and @NVIDIAOmniverse on social media by Thursday, March 30.\nBetter Renders in Blender 3.5\nSupporting OSL shaders with NVIDIA OptiX, the Blender update 3.5 now enables 3D artists to use shaders in Cycles and render them on an NVIDIA RTX GPU. Previously, such a workflow was limited to CPU rendering only.\nBlender update 3.5 supports Open Shading Language shaders with NVIDIA OptiX. Image courtesy of Sprite Fright, studio.blender.org.\nThis saves an extraordinary amount of time for artists, as scenes that use OSL can be completely rendered 36x faster than with a CPU alone.\nBlender 3.5 also delivers updates to creative workflows in animation and rigging, nodes and physics, modeling and more.\nRead the full release notes.\nDino-mite Renders Never Go Extinct\n3D artist AuraProds fondly remembers watching the blockbuster movie Jurassic Park in theaters as a kid, wishing to one day recreate a memorable scene in which a giant T-Rex frightens the main characters who are huddled together in a car. Unlike that scary moment, however, the artist\u2019s AuraProds video came together in a rather cute way.\n\u201cThe concept art was made by my five- and eight-year-old cousins,\u201d said AuraProds. \u201cThey drew the dinosaurs and inspired me to turn them into 3D.\u201d\nBased in Almer\u00eda, a small city in southern Spain, AuraProds was perfectly situated to capture video footage in the nearby town of Tabernas, where Hollywood directors often shoot western movies. With the requisite footage captured, AuraProds modeled dinosaurs to populate the scene.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/studio-itns-auraprods-wk50-clip1-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nHis preferred 3D app is Blender. \u201cNo doubt,\u201d said AuraProds. \u201dI really like it because I can bring to 3D any idea in my head with a simple workflow.\u201d\nThe artist modeled and sculpted each dinosaur by hand, using Blender Cycles RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in the viewport for interactive, photorealistic modeling, thanks to his GeForce RTX 4080 GPU.\nDetailed sculpting was done in Blender.\nSatisfied with the models, AuraProds experimented with a variety of textures before moving on to rig and animate his models. Motion-blur visual effects were applied quickly with accelerated rendering and NVIDIA NanoVBD for easier rendering of volumes.\nGeo nodes can add organic style and customization to Blender scenes and animation.\nRTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in Blender Cycles allowed AuraProds to quickly export fully rendered files to Blackmagic Design\u2019s DaVinci Resolve software.\nVisual effects were applied and rendered in Blender.\nHere, AuraProds RTX GPU dramatically accelerated his compositing workflows. GPU-accelerated color grading, video editing and color scopes were applied with ease. And decoding with NVDEC, also GPU accelerated, enabled buttery-smooth playback and scrubbing of high-resolution footage.\n\u201cNVIDIA RTX GPUs are the only technology that could handle the massive amount of polygons for this project. I know from my own experience how reliable the GPUs are.\u201d\u2019 \u2014 AuraProds.\nThe RTX 4080 GPU sped AuraProds use of new AI video editing tools, delivering up to a 2x increase in AI performance over the previous generation. Performance boosts were also applied to existing RTX-accelerated AI features \u2014 including automatic tagging of clips and tracking of effects, SpeedWarp for smooth slow motion and Video Super Resolution.\nAuraProds then applied several AI features to achieve his desired visual effect. He wrapped up the project by deploying the RTX 4080 GPU\u2019s dual AV1 video encoders \u2014 cutting the export time in half.\n\u201cI got to bring that aesthetic and memory to this new digital age with today\u2019s AI tools,\u201d said AuraProds.\n3D artist AuraProds.\nFor more of AuraProds video content, check out VELOX \u2014 a short 3D film shot entirely with a green screen \u2014 made by scanning an entire desert and creating several 3D spaceships over two months, available on his YouTube channel.\n\nExperienced and aspiring content creators can discover exclusive step-by-step tutorials from industry-leading artists, inspiring community showcases and more on the NVIDIA Studio YouTube channel, which includes a curated Blender playlist.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

Being able to process its data faster and more efficiently means tangible improvements in reduced cost (especially cloud costs), increased operational capability and a boost to the carrier\u2019s efforts to be carbon-neutral by 2035. \nNvidia\u2019s hardware and software have been part of how AT&T leans into artificial intelligence capabilities as part of improving its data processing in terms of both speed and utility. Today, the telco announced the continuation of its partnership with Nvidia to incorporate the chip company\u2019s AI offerings for data processing, analytics acceleration, real-time vehicle routing and optimization; digital avatars and conversational AI. \nNvidia says that AT&T is the first telecommunications provider to explore the use of a full suite of its AI offerings. Andy Markus, AT&T\u2019s chief data officer, explained that it\u2019s AT&T\u2019s goal to make AI part of the fabric of the company, to have \u201call parts of the business leveraging AI and creating AI\u201d rather than limit its use to creation of AI by its specialist data scientists. \nSo how is AT&T using Nvidia\u2019s AI solutions in practice? Markus gives one example of fleet management. AT&T, he said, has a fleet of roughly 30,000 vehicles with over 700 million options in how they can be dispatched and routed. The operator would run dispatch optimization algorithms overnight to get plans for the next day, but it took too long and couldn\u2019t account for the realities that would crop up the next morning: Workers calling in sick, vehicles breaking down, and so on. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as good at noon as it was at 8 in the morning,\u201d Markus said. Using Nvidia GPUs and software, he said, AT&T was able to speed up its processing 60x so that it could run the scenario in near-real-time, as often as it needed to and achieve more jobs in a day (as well as reduce its cloud-related costs by 40%). \nNvidia said that in early trials, its cuOpt software delivered solutions in 10 seconds\u2014a fraction of the 1,000 seconds that the same computation took on x86 CPUs. AT&T can now \u201crun nearly continuous dispatch optimization software\u201d through a combination of methods supported by Nvidia RAPIDS. \nMarkus also said that AI-powered Nvidia tools are also helping AT&T to both serve its customers better through various channels, from sales recommendations to customer care; and that its internal processes are leveraging AI as well, to help employees be more efficient. The company is embracing Nvidia\u2019s AI solutions as a foundation for development of interactive and intelligent customer service avatars.\n\u201cIndustries are embracing a new era in which chatbots, recommendation engines andaccelerated libraries for data optimization help produce AI-driven innovations,\u201d said ManuvirDas, VP of enterprise computing at Nvidia. \u201cOur work with AT&T will help thecompany better mine its data to drive new services and solutions for the AI-powered telco.\u201d\nIn the past 12 months, Markus said, AI has created more than $2.5 billion in value for AT&T. About half of that came via Markus\u2019 team, but the other half came from what he calls \u201ccitizen data scientists\u201d across the company who have been able to leverage AI to solve problems in their respective areas, whether than was marketing, software development or finance.\n\u201cAs we mobilize that citizen data-scientist across the company, we\u2019re doing that via a self-service platform that we call AI-as-a-service, where we\u2019re bringing a unified experience together. But behind the experience, we\u2019re allowing those users to leverage AI in a curated way for their use case,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo they bring their subject matter expertise to the problem that they\u2019re trying to solve, and we \u2026 enable the technology [and processes for them to create] robust AI. But we also govern it with some guardrails, so the AI we\u2019re creating is ethical and responsible.\u201d \nAsked about how he sees AT&T\u2019s use of AI evolving, Markus said that he sees when it comes to automation, In AT&T\u2019s automation development, he said, 92% of its automation is created by employees via self-service to solve a problem. \u201cThe goal is that over time, we bake in incredible functionality like Nvidia, so that AI-as-a-service is delivering that self-service functionality so that we do most of our routine AI creation via the platform, where you don\u2019t have to have a professional data scientist, a code warrior, to be your sherpa.\u201d \n\n\n\nFacebookTwitterLinkedin\n\n\n\n\nPrevious articleAnterix sees $3 billion pipeline for private utilities networksNext articleAnritsu Webinar: O-RAN: Evolution, Market Trends, Use Cases + Testing\nAIanalyticsartificial intelligenceAT&TCloudGPUsNvidia\n\n\nABOUT AUTHOR\n\nKelly HillKelly reports on network test and measurement, as well as the use of big data and analytics.

DUBLIN, March 22, 2023...\n\nA strategic collaboration with Cosmo Pharmaceuticals\u00a0 and NVIDIA delivers the GI Genius\u2122 AI Access\u2122 platform designed to accelerate AI innovation for healthcare. \nDUBLIN, March 22, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Medtronic plc (NYSE: MDT), a global leader in healthcare technology,\u00a0today announced Cosmo Pharmaceuticals\u00a0and NVIDIA plan to integrate NVIDIA's AI technologies into the GI Genius\u2122 intelligent endoscopy module\u00a0\u2014 the first FDA-cleared, AI-assisted colonoscopy tool to help physicians detect polyps that can lead to colorectal cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloped and manufactured by Cosmo Pharmaceuticals, GI Genius\u2122 was designed with the ability to host multiple AI algorithms. Now, with the addition of NVIDIA's Holoscan\u00a0and IGX technologies, Cosmo is introducing an Innovation Center website, enabling third-party developers with a cloud-based platform to efficiently train and validate their own AI models with the intent to eventually distribute them through the GI Genius\u2122 module.\n\"The possibility for GI Genius to host multiple real-time AI applications is a game-changer for physicians performing gastrointestinal procedures,\" said Giovanni Di Napoli, president of the Gastrointestinal business at Medtronic. \"With the launch of our AI Access\u2122 platform, we are now able to support developers everywhere and accelerate the creation of real-time AI applications. This technology may allow us to offer clinicians expanded access to these tools, potentially improving patient outcomes. Our ongoing strategic partnership with Cosmo Pharmaceuticals and the integration of cutting-edge NVIDIA AI technologies have made this platform a reality. We believe that the AI Access platform may be a critical tool for advancing medical AI innovation and improving patient care in the years to come.\"\nThe launch of AI Access\u2122 this week\u00a0coincides with the first Medtronic GI Genius\u2122 summit \u2013 hosted at its Operational Headquarters in Minneapolis, MN on March 23, 2023 \u2013 where the company will be showcasing the future of AI in GI, its principles for responsible and ethical development of AI, and its plans for accelerating the market adoption of the technology. This event brings together a mix of clinicians and experts who are actively implementing AI into clinical practice and features panel discussions and podium presentations led by world-renowned gastroenterologists, engineers from both Cosmo and NVIDIA, and the Medtronic leadership team including Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Geoff Martha.\nTo learn more about how Medtronic is harnessing the power of AI and our commitment to the ethical use of artificial intelligence in healthcare go to: https://www.medtronic.com/us-en/our-company/ai-healthcare-technology.html\u00a0\nAbout MedtronicBold thinking.

Along with a slew of product announcements, the presentation, delivered by CEO Jensen Huang always contains a few surprises\n\n10:58AM EDT - Looking at NVIDIA's sizable product stack, NVIDIA is coming off of the launch of their new Hopper and Ada Lovelace GPU architectures for servers and clients respectively. But there are plenty of spots for individual products that remain to be filled. Meanwhile, NVIDIA expects to release their long-awaited Grace CPU this year, and while many of the technical details of that Armv9-based core have since been released, we should hopefully get some launch details for that. As well as its combined CPU+GPU counterpart, Grace Hopper, which places the Grace CPU and Hopper GPU on the same package.\n\n10:58AM EDT -\u00a0 Meanwhile, we're expecting NVIDIA to take a small victory lap at this year's GTC for having the uncanny timing in launching Hopper and its large language model-friendly Transformer Engines right as the market for GPT and other LLMs has exploded. Now it will be interesting to see how NVIDIA intends to further grow (and profit from) those businesses. The company has all but promissed investors that a cloud service play of some kind will be announced at this GTC.\n10:59AM EDT - At this point we're just waiting for the keynote stream to kick off, which should be promptly at 8am\n\n11:00AM EDT - NVIDIA's GTC conference is, bucking the trends, remaining a virtual conference this year\n\n11:01AM EDT - And here we go\n\n\n\n11:01AM EDT - Jensen is immediate diving into the subjects of accelerated computing and AI\n\n11:02AM EDT - New advances in NVIDIA's full stack of services\n\n11:02AM EDT - \"Welcome to GTC\"\n\n11:02AM EDT - Welcoming more than 250K people to this year's virtual conference\n\n11:02AM EDT - 4 years ago the last in-person conference had 8K attendees\n\n\n\n11:03AM EDT - \"650 amazing talks\"\n\n11:04AM EDT - And quickly covering a list of subjects covered in this year's talks\n\n\n\n\n\n11:05AM EDT - \"The purpose of GTC is to inspire the world on the art of what's possible with accelerated computing\"\n\n11:05AM EDT - Now rolling NVIDIA's latest \"I am AI\" video\n\n\n\n\n\n11:08AM EDT - And, of course, NVIDIA has used AI to put together parts of this video (as they have done for a couple of years now)\n\n11:08AM EDT - \"Accelerated computing is not easy\"\n\n\n\n11:09AM EDT - Accelerated applications can enjoy speed ups and scale ups across many systems\n\n11:09AM EDT - Giving a 1 million-fold increase in performance over the last decade in certain tasks\n\n\n\n\n\n11:10AM EDT - Using then-and-now comparison of AlexNet and GPT-3 as a comparison of the number of FP operations required to train the respective neural nets\n\n11:10AM EDT - And of course, GPT is all the rage now\n\n11:11AM EDT - \"Several thousand applications aare now NVIDIA accelerated\"\n\n\n\n11:11AM EDT - And NVIDIA has established a cycle of users, applications, and developers to make an active ecosystem\n\n11:12AM EDT - A big part of laying this groundwork has been NVIDIA providing so many libraries for different tasks\n\n11:12AM EDT - Jensen is going through some of those libraries now\n\n\n\n11:13AM EDT - NVIDIA is continuing their work with quantum computing and their cuQuantum library\n\n\n\n11:13AM EDT - Which is being used to help simulate quantum computers\n\n11:14AM EDT - Today NVIDIA is announcing a quantum control link which allows connecting NV GPUs to quantum computers for error correction (of the quantum computer)\n\n\n\n11:15AM EDT - Now on to Spark RAPIDS and vector databases\n\n11:15AM EDT - Introducing a new library: RAFT\n\n\n\n11:16AM EDT - For further accelerating vector databases\n\n11:17AM EDT - (As a general reminder, NVIDIA has more software engineers than it does hardware engineers.

The best we can possibly do is to only raise prices by 20% on the consumer side.

None! Zero!\n\n\n\nlilkwarrior - Tuesday, March 21, 2023 - link\n\u2026Your lack of business acumen is showing. A good business\u2013similarly to a person who manages their skillset in the open market well\u2013aligns the times, the state of the market, and the most lucrative demands most sensible to what they bring to the table.Nvidia nor any company cares about sticking to a audience base if it doesn't serve them to make the most revenue or keep the doors open anymore. \n\n\n\nSystemsBuilder - Tuesday, March 21, 2023 - link\nI can assure you there is nothing wrong with my business acumen. Decades of business management experience severs me very well in my assessment of Nivdia above. Expecting customers and partners to forget everything from last year(s) and fully embrace this years slogans.But likely, you are a Nvidia marketer or similar, so I bet we will not get a lot of self assessment or, god forbid, self criticism. Market Management by slogans comes to mind, using terms like \"this years strategy\" and other oxymorons. If you need further clarification, I advice you to go back to business school and read Porter all over again.\n\n\n\nGothmoth - Wednesday, March 22, 2023 - link\nno shit sherlock....but there are some companys an then there is ngreedia.\n\n\n\nlemurbutton - Tuesday, March 21, 2023 - link\nThey never pushed their products for crypto. \n\n\n\nmode_13h - Thursday, March 23, 2023 - link\nUm, they had an entire product line of crypto-focused cards!\n\n\n\nedzieba - Wednesday, March 22, 2023 - link\n\"Remember how hard they pushed their products for crypto just a few year(s) ago.\"If by \"pushed hard\" you mean never mentioned it in a keynote or other presentation, tried (though failed) to limit its use in their general purpose GPUs, and tossed out some lowest-binned chips to the mining market? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

offering aims to help enterprises build and run AI models that generate text, graphics, and even proteins. \t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCredit:

CEO Jensen Huang (pictured) told attendees at the company\u2019s online-only developer conference, GTC 2023, about a string of new services Nvidia hopes enterprises will use to train and run their own generative AI models.\nWhen they hit the market, they\u2019ll open up more options along the build-vs-buy continuum for CIOs called upon to support AI training workloads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean CIOs can just hand off responsibility for AI infrastructure, said Shane Rau, a research VP covering data processing chips for IDC.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCIOs should already understand that AI is not one-size-fits-all,\u201d he said. \u201cThe AI solution stack varies according to how it will be used, which implies one must have intimate understanding of the AI use case \u2014 your AI workers and the end domain in which they work \u2014 and how to map the needs of the use case to the silicon, software, system hardware, and services.\u201d\nNvidia is offering as-a-service solutions to those problems at several levels. Nvidia AI Foundations is a family of cloud services with which enterprises will be able to build their own large language models (LLMs), the technologies at the heart of generative AI systems, and run them at scale, calling them from enterprise applications via Nvidia\u2019s APIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be three Foundations services at launch, still in limited access or private preview for now: NeMo for generating text, Picasso for visuals, and BioNeMo for molecular structures. Each offering will include pre-trained models, data processing frameworks, personalization databases, inference engines, and APIs that enterprises can access from a browser, Nvidia said.\nGenerative AI in action\nFinancial data provider Morningstar is already studying how it can use test-based NeMo to extract useful information about markets from raw data, drawing on the expertise of its staff to tune the models, according to Nvidia.\nThe Picasso service will enable enterprises to train models to generate custom images, videos, and even 3D models in the cloud. Nvidia is partnering with Adobe to deliver such generative capabilities inside Adobe\u2019s tools for creative professionals such as Photoshop and After Effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is seeking to clean up graphical generative AI\u2019s reputation for playing fast and loose with the rights of the artists and photographers on whose works the models are trained. There are concerns that using such models to create derivative work could expose enterprises to lawsuits for breach of copyright. Nvidia hopes to allay those concerns by striking a licensing deal with stock image library Getty Images, which says it will pay royalties to artists on revenue generated by models trained on the works in its database.\nNvidia is working with another library, Shutterstock, to train Picasso to create 3D models in response to text prompts based on licensed images in its database. These 3D designs will be available for use in industrial digital twins running on Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse platform.\nThe third AI Foundations service, BioNeMo, deals not in words and images but in molecular structures. Researchers can use it to design new molecules and predict their behavior. Nvidia is targeting it at pharmaceutical firms for drug discovery and testing, fine-tuning it with proprietary data. It named biotechnology company Amgen as one of the first users of the service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI infrastructure additions\nNvidia\u2019s AI Foundations software services will run in DGX Cloud, a new infrastructure-as-a-service offering.\nDGX is the name of Nvidia\u2019s supercomputer in a box, one of the first of which was delivered to OpenAI, developer of ChatGPT, in 2016. Half of all Fortune 100 companies now have their own DGX supercomputers, according to Nvidia.\nCloud providers such as Oracle and Microsoft are beginning to offer access to the H100 processors on which the DGX is built, and Amazon Web Services will soon join them, Nvidia said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLater this year, enterprises that don\u2019t want to buy their own DGX supercomputer will have the option of renting clusters of those H100 processors by the month through the DGX Cloud service, which will be hosted by Nvidia\u2019s hyperscaler partners.\nCIOs are likely already using hardware, software, and perhaps services from Nvidia to support AI-enabled applications in the enterprise, but the company\u2019s move deeper into the as-a-service market raises new questions, said IDC\u2019s Rau. \n\u201cHaving\u00a0Nvidia\u00a0as a service provider will likely mean a single source of responsibility for the service and a familiar underlying solution architecture,\u201d he said. \u201cBut relying on\u00a0Nvidia\u00a0for service and the underlying solution architecture offers the prospect of costly lock-in should other service and solution architecture providers innovate faster on some measure, like performance or cost.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRelated content\n\n \n\n\nTip\n\n5 ways for CIOs to deal with AI proliferation\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Nicholas D.

The talk was recorded a day after the launch of GPT-4, the most powerful AI model to date from OpenAI, the research company Sutskever co-founded.\nThey talked at length about GPT-4 and its forerunners, including ChatGPT. That generative AI model, though only a few months old, is already the most popular computer application in history.\nTheir conversation touched on the capabilities, limits and inner workings of the deep neural networks that are capturing the imaginations of hundreds of millions of users.\nCompared to ChatGPT, GPT-4 marks a \u201cpretty substantial improvement across many dimensions,\u201d said Sutskever, noting the new model can read images as well as text.\n\u201cIn some future version, [users] might get a diagram back\u201d in response to a query, he said.\nUnder the Hood With GPT\n\u201cThere\u2019s a misunderstanding that ChatGPT is one large language model, but there\u2019s a system around it,\u201d said Huang.\nIn a sign of that complexity, Sutskever said OpenAI uses two levels of training.\nThe first stage focuses on accurately predicting the next word in a series. Here, \u201cwhat the neural net learns is some representation of the process that produced the text, and that\u2019s a projection of the world,\u201d he said.\nThe second \u201cis where we communicate to the neural network what we want, including guardrails \u2026 so it becomes more reliable and precise,\u201d he added.\nPresent at the Creation\nWhile he\u2019s at the swirling center of modern AI today, Sutskever was also present at its creation.\nIn 2012, he was among the first to show the power of deep neural networks trained on massive datasets. In an academic contest, the AlexNet model he demonstrated with AI pioneers Geoff Hinton and Alex Krizhevsky recognized images faster than a human could.\nHuang referred to their work as the Big Bang of AI.\nThe results \u201cbroke the record by such a large margin, it was clear there was a discontinuity here,\u201d Huang said.\nThe Power of Parallel Processing\nPart of that breakthrough came from the parallel processing the team applied to its model with GPUs.\n\u201cThe ImageNet dataset and a convolutional neural network were a great fit for GPUs that made it unbelievably fast to train something unprecedented,\u201d Sutskever said.\n\nThat early work ran on a few GeForce GTX 580 GPUs in a University of Toronto lab. Today, tens of thousands of the latest NVIDIA A100 and H100 Tensor Core GPUs in the Microsoft Azure cloud service handle training and inference on models like ChatGPT.\n\u201cIn the 10 years we\u2019ve known each other, the models you\u2019ve trained [have grown by] about a million times,\u201d Huang said. \u201cNo one in computer science would have believed the computation done in that time would be a million times larger.\u201d\n\u201cI had a very strong belief that bigger is better, and a goal at OpenAI was to scale,\u201d said Sutskever.\nA Billion Words\nAlong the way, the two shared a laugh.\n\u201cHumans hear a billion words in a lifetime,\u201d Sutskever said.\n\u201cDoes that include the words in my own head,\u201d Huang shot back.\n\u201cMake it 2 billion,\u201d Sutskever deadpanned.\nThe Future of AI\nThey ended their nearly hour-long talk discussing the outlook for AI.\nAsked if GPT-4 has reasoning capabilities, Sutskever suggested the term is hard to define and the capability may still be on the horizon.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep seeing systems that astound us with what they can do,\u201d he said. \u201cThe frontier is in reliability, getting to a point where we can trust what it can do, and that if it doesn\u2019t know something, it says so,\u201d he added.\n\u201cYour body of work is incredible \u2026 truly remarkable,\u201d said Huang in closing the session. \u201cThis has been one of the best beyond Ph.D. descriptions of the state of the art of large language models,\u201d he said.\nTo get all the news from GTC, watch the keynote below.\n\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Cloud Services | GTC 2023 | GTC Digital | High-Performance Computing | Inception | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | Parallel Computing | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Dave Altavilla is a Tech Analyst covering chips, compute and AI.Follow AuthorMar 21, 2023, 12:46pm EDTShareSaveCommentNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang Speaking At GTC 2023NVIDIA\nWhile virtually all of the industry is buzzing about AI, accelerated computing and AI powerhouse NVIDIA has just announced a new software library, called cuLitho, that promises an exponential acceleration in chip design development times, as well as reduced chip fab data center carbon footprint and the ability to push the boundaries of bleeding-edge semiconductor design. In fact, NVIDIA cuLitho has already been adopted by the world\u2019s top chip foundry, TSMC, leading EDA chip design tools company Synopsys and chip manufacturing equipment maker ASML.\n\nNVIDIA GPU Chip With Dies ExposedNVIDIA\nSemiconductor Chip Photolithography Is Now Computationally Accelerated\nPhotolithography, or the actual process of patterning a chip on a semiconductor wafer, is an intricate process that utilizes ultraviolet light and a photomask to expose a geometric chip design onto a substrate material like silicon. The problem, as these photomasks get more complex with tinier transistor and wire connectivity, is that designing mask sets has become hugely compute-intensive.\n\nPhoto Lithography Chip Design Patterning TechnologyTSMC\nYears ago, NVIDIA introduced the CUDA programming language for GPU-accelerated apps and software. cuLitho is essentially a library extension of CUDA, optimized for computational photolithography acceleration. In fact, the company claims that cuLitho accelerated on GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) will bring up to a 40X lift over legacy lithography processing, while also reducing the consumption of billions of CPU hours required for this critical chip fab process. NVIDIA claims 500 of its DGX H100 servers can do the computational work of 40,000 CPU servers by running all parts of the process in parallel for a huge reduction in power requirements, which can have enormous environmental impact as well.\n\n\nOr put another way, chip fabs like TSMC utilizing cuLitho could produce photomasks overnight, that otherwise typically would take two weeks to process.\n\n\u201cThe chip industry is the foundation of nearly every other industry in the world,\u201d notes Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cWith lithography at the limits of physics, NVIDIA\u2019s introduction of cuLitho and collaboration with our partners TSMC, ASML and Synopsys allows fabs to increase throughput, reduce their carbon footprint and set the foundation for 2nm and beyond.\u201d\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\ncuLitho Early Adoption And Key TakeawaysNVIDIA cuLitho Early Adoption PartnersNVIDIA\n\n\nIndustry partners like EDA design tools bellwether Synopsys are chiming in as well, with respect to the adoption of cuLitho and what it can do for their customers that may want to take advantage of the technology. \u201cComputational lithography, specifically optical proximity correction, or OPC, is pushing the boundaries of compute workloads for the most advanced chips,\u201d said Aart de Geus, chair and CEO of Synopsys. \u201cBy collaborating with our partner NVIDIA to run Synopsys OPC software on the cuLitho platform, we massively accelerated the performance from weeks to days! The team-up of our two leading companies continues to force amazing advances in the industry.\"\nAs semiconductor fab process nodes get smaller, requiring finer geometry, more complex calculation and photomask patterning, offloading and accelerating these workloads with GPUs makes a lot of sense. In addition, as Moore\u2019s Law continues to slow, cuLitho will also accelerate additional cutting-edge technologies like high NA EUV Lithography, which is expected to help print the extremely tiny and complex features of chips being fabricated at 2nm and smaller.\nI personally expect cuLitho to be another inflection point for NVIDIA. If the chip fab industry shifts to this technology, the company will have a huge new revenue pipeline for its DGX H100 servers and GPU platforms, just like it did when it seeded academia with GPUs and its CUDA programming language in Johnny Appleseed fashion to accelerate AI. NVIDIA is now far and away the AI processing leader, and it could be setting itself up for similar dominance in semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure as well.\nDisclosure: I currently have a small long position in shares of NVDA, but in no way does this affect my reporting on this company.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

(Nasdaq: BMR) -- Today, Beamr is announcing that its video encoding technology, which enables significant reduction in video bitrate while maintaining visual quality, officially supports NVIDIA GPU acceleration, offering up to 10x faster encoding speed on NVIDIA GPUs compared to CPUs.\n\n\nContinue Reading\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning Beamr on NVIDIA GPUs in real time can improve storage and bitrate efficiency, while maintaining video quality\n\nPost this\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n        Beamr teams with NVIDIA to accelerate Beamr technology using NvEnc, the powerful encoder found in NVIDIA's GPUs.\r\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeamr's optimization was previously required to be run offline for an entire content library to benefit from large video file size reduction before being able to stream it. Businesses running Beamr on NVIDIA GPUs can now benefit in real time from storage and bitrate gains for live video streams, preserving quality for optimal user experience.\n\nBeamr on NVIDIA GPU supports AVC, HEVC and royalty-free AV1, spanning across the three leading video codec standards available on the market, serving all needs up to 8K HDR quality. NVIDIA GPUs are available on all major cloud platforms.\n\"Working closely with NVIDIA for the past two years, we are thrilled to offer a real-time video optimization solution that delivers up to 10x performance at an affordable cost. With our recent NASDAQ introduction, we plan to develop a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) with highly competitive pricing, making video optimization accessible to everyone at blazing speed thanks to our collaboration with NVIDIA,\" said Sharon Carmel, Founder and CEO of Beamr.\"NVIDIA has provided GPU-accelerated video encoding technology for over a decade, and now we are opening our API to allow more custom control of our hardware,\" said Bob Pette, vice president of professional visualization at NVIDIA. \"Beamr is the first to adopt this technology, and combining high-performance NVIDIA GPU video encoding with Beamr's technology will provide content providers with significant bitrate and storage reduction without compromising on livestreaming quality.\"50 enterprise customers are already using the Beamr platform. The company expects the launch of its new SaaS service, with beta planned in Q3 2023, to attract a large number of new customers.About\u00a0BeamrBeamr (Nasdaq: BMR) is the world leader in content adaptive video solutions. Backed by 53 granted patents, and winner of the 2021 Technology and Engineering Emmy\u00ae award and the 2021 Seagate Lyve Innovator of the Year award, Beamr's perceptual optimization technology enables up to a 50% reduction in bitrate with guaranteed quality.\u00a0www.beamr.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" that are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties.

Moore23 Mar 202330 Mar 20244 min readSamuel K. Moore is IEEE Spectrum\u2019s semiconductor editor.\n        Nvidia\n    UPDATE 18 MARCH 2024: Today at Nvidia\u2019s developer conference, GTC, leading chip foundry TSMC and electronic design automation company Synopsys each say they are moving cuLitho into production. This follows 12 months of joint work with Nvidia, cuLitho\u2019s inventor. Additionally, Nvidia reported that the addition of generative AI to the inverse lithography system doubles performance.Nvidia had plenty more to announce at GTC, including its new Blackwell B200 GPU and a foundation model for humanoid robots. \u2014IEEE SpectrumOriginal article from 23 March 2023 follows:Nvidia says it has found a way to speed up a computation-limited step in the chipmaking process so that it happens 40 times as fast as today\u2019s standard. Called inverse lithography, it\u2019s a key tool that allows chipmakers to print nanometer-scale features using light with a longer wavelength than the size of those features. Inverse lithography\u2019s use has been limited by the massive size of the needed computation. Nvidia\u2019s answer, cuLitho, is a set of algorithms designed for use with GPUs, turns what has been two weeks of work into an overnight job.The technology \u201cwill allow fabs to increase throughput, reduce their carbon footprint, and set the foundations for 2-nanometer [manufacturing processes] and beyond,\u201d said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at the Nvidia GTC developer conference on Tuesday.Leading logic-chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) will be qualifying cuLitho\u2019s use in production starting in June, said Huang. Design automation software firm Synopsys plans to integrate software, too, and lithography equipment maker ASML plans to support cuLitho in its products as well.Photolithography is basically the first step in the chipmaking process. It involves bouncing light off of a pattern called a photomask to project the forms of transistor structures and interconnects onto the wafer. (More mature technology uses transmissive photomasks instead of reflective ones, but the idea is the same.) It takes 98 photomasks to make an H100 GPU, Jensen said. The features projected from the photomask are smaller than the wavelength of light used\u2014193 nanometers for the relatively large features and 13.5 nm for the finer bits. So, without the aid of tricks and design rules\u2014collectively called optical proximity correction\u2014you\u2019d get only a blurry mess projected onto the wafer. But with optical proximity correction, the designs on the photomask only vaguely resemble the pattern of light on the chip.With the need for finer and finer features, the corrected shapes on the photomask have become more and more elaborate and difficult to come up with. It would be much better to start with the pattern you want on the wafer and then calculate what pattern on the photomask would produce them. Such a scheme is called inverse lithography. Simple as it sounds, it\u2019s quite difficult to compute, often taking weeks to compile.In fact, it\u2019s such a slog that it\u2019s often reserved for use on only a few critical layers of leading-edge chips or just particularly thorny bits of them, according to data from the E-Beam Initiative, which periodically surveys the industry.As chipmaking required finer and finer features, engineers had to produce more and more complex designs to project those features onto the silicon. Inverse lithography (ILT) is the latest development.NvidiaThe long computation time for lithography slows the development and improvement of chip technology Even a change to the thickness of a material can lead to the need for a new set of photomasks, notes Vivek K. Singh, vice president in the advanced technology group working on silicon manufacturing at Nvidia. Computing masks \u201chas been a long pole in chip development,\u201d he says. \u201cIf inverse lithography technology were sped up 40 times, would more companies use it on more layers? Surely.\u201dPart of the computation is an image problem that\u2019s a natural fit for GPUs, says Singh. But at most, that can only cut the computation time in half. The rest is not so easy to make parallel. But over the past four years, with development partners including TSMC, Nvidia engineers have come up with a collection of algorithms for making the remaining work parallel and have packaged it as a software library for use with GPUs.According to Nvidia, using the cuLitho lets 500 Nvidia DGX H100 computers do the work of 40,000 CPU systems. It can produce three to five times as many photomasks per day, drawing only 5 megawatts instead of 35 MW.What\u2019s more, the technology may deliver better results, according to Singh. CuLitho produces otherwise hard-to-calculate curvy polygons on the mask, which results in a greater depth of focus for the pattern cast onto the wafer. That depth of focus should lead to less variation across the wafer and therefore a greater yield of working chips per wafer, he says. In future, it also could mean fewer photomasks are needed; with inverse lithography, what must now be done with a double pattern might work with only one.Nvidia is not the first to look to GPUs to accelerate inverse lithography technology. Silicon Valley-based D2S announced a GPU-based computer custom built for the problem in 2019. IEEE Spectrum reached out to D2S for comment, but the company did not reply before press time.From Your Site ArticlesCustom Computer Makes Inverse Lithography Technology Practical for First Time \u203aNvidia Announces GR00T, a Foundation Model For Humanoids - IEEE Spectrum \u203aRelated Articles Around the WebInverse Lithography Technology \u2013 A Status Update from TSMC ... \u203aInverse lithography - Wikipedia \u203ajensen huangtsmceuvphotolithographysemiconductor manufacturingnvidiaextreme ultraviolet lithographyinverse lithographychip manufacturingSamuel K.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Chief Analyst & CEO, NAND Research. Follow AuthorMar 20, 2023, 03:34pm EDTShareSaveCommentNVIDIAGetty Images\nArtificial Intelligence is having a moment. It\u2019s impossible to escape the flurry of activity around generative AI, with nearly every technology company hurrying to incorporate large language models into their offerings. Microsoft, a long-time investor in OpenAI, the firm behind ChatGPT, last week showed us just how significantly large language models are going to change the user experience for its office products. It\u2019s compelling.\n\n\nBut AI is more than just large language models, as we'll be reminded this week at Nvidia's annual GTC conference. AI is changing how we think about everything from retail loss prevention to medical diagnosis. Anywhere that the interpretation of data can lead to enhanced value is ripe for experimentation with AI.\n\nNVIDIA lives at the center of this revolution. Its GPUs are the most common, and most powerful, in the industry. Beyond its hardware, NVIDIA is enabling the adoption of AI with software tools that span the gamut from edge inference to autonomous driving to medical imaging. The list truly is limitless. The wonderful thing is that much of Nvidia\u2019s software is free for the taking. It just needs an NVIDIA GPU to truly deliver.\n\n\nThe Pull of Generative AI\nGenerative AI, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, drives strong demand for the latest generation of NVIDIA accelerators. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang told us that accelerator sales directly tied to inference for large language models have \"gone through the roof\" to the point where NVIDIA\u2019s view of the technology has \"dramatically changed\" as a result of the past three months of activity in the space.\n\nIt takes a lot of resources to handle even inference tasks for Generative AI, making it cost-prohibitive for smaller companies, and leading to large CapEx spend for enterprises. This is where the cloud makes sense. Jensen agrees, saying that CSPs are driving tremendous demand and that we're just getting started.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nIn Jensen's view, the CSPs enable AI \"factories\" where the final product is intelligence. These factories will be a blend of on-prem and cloud, but the cloud is leading the charge.\nNvidia in the Cloud\n\nOne of the challenges of working with state-of-the-art machine learning is that the hardware is relatively expensive. NVIDIA doesn't publish pricing for its high-end accelerators, but estimates suggest the price of its latest generation Hopper-based GH100 is near $30,000. That's a lot of capital to invest, assuming you can even find one of these accelerators. This is where the public cloud really shines.\n\n\nEvery cloud service provider (CSP) offers accelerated instances based on NVIDIA products, many of which date back multiple generations. At the high end, Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud offer instance types based on the Nvidia A100 accelerator. Each of these CSPs will also very soon provide the newest generation H100. Azure is already in preview with the new instance types.\nAccording to Liftr Insights, the leading data service that tracks cloud instances across the top six global CSPs, Nvidia GPUs account for over 93% of GPU-accelerated instance types in the public cloud. Of those, the vast majority are based on NVIDIA\u2019s Ampere architecture; these include NVIDIA\u2019s A100, A10G, and A10 accelerators. Soon, this will include the new H100 accelerator.NVIDIA Cloud OfferingsNVIDIA\nThe market is responding to the cloud-driven AI model. During NVIDIA\u2019S latest earnings call, CFO Colette Kress told us that \u201cRevenue growth from CSP customers last year significantly outpaced that of Data Center as a whole, as more enterprise customers moved to a cloud-first approach. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, CSP customers drove about 40% of our Data Center revenue.\u201d That\u2019s significant.\nMs. Kress went on to say that, on a revenue basis, demand for the new H100 accelerator in the fourth quarter of 2022 was already \u201cmuch higher\u201d than that of the A100.\nNVIDIA DGX Cloud\nNVIDIA introduced its turnkey DGX \u201cdeep learning supercomputer\u201d back in 2017, and has continuously updated it as new generation accelerators are introduced. The latest generation, the NVIDIA DGX H100, is a powerful machine. Incorporating eight NVIDIA H100 GPUs with 640 Gigabytes of total GPU memory, along with two 56-core variants of the latest Intel Xeon processor, and all tied together with NVIDIA\u2019s NVLink interconnects, the machine can deliver 32 petaFLOPS of performance.NVIDIA DGX H100NVIDIA\nDuring its most recent earnings call, Jensen announced that the DGX machine will be available directly through the CSP community as NVIDIA\u2019s \u201cDGX Cloud.\u201d He said that \u201cNVIDIA DGX is an AI supercomputer and a blueprint of AI factories being built around the world. AI supercomputers are hard and time consuming to build, and today we\u2019re announcing the Nvidia DGX Cloud, the fastest and easiest way to have your own DGX AI supercomputer. Just open your browser.\u201d\nThis powerful option lowers the entry barrier for both AI researchers and commercial entities looking to take advantage of leading-edge AI technology. Before DGX Cloud, IT administrators were forced to assemble their AI infrastructure from the public cloud offerings. DGX cloud removes a level of complexity from that process.DGX Cloud BenefitsNVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u2019s DGX comes in several a range of options. The offerings include the stand-alone NVIDIA DGX A100 and H100 systems, the NVIDIA DGX BasePOD reference architecture, and the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD turnkey AI data center solution. Our current understanding of DGX cloud is that it is the DGX H100 that the CSPs are offering.\nNVIDIA and Oracle Cloud\nDGX Cloud will be available first through Oracle Cloud. Its OCI Supercluster provides a purpose-built RDMA network, bare-metal compute and high-performance local and block storage that can scale to superclusters of over 32,000 GPUs. Azure will follow. NVIDIA told us that DGX Cloud instances will start at $36,999 per instance per month.\nBeyond DGX Cloud, Oracle is also embracing NVIDIA\u2019s BlueField 3 DPUs to help accelerate its infrastructure. BlueField-3 is NVIDIA\u2019s third-generation data processing unit that enables enterprises to build software-defined, hardware-accelerated IT infrastructures from cloud to data center to edge\nThe DPUs support Ethernet and InfiniBand connectivity at up to 400 gigabits per second and provide 4x more compute power, up to 4x faster crypto acceleration, 2x faster storage processing and 4x more memory bandwidth compared to the previous generation of BlueField.\nOracle is making BlueField-accelerated networking available to its OCI customers. This provides a powerful new option for Oracle\u2019s cloud customers to offload data center tasks from CPUs.\nAnalyst\u2019s Take\nNVIDIA\u2019s data center business now eclipses its gaming business. The company spent the past two decades strategically investing in enabling enterprise AI. Its remarkably simple to leverage the tools provided by NVIDIA to build a system for a range of AI-enabled applications. This is true at the industrial edge. It's equally valid in the highest-performance deep learning clusters that you imagine.\nNVIDIA's strength is equal parts hardware engineering and software enablement. The company's diverse range of cloud-native software is what makes it easy. However, it's NVIDIA's hardware that makes it performant.\nDelivering DGX directly to users through public partners who are already bringing goodness to NVIDIA's bottom-line makes a lot of sense. This model brings a cloud-like efficiency to high-performance AI. The CSPs absorb the capital expense while amortizing it over a broad customer base, while end-customers gain affordable access.\nAs NVIDIA GTC kicks off this week, I'm anxious to learn more about the DGX cloud. Beyond that, I'm intrigued by where all this innovation leads us. The amount of activity spawned by large language models in the past six months has been mind-boggling. Tying that together with everything else in the AI universe hints at limitless possibilities, possibilities that can only be fulfilled with the continuous innovation of NVIDIA.\nEdited after publication to include new details from NVIDIA\u2019s GTC 2023 Keynote. \nDisclosure: Steve McDowell is an industry analyst, and NAND Research an industry analyst firm, that engages in, or has engaged in, research, analysis, and advisory services with many technology companies, which may include those mentioned in this article.

Photograph: Tyrone Siu/ReutersCryptocurrencies This article is more than 1 year oldCryptocurrencies add nothing useful to society, says chip-maker NvidiaThis article is more than 1 year oldTech chief says the development of chatbots is a more worthwhile use of processing power than crypto miningAlex HernSun 26 Mar 2023 16.21 BSTShareThe US chip-maker Nvidia has said cryptocurrencies do not \u201cbring anything useful for society\u201d despite the company\u2019s powerful processors selling in huge quantities to the sector.Michael Kagan, its chief technology officer, said other uses of processing power such as the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT were more worthwhile than mining crypto.Nvidia never embraced the crypto community with open arms. In 2021, the company even released software that artificially constrained the ability to use its graphics cards from being used to mine the popular Ethereum cryptocurrency, in an effort to ensure supply went to its preferred customers instead, who include AI researchers and gamers.Kagan said the decision was justified because of the limited value of using processing power to mine cryptocurrencies.The first version ChatGPT was trained on a supercomputer made up of about 10,000 Nvidia graphics cards.\u201cAll this crypto stuff, it needed parallel processing, and [Nvidia] is the best, so people just programmed it to use for this purpose. They bought a lot of stuff, and then eventually it collapsed, because it doesn\u2019t bring anything useful for society. AI does,\u201d Kagan told the Guardian.\u201cWith ChatGPT, everybody can now create his own machine, his own programme: you just tell it what to do, and it will. And if it doesn\u2019t work the way you want it to, you tell it \u2018I want something different\u2019.\u201dCrypto, by contrast, was more like high-frequency trading, an industry that had led to a lot of business for Mellanox, the company Kagan founded before it was acquired by Nvidia.\u201cWe were heavily involved in also trading: people on Wall Street were buying our stuff to save a few nanoseconds on the wire, the banks were doing crazy things like pulling the fibres under the Hudson taut to make them a little bit shorter, to save a few nanoseconds between their datacentre and the stock exchange,\u201d he said.\u201cI never believed that [crypto] is something that will do something good for humanity. You know, people do crazy things, but they buy your stuff, you sell them stuff. But you don\u2019t redirect the company to support whatever it is.\u201dOriginally best known for producing powerful graphics cards for PC gamers to play the latest games, it was almost by chance that Nvidia\u2019s products took their place at the heart of the AI boom.The computationally intensive work of training a new AI system, which can take millions of billions of dollars-worth of computing power, happened to work significantly faster on the types of simple yet powerful processors that had been adopted by gamers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Inferencing is key to the development of everything from customer service chatbots to AI-powered avatars and video analysis in manufacturing quality control environments.\nCompanies require massive computing resources to power AI inferencing, and that\u2019s where Nvidia comes in with its extremely powerful graphics processing units. Today it announced its latest generation of Nvidia DGX platforms incorporating its new Nvidia H100 GPUs\u00a0(pictured). The H100 GPUs are based on the Nvidia Hopper architecture and feature a built-in Transformer Engine that\u2019s optimized for developing, training and deploying generative AI, large language models and AI recommender systems. According to the company, the H100 enables AI training at up to nine times faster than its previous-generation GPUs, with up to 30 times faster AI inference on LLMs.\nAlongside the H100 GPUs, Nvidia also revealed a new generation of specialized AI accelerators and inferencing chips, a new data center processing unit, and advances in the field of computational lithography.\nNvidia DGX H100 GPUs\nCustomers can access the new H100 GPUs in the latest Nvidia DGX H100 platform. It\u2019s powered by eight H100 GPUs linked with Nvidia\u2019s NVLink high-speed interconnects and Quantum InfiniBand and Spectrum Ethernet networking. Altogether, the platform provides 32 petaflops of compute performance, Nvidia said, with networking speeds that are twice as fast as the previous DGX A100 platform.\nThe DGX H100 is integrated with the complete Nvidia AI software stack, including the latest edition of Nvidia AI Enterprise and Nvidia Base Command, which serves as its operating system.\nEnterprises won\u2019t need to acquire their own DGX H100 platform though, for they can also access the H100 GPUs in the cloud through a number of partners, including Oracle Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Amazon Web Services Inc. All three cloud providers have announced services and instances powered by the H100 GPU. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms Inc. said it has deployed hundreds of H100 GPUs in its new Grand Teton AI supercomputer for internal use by its AI production and research teams.\n\u201cGenerative AI\u2019s incredible potential is inspiring virtually every industry to reimagine its business strategies and the technology required to achieve them,\u201d Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in a keynote address. \u201cNvidia and our partners are moving fast to provide the world\u2019s most powerful AI computing platform to those building applications that will fundamentally transform how we live, work and play.\u201d\nNvidia said the DGX H100 platform is available now worldwide, while Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure are now offering access in private preview. AWS, along with Google Cloud, are expected to provide access soon.\nMore Advanced AI accelerators and DPUs\nBesides the H100 GPU, Nvidia also unveiled some additional hardware that\u2019s geared for specialized AI tasks. The Nvidia L4\u00a0(below) is a single-slot and low-profile accelerator for AI, video and graphics that can fit into any standard server, where it can decode, run models and encode video at up to 120 times faster than the best central processing unit-based platforms. It can also simultaneously run up to 1,040 HD streams, or process graphics four times faster than the previous Nvidia T4 accelerator. Google Cloud has announced early access to the Nvidia L4 via its cloud platform.\n\nThere\u2019s also a variation called the Nvidia L40, which is an accelerator designed specifically for AI-powered image generation. According to Nvidia, the L40 serves as the engine of the Nvidia Omniverse platform for building and running 3D metaverse applications.\nMeanwhile, the Nvidia H100 NVL is a specialized chip for real-time LLM inferencing. It\u2019s a PCIe GPU that can fit into any server that\u2019s able to accommodate a PCIe card. It features two H100 GPUs in a double-wide case with an NVLink bridge, delivering a combined 188 gigabytes of memory and 12 times the throughput of a standard HGX A100 chip. Nvidia said it\u2019s designed for deploying massive LLMs like ChatGPT at scale, capable of up to 12-times faster inference performance compared to the A100 GPU.\nFinally, Nvidia revealed the latest generation of its BlueField-3 data processing unit\u00a0(below), which boasts double the number of Arm processor cores and more accelerators than the BlueField-2 DPU. This means it can run workloads at up to eight times faster. DPUs are designed to offload, accelerate and isolate certain types of infrastructure administration tasks more efficiently, including network traffic inspection. By offloading this work to the DPU, a server\u2019s central processing units can focus solely on the compute tasks they have been given, thereby improving overall performance.\n\nNvidia said Oracle Cloud Infrastructure has decided to standardize on the BlueField-3 DPU to run its new DGX Cloud platform, which makes AI training available in the cloud. By using BlueField-3, Oracle says it can support large-scale GPU clusters with dynamic and always-on capacity to deliver massive efficiency gains by offloading data center infrastructure tasks.\nThe next generation of AI chips\nPerhaps the most inspiring news is that the new Nvidia platforms are just a taste of things to come, for the company is also working with semiconductor manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., ASML Holding NV and Synopsys Inc. to bring accelerated computing to chip design and manufacturing.\n\nNvidia announced the availability of its new cuLitho software library for computational lithography, which refers to the use of algorithmic models in the semiconductor manufacturing process. TSMC and Synopsys both said they\u2019re integrating the Nvidia cuLitho software with their manufacturing processes and systems to design and build Nvidia\u2019s most advanced Grace Hopper architecture GPUs, while ASML is planning to do the same.\nAccording to Nvidia, these advances will enable the manufacture of even tinier transistors and wires than are currently possible, while accelerating time to market and boosting energy efficiency. For instance, cuLitho has already shown it can deliver a performance leap of 40 times beyond existing lithography, enabling 500 Nvidia DGX H100 systems to achieve the work of 40,000 CPU systems.\nIn the near term, Nvidia said, chip fabs that run cuLitho will be able to produce three to five times more photomasks, which are the templates for a chip\u2019s design, using nine times less power than existing systems. Longer-term, cuLitho brings the promise of better designs with more computational power, higher density, greater energy efficiency and higher production yields, Nvidia said. In other words, it\u2019s playing a key role in the development of even more powerful AI hardware to come. Further down the road, cuLitho will enable better design rules, higher density, higher yields and AI-powered lithography for circuit widths of two nanometers or less.\n\u201cThe chip industry is the foundation of nearly every other industry in the world,\u201d Huang said. \u201cWith lithography at the limits of physics, Nvidia\u2019s introduction of cuLitho and collaboration with our partners TSMC, ASML and Synopsys allows fabs to increase throughput, reduce their carbon footprint and set the foundation for 2nm and beyond.\u201d\nImages: Nvidia\n\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content. \u00a0\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\n\n\n\u201cTheCUBE\u00a0is an important partner to the industry.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Chief Analyst & CEO, NAND Research. Follow AuthorMar 22, 2023, 02:54pm EDTShareSaveComment\nNVIDIAGetty Images\n\nJensen Huang, CEO and founder of NVIDIA, has long maintained that the data center is the new unit of computing. It's a view that resonates in our modern software-defined-everything cloud-native world. Compute should happen where it makes the most sense, close to the data, and where the results can have the most immediate impact. Instantaneous time-to-value from our data is what we all want, a desire that has fueled an explosion of AI at the edge.\n\nEven if we accept the data center as our new unit of computing, it\u2019s a metaphor brought to life with combinations of physical servers, storage, and networking. NVIDIA has traditionally served this world by delivering piece parts. NVIDIA's GPUs, networking adapters, and DPUs power the platforms from every OEM and nearly every cloud service provider (CSP). That's not enough. NVIDIA is moving up the stack, now providing the platforms that underpin our AI-hungry enterprise needs.\n\n\nNVIDIA is a platform company. It's been putting together the piece parts for years. In just the past three years, NVIDIA acquired Mellanox for its interconnect technology, Bright Computing for its management software, Excelero for its software-defined storage stack, and Cumulus Networks for its networking software. It famously tried to buy Arm, but that acquisition was unfortunately abandoned over antitrust concerns. That hasn't stopped NVIDIA from developing its CPU, as the company is now in production with the Arm-architecture-based Grace CPU.\n\nWhile NVIDIA has a history of building platforms for the embedded market with its Jetson, Clara, and DRIVE AGX solutions, the company has primarily serviced the data center market at the add-in accelerator level. The shining exception to that is NVIDIA\u2019s DGX deep-learning supercomputer, which it brought to market in 2016.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nThis week at NVIDIA's GTC event, it became clear that NVIDIA strives to own the entire platform for AI-infused analytics. The time is right, as accelerated AI is fueling a shift in how enterprises derive value from their data and how businesses operate and engage with their customers. These new use cases require more than traditional servers can deliver.\n\nAnd who better to pull the pieces than NVIDIA, perhaps the only company on the planet that has everything needed to assemble a solution right under its roof? That's Jensen's thinking.\nGrowing Power in the Cloud\n\n\nConsuming AI in the cloud makes sense. The machines required for deep learning are expensive. Unfortunately, they're also often idle. The consumption-based pricing model public cloud providers offer aligns perfectly with accelerated-AI workloads.\nDGX & DGX Cloud\nNVIDIA introduced its turnkey DGX \"deep learning supercomputer\" in 2017, continuously updating it as new generation accelerators are introduced. The latest generation, the NVIDIA DGX H100, is a powerful machine. Incorporating eight NVIDIA H100 GPUs with 640 Gigabytes of total GPU memory and two 56-core variants of the latest Intel Xeon processor, all tied together with NVIDIA's NVLink interconnects, the machine can deliver 32 petaFLOPS of performance.\nThis week at GTC, NVIDIA formally announced that it is making the DGX directly available through public cloud providers. NVIDIA\u2019s Jensen said that \"NVIDIA DGX is an AI supercomputer and a blueprint of AI factories being built around the world.\" AI supercomputers are complex and time-consuming to build, and today we're announcing the Nvidia DGX Cloud, the fastest and easiest way to have your own DGX AI supercomputer. Just open your browser.\"\nNVIDIA\u2019s DGX comes in several a range of options. The offerings include the stand-alone NVIDIA DGX A100 and H100 systems, the NVIDIA DGX BasePOD reference architecture, and the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD turnkey AI data center solution. Our current understanding of DGX cloud is that it is the DGX H100 that the CSPs offer and will be priced at about $3,600/month. DGX Cloud will be available on Oracle's Cloud Infrastructure imminently, with Azure offering DGX Cloud sometime in Q2.\nAzure & the Omniverse Cloud\nNVIDIA\u2019s Omniverse Cloud is a platform-as-a-service tuned for the full lifecycle of industrial Omniverse applications, flowing from design, development, deployment, and, ultimately, the management of Omniverse applications. Omnivese Cloud is built on NVIDIA\u2019s OVX reference architecture.\nNVIDIA OVX is purpose-built for powering the creation and operation of NVIDIA Omniverse applications at data center scale. The machine contains four NVIDIA L40 GPUs, 192 GB of GPU memory, two 32-core processors, 1TB of system memory, 8TB of NVMe-attached flash storage, and a combination of NVIDIA BlueField DPUs and NVIDIA ConnectX-7 smart NICs. It\u2019s a beast of a computer.\nThis week, NVIDIA and Microsoft announced that Microsoft will offer NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud as a Microsoft Azure service. This will benefit Azure users, as it allows them to link real-time data from sensors in the physical world with the digital twins contained within the Omniverse. It's a powerful capability, closing a gap in the cloud for the growing number of industries embracing digital twins.\nNew Inference Platforms\nGenerative AI has unleashed a frenzy of GPU-assisted inference needs. I've been on multiple calls with Wall Street analysts over the past sixty days who all want to understand the winners and losers, and whether this is a short-term bump or a long-term trend.\nNVIDIA believes that the need for inference in the enterprise will only grow. This makes sense if you look across the landscape of inference use cases. Even before generative AI caught the public's attention, image processing at the edge, recommender engines, and other inference applications have been riding an explosive growth curve.\nThis week NVIDIA expanded its reach into enterprise inference workloads with a range of new inference platforms. These are turnkey solutions, quite different from providing GPUs and other accelerators to be integrated into end-solutions. These new inference platforms all combine NVIDIA\u2019s full stack of inference software with the latest NVIDIA Ada, Hopper, and Grace Hopper processors. NVIDIA tells us that these platforms are ideal for AI-assisted video processing, image generation, large language model deployment, and recommender inference.\nNVIDIA released four inference platforms, each targeting a different workload:\n\u00b7 NVIDIA L4 for Video offers enhanced video decoding and transcoding capabilities for video streaming, augmented reality, generative AI, and related applications.\n\u00b7 NVIDIA L40 for Image Generation is optimized for graphics and AI-enabled 2D, 3D, and video image generation. The L40 is also the platform underpinning NVIDIA Omniverse.\n\u00b7 NVIDIA H100 NVL for Large Language Model Deployment is targeted at large language models, such as ChatGPT, at scale.\n\u00b7 NVIDIA Grace Hopper for Recommendation Models is ideal for deploying graph recommendation models, vector databases, and graph neural networks.\nThese new inference platforms are available through NVIDIA\u2019s usual channel partners. It\u2019s also available in the public cloud, with Google\u2019s GCP announcing it will be the first CSP to offer L4-based instances. GCP is offering the new instances in preview beginning this week.\nThe Analyst\u2019s Take\nThe most impactful piece of NVIDIA\u2019s platform announcements is hidden in the details. The top public cloud providers don't buy turnkey systems, or, if they do, they don't expose them as such to their customers.\nThe CSPs usually act as their own OEM, building servers optimized for their environment. Some of the CSPs even produce their own silicon. They do this to optimize and own their supply chain, but there's also a bottom-line bonus. Manufacturing your servers allows you to reclaim the margin that would otherwise go to an OEM. Or to a chipmaker.\nIt's significant that NVIDIA can break that tradition. DGX Cloud directly exposes NVIDIA's turnkey system, placing it front-and-center to the CSP customer. DGX Cloud demonstrates that NVIDIA's value trumps the CSP's desire to roll their own, as they do with more traditional servers. It also shows customer pull for NVIDIA, demonstrating a dependence that works in NVIDIA's favor \u2013 a dependence that will only deepen over time.\nJensen likes to say that AI is having its iPhone moment, which implies NVIDIA, much like Apple in 2007, is enjoying a moment of its own.\nDisclosure: Steve McDowell is an industry analyst, and NAND Research an industry analyst firm, that engages in, or has engaged in, research, analysis, and advisory services with many technology companies, which may include those mentioned in this article.

Graphic designers will be able to apply Canvas AI-generated scenes to their workflow, allowing for quick and easy iterations.\nUsers can select between Standard and Panorama workspace each time they open or create a new file.\nFor 3D artist and AI aficionado Dan \u201cGreenskull\u201d Hammill, Canvas technology invokes an intentional change of tone.\n\u201cThe therapeutic nature of painting a landscape asks me to slow things down and let my inner artist free,\u201d said Greenskull. \u201cThe legendary Bob Ross is a clear inspiration for how I speak during my videos. I want the viewer to both be fascinated by the technology and relaxed by the content.\u201d\nFor a recent piece, called \u201cThe Cove,\u201d Greenskull took a few minutes to create his preferred landscape \u2014 an ocean view complete with hills, foliage, sand and darker skies for a cloudy day \u2014 with the few strokes of a digital pen in Canvas, all accelerated by his GeForce RTX 4090 GPU.\n\u2018The Cove\u2019 was created in NVIDIA Canvas and completed in mere minutes.\nThe artist refined his landscape in even more detail with an expanded selection of brush-size options included in the Canvas 1.4 release. Once satisfied with the background, Greenskull reviewed his creation. \u201cI can look at the 3D view, review, see how it looks, and it\u2019s looking pretty good, pretty cool,\u201d he said.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/nvidia-studio-itns-wk48-clip1-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nGreenskull then uploaded his landscape into a video game within Unreal Engine 5 as the skybox or enclosed world. Now his Canvas texture makes up the background.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/nvidia-studio-itns-wk48-clip2-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis really does open up a lot of possibilities for game designers, especially indie developers who quickly want to create something and have it look genuinely unique and great,\u201d Greenskull said.\n\u201cNVIDIA has powered both my casual and professional life for countless years. To me, NVIDIA is reliable, powerful and state of the art. If I\u2019m going to be on top of my game, I should have the hardware that will keep up and push forward.\u201d \u2014 Dan \u201cGreenskull\u201d Hammill\n\nWith his new virtual world complete, Greenskull prepared to create videos for his social media platforms.\n\u201cI hit record, run my DSLR through a capture card, record dialog through Adobe Audition, and grab a second screen capture with a separate PC,\u201d explained Greenskull.\nGreenskull then pieced everything together, syncing the primary video, secondary PC video captures and audio files. He reviewed the clips, made minor edits and exported final videos.\nUsing his favorite video editing app, Adobe Premiere Pro, Greenskull tapped his NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU\u2019s dual AV1 video encoders via the Voukoder plug-in, cutting export times in half with improved video quality.\nDownload the Canvas beta, free for NVIDIA and GeForce RTX GPU owners.\n\nCheck out Greenskull on TikTok.\nDan \u201cGreenskull\u201d Hammill.\nLearn more about these latest technologies by joining us at the Game Developers Conference.

BMW Group has taken factory planning to new\n  heights \u2013 setting the latest milestone in the digitalisation of\n  automotive manufacturing. More than two years before the official\n  launch of series production, vehicle manufacturing is already underway\n  in the future plant Debrecen \u2013 virtually, at least, as Debrecen is the\n  BMW Group\u2019s first facility to be planned and validated completely\n  virtually. The ground-breaking and innovative planning concept was\n  realised in collaboration with its partner NVIDIA. The future plant\n  Debrecen is scheduled to open in 2025. Construction has just begun,\n  and the new facility is scheduled to produce the BMW Group\u2019s next\n  generation of all-electric models: the Neue Klasse.\n\u00a0\nBMW Group is taking a digital-first approach to validate and optimize\n  complex manufacturing systems across its production network using\n  NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise, a platform for building and operating 3D\n  industrial metaverse applications, to run real-time digital twin\n  simulations to optimise layouts, robotics and logistic systems\n  virtually. Omniverse will be extended across the BMW product network\n  around the world.\n\u00a0\n\u201cVirtualisation and artificial intelligence are accelerating and\n  refining our planning. With the various planning systems consolidated\n  within a digital twin, our teams around the world can now work\n  together in real-time and make decisions faster and on a more solid\n  foundation,\u201d Milan Nedeljkovi\u0107 explained. \u201cThis makes us much quicker\n  and more efficient and saves on costs as well.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDigitalization is moving fastest in the automotive industry and BMW\n  has been a leader in advancing this vision,\u201d said Jensen Huang,\n  founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cWe are partnering closely with BMW, using\n  NVIDIA Omniverse to help streamline their manufacturing processes,\n  enhance collaboration and further efficiency. Our collaboration will\n  continue to push the frontiers of virtual integration for the next\n  generation of smart, connected factories around the world\u201d.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn a joint demo at the NVIDIA GTC, a global conference for the era of\n  AI and the metaverse, Milan Nedeljkovi\u0107, took Huang on a virtual\n  planning session for the new body shop. Nedeljkovi\u0107 described the\n  real-time collaboration between the different BMW Group planning\n  departments and their partners as a \u201crevolution in factory planning\u201d,\n  delivered on NVIDIA\u2019s Omniverse \u2013 which had enabled the first virtual\n  start of production.\n\u00a0\nEngineering and planning experts from the two companies, both leaders\n  in their respective fields worked, in close collaboration to help BMW\n  build Omniverse applications that meet the BMW Group\u2019s specific\n  requirements. The virtual planning approach for the new vehicle plant\n  is now considered a blueprint for all future planning processes at the\n  BMW Group.\n\u00a0\n\nVirtual planning facilitates global collaboration \u2013 rollout\n    starts end of March\nNVIDIA Omniverse makes collaboration across sites and time zones\n  easier and supports the planning and design of structures, production\n  systems and processes at an entirely new technological level. It works\n  as a \u201ccockpit\u201d, offering quick, easy access to the digital planning\n  worlds of BMW. At the end of this month, Omniverse, which is both\n  cloud-based and cloud-agnostic, will be available to BMW experts in\n  various technologies and planning departments.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNext milestone in the BMW iFACTORY\nConsistent virtual planning of highly complex vehicle production\n  processes represents the BMW Group\u2019s next important step in the\n  transformation to the BMW iFACTORY. First introduced in early 2022,\n  the concept of the iFACTORY is described by Nedeljkovi\u0107 as \u201cour\n  masterplan for the automotive production of tomorrow\u201d.\n\u00a0\nBased on a completely new vehicle architecture, the Neue Klasse\n  heralds the fundamental transformation of production to the BMW\n  iFACTORY. It began in 2020, when all of the BMW Group\u2019s vehicle and\n  engine plants were 3D-scanned. Since November of that year, more than\n  seven million square metres of indoor and 15 million square metres of\n  outdoor production space have been scanned. Subsequent modifications\n  can be integrated into the digital world with a re-scan, to ensure the\n  available data is always up to date.\n\u00a0\nMeanwhile, virtual planning is under way for the roughly 1.4\n  km2 production hall for the Neue Klasse in Debrecen, where\n  the success of the virtual start of production is a testament to the\n  high standards that can be achieved through the digitalisation of the\n  planning process. NVIDIA Omniverse allows production experts to use\n  live data both in-house and with suppliers on the detailed planning\n  and optimisation of processes and individual systems \u2013 without\n  compatibility issues. It makes structure and facility data easy to\n  retrieve and integrate with equipment and assembly line data. In the\n  future items and part numbers for production materials will be\n  available as well. What\u2019s more, layout options \u2013 for instance for\n  robots in work cells, or for the various areas of logistics \u2013 can be\n  played through in real-time, photorealistic simulations and adapted as\n  required. And with Omniverse, any modifications are evaluated,\n  validated and implemented in real-time. The platform also will allow\n  suppliers to be involved in decision-making and integrates the\n  tried-and-tested design and planning tools that BMW has been using to\n  date. These are made by various producers and include Bentley Systems\n  MicroStation for layout planning, ipolog for logistics planning,\n  Siemens Process Simulate, Dassault Systemes CATIA for vehicle design\n  and Autodesk Revit for building planning, with more tools to follow.\n\u00a0\nOver time all the relevant product, process, quality and cost data\n  will also gradually be available in Omniverse alongside the\n  development, planning and production processes. There will also be\n  further developments to the platform, which are expected to include\n  \u201cinvisible\u201d processes such as the consumption of energy and resources.\n\u00a0\nOmniverse will enhance digital operations as well \u2013 a crucial stage\n  that is already being tackled by BMW Group and NVIDIA teams. In the\n  future, this will allow operational faults to be localized in a matter\n  of seconds and thus prevent longer production downtimes. It is also an\n  important step towards, for example, integrating and automating\n  virtual commissioning of new systems into a continuous planning process.\n\n\n\nShow entire text\n\n\nArticle Offline Attachments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress Release PDF, EN, 477.13 KB\n\n\n\n\nArticle Media Material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      My.PressClub\u00a0Login\n      \n\n\u00a0PressClub InformationANNUAL CONFERENCE 2025.\nMunich, 14 March 2025.\nHere you can see the On-Demand Webcast of the BMW Group Annual Conference 2025.\nOpen Website\n\nCO2 emission information.\nFuel consumption, CO2 emission figures and power consumption and range were measured using the methods required according to Regulation VO (EC) 2007/715 as amended.

According to NVIDIA's announcement, the GI Genius integration could support physicians with AI-enhanced diagnostic images to improve colonoscopies and patient outcomes.\u00a0\nHoloscan enables medical devices to deliver the low-latency inference required for AI in a clinical setting.\u00a0\n\"Artificial intelligence is a powerful tool that can increase the speed, efficiency and effectiveness of global health systems,\" Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA, said in yesterday's announcement.\u00a0\n\"We\u2019re collaborating with Medtronic to accelerate AI innovation by enabling a software-defined business model, with the goal of improving clinical decision-making, reducing medical variability and driving better patient outcomes,\" she said.\nAdditional integrations with Holoscan and IGX could allow developers to train and validate AI models, and then host the AI-powered applications on Medtronic\u2019s GI Genius AI Access Platform, a marketplace for software-as-a-medical-device\u00a0applications.\nAssisting with robotic surgery and advancing medical images\nNVIDIA said Holoscan was also recently used at the Belgium-based ORSI Academy surgical training center in the operating room to support robot-assisted surgery.\n\"At Onze-Lieve-Vrouw Hospital, urologists trained at ORSI successfully removed the patient\u2019s kidney using Intuitive\u2019s da Vinci robotic-assisted surgical system, with the help of an augmented reality overlay of the patient\u2019s anatomy from a CT scan, rendered in real-time and AI-augmented with Holoscan,\" the company said in a separate announcement.\u00a0\n\"The metaverse holds the power to transform healthcare in manifold ways. It allows seamless collaboration for personnel across the industry and geography to knowledge-share and collaborate,\" said Pari Natarajan, CEO of Zinnov, a global management and consulting firm focusing on digital transformation in healthcare.\n\"It will become very easy for healthcare specialists across the globe to assist in key surgeries, using robots and augmented reality technology,\" he told HealthcareITNews last month.\nNVIDIA's Clara ecosystem, which also includes BioNeMo for drug discovery, Parabricks for genomics and MONAI for medical imaging, is being used by more than 100 partners, NVIDIA said.\nMONAI helps create healthcare AI applications that can label and analyze medical images.\nNVIDIA also noted that Flywheel, a biomedical research data platform, is incorporating MONAI in its offerings. That\u00a0company partnered with the University of Wisconsin Radiology Department to develop a model-based image classifier that predicts and labels the body regions present in medical images.\u00a0\nAndrea Fox is senior editor of Healthcare IT News.\nEmail:\u00a0afox@himss.orgHealthcare IT News is a HIMSS Media publication.\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin Knisely and Holly Pavliscsak will offer more detail during their HIMSS23 session \" Natural Language Processing to Identify Unmet Needs in Military Medicine.\" It is scheduled for Tuesday, April 18, at 11:45 a.m. - 12:15 p.m. CT at the South Building, Level 1, in room S104.\nTopics:\u00a0Artificial Intelligence, Clinical, Imaging, Medical Devices\nMore regional news\n\n\n\n\nHHS layoffs temporarily reversed by federal judgeBy Jeff LagasseMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\nHow leveraging cardiac data via RPM can help overcome many clinical challengesBy Bill SiwickiMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\nEHRs and agentic AI: Balancing human and automated collaborationBy Andrea FoxMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to get more stories like this\n          one?

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Luis E. Romero is an entrepreneur, author and speaker.Follow AuthorMar 21, 2023, 06:38pm EDTShareSaveCommentSignage with logo at the Silicon Valley headquarters of computer graphics hardware company Nvidia, ... [+] Santa Clara, California, August 17, 2017. (Photo via Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images).Getty Images\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang kicked off GTC 2023 by saying, \u201cFor nearly four decades, Moore\u2019s Law has been the governing dynamics of the computer industry, which in turn, has impacted every industry.\u201d Although \u201cthe exponential performance increase at constant cost and power has slowed down [\u2026], computing advance has gone to light speed.\u201d The underlying factor is Artificial Intelligence (AI), and we should all pay attention.\n\n\nIncremental increases in CPU processing capabilities have been expected to fall short of Moore\u2019s Law at some point. Physical limits on miniaturization and the challenges associated with improving superconductor properties make this inevitable. Software developers and systems engineers have worked hard to be ready for this moment for years and they succeeded\u2014all thanks to AI. Now, AI software and AI-enabled systems can pick up where Moore\u2019s Law left off. AI tools and applications\u2014more specifically Generative AI\u2014allow existing infrastructure to do 1,000-X what it did with traditional computing.\n\nWith Generative AI, processing power currently available can be used to create entirely new products and services and transform industries beyond just optimizing existing operations. With the creation of AI-enabled task-specific servers and computing farms, the business landscape is changing rapidly for everyone. AI is no longer a nice-to-have, it is a must-have. Most businesses will see their offerings become obsolete very soon unless they integrate them with AI-enabled tools that can compete in an ever-more immersive consumer experience.\n\n\nYet there is a new challenge on the horizon. As businesses become ever more proficient in the use of AI, they start to wonder how they can make it even better. There is never enough of a good thing, right? But makers of AI tools cannot anticipate every single demand from every single process for every single operation. This is where businesses become interested in manufacturing their own company-specific AI. They want to manufacture their own intelligence. But since it is also an impractical possibility that every business will become an AI powerhouse capable of to not only using but developing its own AI, there is a monumental business opportunity for customizable AI applications. These would allow AI vendors to provide flexible platforms for clients to develop their own company-specific AI suits.\n\nTo that end, the NVIDIA \u201cDGX Supercomputer will become a modern AI factory. Every company will manufacture intelligence,\u201d said Huang. By expanding their current business model with NVIDIA DGX Cloud in partnership with Microsoft Azure, Google GCP, and Oracle OCI, NVIDIA plans to bring AI to every company, from a browser.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\n\n\nAt GTC 2023, NVIDIA also introduced NVIDIA AI Foundations. Per an email sent to developers, this new service pack is meant \u201cto enable software companies, service providers, and enterprises to realize the potential of generative AI. NVIDIA AI Foundations is a set of cloud services that provides a simplified approach to building and running custom generative AI, starting with state-of-the-art foundation models for text, visual media (image, video, and 3D), and the language of biology. Adobe, Getty Images, Shutterstock, and Morningstar are among the companies creating AI models, applications, and services with NVIDIA AI Foundations.\u201d\n\nSo, yes, we just entered the era where companies will not only use, but also manufacture their own AI.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Each instance of DGX Cloud features eight Nvidia H100 or A100 80GB Tensor Core GPUs for a total of 640GB of GPU memory per node. DGX Cloud instances start at $36,999 per instance per month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 Nvidia\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are at the iPhone moment of AI. Startups are racing to build disruptive products and business models, and incumbents are looking to respond,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia. \u201cDGX Cloud gives customers instant access to Nvidia AI supercomputing in global-scale clouds.\u201dEarly customers include biotech company Amgen, insurance software firm CCC Intelligent Solutions, and ServiceNow in conjunction with on-premises Nvidia DGX supercomputers.\u201cWith Nvidia DGX cloud and Nvidia BioNeMo, our researchers are able to focus on deeper biology instead of having to deal with AI infrastructure and set up ML engineering,\u201d said Peter Grandsard, executive director of research, biologics therapeutic discovery center for research acceleration by digital innovation at Amgen. \u201cThe powerful computing and multi-node capabilities of DGX Cloud have enabled us to achieve 3x faster training of protein LLMs with BioNeMo and up to 100x faster post-training analysis with Nvidia RAPIDS relative to alternative platforms.\u201dDGX Cloud will initially be available through Oracle\u2019s OCI cloud service; its OCI Supercluster provides a purpose-built RDMA network, bare-metal compute, and high-performance local and block storage that can scale to superclusters of over 32,000 GPUs.Nvidia said Microsoft Azure is expected to begin hosting DGX Cloud next quarter, with plans to \u2018soon expand\u2019 to Google Cloud and others.\u201cOCI is the first platform to offer an AI supercomputer at scale to thousands of customers across every industry. This is a critical capability as more and more organizations require computing resources for their unique AI use cases,\u201d said Clay Magouyrk, executive vice president of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. \u201cTo support this demand, we continue to expand our work with Nvidia.\u201dManuvir Das, vice president of enterprise computing at Nvidia, added: \u201cThe limitless opportunities for AI-driven innovation are helping transform virtually every business. Nvidia\u2019s collaboration with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure puts the extraordinary supercomputing performance of Nvidia\u2019s accelerated computing platform within reach of every enterprise.\u201dIn its own announcement, Oracle added that Nvidia is running its newly-announced AI Foundations services through Oracle OCI on the DGX Cloud platform.According to Oracle, the OCI Supercluster includes OCI Compute Bare Metal, a latency RoCE cluster based on Nvidia networking, and a choice of storage. The system can scale up to 4,096 OCI Compute Bare Metal instances with 32,768 A100 GPUs.Oracle is also adding Nvidia\u2019s BlueField-3 data processing units (DPU) to its networking stack. DPUs can offload certain tasks from the CPU and take on the task of managing data moving through a data center, offloading networking tasks, and helping optimize application performance.Clay Magouyrk, executive vice president of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, said. \u201cNvidia BlueField-3 DPUs are a key component of our strategy to provide state-of-the-art, sustainable cloud infrastructure with extreme performance.\u201dNvidia Hopper GPUs come to the cloudNvidia's Hopper GPUs are now available as virtual instances through a number of cloud providers.Oracle this week announced that OCI Compute Bare Metal instances with Nvidia H100 GPUs are currently in limited availability. Microsoft last week announced a preview of its own H100-powered virtual machine, the ND H100 v5.AWS will soon be offering H100 GPUs via its EC2 P5 instances. Each P5 instance features eight H100 GPUs capable of 16 petaflops of mixed-precision performance, 640 GB of memory, and 3,200 Gbps networking connectivity. Customers will be able to scale their P5 instances to over 20,000 H100 GPUs.H100 instances are generally available from Cirrascale and CoreWeave.Nvidia said Google Cloud, Lambda, Paperspace, and Vultr plan to offer H100 instances in the future.On-premise H100 DGXs coming soonDuring his GTC keynote this week, Nvidia CEO Huang said that the company\u2019s latest generation of DGX H100 supercomputers, powered by its Hopper GPUs, are in full production and will be coming soon to enterprises worldwide.Each H100 DGX will feature eight H100 GPUs, and provide provides 32 petaflops of compute performance at FP8 precision. Early customers set to receive the system include the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, Japanese conglomerate Mitsui, and Ecuadorian telco Telconet.\n\n\n\n Subscribe to our daily newsletters\n\n\n Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nOracle\n\n\nDGX SuperPOD\n\n\nOracle Cloud\n\n\nDGX Cloud\n\n\nDGX H100 SuperPod\n\n\nOCI\n\n\nH100 GPU\n\n\nDGX H100\n\n\nH100\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

It leads a total of eight new games expanding the GeForce NOW library. New content for Rainbow Six Siege is also now streaming.\nPlus, two new cities are now online with GeForce RTX 4080 performance for cloud gaming. Chicago and Montreal have completed upgrades to RTX 4080 SuperPODs, delivering next-generation cloud streaming to GeForce NOW Ultimate members.\nShifting Up\nBeyond-fast gaming meets beyond-fast racing.\nJump into the spectacular action of GRID Legends, the racing game from EA with drama at every turn. Battle for glory with a variety of incredible cars on stellar tracks featuring iconic landmarks from the streets of London and Moscow.\nNavigate the world of high-stakes racing as a rookie behind the wheel, with a documentary team capturing every sensational moment. Conquer hundreds of events and challenges, and create a dream racing team in the unique, cinematic story mode. Join up online with other legends and race against friends, or challenge them to a race designed in the Race Creator mode.\nGeForce NOW members can experience it all with high dynamic range on PC, Mac and SHIELD TV for a smooth, ultra-crisp driving experience, even under intense racing conditions.\nUpgrade Roll Call\nOrder up! Servers are now live in Chicago and Montreal.\nThe RTX 4080 SuperPODs have been rolling out around the world for a couple months now, so it\u2019s time to check in with a RTX 4080 roll call.\nChicago and Montreal bring the number of cities on the server update map to 10, joining Ashburn, Dallas, Los Angeles and San Jose in the U.S., and Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Paris in Europe. Now past it\u2019s halfway point, the rollout is expected to be completed by mid-year.\nHere\u2019s a few reasons to upgrade:\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 3 technology is enabled for AI-powered performance boosts on supported games like HITMAN World of Assassination and Marvel\u2019s Midnight Suns. This means 4K streaming from the cloud results in the smoothest game play at up to 120 frames per second, even when settings are cranked to the max.\nNVIDIA Reflex delivers ultra-low latency. Paired with DLSS 3, the technology enables Ultimate members to stream games like Rainbow Six Siege and Apex Legends at up to 240 fps on PCs and Macs, with as low as 35 milliseconds of total latency for a streaming experience that feels nearly indistinguishable from being on a local desktop.\nUltrawide resolutions are supported for the first time ever from the cloud, giving Ultimate members the most immersive game play in No Man\u2019s Sky, Cyberpunk 2077 and Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla.\n\nUltimate members in and around the 10 cities on the map are streaming with new performance today, and can take full advantage of these RTX technologies in the cloud. Level up to next-generation cloud streaming today for beyond-fast gaming.\nSpring Forward With New Games\n\u201cBrava will do what\u2019s needed. Even when it requires sacrifice.\u201d\nOperation Commanding Force is the newest season of Year 8 for Tom Clancy\u2019s Rainbow Six Siege, now available for members to stream. The update brings a new attacker named Brava, equipped with the Kludge Drone, a gadget that can disrupt enemy electronics devices and even take over some of them to turn the tides of battle.\nThat\u2019s on top of the eight games joining the cloud this week:\n\nHotel Renovator (New release on Steam)\nClash: Artifacts of Chaos (New release on Steam, March 9)\nFigment 2: Creed Valley (New release on Steam, March 9)\nMonster Energy Supercross \u2013 The Official Videogame 6 (New release on Steam, March 9)\nBig Ambitions (New release on Steam, March 10)\nCall of the Sea (Free on Epic Games, March 9)\nGRID Legends (Steam and EA)\nScars Above (Steam)\n\nThere\u2019s a whole lot of games streaming from the cloud, and we want to know your top three.

CD PROJEKT RED, one of many developers to tap into these resources, recently announced a new update coming to Cyberpunk 2077 on April 11 \u2014 including a new technology preview for Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode that enables full ray tracing on GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs and RTX 4080 SuperPODs.\nRTX 4080 performance lights up Sofia, Bulgaria.\nIn addition, members in and around Sofia, Bulgaria, can now experience the best of GeForce NOW Ultimate cloud gaming. It\u2019s the latest city to roll out RTX 4080 gaming rigs to GeForce NOW servers around the globe.\nPlus, with five new games joining the cloud this week, and an upcoming marvel-ous reward, GeForce NOW members can look forward to a busy weekend of streaming goodness.\nDevelopers, Mount Up!\nGDC presents the ideal time to spotlight GeForce NOW tools that enable developers to seamlessly bring their games to the cloud. NVIDIA tools, software development kits (SDKs) and partner engines together enable the production of stunning real-time content that uses AI and ray tracing. And bringing these games to billions of non-PC devices is as simple as checking an opt-in box.\nGeForce NOW taps into existing game stores, allowing game developers to reap the benefits of a rapidly growing audience without the hassle of developing for another platform. This means zero port work to bring games to the cloud. Users don\u2019t have to buy games for another platform and can play them on many of the devices they already own.\nDevelopers who want to do more have access to the GeForce NOW Developer Platform \u2014 an SDK and toolset empowering integration of, interaction with and testing on the NVIDIA cloud gaming service. It allows developers to enhance their games to run more seamlessly, add cloud gaming into their stores and launchers, and let users connect their accounts and libraries to GeForce NOW.\nThe SDK is a set of APIs, runtimes, samples and documentation that allows games to query for cloud execution and enable virtual touchscreens; launchers to trigger cloud streaming of a specified game; and GeForce NOW and publisher backends to facilitate account linking and game library ownership syncing, already available for Steam and Ubisoft games.\nContent developers have a slew of opportunities to bring their virtual worlds and interactive experiences to users in unique ways, powered by the cloud.\nMetaverse services company Improbable will use NVIDIA cloud gaming infrastructure for an interactive, live, invite-only experience that will accommodate up to 10,000 guests. Other recent developer events included the DAF Trucks virtual experience, where potential customers took the newest DAF truck for a test drive in a simulated world, with PixelMob\u2019s Euro Truck Simulator 2 providing the virtual playground.\nFurthermore, CD PROJEKT RED will be delivering full ray tracing, aka path tracing, to Cyberpunk 2077. Such effects were previously only possible for film and TV. With the power of a GeForce RTX 4080 gaming rig in the cloud, Ultimate members will be able to stream the new technology preview for the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode coming to Cyberpunk 2077 across devices \u2014 even Macs \u2014 no matter the game\u2019s system requirements.\nGet Ready for a Marvel-ous Week\nGeForce NOW Premium members can get this Marvel-ous reward for free first.\nGeForce NOW Ultimate members have been enjoying Marvel\u2019s Midnight Suns\u2019 ultra-smooth, cinematic game play thanks to DLSS 3 technology support on top of RTX-powered ray tracing, which together enable graphics breakthroughs.\nNow, members can fight among the legends with Captain Marvel\u2019s Medieval Marvel suit in a free reward, which will become available at the end of the month \u2014 first to Premium members who are opted into GeForce NOW rewards. This reward is only available until May 6, so upgrade to an Ultimate or Priority membership today and opt into rewards to get first access.\nNext, on to the five new games hitting GeForce NOW week for a happy weekend:\n\nTchia (New release on Epic Games Store)\nChess Ultra (New release on Epic Games Store, March 23)\nAmberial Dreams (Steam)\nSymphony of War: The Nephilim Saga (Steam)\nNo One Survived (Steam)\n\nAnd with that, we\u2019ve got a question to end this GFN Thursday:\n\nYou've got free rent for a year to live in a video game city of your choice, which one are you choosing?  \ud83e\udd14\n\u2014 \ud83c\udf29\ufe0f NVIDIA GeForce NOW (@NVIDIAGFN) March 22, 2023\n\n\n\nCategories: GamingTags: Cloud Gaming | GeForce NOW \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

At the high-end of the market, the company today is announcing a new H100 accelerator variant specifically aimed at large language model users: the H100 NVL.\nThe H100 NVL is an interesting variant on NVIDIA\u2019s H100 PCIe card that, in a sign of the times and NVIDIA\u2019s extensive success in the AI field, is aimed at a singular market: large language model (LLM) deployment. There are a few things that make this card atypical from NVIDIA\u2019s usual server fare \u2013 not the least of which is that it\u2019s 2 H100 PCIe boards that come already bridged together \u2013 but the big takeaway is the big memory capacity. The combined dual-GPU card offers 188GB of HBM3 memory \u2013 94GB per card \u2013 offering more memory per GPU than any other NVIDIA part to date, even within the H100 family.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA H100 Accelerator Specification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\nH100 NVL\nH100 PCIe\nH100 SXM\n\n\nFP32 CUDA Cores\n2 x 16896?\n14592\n16896\n\n\nTensor Cores\n2 x 528?\n456\n528\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1.98GHz?\n1.75GHz\n1.98GHz\n\n\nMemory Clock\n~5.1Gbps HBM3\n3.2Gbps HBM2e\n5.23Gbps HBM3\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n6144-bit\n5120-bit\n5120-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n2 x 3.9TB/sec\n2TB/sec\n3.35TB/sec\n\n\nVRAM\n2 x 94GB (188GB)\n80GB\n80GB\n\n\nFP32 Vector\n2 x 67 TFLOPS?\n51 TFLOPS\n67 TFLOPS\n\n\nFP64 Vector\n2 x 34 TFLOPS?\n26 TFLOPS\n34 TFLOPS\n\n\nINT8 Tensor\n2 x 1980 TOPS\n1513 TOPS\n1980 TOPS\n\n\nFP16 Tensor\n2 x 990 TFLOPS\n756 TFLOPS\n990 TFLOPS\n\n\nTF32 Tensor\n2 x 495 TFLOPS\n378 TFLOPS\n495 TFLOPS\n\n\nFP64 Tensor\n2 x 67 TFLOPS?\n51 TFLOPS\n67 TFLOPS\n\n\nInterconnect\nNVLink 4\r\n\t\t\t(600GB/sec)\nNVLink 4\r\n\t\t\t(600GB/sec)\nNVLink 4\r\n\t\t\t18 Links (900GB/sec)\n\n\nGPU\n2 x GH100\r\n\t\t\t(814mm2)\nGH100\r\n\t\t\t(814mm2)\nGH100\r\n\t\t\t(814mm2)\n\n\nTransistor Count\n2 x 80B\n80B\n80B\n\n\nTDP\n700-800W\n350W\n700W\n\n\nManufacturing Process\nTSMC 4N\nTSMC 4N\nTSMC 4N\n\n\nInterface\n2 x PCIe 5.0\r\n\t\t\t(Quad Slot)\nPCIe 5.0\r\n\t\t\t(Dual Slot)\nSXM5\n\n\nArchitecture\nHopper\nHopper\nHopper\n\n\n\nDriving this SKU is a specific niche: memory capacity. Large language models like the GPT family are in many respects memory capacity bound, as they\u2019ll quickly fill up even an H100 accelerator in order to hold all of their parameters (175B in the case of the largest GPT-3 models). As a result, NVIDIA has opted to scrape together a new H100 SKU that offers a bit more memory per GPU than their usual H100 parts, which top out at 80GB per GPU.\nUnder the hood, what we\u2019re looking at is essentially a special bin of the GH100 GPU that\u2019s being placed on a PCIe card. All GH100 GPUs come with 6 stacks of HBM memory \u2013 either HBM2e or HBM3 \u2013 with a capacity of 16GB per stack. However for yield reasons, NVIDIA only ships their regular H100 parts with 5 of the 6 HBM stacks enabled. So while there is nominally 96GB of VRAM on each GPU, only 80GB is available on regular SKUs.\n\nThe H100 NVL, in turn, is the mythical fully-enabled SKU with all 6 stacks enabled. By turning on the 6th HBM stack, NVIDIA is able to access the additional memory and additional memory bandwidth that it affords. It will have some material impact on yields \u2013 how much is a closely guarded NVIDIA secret \u2013 but the LLM market is apparently big enough and willing to pay a high enough premium for nearly perfect GH100 packages to make it worth NVIDIA\u2019s while.\nEven then, it should be noted that customers aren\u2019t getting access to quite all 96GB per card. Rather, at a total capacity of 188GB of memory, they\u2019re getting effectively 94GB per card. NVIDIA hasn\u2019t gone into detail on this design quirk in our pre-briefing ahead of today\u2019s keynote, but we suspect this is also for yield reasons, giving NVIDIA some slack to disable bad cells (or layers) within the HBM3 memory stacks. The net result is that the new SKU offers 14GB more memory per GH100 GPU, a 17.5% memory increase. Meanwhile the aggregate memory bandwidth for the card stands at 7.8TB/second, which works out to 3.9TB/second for the individual boards.\nBesides the memory capacity increase, in a lot of ways the individual cards within the larger dual-GPU/dual-card H100 NVL look a lot like the SXM5 version of the H100 placed on a PCIe card. Whereas the normal H100 PCIe is hamstrung some by the use of slower HBM2e memory, fewer active SMs/tensor cores, and lower clockspeeds, the tensor core performance figures NVIDIA is quoting for the H100 NVL are all at parity with the H100 SXM5, indicating that this card isn\u2019t further cut back like the normal PCIe card. We\u2019re still waiting on the final, complete specifications for the product, but assuming everything here is as presented, then the GH100s going into the H100 NVL would represent the highest binned GH100s currently available.\n\nAnd an emphasis on the plural is called for here. As noted earlier, the H100 NVL is not a single GPU part, but rather it\u2019s a dual-GPU/dual-card part, and it presents itself to the host system as such. The hardware itself is based on two PCIe form-factor H100s that are strapped together using three NVLink 4 bridges. Physically, this is virtually identical to NVIDIA\u2019s existing H100 PCIe design \u2013 which can already be paired up using NVLink bridges \u2013 so the difference isn\u2019t in the construction of the two board/four slot behemoth, but rather the quality of the silicon within. Put another way, you can strap together regular H100 PCie cards today, but it wouldn\u2019t match the memory bandwidth, memory capacity, or tensor throughput of the H100 NVL.\nSurprisingly, despite the stellar specs, TDPs remain almost. The H100 NVL is a 700W to 800W part, which breaks down to 350W to 400W per board, the lower bound of which is the same TDP as the regular H100 PCIe. In this case NVIDIA looks to be prioritizing compatibility over peak performance, as few server chassis can handle PCIe cards over 350W (and fewer still over 400W), meaning that TDPs need to stand pat. Still, given the higher performance figures and memory bandwidth, it\u2019s unclear how NVIDIA is affording the extra performance. Power binning can go a long way here, but it may also be a case where NVIDIA is giving the card a higher than usual boost clockspeed since the target market is primarily concerned with tensor performance and is not going to be lighting up the entire GPU at once.\nOtherwise, NVIDIA\u2019s decision to release what\u2019s essentially the best H100 bin is an unusual choice given their general preference for SXM parts, but it\u2019s a decision that makes sense in context of what LLM customers need. Large SXM-based H100 clusters can easily scale up to 8 GPUs, but the amount of NVLink bandwidth available between any two is hamstrung by the need to go through NVSwitches. For just a two GPU configuration, pairing a set of PCIe cards is much more direct, with the fixed link guaranteeing 600GB/second of bandwidth between the cards.\nBut perhaps more importantly than that is simply a matter of being able to quickly deploy H100 NVL in existing infrastructure. Rather than requiring installing H100 HGX carrier boards specifically built to pair up GPUs, LLM customers can just toss H100 NVLs in new server builds, or as a relatively quick upgrade to existing server builds. NVIDIA is going for a very specific market here, after all, so the normal advantage of SXM (and NVIDIA\u2019s ability to throw its collective weight around) may not apply here.\nAll told, NVIDIA is touting the H100 NVL as offering 12x the GPT3-175B inference throughput as a last-generation HGX A100 (8 H100 NVLs vs. 8 A100s). Which for customers looking to deploy and scale up their systems for LLM workloads as quickly as possible, is certainly going to be tempting. As noted earlier, H100 NVL doesn\u2019t bring anything new to the table in terms of architectural features \u2013 much of the performance boost here comes from the Hopper architecture\u2019s new transformer engines \u2013 but the H100 NVL will serve a specific niche as the fastest PCIe H100 option, and the option with the largest GPU memory pool.\nWrapping things up, according to NVIDIA, H100 NVL cards will begin shipping in the second half of this year. The company is not quoting a price, but for what\u2019s essentially a top GH100 bin, we\u2019d expect them to fetch a top price. Especially in light of how the explosion of LLM usage is turning into a new gold rush for the server GPU market.\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n24 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nThreska - Tuesday, March 21, 2023 - link\nBuy one of these and have ChatGPT at home.\n\n\n\nsatai - Tuesday, March 21, 2023 - link\nTo run it? Yes (but actually no, you wouldn't get the weights probably, the closest think you can get hands on is probably to torrent LLaMA).To infer it?\u00a0No.\n\n\n\nbrucethemoose - Tuesday, March 21, 2023 - link\nI'm sure the community will cook up some low-memory finetuning schemes for LLaMA or whatever else catches on. Alpaca was already tuned with relatively modest hardware. \n\n\n\nsatai - Tuesday, March 21, 2023 - link\nLLaMA is now down to 4b weights and I guess this is the end for now.So now you can live with something like 20GB or 24GB cards for medium size models.So - to run such a model is quite possible. (The issue is, that you won't get to such a model in a licence-OKish way probably.) To infer such a model... oh, that's a bit different story for now and probably for years (decades?) to come.\n\n\n\nbrucethemoose - Tuesday, March 21, 2023 - link\nIts much less when rounded down to 4 bits, probably even less with some clever swapping or frameworks like DeepSpeed, thoigh the larger LLaMA models are better.Maybe I am misinterpreting what you mean by \"infer,\" but finetuning Stable Diffusion with LORA can comfortably squeeze onto 6GB cards (and less comfortably onto 4GB), where inference eats around 3.3GB for reference.\n\n\n\nsatai - Tuesday, March 21, 2023 - link\nYou can use such a model on a mainstream card but you still can't construct it. So we are still dependent on who provides (leaks?) the already computed model.\n\n\n\nbrucethemoose - Tuesday, March 21, 2023 - link\nYep.But I think the probability of good LLMs releasing/leaking is high.And again, stable diffusion is a good example of what happens after that. SD 1.5 alone is antiquated compared to newer Midjourney, Dall-E and such, but with the endless community finetunes and extensions, it blows the cloud models away.\n\n\n\natomek - Wednesday, March 22, 2023 - link\nInferencing is actually \"running it\". You train network, and inferencing is executing inputs on trained model. \n\n\n\ncappie - Tuesday, May 16, 2023 - link\nI think you're mixing up Inferencing and Training.. running the model is what they mean with inferencing.. training usually takes way more memory as you need the extra data for your gradients while performing any form of backprop\n\n\n\np1esk - Tuesday, March 21, 2023 - link\nThe big question is if the memory is exposed as a unified 188GB, or as 2x94GB.

It enables enterprises to scale robotics simulation workloads, such as SDG, and provides continuous integration and continuous delivery for devops teams to work in a shared repository on code changes while working with Isaac Sim.\nIsaac Sim is a robotics simulation application and SDG tool that drives photorealistic, physically accurate virtual environments. Isaac Sim, powered by the NVIDIA Omniverse platform, enables global teams to remotely collaborate to build, train, simulate, validate and deploy robots.\n\u00a0\n\nMaking Isaac Sim accessible in the cloud allows teams to work together more effectively with access to the latest robotics tools and software development kits. Omniverse Cloud gives enterprises more options in the cloud with Azure, in addition to the existing cloud-based methods of using Isaac Sim for self-managed containers, or with using it on virtual workstations or fully managed services such as AWS RoboMaker.\nAnd with access to Omniverse Replicator, an SDG engine in Isaac Sim, engineers can build production-quality synthetic datasets to train robust deep learning perception models.\nAmazon uses Omniverse to automate, optimize and plan its autonomous warehouses with digital twin simulations before deployment into the real world. With Isaac Sim, Amazon Robotics is also improving the capabilities of Proteus, its latest autonomous mobile robot (AMR).

But what if the haystack itself could reveal where the needle is?\nThat\u2019s the promise of large language models, or LLMs, the subject of this week\u2019s episode of the NVIDIA AI Podcast featuring Deedy Das and Eddie Zhou, founding engineers at Silicon Valley-based startup Glean, in conversation with our host, Noah Kravitz.\nWith LLMs, the haystack can become a source of intelligence, helping guide knowledge workers on what they need to know.\nGlean is focused on providing better tools for enterprise search by indexing everything employees have access to in the company, including Slack, Confluence, GSuite and much more. The company raised a series C financing round last year, valuing the company at $1 billion.\nLarge language models can provide a comprehensive view of the enterprise and its data, which makes finding the information needed to get work done easier.\nIn the podcast, Das and Zhou discuss the challenges and opportunities of bringing LLMs into the enterprise, and how this technology can help people spend less time searching and more time working.\n\nThe AI Podcast \u00b7 Glean Founders Talk AI-Powered Enterprise Search on NVIDIA Podcast \u2013 Ep. 190\nYou Might Also Like\nSequoia Capital\u2019s Pat Grady and Sonya Huang on Generative AI\nPat Grady and Sonya Huang, partners at Sequoia Capital, to discuss their recent essay, \u201cGenerative AI: A Creative New World.\u201d The authors delve into the potential of generative AI to enable new forms of creativity and expression, as well as the challenges and ethical considerations of this technology.

It\u2019s a technological feat considering there are thousands of vehicle makes and models on the road, and countless repair permutations.\nThe company\u2019s commitment to AI spans many years, with its first AI solutions hitting the market more than five years ago. Today, it\u2019s working to bring AI and intelligent experiences to key facets of claims and mobility for its 30,000 customers, who process more than 16 million claims annually using CCC solutions.\n\u201cOur data scientists play a crucial role in creating new solutions and the ability to build models, experiment and easily integrate the model into our AI workflows is key,\u201d said Reza Rooholamini, chief scientific officer at CCC.\nCCC has four decades of expertise in automotive claims and collects millions of unstructured and structured automotive-claim data points every year. The combination of industry experience and raw data, however, is just the starting point for CCC\u2019s efforts. The company runs a 100% cloud production environment, providing customers with a flexible platform for continuous innovation.\nAs a market leader, CCC regularly reports AI adoption among its customers to track progress. According to its 2023 AI Adoption report, the company reported that more than 14 million unique claims have been processed using CCC\u2019s computer vision AI through 2022. The company also saw a 60% year-over-year increase in the application of advanced AI for claims processing.\nAnd AI isn\u2019t just being used to process more claims, it\u2019s informing more decisions across the entire claims management experience. In fact, the number of claims processed with four or more of CCC\u2019s AI applications has more than doubled, year-over-year.\nCCC has built an end-to-end hybrid-cloud AI development and training pipeline to support its continuous innovation. This infrastructure uses over 150 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, including NVIDIA DGX systems on premises and additional resources within NVIDIA DGX Cloud.\nThe CCC development teams are using DGX Cloud to supplement on-prem capacity, support supercomputing demand spikes and accelerate AI model development overall.\n\u201cThe AI pipeline we\u2019ve built enables us to unleash all kinds of innovations,\u201d said Neda Hantehzadeh, director of data science at CCC.\nWith 25-30% of its data scientists and engineering teams\u2019 time dedicated to experimentation, coupled with massive datasets that are growing each day, CCC needed to enable a more scalable, multi-platform, hybrid multi-cloud for its training environment.\nUsing its AI pipeline, CCC launched CCC Estimate \u2013 STP, which can deliver a detailed line-level estimate of the collision repair cost based on insurer rules in seconds using AI and just a few pictures of vehicle damage taken from a smartphone. Traditional methods can take several days.\nThis saves time for adjusters, freeing them up for more complex work. This digitalized estimation process helps elevate the customer experience as well as lower processing costs and is currently being used by leading insurance companies across the U.S.\nBut the results are broader. Using the NVIDIA Base Command Platform integrated with their development pipeline for training job orchestration and data management, the CCC team realizes improved productivity. Data scientists can run experiments 2x faster, which can mean more learnings for more innovation and solution development.\n\u201cWe run some experiments on premises on NVIDIA DGX systems, but we may have spikes where we want to add, for example, 10 million more data points and do another run,\u201d Hantehzadeh said. \u201cIf we need additional capacity, we can switch to DGX Cloud. Base Command Platform makes this process seamless.\u201d\nCCC plans to continue taking its investment to the leading edge of AI development, injecting AI and STP into different channels and products across the property and casualty insurance economy.\nLearn more about NVIDIA DGX Cloud and NVIDIA Base Command Platform.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: DGX Cloud | NVIDIA DGX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

A Tel Aviv startup is saving brands time and money by transforming these camera clicks into mouse clicks.\nHexa uses GPU-accelerated computing to help companies turn their online inventory into 3D renders that shoppers can view in 360 degrees, animate or even try on virtually to help their buying decisions. The company, which recently announced a $20.5 million funding round, is working with brands in fashion, furniture, consumer electronics and more.\n\u201cThe world is going 3D,\u201d said Yehiel Atias, CEO of Hexa. \u201cJust a few years ago, the digital infrastructure to do this was still so expensive that it was more affordable to arrange a photographer, models and lighting. But with the advancements of AI and NVIDIA GPUs, it\u2019s now feasible for retailers to use synthetic data to replace physical photoshoots.\u201d\nHexa\u2019s 3D renders are used on major retail websites such as Amazon, Crate & Barrel and Macy\u2019s. The company creates thousands of renders each month, reducing the need for physical photoshoots of every product in a retailer\u2019s catalog. Hexa estimates that it can save customers up to 300 pounds of carbon emissions for each product imaged digitally instead of physically.\nFrom Physical Photoshoots to AI-Accelerated Renders\nHexa can reconstruct a single 2D image, or a set of low-quality 2D images, into a high-fidelity 3D asset. The company uses differing levels of automation for its renders depending on the complexity of the shape, the amount of visual data that needs to be reconstructed, and the similarity of the object to Hexa\u2019s existing dataset.\nTo automate elements of its workflow, the team uses dozens of AI algorithms that were developed using the PyTorch deep learning framework and run on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs in the cloud. If one of Hexa\u2019s artists is reconstructing a 3D toaster, for example, one algorithm can identify similar geometries the team has created in the past to give the creator a head start.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Toaster-Item-Promo-video.mp4\n\u00a0\nAnother neural network can scan a retailer\u2019s website to identify how many of its products Hexa can support with 3D renders. The company\u2019s entire rendering pipeline, too, runs on NVIDIA GPUs available through Amazon Web Services.\n\u201cAccessing compute resources through AWS gives us the option to use thousands of NVIDIA GPUs at a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d said Segev Nahari, lead technical artist at Hexa. \u201cIf I need 10,000 frames to be ready by a certain time, I can request the hardware I need to meet the deadline.\u201d\nNahari estimates that rendering on NVIDIA GPUs is up to 3x faster than relying on CPUs.\nBroadening Beyond Retail, Venturing Into Omniverse\nHexa developers are continually experimenting with new methods for 3D rendering \u2014 looking for workflow improvements in preprocessing, object reconstruction and post-processing. The team recently began working with NVIDIA GET3D, a generative AI model by NVIDIA Research that generates high-fidelity, three-dimensional shapes based on a training dataset of 2D images.\nBy training GET3D on Hexa\u2019s dataset of shoes, the team was able to generate 3D models of novel shoes not part of the training data.\nIn addition to its work in ecommerce, Hexa\u2019s research and development team is investigating new applications for the company\u2019s AI software.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t stop at retail,\u201d Atias said. \u201cIndustries from gaming to fashion and healthcare are finding out that synthetic data and 3D technology is a more efficient way to do things like digitize inventory, create digital twins and train robots.\u201d\nThe team credits its membership in NVIDIA Inception, a global program that supports cutting-edge startups, as a \u201chuge advantage\u201d in leveling up the technology Hexa uses.\n\u201cBeing part of Inception opens doors that outsiders don\u2019t have,\u201d Atias said. \u201cFor a small company trying to navigate the massive range of NVIDIA hardware and software offerings, it\u2019s a door-opener to all the cool tools we wanted to experiment with and understand the potential they could bring to Hexa.\u201d\nHexa is testing the NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise platform \u2014 an end-to-end platform for building and operating metaverse applications \u2014 as a tool to unify its annotating and rendering workflows, which are used by dozens of 3D artists around the globe. Omniverse Enterprise enables geographically dispersed teams of creators to customize their rendering pipelines and collaborate to build 3D assets.\n\u201cEach of our 3D artists has a different software workflow that they\u2019re used to \u2014 so it can be tough to get a unified output while still being flexible about the tools each artist uses,\u201d said Jonathan Clark, Hexa\u2019s CTO. \u201cOmniverse is an ideal candidate in that respect, with huge potential for Hexa. The platform will allow our artists to use the rendering software they\u2019re comfortable with, while also allowing our team to visualize the final product in one place.\u201d\nTo learn more about NVIDIA Omniverse and next-generation content creation, register free for NVIDIA GTC, a global conference for the era of AI and the metaverse, taking place online March 20-23.\nImages and videos courtesy of Hexa\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Deep LearningTags: 3D | Artificial Intelligence | Inception | Rendering | Retail | Synthetic Data Generation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In effect, it processes the same workloads at a quarter of the cloud-computing cost.\nThe CV-CUDA library provides developers more than 30 high-performance computer vision algorithms with native Python APIs and zero-copy integration with the PyTorch, TensorFlow2, ONNX and TensorRT machine learning frameworks.\nThe result is higher throughput, reduced computing cost and a smaller carbon footprint for cloud AI businesses.\nGlobal Adoption for Computer Vision AI\nAdoption by industry leaders around the globe highlights the benefits and versatility of CV-CUDA for a growing number of large-scale visual applications. Companies with massive image processing workloads can save tens to hundreds of millions of dollars.\nMicrosoft is working to integrate CV-CUDA into Bing Visual Search, which lets users search the web using an image instead of text to find similar images, products and web pages.\nIn 2019, Microsoft shared at GTC how they\u2019re using NVIDIA technologies to help bring speech recognition, intelligent answers, text to speech technology and object detection together seamlessly and in real time.\nTencent has deployed CV-CUDA to accelerate its ad creation and content understanding pipelines, which process more than 300,000 videos per day.\nThe Shenzhen-based multimedia conglomerate has achieved a 20% reduction in energy and cost for image processing over their previous GPU-optimized pipelines.\nAnd Beijing-based search giant Baidu is integrating CV-CUDA into FastDeploy, one of the open-source deployment toolkits of the PaddlePaddle Deep Learning Framework, which enables seamless computer vision acceleration to developers in the open-source community.\nFrom Content Creation to Automotive Use Cases\nApplications for CV-CUDA are growing. More than 500 companies have reached out with over 100 use cases in just the first few months of the alpha release.\nIn content creation and e-commerce, images use pre- and post-processing operators to help recommender engines recognize, locate and curate content.\nIn mapping, video ingested from mapping survey vehicles requires preprocessing and post-processing operators to train neural networks in the cloud to identify infrastructure and road features.\nIn infrastructure applications for self-driving simulation and validation software, CV-CUDA enables GPU acceleration for algorithms that are already occurring in the vehicle, such as color conversion, distortion correction, convolution and bilateral filtering.\nLooking to the future, generative AI is transforming the world of video content creation and curation, allowing creators to reach a global audience.\nNew York-based startup Runway has integrated CV-CUDA, alleviating a critical bottleneck in preprocessing high-resolution videos in their video object segmentation model.\nImplementing CV-CUDA led to a 3.6x speedup, enabling Runway to optimize real-time, click-to-content responses across its suite of creation tools.\n\u201cFor creators, every second it takes to bring an idea to life counts,\u201d said Crist\u00f3bal Valenzuela, co-founder and CEO of Runway. \u201cThe difference CV-CUDA makes is incredibly meaningful for the millions of creators using our tools.\u201d\nTo access CV-CUDA, visit the CV-CUDA GitHub.\nOr learn more by checking out the GTC sessions featuring CV-CUDA.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Tim Bajarin covers the tech industry\u2019s impact on PC and CE markets.Follow AuthorMar 29, 2023, 10:00am EDTShareSaveCommentNVIDIA has evolved into a semiconductor powerhouse.  (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Getty Images\nLast week, two prominent leaders in the world of tech made some remarkable statements about AI. Bill Gates recently wrote: \u201cAI is the most important technological advance in decades.\" Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA, in his keynote at their developer's conference last week, said that, \"AI is having its iPhone moment\", referring to the incredible impact the iPhone has had on the tech industry as a whole and for creating a handheld computer for the masses.\n\n\nAlthough AI has been around for decades, ChatGPT has made it more relative to everyone, and we are in the early stages of seeing AI's dramatic impact on all of our futures.\n\nAfter Jensen Huang's keynote, Ben Thompson of Stratechery interviewed Mr. Huang about his iPhone moment comment. Mr. Huang stated, \"I think we were all surprised by how effective ChatGPT was in both its ease of use as well as incredible capability. Almost immediately after the ripples of ChatGPT around the world, cloud service providers and software vendors in all these different industries started to ask the question, what does it mean to them? The combination of both of those things, and they were both independently surprising I guess, but it happened very fast. It's not as if transformers weren't developing and getting larger and larger, and it wasn't as if the innovation wasn't done in plain sight, but it was the ChatGPT moment when it all came together. The user interface was incredible. It was fine-tuned to produce incredible results, and it was all of that that came together in a flashpoint and because it went around the world literally instantaneously, the ripples, the reverberation around it from every industry, happened very quickly.\"\n\nNVIDIA's role in AI was amplified during the developer's conference as Mr. Huang rolled out multiple powerful CPUs, GPUs, high-performance computing platforms, and software designed to power many of the back-end systems that will deliver AI apps, solutions, and services.\n\n\nNVIDIA announced several new products and services at GTC 2023 to expand the applications enabled by GPUs, improve GPU performance and make GPU computing more accessible. These included the DGX Cloud AI supercomputing service, the AI Foundations services for custom generative AI applications, the L4 and H100 NVL specialized GPUs, and the Omniverse Cloud platform-as-a-service. The company also disclosed more details about its Arm-based Grace and Grace Hopper Chips and said it had begun production for its BlueField-3 data processing unit.\nCRN did a great piece that outlined the eight major announcements from NVIDIA's developer conference and is worth reviewing for more details on these offerings-8 Big Announcements At NVIDIA's GTC 2023: From Generative AI Services to New GPUs | CRN. However, one of the more critical things NVIDIA launched was its DGX cloud service offerings.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nWhy is this such a big deal for NVIDIA?\nNVIDIA, on the whole, is a semiconductor company. They provide CPUs, GPUs, and software development platforms for accelerated computing solutions.\n\nNow, with their DGX cloud and AI Enterprise solutions, they have an additional business service that delivers recurring revenue and, in the process, provides a supercomputer as a service to deliver AI to any business. This service would allow any company to deploy AI functionality and capabilities for whatever they offer. It supports multiple deployment options, such as on-premise, hybrid cloud, or multi-cloud. It provides enterprise-grade support services when using NVIDIA platforms in the cloud. And it accelerates the data science pipeline and streamlines the development and deployment of predictive AI models.\n\n\nBeyond giving NVIDIA new recurring revenue, what is most significant is that the DGX cloud as a service will provide enterprises quick access to tools and infrastructure needed to train deep learning models. They combine NVIDIA's DGX supercomputers and AI software through a web browser hosted by cloud providers.\nThis new service includes access to NVIDIA AI Enterprise, a software suite of additional frameworks, pre-trained models, and tools to help a company deploy AI more effectively.\nI have followed NVIDIA since it began. I was one of the analysts invited to meet with Jensen and NVIDIA founders just after it launched. At first, NVIDIA's focus was on graphics cards and advanced graphics. However, due to Jensen Huang's vision and technical prowess, NVIDIA has evolved into what can only be called a semiconductor powerhouse.\nTheir role of integrating the tools to help power enterprises' AI capabilities into their product or services as a HAAS and SAAS model is significant for NVIDIA and their customers and will help businesses integrate AI into their products faster.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

The latest OVX system provides the breakthrough graphics and AI required to accelerate massive digital twin simulations and other demanding applications by combining NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs with NVIDIA L40 GPUs, ConnectX-7 SmartNICs and the NVIDIA Spectrum Ethernet platform.\nSome of the world\u2019s largest systems makers will be bringing the latest OVX systems to customers worldwide later this year, providing enterprises with the technology to handle complex manufacturing, design and Omniverse-based workloads. Businesses can take advantage of the real-time, true-to-reality capabilities of OVX to collaborate on the most challenging visualization, virtual workstation and data center processing workflows.\nReimagining Digital Twin Simulation\u00a0\nCustomers using third-generation OVX systems can speed their workflows and optimize simulations through immersive digital twins used to model factories, cities, autonomous vehicles and more before deployment in the real world. This helps maximize operational efficiency and predictive planning capabilities.\nFor example, DB Netze\u2019s Digitale Schiene Deutschland is leveraging the capabilities of OVX to power large-scale digital twins of dynamic physical systems, including rail networks. Others, like Jaguar Land Rover, are leveraging the graphics and simulation capabilities of OVX systems in conjunction with the NVIDIA DRIVE Sim platform to accelerate the testing and development of next-generation autonomous vehicles.\nNext-Generation Platform Features\u00a0\nThe third generation of OVX features a new architecture, with a server design based on a dual-CPU platform with four NVIDIA L40 GPUs. Based on the Ada Lovelace architecture, the L40 GPU delivers revolutionary neural graphics, AI compute and the performance needed for the most demanding Omniverse workloads.\nEach OVX server also includes two high-performance ConnectX-7 SmartNICs to enable multi-node scalability and precise time synchronization. The Ethernet adapters enable the multi-node scalability of OVX systems and provide networking capabilities for the low-latency, high-bandwidth communication that globally dispersed teams need.\nNew with this generation, the BlueField-3 data processing unit offloads, accelerates and isolates CPU-intensive infrastructure tasks. For deploying Omniverse at data center scale, BlueField-3 DPUs provide a secure foundation for running the data center control-plane, enabling higher performance, limitless scaling, zero-trust security and better economics.\nHelping users keep up with networking performance, the accelerated NVIDIA Spectrum Ethernet platform provides high bandwidth and network synchronization to enhance real-time simulation capabilities.\nAvailability\u00a0\nIn addition to original NVIDIA OVX partners Lenovo and Supermicro, third-generation OVX systems will be available later this year through Dell Technologies, GIGABYTE and QCT.

By taking the automotive product workflow into the virtual world, automakers can bypass traditional bottlenecks to save critical time and reduce cost.\n\nBringing Ideas to Life\nDesigning new vehicle models \u2014 and refreshing current ones \u2014 is a collaborative process that requires review and alignment of even the tiniest details.\nBy refining concepts in Omniverse, designers can visualize every facet of a car\u2019s interior and exterior in the full context of the broader vehicle. Global teams can iterate quickly with real-time, physically based, photorealistic rendering.\nWith NVIDIA Omniverse, designers, sculptors and artists can collaborate seamlessly and efficiently \u2014 from anywhere around the globe.\nWith the ability to use 3D software applications of their choice, these companies can bring their visions to life with physically accurate, photorealistic renderings that show exactly how the vehicle will look, inside and out.\nDRIVE Sim IX, built on Omniverse, also enables designers to flexibly lay out the cabin and cockpit onscreen user experience along with the vehicle\u2019s physical interior to ensure a harmonious look and feel.\nWith this next-generation design process, automakers can catch flaws early and make real-time improvements, reducing the number of physical prototypes to test and validate.\nVirtual Validation\nOnce the design is complete, developers can use Omniverse to kick the tires on their new concepts.\nPerfecting the interior is necessary for customer experience as well as safety.\u00a0\nDevelopers can take these in-cabin designs for a spin in the virtual world, collaborating and sharing designs for efficient refinement and validation.\u00a0\nDigitalization is also transforming the way automakers approach vehicle engineering. Teams can test different materials and components in a virtual environment to further reduce physical prototyping.\u00a0\nAutomotive engineers, for example, can integrate Omniverse and broaden access to computational fluid dynamics data, which can be visualized in high fidelity, with physical accuracy, and in the context of design data. This ultimately speeds design reviews, saves costs and improves decisions related to vehicle aerodynamics and energy efficiency.\u00a0\u00a0\nContinuous Improvement\nThe coming generation of vehicles are highly advanced computers on wheels, packed with complex, centralized electronic systems and software for enhanced safety, intelligence and security.\u00a0\nTypically, vehicle functions are controlled by dozens of electronic control units distributed throughout a vehicle. By centralizing computing into core domains, automakers can replace many components and simplify what has been an incredibly complex supply chain.\nWith a digital representation of this entire architecture, automakers can simulate and test the vehicle software, and then provide over-the-air updates for continuous improvement throughout the car\u2019s lifespan \u2014 from remote diagnostics to autonomous-driving capabilities to subscriptions for entertainment and other services.\u00a0\nDigital-First Production\nVehicle production is a colossal undertaking that requires thousands of parts and workers moving in sync. Any supply chain or production issues can lead to costly delays.\nWith Omniverse, automakers can develop and operate complex, AI-enabled virtual environments, or digital twins, for factory and warehouse design. These virtual replicas facilitate real-time collaboration among teams and are the key to unleashing operational efficiencies with predictive analysis and process automation. BMW and Mercedes-Benz are early adopters of this digital-first approach in their respective factories of the future.\nFactory planners can access the digital twin of the factory to review and improve the plant as needed. Every change can be quickly evaluated and validated in the virtual world, then implemented in the real world to ensure maximum efficiency and optimal ergonomics for factory workers.\nAdditionally, automakers can synchronize plant locations anywhere in the world for scalable design and iteration.\nAutonomous Vehicle Proving Grounds\nOn top of enhancing traditional product development and manufacturing, Omniverse offers a complete toolchain for developing and validating automated and autonomous-driving systems.\nNVIDIA DRIVE Sim is an end-to-end simulation platform, built on NVIDIA Omniverse, designed to accelerate autonomous-vehicle development. It is time-accurate, physically based and supports the complete development toolchain, so developers can run simulation at the component level or for the entire system.\nWith DRIVE Sim, developers can repeatedly simulate routine driving scenarios, as well as rare and hazardous conditions that are too risky to test in the real world. Additionally, Omniverse\u2019s generative AI reconstructs real sensor data into a reactive simulation environment.\u00a0\nAutomakers can also fine-tune their advanced driver-assistance and autonomous-vehicle systems for New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) regulations in simulation. NCAP tests evaluate the safety performance of new cars based on several crash tests and safety features.\u00a0\nThe DRIVE Sim NCAP tool provides high-fidelity test protocols, so automakers can efficiently perform dedicated development and validation at scale.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe ability to drive in physically based virtual environments can significantly accelerate the autonomous-vehicle development process, overcoming real-world data collection and scenario diversity challenges.\nTry Before You Buy\nNVIDIA AI and Omniverse are also helping automakers, like Rimac, enhance the customer experience.\u00a0\nImmersive technologies in Omniverse \u2014 including 3D visualization, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) streamed using NVIDIA CloudXR \u2014 deliver consumers a more engaging experience, allowing them to explore features before making a purchase.\nProspective buyers can customize their vehicle in a car configurator \u2014 choosing colors, interior materials, trim levels and more \u2014 without being limited by the physical inventory of a dealership. They can then check out the car from every angle using 3D visualization. And with AR and VR, they can view and virtually test drive a car from anywhere.\u00a0\u00a0\nNVIDIA AI is also helping companies like ProovStation, which is developing automated bays designed for vehicle inspection. This allows for generation of repair estimates with lightning-fast speed and improved accuracy \u2014 ultimately, reducing costs and increasing productivity.\nIn all, NVIDIA AI and Omniverse are the go-to solutions for automakers looking to digitalize every aspect of the vehicle lifecycle \u2014 delivering game-changing benefits that unleash creativity, enhance efficiencies, improve safety and deliver greater consumer satisfaction.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd the benefits of digitalization extend beyond the automotive industry. With NVIDIA Omniverse and AI, any enterprise can reimagine its workflows to increase efficiency, productivity and speed, revolutionizing the way it does business.

Game as if using a PC on any device \u2014 at up to 4K resolution and 120 frames per second \u2014 even on a Mac.\nGame Different\nI\u2019m a Mac, and I\u2019m now a gaming PC.\nGeForce NOW gives members the unique ability to play over 1,500 games with the power of a gaming PC, on nearly any device.\nThe new Ultimate membership taps into next-generation NVIDIA SuperPODs that stream GeForce RTX 4080-class performance. With support for 4K resolution at up to 120 fps or high-definition gaming at 240 fps on both PCs and Macs, even Mac users can say they\u2019re PC gamers.\n\n\u201cFor Mac users, GeForce NOW is an opportunity to finally play the most advanced games available on the computer they love, which is exciting.\u201d \u2014 MacStories.net\n\nMacs with the latest Apple silicon \u2014 M2 and M1 chips \u2014 run the GeForce NOW app natively, without the need to install or run Rosetta. GeForce NOW members on a Mac get the best of PC gaming, on the system they love, without ever leaving the Apple ecosystem. This results in incredible performance from popular PC-only games without downloads, updates or patches.\n\n\u201cAny laptop can be a gaming laptop, even a MacBook.\u201d \u2014 Laptop Mag\n\nMacBook Pro 16-inch laptops with 3,456\u00d72,234 ProMotion 120Hz refresh-rate displays enable gaming in 4K high dynamic range at up to 120 fps. With NVIDIA DLSS 3 technology, these Macs can even run graphically intense games like The Witcher 3 and Warhammer 40,000: Darktide at 4K 120 fps. MacBook Pro laptops with smaller displays and MacBook Airs with 2,560\u00d71,664 displays transform into gaming PCs, running titles like Cyberpunk 2077 in 1440p HDR at liquid-smooth frame rates.\n\n\u201cNVIDIA\u2019s GeForce NOW Ultimate changes everything. Suddenly, the Mac became a brilliant gaming platform.\u201d \u2014 Forbes\n\nGeForce NOW opens a world of gaming possibilities on Mac desktops \u2014 like the Mac mini, Mac Studio and iMac. Connect an ultrawide monitor and take in all the HDR cinematic game play at up to 3,840\u00d71,600 and 120 fps in PC games such as Destiny 2 and Far Cry 6. With Macs connected to a 240Hz monitor, GeForce NOW Ultimate members can stream with the lowest latency in the cloud, enabling gaming at 240 fps in Apex Legends, Tom Clancy\u2019s Rainbow Six Siege and nearly a dozen other competitive titles.\nAnd it\u2019s not just new Macs that can join in PC gaming. Any Mac system introduced in 2009 or later is fully supported.\nWe\u2019ve Got Games, Say Cheers!\nOh boy! \u201cDisney Dreamlight Valley\u201d is streaming on GeForce NOW.\nHelp restore Disney magic to the Valley and go on an enchanting journey in Gameloft\u2019s Disney Dreamlight Valley \u2014 a life-sim adventure game full of quests, exploration and beloved Disney and Pixar friends.\nIt\u2019s one of two new games being added this week:\n\nDisney Dreamlight Valley (Steam and Epic Games Store)\nThe Legend of Heroes: Trails to Azure (New release on Steam)\n\nBefore you start a magical weekend of gaming, we\u2019ve got a question for you.

It employs the tractor operator, who is trained to manage the AI-driven implements. The company\u2019s robot-as-service model, or RaaS, enables farmers to see metrics on yield improvements and reductions in chemical costs, and pay by the acre for results.\n\u201cWe wanted to do something meaningful to help the environment,\u201d said Ibarria, Verdant\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not only reducing costs for farmers, it\u2019s also increasing their yield.\u201d\nThe company recently landed more than $46 million in series A funding.\nAnother recent event at Verdant was hiring as its chief technology officer Frank Dellaert, who is recognized for using graphical models to solve large-scale mapping and 4D reconstruction challenges. A faculty member at Georgia Institute of Technology, Dellaert has led work at Skydio, Facebook Reality Labs and Google AI while on leave from the research university.\n\u201cOne of the things that was impressed upon me when joining Verdant was how they measure performance in real-time,\u201d remarked Dellaert. \u201cIt\u2019s a promise to the grower, but it\u2019s also a promise to the environment. It shows whether we do indeed save from all the chemicals being put into the field.\u201d\nVerdant is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a free program that provides startups with technical training, go-to-market support, and AI platform guidance.\nCompanies worldwide \u2014 Monarch Tractor, Bilberry, Greeneye, FarmWise, John Deere and many others \u2014 are building the next generation of sustainable farming with NVIDIA Jetson AI.\nWorking With Bolthouse Farms\nVerdant is working with Bolthouse Farms, based in Bakersfield, Calif., to help its carrot-growing business transition to regenerative agriculture practices. The aim\u00a0 is to utilize more sustainable farming practices, including reduction of herbicides.\nVerdant is starting with weeding and expanding next into precision fertilizer applications for Bolthouse.\nThe computation and automation from Verdant have enabled Bolthouse Farms to understand how to achieve its sustainable farming goals, according to the farm\u2019s management team.\nRiding With Jetson AGX Orin\nVerdant is putting the Jetson AGX Orin system-on-module inside tractor cabs. The company says that Orin\u2019s powerful computing and availability with ruggedized cases from vendors makes it the only choice for farming applications. Verdant is also collaborating with Jetson ecosystem partners, including RidgeRun, Leopard Imaging and others.\nThe module enables Verdant to create 3D visualizations showing plant treatments for the tractor operator. The company uses two stereo cameras for its field visualizations, for inference and to gather data in the field for training models on NVIDIA DGX systems running NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs back at its headquarters. DGX performance allows Verdant to use larger training datasets to get better model accuracy in inference.\n\u201cWe display a model of the tractor and a 3D view of every single carrot and every single weed and the actions we are doing, so it helps customers see what the robot\u2019s seeing and doing,\u201d said Ibarria, noting this can all run on a single AGX Orin module, delivering inference at 29 frames per second in real time.\nDeepStream-Powered Apple Vision\u00a0\nVerdant relies on NVIDIA DeepStream as the framework for running its core machine learning to help power its detection and segmentation. It also uses custom CUDA kernels to do a number of tracking and positioning elements of its work.\nVerdant\u2019s founder and CEO, Sibley, whose post-doctorate research was in simultaneous localization and mapping has brought this expertise to agriculture. This comes in handy to help present a logical representation of the farm, said Ibarria. \u201cWe can see things, and know when and where we\u2019ve seen them,\u201d he said.\nThis is important for apples, he said. They can be challenging to treat, as apples and branches often overlap, making it difficult to find the best path to spray them. The 3D visualizations made possible by AGX Orin allow a better understanding of the occlusion and the right path for spraying.\n\u201cWith apples, when you see a blossom, you can\u2019t just spray it when you see it, you need to wait 48 hours,\u201d said Ibarria. \u201cWe do that by building a map, relocalizing ourselves saying, \u2018That\u2019s the blossom, I saw it two days ago, and so it\u2019s time to spray.\u2019\u201d\nNVIDIA TAO for 5x Model Production\nVerdant relies on NVIDIA TAO Toolkit for its model building pipeline. The transfer learning capability in TAO Toolkit enables it to take off-the-shelf models and quickly refine them with images taken in the field. For example, this has made it possible to change from detecting carrots to detecting onions, in just a day. Previously, it took roughly five days to build models from scratch that achieved an acceptable accuracy level.\n\u201cOne of our goals here is to leverage technologies like TAO and transfer learning to very quickly begin to operate in new circumstances,\u201d said Dellaert.\nWhile cutting model building production time by 5x, the company has also been able to hit 95% precision with its vision systems using these methods.\n\u201cTransfer learning is a big weapon in our armory,\u201d he said.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Inception | Metropolis | NVIDIA Jetson \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It improves performance, efficiency and security in data centers by offloading, accelerating and isolating infrastructure workloads, thus freeing expensive CPU cores to run business applications.\nOCI offers a wide range of cloud infrastructure and platform services to its customers to build and run applications and services in the cloud or on premises. By utilizing BlueField-3, OCI is extending its long-established approach of offloading data center infrastructure tasks from CPUs.\n\u201cThe age of AI demands cloud data center infrastructures to support extraordinary computing requirements,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s BlueField-3 DPU enables this advance, transforming traditional cloud computing environments into accelerated, energy-efficient and secure infrastructure to process the demanding workloads of generative AI.\u201d\n\u201cOracle Cloud Infrastructure offers enterprise customers nearly unparalleled accessibility to AI and scientific computing infrastructure with the power to transform industries,\u201d said Clay Magouyrk, executive vice president of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. \u201cNVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs are a key component of our strategy to provide state-of-the-art, sustainable cloud infrastructure with extreme performance.\u201d\nBlueField-3 Boosts Data Center Performance, Efficiency and Security\r\nBlueField-3 is the foundation of the data center control plane that delivers cloud and AI services. Tests show power reductions of up to 24% on servers using NVIDIA BlueField DPUs compared to servers without DPUs.\nThe DPUs support Ethernet and InfiniBand connectivity at up to 400 gigabits per second and provide 4x more compute power, up to 4x faster crypto acceleration, 2x faster storage processing and 4x more memory bandwidth compared to the previous generation of BlueField.\nBlueField also delivers full backward-compatibility through the NVIDIA DOCA\u2122 software framework. DOCA equips developers with advanced, zero-trust security capabilities, including the ability to create metered cloud services that control resource access, validate each application and user, isolate potentially compromised machines and help protect data from breaches and theft.\nWatch Huang discuss the NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPU in his GTC keynote.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company\u2019s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling the creation of the metaverse.

NVIDIA\u2019s automotive design win pipeline has increased to $14 billion over the next six years \u2014 from\u00a02023 through 2028 \u2014\u00a0as announced at the\u00a0financial analyst event held during GTC.\nThe world\u2019s best-selling new energy vehicle (NEV) brand BYD announced at GTC that it\u2019s using the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin centralized compute platform to power an even wider range of vehicles within its mainstream Dynasty and Ocean series of NEVs.\nThis comes hot on the heels of BYD\u2019s recent announcement that it\u2019s working to bring the NVIDIA GeForce NOW cloud gaming service to its vehicles to further enhance the in-car experience.\nDeepRoute.ai, a developer of production-ready autonomous driving solutions, has launched its Driver 3.0 HD Map-Free solution. Built on NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, this product is designed to offer a non-geo-fenced solution for mass-produced advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) vehicles, and will be available at the end of the year.\nBy using the computational power of the automotive-grade DRIVE Orin system-on-a-chip, which delivers 254 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of compute performance, DeepRoute\u2019s HD Map-Free solution promises to accelerate deployment of driver-assistance functions to consumer cars and robotaxis.\nPlus, Pony.ai announced that its autonomous-driving domain controller (ADC), powered by NVIDIA DRIVE, will be deployed for large-scale commercial use in autonomous-delivery vehicles for Beijing-based companies Meituan and Neolix.\nWith NVIDIA DRIVE Orin as the AI brain of their driverless vehicles, Meituan and Neolix are well-positioned to fulfill growing consumer demand for safe, scalable autonomous delivery of goods.\nLenovo announced it is a tier-one manufacturer of a new ADC based on the next-generation NVIDIA DRIVE Thor centralized computer. Packed with up to 2,000 TOPS of performance, DRIVE Thor will power Lenovo\u2019s ADC, which is set to become the company\u2019s top-tier vehicle computing product line, with mass production expected in 2025.\nRimac Technology, the engineering arm of Croatian-based Rimac Group, is working on a new central vehicle computer, or R-CVC, that will power ADAS, in-vehicle cockpit systems, the vehicle dynamics logic and the body and comfort software stack.\nNVIDIA DRIVE hardware and software will be used in this platform to accelerate Rimac Technology\u2019s development efforts and enable its manufacturer customers to speed time to market, reduce development costs, streamline maintenance, and boost vehicle performance.\nRimac Technology\u2019s central vehicle computer.\nNew premium intelligent all-electric auto brand smart is now developing next-generation intelligent mobility solutions with NVIDIA. The startup will build its future all-electric portfolio\u00a0 using the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin platform to create a \u201csmarter\u201d urban mobility experience for its global customers. The start of vehicle production is expected by the end of 2024.\nIn addition, smart will collaborate with NVIDIA to build a dedicated data center for the development of highly advanced assisted-driving and AI systems to explore cutting-edge mobility solutions.\n\nChanging the Rules of the Road\nThe transportation industry is undergoing a revolution, and NVIDIA is leading the charge with its game-changing DRIVE end-to-end platform, which is transforming the way mobility leaders are building advanced driving systems.\nNVIDIA\u2019s dedication to safer, smarter and more enjoyable in-vehicle experiences is core to all aspects of its DRIVE platform, from the ability to train AI in the data center to delivering high-performance centralized compute in the car.\nThe NVIDIA DRIVE AV and DRIVE IX software stacks enable custom applications, and the DRIVE Sim platform powered by Omniverse provides a comprehensive testing and validation platform for autonomous vehicles.\nLearn more about the latest technology breakthroughs in automotive and other industries by watching NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s GTC keynote:\n\nFeatured image courtesy of BYD.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | GTC 2023 | NVIDIA DRIVE \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Nearly 150 billion parcels are shipped every year, according to Pitney Bowes.\nAT&T is using cuOpt to optimize routes for 30,000 technicians. \u201cWith cuOpt, AT&T can find a solution 100x faster and update their dispatch in real time,\u201d said NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, during his keynote at NVIDIA\u2019s GTC technology conference Tuesday.\nAT&T is also testing digital assistants built with NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine to enhance the customer service experience and improve its employee help desk. Additionally, the company is accelerating its data-processing workflow using NVIDIA RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark, a suite of libraries that enable GPU acceleration of data-science pipelines.\n\u201cAT&T has adopted a full suite of NVIDIA AI libraries,\u201d Huang said.\nBetter solutions to the pickup and delivery problems result in lower costs for manufacturers moving goods and services across the globe, quicker disaster relief and hotter, fresher pizza, among other benefits.\nIntroduced in 2021, NVIDIA cuOpt offers enterprises the ability to adapt to real-time data to optimize delivery routes by analyzing billions of feasible moves per second.\ncuOpt is now at the center of a thriving partner ecosystem of system integrators and service providers, logistics and transportation software vendors, optimization software specialists and location service providers.\nA Global Benchmark\nRoute optimization is one of the most critical industrial computing problems of our time.\nWhile the problems involved in route optimization are simple to understand \u2014 what\u2019s the most efficient way to visit the most places \u2014 the computation required to determine the most efficient routes stacks up, fast, as the number of delivery vehicles, customers and delivery destinations increases.\nThat\u2019s made the benchmarks for pickup and delivery problems set forth in 2001 by Hiabing Li at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and Andrew Lim at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology \u2014 who introduced a collection of 300 datasets by which a route\u2019s efficiency can be measured \u2014 a widely watched global standard.\nResearchers have been proposing best route plans for these benchmarks for more than two decades, inventing algorithms that set and reset the world\u2019s best-known solutions, with past winners focusing on making small tweaks to previous routes.\nThe route cuOpt created, by contrast, looks unlike the routes created by previous winners. It was able to find an entirely new approach to the problem, delivering three world-record solutions in the largest instances of the Li & Lim benchmark suite. They include 1,000 pickup and delivery locations.\nThe benchmark\u2019s top objective is to minimize the fleet size first, and the total distance traveled next. Nevertheless, cuOpt was able to cut the distance traveled by as much as 0.8% to 1,000 pickup and delivery locations.\nBy relying on the parallel computing capabilities of NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, cuOpt is able to search for routes more deeply and more broadly.\nThe result: cuOpt delivered an improvement 7.2x higher than the improvement over the previous record on the benchmark and 26.6x higher than the improvement gained by the record-setting effort before that.\ncuOpt for production environments is available with NVIDIA AI Enterprise, the software layer of the NVIDIA AI platform. With enterprise support for over 50 production-ready frameworks, pretrained models and development tools included, NVIDIA AI Enterprise is designed to accelerate enterprises to the bleeding edge of AI, while also simplifying AI to make it accessible to every enterprise.\nEnterprises can also work with NVIDIA service delivery partners including Deloitte and Quantiphi to integrate cuOpt solutions into their business.\nLearn More\nExplore what cuOpt can do for your business, stay up to date on the latest news for cuOpt and join us at GTC.\nResources to learn more:\n\ncuOpt Product Page\ncuOpt Cloud Service Early Access Program\nRoute Optimization AI Workflow (powered by cuOpt)\ncuOpt News Sign Up Form\ncuOpt GTC sessions\n\nAdvances in Operations Optimization\nAccelerated AI Logistics and Route Optimization 101\n\n\n\n\n\nCategories: Accelerated Analytics | Data Center | SoftwareTags: GTC | NVIDIA cuOpt | Smart Spaces \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The Clara ecosystem includes BioNeMo for drug discovery, Holoscan for medical devices, Parabricks for genomics and MONAI for medical imaging.\nUsing NVIDIA Clara, healthcare researchers and companies have recently achieved milestones including generating blueprints for two novel proteins with BioNeMo, conducting a first-of-its-kind surgery with Holoscan, and deploying MONAI-powered solutions in radiology departments.\nBioNeMo Enables Generative AI for Drug Discovery\nTraditional drug discovery is a time- and resource-intensive process. Many drugs take more than a decade to go to market, with an average drug candidate success rate of just 10%. Generative AI, which makes use of large language models, can help increase the chances of success in less time with fewer costs.\nJust as the large language models behind services like ChatGPT can generate text, generative AI models trained on biomolecular data can generate blueprints for new molecules and proteins, a critical step in drug discovery.\nNVIDIA BioNeMo is a cloud service for generative AI in biology, offering a variety of AI models for small molecules and proteins. With BioNeMo, pharmaceutical research and industry professionals can use generative AI to accelerate the identification and optimization of new drug candidates.\nStartup Evozyne used NVIDIA BioNeMo for AI protein identification to engineer new proteins with enhanced functionality. A joint paper describes the engineered proteins \u2014 one to potentially be used for treating disease and another designed for carbon consumption.\nDeloitte is using AI models ESM and OpenFold in BioNeMo for its AI drug discovery platform for 3D protein structure prediction, model rank classification and druggable region prediction.\nNVIDIA Inception member Innophore uses BioNeMo with its product Cavitomix, a tool that allows users to analyze protein cavities from any input structure. PyTorch-based AI model OpenFold is accelerated up to 6x in BioNeMo, resulting in lightning-fast 3D protein structure prediction of linear amino acids.\nHoloscan Powers Real-Time AI in Medical Devices\nMillions of medical devices are used every day across hospitals to enable robot-assisted surgery, radiation therapy, CT scans and more. NVIDIA Holoscan \u2014 a scalable, software-defined AI computing platform for processing real-time data at the edge \u2014 accelerates these devices to deliver the low-latency inference required for AI in a clinical setting.\nIn a landmark step, doctors at Belgium-based surgical training center ORSI Academy brought NVIDIA Holoscan into the operating room to support real-world, robot-assisted surgery for the first time.\nAt Onze-Lieve-Vrouw Hospital, urologists trained at ORSI successfully removed the patient\u2019s kidney using Intuitive\u2019s da Vinci robotic-assisted surgical system, with the help of an augmented reality overlay of the patient\u2019s anatomy from a CT scan, rendered in real time and AI-augmented with Holoscan. The video feed overlay allowed the surgeon to clearly view the patient\u2019s vascular and tissue structures that may have been obstructed from view by the surgical instruments used during the procedure.\nORSI Academy surgeons interact with NVIDIA Holoscan in the operating room. Image courtesy of ORSI Academy.\nParabricks Accelerates Genomics for Precision Medicine\nAccelerating genomic sequencing, the process of determining the genetic makeup of a specific organism or cell type, is critical to unlocking the full potential of precision medicine.\nNVIDIA Parabricks is a suite of AI-accelerated genomic analysis applications that enhances the speed and accuracy of the entire sequencing process, from gathering genetic data to analyzing and reporting it. A whole genome can be analyzed in 16 minutes vs. about 24 hours on CPU, meaning that around 32,000 genomes can be analyzed in a year on a single server.\nAccessible from either the genomics instrument itself or through cloud services, Parabricks allows for flexible, scalable and efficient genomics analysis that can lead to more accurate diagnoses and tailored treatments.\nForm Bio has recently integrated NVIDIA Parabricks into its computational life sciences platform, resulting in a 52% reduction in overall costs and an over 80x speedup, enabling life sciences professionals to accelerate whole genome sequence analysis.\nPacBio began shipping its Revio system, a long-read sequencer designed to deliver accurate, complete genomes at high throughput. With on-board NVIDIA GPUs, Revio has 20x more computing power than prior PacBio systems. The compute is used to handle the increased scale and to utilize advanced AI models for basecalling and methylation analysis. For spatial biology workflows, Nanostring is using NVIDIA technology in its CosMx instrument to power 5-20x faster cell segmentation.\nMONAI Helps to Build and Deploy Medical AI\nAccurate, detailed processing of medical images is crucial for precise diagnosis. MONAI, a medical imaging AI framework accelerated by NVIDIA, simplifies the creation of healthcare AI applications that can label and analyze medical images.\nMONAI recently surpassed 1 million downloads, solidifying its position as an industry-standard tool for healthcare AI developers. MONAI MAPs streamline the deployment of AI models created with the framework as applications that integrate within healthcare workflows and medical software ecosystems.\nBiomedical research data platform Flywheel is incorporating MONAI in its offerings. In collaboration with the University of Wisconsin Radiology Department, Flywheel has used MONAI to develop a model-based image classifier that predicts and labels the body regions present in medical images. The AI application speeds up data preparation from up to eight months to just one day.\nMLOps platform Weights & Biases is bringing MONAI to Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital, providing AI researchers there with a full suite of tools to train and tune computer vision algorithms for AI-assisted object detection to aid diagnosis.\nAI Available Anytime, Anywhere\u00a0\nWith the vast applications and impact of AI in healthcare, strategic implementation of the technology is essential. NVIDIA Clara is reaching developers wherever they are, however it\u2019s needed, through global systems integrators, original design manufacturers, cloud platforms and more.\u00a0\n\nBringing AI to a global network: Global systems integrator Deloitte is helping solution providers around the world bring NVIDIA Clara to the healthcare ecosystem. With access to Clara, Deloitte\u2019s professionals are leveraging MONAI for medical imaging, NVIDIA FLARE for federated learning and BioNeMo for drug discovery to develop innovative solutions for customers across the industry.

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Powerful AI technologies are making a massive impact in 3D content creation and game development. Whether creating realistic characters that show emotion or turning simple texts into imagery, AI tools are becoming fundamental to developer workflows \u2014 and this is just the start.\nAt NVIDIA GTC and the Game Developers Conference (GDC), learn how the NVIDIA Omniverse platform for creating and operating metaverse applications is expanding with new Connectors and generative AI services for game developers.\nPart of the excitement around generative AI is because of its ability to capture the creator\u2019s intent. The technology learns the underlying patterns and structures of data, and uses that to generate new content, such as images, audio, code, text, 3D models and more.\nAnnounced today, the NVIDIA AI Foundations cloud services enable users to build, refine and operate custom large language models (LLMs) and generative AI trained with their proprietary data for their domain-specific tasks.\nAnd through NVIDIA Omniverse, developers can get their first taste of using generative AI technology to enhance game creation and accelerate development pipelines with the Omniverse Audio2Face app.\nAccelerating 3D Content With Generative AI\nSpecialized generative AI tools can boost creator productivity, even for users who don\u2019t have extensive technical skills. Anyone can use generative AI to bring their creative ideas to life, producing high-quality, highly iterative experiences \u2014 all in a fraction of the time and cost of traditional game development.\nFor example, NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) offers the fastest, most versatile solution for bringing interactive avatars to life at scale. Game developers could leverage ACE to seamlessly integrate NVIDIA AI into their applications, including NVIDIA Riva for creating expressive character voices using speech and translation AI, or Omniverse Audio2Face and Live Portrait for AI-powered 2D and 3D character animation.\n\nToday, game developers are already taking advantage of Audio2Face, where artists are more efficiently animating characters without a tedious manual process. The app\u2019s latest release brings major quality, usability and performance updates, including headless mode and a REST API \u2014 enabling developers to run the app and process numerous audio files from multiple users in the data center.\nMandarin Chinese language support can now be previewed in Audio2Face, along with improved lip-sync quality, more robust multi-language support and a new pretrained female model. The world\u2019s first fully real-time, ray-traced subsurface scattering shader is also demonstrated in the demo with Diana, a new digital human model.\nGSC Game World, one of Europe\u2019s leading game developers, is adopting Omniverse Audio2Face in its upcoming game, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Head of Chernobyl. Join the NVIDIA and GCS session at GDC to learn how developers are implementing generative AI technology in Omniverse.\nA scene from \u201cS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Head of Chernobyl.\u201d\nFallen Leaf, an indie game developer, is also using Omniverse Audio2Face for character facial animation in Fort Solis, a third-person sci-fi thriller game that takes place on Mars.\nNew generative AI services such as NVIDIA Picasso, announced at GTC, preview the future of building and deploying assets for game production pipelines. Omniverse is opening portals to enrich workflows with generative AI tools powered by NVIDIA and its partners, and the momentum around unifying the game asset pipeline is growing.\nUnifying Game Asset Pipelines With Universal Scene Description\nBased on the Universal Scene Description (USD) framework, NVIDIA Omniverse is the connecting fabric that helps creators and developers build interoperability between their favorite tools \u2014 like Autodesk Maya, Autodesk 3ds Max and Adobe Substance 3D Painter \u2014 or make their own custom applications.\nAnd with USD \u2014 an open, extensible framework and ecosystem for composing, simulating and collaborating within 3D worlds \u2014 developers can achieve non-destructive, collaborative workflows when creating scenes, as well as simplify asset aggregation so content creation teams can iterate faster.\nImage courtesy of Tencent Games.\nTencent Games is adopting USD workflows based on Omniverse to better streamline content creation pipelines. To create vast worlds in every level of a game, the artists at Tencent use design tools such as Autodesk Maya, SideFX Houdini and Unreal Engine to produce up to millions of trees, buildings and other properties to enrich their scenes. The technical artists often look to optimize their content creation pipelines to speed up this process, so they developed a proprietary Unreal Engine workflow powered by OmniObjects.\nWith USD, Tencent Games\u2019 teams saw the opportunity to easily streamline and seamlessly connect their workflows. Building on Omniverse as the platform for developing USD workflows, the artists at Tencent no longer need to install plug-ins for each software they use. Using just one USD plug-in enables interoperability across all their favorite software tools. Learn more about Tencent Games by joining this session at GDC.\nNew and updated Omniverse Connectors for game engines are also now available.\nThe open-beta Omniverse Connector for Unity workflows helps users of Omniverse and Unity collaborate on projects. Developed by NVIDIA, the Connector delivers USD support alongside Unity workflows, enabling Unity users to take advantage of interoperable workflows. It offers Omniverse Nucleus connection and browsing, USD geometry export, lights, cameras, Material Definition Language and preview for USD materials.

That opens up a whole new set of opportunities.\nIt means data centers can handle twice as much peak traffic. They can slash their power bills by as much as half. They can pack more punch into the confined spaces at the edge of their networks \u2014 or any combination of the above.\nEnergy Efficiency, a Data Center Priority\nData center managers need these options to thrive in today\u2019s era of energy efficiency.\nMoore\u2019s law was a brilliant predictor of the last half-century of technical progress, but today we have reached the limits of the laws of physics. Gone are the days of semiconductor capabilities doubling every 18 months; we must do more with less. Engineers can no longer pack more transistors in the same space at the same power.\nThat\u2019s why new x86 CPUs typically offer gains over prior generations of less than 30%. It\u2019s also why a growing number of data centers are power capped.\nWith the added threat of global warming, data centers don\u2019t have the luxury of expanding their power, but they still need to respond to the growing demands for computing.\nWanted: Same Power, More Performance\nCompute demand is growing 10% a year in the U.S., and will double in the eight years from 2022-2030, according to a McKinsey study.\n\u201cPressure to make data centers sustainable is therefore high, and some regulators and governments are imposing sustainability standards on newly built data centers,\u201d it said.\nWith the end of Moore\u2019s law, the data center\u2019s progress in computing efficiency has stalled, according to a survey that McKinsey cited (see chart below).\n\nIn today\u2019s environment, the 2x gains NVIDIA Grace offers are the eye-popping equivalent of a multi-generational leap. It meets the requirements of today\u2019s data center executives.\nZac Smith \u2014 the head of edge infrastructure at Equinix, a global service provider that manages more than 240 data centers \u2014 articulated these needs in an article about energy-efficient computing.\n\u201cThe performance you get for the carbon impact you have is what we need to drive toward,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe have 10,000 customers counting on us for help with this journey. They demand more data and more intelligence, often with AI, and they want it in a sustainable way,\u201d he added.\nA Trio of CPU Innovations\nThe Grace CPU delivers that efficient performance thanks to three innovations.\nIt uses an ultra-fast fabric to connect 72 Arm Neoverse V2 cores in a single die that sports 3.2 terabytes per second in fabric bisection bandwidth, a standard measure of throughput. Then it connects two of those dies in a superchip\u00a0 package with the NVIDIA NVLink-C2C interconnect, delivering 900 GB/s of bandwidth.\nFinally, it\u2019s the first data center CPU to use server-class LPDDR5X memory. That provides up to 50% more memory bandwidth at similar cost but one-eighth the power of typical server memory. And its compact size enables 2x the density of typical card-based memory designs.\nCompared to current x86 CPUs, NVIDIA Grace is a simpler design that offers more bandwidth and uses less power.\nThe First Results Are In\nNVIDIA engineers are running real data center workloads on Grace today.\nThey found that compared to the leading x86 CPUs in data centers using the same power footprint, Grace is:\n\n2.3x faster for microservices,\n2x faster in memory intensive data processing\nand 1.9 x faster in computational fluid dynamics, used in many technical computing apps.\n\nData centers usually have to wait two or more CPU generations to get these benefits, summarized in the chart below.\nNet gains (in light green) are the product of server-to-server advances (in dark green) and additional Grace servers that fit in the same x86 power envelope (middle bar) thanks to the energy efficiency of Grace.\nEven before these results on working CPUs, users responded to the innovations in Grace.\nThe Los Alamos National Laboratory announced in May it will use Grace in Venado, a 10 exaflop AI supercomputer that will advance the lab\u2019s work in areas such as materials science and renewable energy. Meanwhile, data centers in Europe and Asia are evaluating Grace for their workloads.\nNVIDIA Grace is sampling now with production in the second half of the year. ASUS, Atos, GIGABYTE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, QCT, Supermicro, Wistron and ZT Systems are building servers that use it.\nGo Deep on Sustainable Computing\nTo dive into the details, read this whitepaper on the Grace architecture.\nLearn more about sustainable computing from this session at NVIDIA GTC (March 20-23, free with registration): Three Strategies to Maximize Your Organization\u2019s Sustainability and Success in an End-to-End AI World.\nRead a whitepaper about the NVIDIA BlueField DPU to find out how to build energy-efficient networks.\nAnd watch NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s GTC keynote to get the big picture.\n\n\n\nCategories: Data CenterTags: Cloud Services | Energy | GTC 2023 | Hardware | High-Performance Computing | NVLink | Parallel Computing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This AI-powered innovation helps read warehouse labels and barcodes in fast-moving environments where the labels can be in any size, at any angle or even partially occluded or damaged.\nThis is up and running in a PepsiCo distribution center in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, with plans for broader deployment this year.\n\u201cIf you find the right lever, you could dramatically improve our throughput,\u201d said Greg Bellon, senior director of digital supply chain at PepsiCo.\nKoiReader\u2019s AI-powered innovation helps read warehouse labels and barcodes in fast-moving environments.\nKoiReader\u2019s technology is being used to train and run the deep learning algorithms that power PepsiCo\u2019s AI label and barcode scanning system.\nOnce near-perfect accuracy was achieved, its application is being expanded to validate customer deliveries to ensure 100% accuracy of human-assisted picking operations.\nAt the Dallas facility where PepsiCo is testing the technology, Koi\u2019s AutonomousOCR technology scans some of the most complex warehouse labels quickly and accurately on fast-moving conveyor belts.\nIt also is being investigated to assist warehouse workers as they scan pallets of soda and snacks. The same AutonomousOCR technology has also been deployed to automate yard operations as tractors and trailers enter and exit PepsiCo\u2019s distribution center in Texas.\n\u201cKoiReader\u2019s capability offers up the potential for many use cases \u2014 starting small and demonstrating capability is key to success,\u201d Bellon says.\nThe system is already generating valuable real-time insights, Bellon reports.\nKoi\u2019s technology can accurately track regular or irregularly shaped products, with and without labels, as well as count how long it takes workers to pack boxes, how many items they are packing, and how long it takes them to retrieve items for boxes.\nIt acts as a real-time industrial engineering study answering many questions about the influence of people, process and technology on throughput.\nA broad array of the NVIDIA Metropolis stack is being used by KoiReader across its diverse solutions portfolio and customer workflows.\nNVIDIA TAO Toolkit, DALI and Nsight Systems are being used to train and optimize models on large NVIDIA A6000 GPU-powered servers.\nThe NVIDIA DeepStream SDK, TensorRT and Triton Inference Server are used to maximize throughput and deliver real-time results on edge nodes powered by NVIDIA A5000 GPUs, and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin module-enabled servers for larger-scale deployments.\nAnd every aspect of Koi\u2019s applications are built cloud-native, using containerization, Kubernetes and microservices.\nAdditionally, the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite promises to help PepsiCo confidently scale up and manage its applications and AI deployments.\n\u201cThe KoiVision Platform was built to deliver logistics, supply chain, and industrial automation for enterprise customers. Our solution suite is helping PepsiCo improve operational efficiency and accuracy in its distribution process,\u201d said Ashutosh Prasad, founder and CEO of KoiReader.\nAccelerating Insights\n\u201cWe\u2019re testing out object- and activity-detection capabilities and computer vision today to figure out what kind of data we want to collect with that sort of application,\u201d Bellon said.\nBellon said he\u2019s excited for what\u2019s next. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be on a journey together,\u201d he said.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Hardware | SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | Metropolis | Smart Spaces \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It\u2019s used by visual effects artists to create film and TV graphics that are indistinguishable from reality. But until the arrival of GeForce RTX GPUs with RT Cores, and the AI-powered acceleration of NVIDIA DLSS, real-time video game path tracing was impossible because it is extremely GPU intensive.\n\u201cThis not only gives better visuals to the players but also has the promise to revolutionize the entire pipeline of how games are being created,\u201d said Pawel Kozlowski, a senior technology developer engineer at NVIDIA.\nThis technology preview, Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, is a sneak peek into the future of full ray tracing. With full ray tracing, now practically all light sources cast physically correct soft shadows. Natural colored lighting also bounces multiple times throughout Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s world, creating more realistic indirect lighting and occlusion.\nCyberpunk 2077, previously an early adopter of ray tracing, becomes the latest modern blockbuster title to harness real-time path tracing. Coming shortly after path tracing for Minecraft, Portal and Quake II, it underscores a wave of adoption in motion.\nLike with ray tracing, it\u2019s expected many more will follow. And the influence on video games is just the start, as real-time path tracing holds promise for many design industries.\nDecades of Research Uncorked\nDecades in the making, real-time path tracing is indeed a big leap in gaming graphics.\nWhile long used in computer-generated imagery for movies, path tracing there took place in offline rendering farms, often requiring hours to render a single frame.\nIn gaming, which requires fast frame rates, rendering needs to happen in about 0.016 seconds.\nSince the 1970s, video games have relied on rasterization techniques (see below). More recently, in 2018, NVIDIA introduced RTX GPUs to support ray tracing. Path tracing is the final frontier for the most physically accurate lighting and shadows.\n\nPath tracing has been one of the main lighting algorithms used in offline rendering farms and computer graphics in films for years. It wasn\u2019t until GeForce RTX 40 series and DLSS 3 was available that it was possible to bring path tracing to real-time graphics.\nCyberpunk 2077 also taps into Shader Execution Reordering \u2014 available for use on the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture generation \u2014 which optimizes GPU workloads, enabling more efficient path-traced lighting.\nAccelerated by DLSS 3\u00a0\u00a0\nDLSS 3 complements groundbreaking advancements in path tracing and harnesses modern AI \u2014 built on GPU-accelerated deep learning, a form of neural networking \u2014 as a powerful gaming performance multiplier. DLSS allows games to render 1/8th of the pixels, then uses AI and GeForce RTX Tensor Cores to reconstruct the rest, dramatically multiplying frame rates, while delivering crisp, high-quality images that rival native resolution.\nRunning on Ada Lovelace advances \u2014 launched with GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs \u2014 DLSS 3 multiplies frame rates, maintaining image quality and responsiveness in games.\nPowerful Tools Now Available\u00a0\nFor game developers, NVIDIA today at GDC announced the availability of the RTX+ Path Tracing SDK 1.0. The package of technologies includes DLSS 3, Shader Execution Reordering (SER), RTX Direct Illumination (RTXDI) and NVIDIA Real-Time Denoisers (NRD).\nLearn more about full RTX path tracing.\u00a0\nAnd catch up on all the breakthroughs in generative AI and the metaverse by joining us at GTC this week. \n\n\nCategories: GamingTags: GDC | NVIDIA DLSS | NVIDIA RTX | Ray Tracing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We asked NVIDIA, and the company says that logically this is two GPUs to the OS, but that the NVLink will allow the full 188GB of memory to be used by the system.\nNVIDIA H100 NVL for High-End AI Inference Launched\nThe new NVIDIA H100 NVL brings two NVIDIA H100 PCIe together with NVLink, and a twist. The new NVL version has 94GB of HBM3 memory per GPU for a total of 188GB. That likely means that the sixth 16GB stack is activated, but with only 14GB available for 94GB of the 96GB active.\nNVIDIA H100 HVL\nWhat is really interesting as well is the TDP. These are 350W to 400W TDP PCIe cards. Generally, 300W is the top-end we see from most other vendors in PCIe cards since many servers cannot handle 400W in PCIe form factors. That is a big driver for higher-end OAM/ SXM form factors.\n\n\n\n\nH100 SXM\nH100 PCIe\nH100 NVL\n\n\n\n\nFP64\n34 teraFLOPS\n26 teraFLOPS\n68 teraFLOPs\n\n\nFP64 Tensor Core\n67 teraFLOPS\n51 teraFLOPS\n134 teraFLOPs\n\n\nFP32\n67 teraFLOPS\n51 teraFLOPS\n134 teraFLOPs\n\n\nTF32 Tensor Core\n989 teraFLOPS1\n756teraFLOPS1\n1,979 teraFLOPs1\n\n\nBFLOAT16 Tensor Core\n1,979 teraFLOPS1\n1,513 teraFLOPS1\n3,958 teraFLOPs1\n\n\nFP16 Tensor Core\n1,979 teraFLOPS1\n1,513 teraFLOPS1\n3,958 teraFLOPs1\n\n\nFP8 Tensor Core\n3,958 teraFLOPS1\n3,026 teraFLOPS1\n7,916 teraFLOPs1\n\n\nINT8 Tensor Core\n3,958 TOPS1\n3,026 TOPS1\n7,916 TOPS1\n\n\nGPU memory\n80GB\n80GB\n188GB\n\n\nGPU memory bandwidth\n3.35TB/s\n2TB/s\n7.8TB/s\n\n\nDecoders\n7 NVDEC\n7 JPEG\n7 NVDEC\n7 JPEG\n14 NVDEC\n14 JPEG\n\n\nMax thermal design power (TDP)\nUp to 700W (configurable)\n300-350W (configurable)\n2x 350-400W\n(configurable)\n\n\nMulti-Instance GPUs\nUp to 7 MIGS @ 10GB each\nUp to 14 MIGS @ 12GB\neach\n\n\nForm factor\nSXM\nPCIe\nDual-slot air-cooled\n2x PCIe\nDual-slot air-cooled\n\n\nInterconnect\nNVLink: 900GB/s\nPCIe Gen5: 128GB/s\nNVLink: 600GB/s\nPCIe Gen5: 128GB/s\nNVLink: 600GB/s\nPCIe Gen5: 128GB/s\n\n\n\nBased on the specs, it seems like, assuming the NVIDIA H100 NVL specs are for 400W, that the PCIe versions are vastly superior to the H100 SXM5 versions but without the higher-end 900GB/s NVLINK interfaces. The compute specs are 2x the H100 SXM, but the NVL version has more memory, higher memory bandwidth, and uses similar power for the performance.\nFinal Words\nOur sense is that the NVL will have to be de-rated or the H100 SXM5 will need a spec bump soon to match. This is very strange positioning. Still, NVIDIA says that OpenAI that is using DGX A100\u2019s now for ChatGPT can replace up to 10x DGX A100 systems with four sets of NVIDIA H100 NVL pairs to do its inferencing. It will be interesting to see whether these get de-rated or an updated H100 SXM5 over time.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n TAGSGTCH100NVIDIA \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleNVIDIA L4 24GB Released Upgrading the NVIDIA T4Next articleGiga Computing Goes Full AMD Ryzen Server Cliff RobinsonThey call me \"the STH news guy\" for a reason.  \n \nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAcemagic F3A an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 Mini PC with up to 128GB of RAM \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASUS ESC8000A-E13P Review an 8x PCIe GPU Server \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASRock Rack 4U8G-TURIN2 A Fresh Take on a Classic AI Server Design \n\n  \n\n\n\n5 COMMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            March 22, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            6:28 am                                            \n\n\n\n\u201cBased on the specs, it seems like, assuming the NVIDIA H100 NVL specs are for 400W, that the PCIe versions are vastly superior to the H100 SXM5 versions given they are 300W less but without the higher-end 900GB/s NVLINK interfaces.\u201d\nTDP is a design specification. Just because the SXM part can be configured to allow it to operate at 700 W doesn\u2019t mean it needs 700 W to operate. A processor can be limited by various different things for its performance, power being just one of them. Just because a processor can draw 700 W doesn\u2019t mean it needs to in order to perform a certain workload as fast as one that can only draw 400 W.

Enough time to see some solutions flourish and others fail. While DPUs have been deployed in the cloud for many years, bringing that cloud-like deployment model to the Enterprise has been much slower, if not impossible. Now with VMware vSphere 8, organizations with VMware deployments can start taking advantage of DPUs. That project has gone from theory to deployment and we were able to check it out.\nAs a quick note, we normally would not be prioritized to get access for this NVIDIA LaunchPad demo. We are saying that NVIDIA is sponsoring this piece. Like all pieces on STH, NVIDIA, and VMware did not get to review this piece before it went live to maintain editorial independence. NVIDIA did help show us around the demo environment before we started our walk-through and testing. That was necessary in this case to ensure our first time setting this up was not going to be done incorrectly.\nWhat is the NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU?\nWe have covered the NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU on STH many times. One way to think about BlueField-2 is that it is a NVIDIA ConnectX-6 network interface with an Arm core complex, its own memory, storage, out-of-band networking, a PCIe switch, and accelerators.\nNVIDIA BlueField 2 DPU Block Diagram\nThe BlueField-2 cards come in various form factors. Here is one from our recent\u00a0AMD Ryzen Server the ASRock Rack 1U4LW-B650/2L2T Review.\nASRock Rack 1U4LW B650 2L2T NVIDIA BlueField 2 DPU In Full Height PCIe Riser\nHere is the topology when logged directly into the card\u2019s Arm complex.\nNVIDIA BlueField 2 DPU Lstopo\nWe showed in\u00a0ZFS without a Server Using the NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU a fun demo with these cards running storage stacks using the Arm cores.\n\nWhile the demo we built last year was fun, it was not meant for production. The VMware-NVIDIA networking integration is. That is the solution we are going to review today.\nNext, we are going to show how this works and how we set up the demo environment. If you just want to see the \u201cso what\u201d performance and impact, that will be on the last page.\n\n\n\n \n\n 1 2 3 \n\n TAGSESXiEXSioNVIDIAVMwarevSphere \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articlePredator GM7 1TB PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSD ReviewNext articleAMD Versal 400Gbps In-Line IPSec Demo Patrick Kennedyhttps://www.servethehome.comPatrick has been running STH since 2009 and covers a wide variety of SME, SMB, and SOHO IT topics.

Does it improve performance in area XYZ?  Well yes, of course.  It\u2019s a computer.  You have put a smaller computer in charge of a specialized group of functions so that your CPU does not have to do those functions.  It would be like going nuts over a GPU.  Yes, of course the GPU is going to GPU so the CPU does not have to.  And no, ZFS was not run on not a server, it was run on the computer that is the DPU.  Some of them throw down 200W+ (not including pcie passthrough).  Well, I think that is a correct high number, NVIDIA actually publishes all of the specs EXCEPT the power usage.  You have to go sign into the customer portal to get those.  I kid you not, look: https://docs.nvidia.com/networking/display/BlueField2DPUENUG/Specifications\nI mean, I know there has never been a computer of 200W that has ever been able to run ZFS with ECC memory\u2026\u2026\u2026.atom.  And as your article does show, as usual, it is not that you can put another computer somewhere, its putting it there and getting it to do what you want and talk with the computer playing host to it.  So great.  Its an comp-ccelerator.  It can offload my OVS, cool.  Also there is a certain always around the corner about so much these days.  The future, great (maybe?), but if something is always around the corner, its not being used for anything they told us Sapphire Rapids was good for.  Bazinga!  Intel joke.  AMD handed Zen 1 to China for a quick buck.  AMD joke.  All is balanced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEric Olson\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            March 17, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            11:08 am                                            \n\n\n\nThe article states all VM were provisioned the same, but then doesn\u2019t go on to provide details or at least details I could find.  Was the test sensitive to how many virtual CPUs and RAM was assigned to each VM?

The DPU performance difference while nice is not as big as I would have expected. Afaik AWS mentioned latency decreases and bandwidth uplift of 50% when initially switching to their Nitro architecture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHerschel Wong\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            March 18, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            7:36 am                                            \n\n\n\nWhat was the power consumption of the BF2?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissident Aggressor\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            March 19, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            10:55 am                                            \n\n\n\nWB\nAMD committed something akin to treason, and someone lied to you about something something Intel.  Run Along \u2013 you are not the target audience for this now deprecated DPU nor for anything in the server realm.\nDavid\nThis the previous gen card \u2013 the Bluefield 3 (400Gb/s) offers better performance.\nNo SPR servers to review (I have 13 dual SPR 1U servers) \u2013 no modern DPU to review, no DGX A100 or DGX H100 to review \u2013 yet all of those are in my datacenter\u2026\nIf Patrick had actual journalistic skills and a site that attracts more than a couple dozen people I would let him review the equipment I have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHank Pierce\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            March 19, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            6:41 pm                                            \n\n\n\nHa! This DA troll. You\u2019re realizing at some point they\u2019ve got 130K subs on YT and they\u2019re getting tens of thousands of views per video, not posting anywhere near as much on here.

We already have numbers of DPU to DPU traffic running directly on the cards and those are much better than the VM level differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatrick Kennedy\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            March 20, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            10:33 am                                            \n\n\n\nRight now, only a select number of cards are supported by VMware. These are the fastest BlueField-2 DPUs supported. BlueField-3\u2019s will be, but not yet.\nTo be fair to DA \u2013 we do only get a several dozen people per minute on the main site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEAVE A REPLY\n\n\nPlease enter your comment!\n\n\nPlease enter your name here\n\n\n\nYou have entered an incorrect email address!\nPlease enter your email address here\n\n\n\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign me up for the STH newsletter! \n\n\u0394 \nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
