Bottom Line Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved\nNvidia (NVDA) has been a market darling since the beginning of the decade. This is no secret to any level of investor. Regardless of the market environment, it just seems like NVDA bulls can\u2019t lose. Artificial intelligence (AI) is still a hot topic, gaming as an industry and a hobby has never been more popular, and the market hunger for NVDA\u2019s products looks stable, but can this continue? Will Nvidia stock reach $1,000? We\u2019ll go through all the factors that could push the stock to this level, but through the near future, hitting this price target seems unlikely.\n\n\nNVDA Stock Key Metrics\nLike any growth name with a heavy bias toward being labeled a \u201ctech\u201d stock, NVDA\u2019s basic valuation metrics are extremely elevated. As an example, at the time of writing, investors are looking at an eye-watering 101 P/E value. On its own and relative to many other blue-chip stocks, this is a staggeringly high value. But relative to its previous P/Es, this has been a progressive climb. Yes, it\u2019s an elevated figure still, but so far the market has supported this valuation. Investors only need to be concerned with high P/Es like this when a company\u2019s intrinsic valuation can\u2019t be justified. Given Nvidia\u2019s place in the semiconductor and gaming industry, there are many scenarios that analysts can create that reasonably support a continued high valuation. Otherwise, Nvidia\u2019s stock metrics read like most other popular stocks driven by a healthy company. There\u2019s good trading volume at around 44 million on average and volatility has lowered since the beginning of the year. The stock\u2019s momentum is also strongly in favor of a continued move up. Overall, investors shouldn\u2019t worry about the stock itself; there\u2019s sufficient liquidity and enough broad market interest where there shouldn\u2019t be any shocks when holding NVDA.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nNvidia may be a \"tech\" name, but it also shares characteristics of a typical non-tech blue-chip stock (such as a regular dividend payment and mega-cap size).\nNVDA's basic valuation metrics look elevated, but investors should keep in mind that this premium exists because of the company's growth profile, so the intrinsic value should eventually catch up (if the bull case plays out).\nEntry and exit windows for a NVDA trade are abundant due to the company's size and popularity.\n\nFrom healthcare to retail, finance to education... AI is the catalyst for innovation across major industries.

As the widely considered leader in the AI chip space, most analysts that cover this name are expecting EPS growth moving forward. The cyclicality of the semiconductor industry can be somewhat difficult to predict, but judging by the last several quarters, Nvidia\u2019s earnings seems to be expanding out of the trough. In the second quarter, the company generated an adjusted $2.70 per share against revenue of $13.51 billion. Both of these beat expectations, as did management\u2019s guidance for the third quarter of $16 billion. The average 12-month price target is $645.53 among analysts covering Nvidia, which is around 48% return based on the share price at the time of writing.\n\nFuture Growth Challenges And Opportunities\nDemand for AI chips is steady year-to-date, so investors shouldn\u2019t expect much deviation through the rest of Nvidia\u2019s fiscal year. At this point, the company is stable and mature; idiosyncratic risk is minimal relative to possible systematic risk. Overall though, there are two major arcs on the horizon for Nvidia and its leadership, one supporting the bear thesis and one related to the bull thesis:\nGeopolitical Pressure\nRecently, the U.S. Commerce Department decided to accelerate its embargo timeline on AI chips to China; Nvidia now has to comply immediately rather than in a month\u2019s time. Management expects no major effect on this quarter\u2019s financials because of this change. But, this event was material enough that it warranted an 8-K filing by the company, which should be no surprise to investors. This is less a caution of short-term revenue impact and more so a reflection of how U.S. foreign policy could be a long-term factor working against the company. Investors should also keep in mind that Taiwan, China\u2019s neighbor to the south, is a critical production center for the semiconductor industry. Any escalation to the long-standing tension in the region would be a difficult storm to weather on both a political and economic level.\n\nEntry Into The CPU Market\nNvidia is well-known for its GPUs or graphics processing units. Gamers, artists and scientists alike find value in this tech, as do large enterprise-level customers. The other major semiconductor-based component that all these users need alongside their GPUs are CPUs, or central processing units. Investors in this space understand that if Nvidia were to move into developing CPUs, their success might be so significant that it could generate regulatory action. As of this quarter, this is the exact route that the company is taking, with recent reports indicating that Nvidia is building their offering using ARM technology. The partnership makes sense, given that Nvidia was a cornerstone investor in ARM\u2019s IPO in September. This processor won\u2019t necessarily dominate its respective market (thanks to incumbent positioning by Intel and AMD) and its release isn\u2019t expected until 2025, but investors should see this as a positive long-term catalyst.\nFrom healthcare to retail, finance to education... AI is the catalyst for innovation across major industries. Ignite your portfolio\u2014get the names of the top companies driving the AI revolution in this exclusive Forbes report, 12 Top AI Stocks to Buy Now.\nCan Nvidia Reach $1,000? \nSo can Nvidia make it to $1,000 a share? Not any time soon, judging by current fundamentals. This year alone has given investors a nearly 200% return, which is rare even for a small-cap company, but especially unique given Nvidia\u2019s size and influence. So for the share price to move past current levels to $1,000 would be a near 10x return from the beginning of 2023, although only about 2.3x from the price at the time of writing. Still, we\u2019re talking about price movement that\u2019s on the statistically unlikely side given the exponential curve needed for this to materialize. Recall that the stock\u2019s momentum is favoring upside, so bullish investors shouldn\u2019t stress over any volatility in the near future. But within this same period, bulls shouldn\u2019t expect a jump to $1,000. Judging by the current trendline of Nvidia\u2019s share price movement, that price target seems achievable in a few years assuming no major shocks to the global economy.\nBottom Line\nNvidia is both easy to invest in and perhaps difficult to understand. The average investor may not be able to discern the difference between an A800 and a H800 chip, but they can certainly tell that the market appetite for these products is voracious. It\u2019s also easy enough to look at Nvidia\u2019s recent SEC filings and see that growth is not only healthy, but even accelerating in some aspects. It\u2019s already a trillion dollar company (market cap), so does that mean it can reach $1,000 a share? It certainly seems that way, although this milestone likely won\u2019t be reached any time soon. Again, Nvidia\u2019s fundamentals and technicals look good, so it\u2019s not a bad pick for investors who want a big name tech addition to their portfolio. However, they shouldn\u2019t expect the tremendous 200% return that current investors experienced over the last year. A price of $1,000 isn\u2019t far off, but that\u2019ll be further down the road rather than just around the corner. As always, make sure to perform your own due diligence and only invest what you\u2019re willing to lose.\nRead Next\n\n10 Best Stocks for 2024\nBeginner's Guide To Options Trading Strategies\n3 Top AI Stocks To Buy Beyond Nvidia & MAMAA\n\nFrom healthcare to retail, finance to education...

Nevertheless, investors may need to tread cautiously with the underlying hype train. With expectations heightened, the company just might not be able to replicate prior results. Therefore, I am tactically bearish on NVDA stock.\n\nNVDA Stock May Need a New Viable Catalyst\nSince the start of the year, NVDA stock has gained over 220%, a remarkable achievement given its massive size. Sporting a market capitalization of around $1.14 trillion, Nvidia is no spring chicken. Yet, it\u2019s performing like a technology startup with an exciting new product. Still, its recent print paints a humbler picture, suggesting that the company may need a new (and viable) catalyst.\nSince the end of June this year, NVDA stock has only moved up by around 9%. To be sure, the incredible rally that Nvidia enjoyed requires a healthy consolidation to reload for the next phase higher. Naturally, analysts have continued to sing the company\u2019s praises while upping their price targets. At the highest, Rosenblatt Securities\u2019 Hans Mosesmann forecasts NVDA hitting $1,110 per share.\nStill, for shares to more than double in value will likely require an exciting new application or venture. For example, what helped catapult NVDA stock earlier was the intense focus on generative AI. Today, people across various industries are raving about the utility and intuitiveness of ChatGPT. However, NVDA stock has already priced in this enthusiasm.\nCertainly, other AI applications exist to which Nvidia offers tremendous relevance. Perhaps most notably, the company specializes in automotive software that offers both driver assistance systems and specific autonomous driving capabilities. Unfortunately, this avenue may face significant challenges.\n\t\t\n\n\nIncreasingly, regulators have grown concerned about the safety of autonomous driving systems. Rising incidents suggest that driverless vehicles may be further out than previously thought. Thus, Nvidia needs something fresh and exciting to incentivize investors to hold the risk.\nEven Generative AI Might Not be \u201cAll That\u201d for Nvidia\nWhile it might be a sacrilegious statement, given the heightened interest in digital intelligence, generative AI might not even be all that great. For instance, while people may still rave about ChatGPT, experts have also noted that the protocol can occasionally emit erroneous statements or \u201challucinate\u201d outputs. While that\u2019s not a direct headwind for NVDA stock, such inaccuracies may impugn its market value.\nBasically, powering various advanced AI protocols won\u2019t mean much if the output occasionally generates flaws. If you can\u2019t trust the answers 100% of the time, this flaw requires human oversight for correction. However, if an AI system requires such human intervention, why bother with it in the first place?\nNow, for answering homework questions, the consequences for inaccurate outputs aren\u2019t as dire. However, if we\u2019re talking about driverless vehicles amid heavy car and pedestrian traffic, hallucinations can be deadly.\nIn other words, NVDA stock has gained handsomely from the low-hanging fruit of AI. The next step, making AI more consistently reliable, may involve substantial time and financial resources. Such a phase might yield a lower return on investment compared to the low-hanging fruit phase, making NVDA unusually risky.\n\t\t\n\n\nA Matter of Valuation\nAbout one year ago, NVDA stock traded at an earnings multiple of 44.1x. After soaring almost 300% during the past 365 days, the current earnings multiple stands at just over 110x. Either way, NVDA traded well above the underlying semiconductor industry\u2019s average price/earnings ratio, and its valuation is extremely high at the moment.\nTherefore, it\u2019s a classic baseball question. Do you want to keep your starting pitcher, who might be gassed, late in the game? Or do you want to go to the bullpen?\nFrom a practical standpoint, it might make sense to trim excessive exposure to NVDA stock and rotate into a more valuation-attractive idea. The risk-reward profile just isn\u2019t as appealing as it was a year ago.\nIs NVDA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\nTurning to Wall Street, NVDA stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 38 Buys, one Hold, and zero Sell ratings. The average NVDA stock price target is $649.82, implying 41% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway: NVDA Stock May Need a Break\nThere\u2019s a reason why starting pitchers in baseball need a few days in between starts, and the same concept may apply to NVDA stock. To be clear, this assessment isn\u2019t about casting aspersions on Nvidia. It\u2019s been a phenomenal performer, as any cursory glance at the charts will reveal. However, its valuation is high now, and even the best need a break sometimes.\n\t\t\n\n\nDisclosure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\n\n\n FACEBOOK\n\n\n\n\n TWITTER\n\n\n\n\n EMAIL\n\n\n\n\n COPY LINK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNVIDIA NewsMORE  \n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX PRO Comes to Workstations and Servers for Designers, Developers, Data Scientists and Creatives to Build and Collaborate With Agentic AIGlobeNewswire 19m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces DGX Spark and DGX Station Personal AI ComputersGlobeNewswire 22m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces Spectrum-X Photonics, Co-Packaged Optics Networking Switches to Scale AI Factories to Millions of GPUsGlobeNewswire 37m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell Ultra AI Factory Platform Paves Way for Age of AI ReasoningGlobeNewswire 47m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Dynamo Open-Source Library Accelerates and Scales AI Reasoning ModelsGlobeNewswire 1h \n\n\n\nNvidia GTC 2025: Rubin, reasoning, robotics and moreSeeking Alpha 1h \n\n\n\nGeneral Motors and NVIDIA Collaborate on AI for Next-Generation Vehicle Experience and ManufacturingGlobeNewswire 2h \n\n\n\nNVIDIA and Telecom Industry Leaders to Develop AI-Native Wireless Networks for 6GGlobeNewswire 2h \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tStart Trading Futures\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n\n\n\n\nNVDA\n\n\n\n116.50\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-3.03 (-2.53%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t03:13:43 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time NVDA charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFind News\n\t\t\t\tNews\n\n\n\n\n\nGO\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n            See also:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                - Explore more categories\n            \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

But chances are equally likely you have no idea what these truly mean and how to assess/measure and exploit these different concepts in your trading life and investment life. And it makes sense, these are really complex concepts and generally utilized by quantitative traders in institutional trading. But, why let them have all the fun. So I\u2019m going to try to simplify these concepts and give you a working idea of: a) What these things mean;b)\tWhy they are imported for traders and investors; and c) How to start applying these concepts to your trading and/or investment portfolio. First, let\u2019s get started with the pesky definition details. Arbitrage: Isn\u2019t that a big bird?! In finance, arbitrage generally refers to any short to mid term trading strategies that revolve around mean reversion models and the exploitation of pricing inefficiencies. Despite the fact that the \u201cEfficient market Hypothesis\u201d postulates that markets are efficient and thus unpredictable, I am going to show you that they are in fact very inefficient and all it takes is a little math to reveal these inefficiencies. And Co-Integration? Co-integration is kind of like co-habitation, perhaps more copulation. If two tickers were going to have a child together, it would be a co-integration. Essentially, co-integration refers to what a ticker would look like while integrated into another ticker. The official explanation of cointegration is essentially when two or more nonstationary time series move together in such a way that their linear combination results in a stationary time series. Now this is the involves modelling one ticker after another, so that you can essentially predict one ticker\u2019s price or behaviour, from another.It may help to show you some examples of co-integration via charts. So let\u2019s take a look at some examples below, using the SPTS indicator to perform linear regression assessments:In the chart above, I have placed a co-integration model of GOOG and MSFT through linear regression. Essentially, we use GOOG\u2019s close price to calculate the respective fair value of MSFT. From this, we can see when MSFT is over-valued from GOOG and vice versa, and we can see when the two are fully integrated (a regression to the mean). Now cointegration isn\u2019t a natural order. Not everything can co-integrate. Sometimes, there just isn\u2019t a significant relationship. For this, we must apply some statistical tests. There are many that can be used, such as the Engle Granger Test, but the most popular is the Dickey Fuller test or Augmented Dickey Fuller test. We will talk more about this later. Pairs Trading Pairs trading refers to trading both arbitrage and co-integration. Remember our GOOG/MSFT example above? Well, pairs trading involves assessing, modelling and trading this co-integrated relationship. Let me explain through charts:In the chart above we can see both MSFT and GOOG are in an uptrend. However, MSFT is lagging below GOOG and GOOG is holding slightly above MSFT. Now, because they are both in an uptrend, you don\u2019t want to short, but if you wanted to maximize your profits, you are going to long the stock that is under-performing its benchmark or \u201ccointegrated\u201d pair, i.e. GOOG. We can see this translated into about a 6.18% gain on MSFT vs only a 4.75% gain had you longed GOOG. Now, traditional pairs trading generally involves finding two stocks that are highly correlated but have extremely diverged, shorting the one that is overvalued and longing the one that is undervalued. But I can tell you, that is almost IMPOSSIBLE to find in the real world! So I settle for this as a pseudo-pairs trading fill in!Here is an intra-day example between SPY and QQQ from Tuesday October 31st:Do you notice anything in this chart? During the morning sell down, SPY lagged QQQ and QQQ sold more starkly. SPY held higher above QQQ, which we can see from our co-integration model. So what would have made more sense, to long SPY or QQQ for the bounce?If you said QQQ, you are correct:From its lowest to highest point, SPY bounced 0.57%. From its lowest to highest point, QQQ bounced 0.85%. And we were able to see that QQQ had more upside room than SPY by looking at the co-integration model overlaid on the chart. Now do you remember when I talked about arbitrage and how I said the market isn\u2019t so efficient when you pull in these pesky math equations? This is why. There is arbitrage everywhere, everyday, on every stock. These small inconsistencies in pricing that can be exploited for profit. Now, as retail traders, we likely don\u2019t have the computing and modelling power/setup necessary to scan millions of tickers, creating multiple co-integration models to look for these pricing anomalies and capitalize on them, but we can absolutely have our own co-integration model built on stocks that we trade frequently, or that we like to invest in. But before we get into the how, let\u2019s look at some different examples of co-integration and mean reversion. First, let\u2019s look at an example of a \u201cperfect integration\u201d i.e. the same stock with SPY and SPX: You can see that the blue lines align perfectly with the candles. But watch what happens when we overlay SPY and ES1! (the futures version):Do you notice something.. strange? Despite ES1! And SPY being pretty identical, we can notice a few \u201cdrifts\u201d or inconsistencies in the pricing. This is likely attributable to the extended trading time of ES1! Vs SPY which is limited in its trading times, but it does highlight how these inconsistencies can \u201cpop up\u201d on tickers/futures that are trading almost identical underlying assets (in this case, the S&P 500). What about investments? How is this useful for investments? This is actually a really great question and.. well friends\u2026 I\u2019m going to show you how your investments can thrive with a little bit of quantitative love! Let\u2019s use a very straight forward example, SPY and QQQ. They are pretty similar, tend to follow each other. Over the past 75 days, SPY and QQQ have a Pearson Correlation of 0.94. That is a pretty substantial relationship! If we look at what SPY looks like overlaid with QQQ, here we are:In the chart above, you can see there are areas where SPY outperforms QQQ and QQQ outperforms SPY. If we were to export SPY and QQQ trading data since July 2020 into Excel and create a investment model based on the modelled relationship between SPY and QQQ, it would look something like this:Column B has our SPY close Price, C our QQQ close price, E through G are how we calculate the Dickey Fuller statistic, H and I are our SPY and QQQ Returns respectively, and J is our investment of $100.Now, if we create a SPY trading algorithm off this model and tell it to long and hold SPY as long as it is undervalued in comparison to QQQ, sell when its over-valued and re-buy when its undervalued, assuming an initial investment of 100$, between July 22nd, 2020 and October 31st, 2023, you would have made exactly $36.40 or 36%. Had you just held SPY for that time and not sold when SPY became over-valued against QQQ, you would have made $27.95, or around 28%. The difference seems marginal maybe, but it is quite a stark percent difference. And if you change that 100 to, say, 10,000, the difference starts to add up. So \u2026 How can do you do it?So now for the technical stuff. I am going to try to keep this as easy and straight forward as possible. In a nutshell, the steps involved in developing a co-integration model include the following: a) Finding a rational basis for the integration: It is insufficient to think that one stock should relate to the other. You need a rationale basis as to why these stocks are similar, which can later be confirmed by some tests.  b)\tReference a correlation table or matrix to compare the stocks of interest and identify the highest correlated stock pairs.  c)\tOnce you have identified the highest correlated stock pairs, you can use an indicator such as SPTS to create a regression model, or you can use Excel to create a regression model (for simplicity, I am going to show you how to do it on the SPTS indicator).  d)          Create your co-integration model in Excel by exporting your two stocks of interest and plotting in your linear regression formula.  e)\tPerform the Dickey Fuller test to ensure stationarity. f)\t         You\u2019re done! Now, let\u2019s walk through the steps, using NVDA and SMH as our two basis. Determine rationality:NVDA is a subsector of chips, which is tracked by SMH. Check Correlation:We can see on this correlation matrix, NVDA has a 0.82 correlation to SMH. It is the strongest, even stronger than QQQ which has a 0.74 correlation. In general, you want a correlation >= 0.8. So SMH has passed the first and second step! Create a Regression Model For simplicity, let\u2019s use SPTS. Launching SPTS, it is going to ask us to set a start and end time. I am going to start from the beginning of 2018 till current (approx. 5 years). Then, in the settings, I am going to select \u201cLinear Regression\u201dSPTS is going to output a linear regression model (green arrow):We are going to take a look at the Significance or P value, which is 0.9, even better than our correlation matrix result! And our R squared which is 0.8. This is an excellent R2 reading! We generally will accept R2 of 0.5 or greater, so 0.8 is perfect! We can also see our Error is 138.59, which means the variance present between NVDA and SMH is around $138.59 in both directions. The meat of our model is the equation y = 2.7994x + -114.15. We need this formula for the next step. Export the data into Excel We are going to click the dropdown menu in the top right hand corner by our chart title and click \u201cExport chart data\u201d:We are going to do this for both our tickers. Once we have the data, we are going to just leave the Time and the Close price for NVDA and copy over the close price for SMH so that our Excel file looks like this:Now, we are going to create a column in D called \u201cCo-Integration\u201d. In this column, we are going to use our model equation that was generated by SPTS like so:Remember, we are converting SMH to NVDA, so we take the SMH close price and substitute for X in the equation. Once that is done, we can drag and drop the data to calculate the expected close for NVDA:If we want to use Excel to calculate the equation, we can select an empty cell and use the formula =SLOPE(known ys (NVDA), Known_xs (SMH)):Then, in another column, we use =INTERCEPT(known_ys (NVDA), known_xs (SMH)):Perform Dickey Fuller TestSo now we have our data, we have to ensure there is stationarity. Stationarity refers to the principle that the statistical processes of a stock will remain the same. Stationarity is required for any time series analysis, without stationarity, time series would not work in the way we need it to for this. Now don\u2019t get confused by the term. Stationarity doesn\u2019t mean that the stock price can\u2019t change, just that its statistical attributes will remain the same. For example, say NVDA and SMH both gain 4% in one day, then following day they lose 2%. Now, say in two months, both gain 4.2% and lose 2.2% the next day. This is a simplistic example of stationarity. The statistical processes that are driving these two tickers remain constant, despite the price increase or decrease. So to perform a stationarity analysis, we need to first do what is called \u201cDifferencing\u201d. All this means, is we need to subtract NVDA from our Co-integration formula like so:Then we drag down. (Notice we assigned this column X. This is for simplicity).One thing you will notice is the value of X is negative. This implies that NVDA is actually OVERVALUED in comparison to SMH. We are going to be seeing a lot of negatives ;). Now that we have created our X column, we can go ahead and calculate what is called delta x or x change. This is the difference between the second and first x value, calculated as such:We simply subtracted the proceeding value from the previous value. Once we put in the formula once we can just drag and drop it:Now the last thing we need to do is created a lagged value of X. This is because the Dickey Fuller test requires lagged values to assess stationarity. So we simply carry down the previous X like so:Then\u2026 what do you think?..... we drag and drop :p.So now we are ready to calculate the Dickey Fuller result. And this is actually really easy! All we do is use the formula =LINEST(known_ys, known_xs). Our known Y\u2019s are going to be the delta x and our known x\u2019s are going to be the lagged x. But before we use this function, we are going to highlight 2 rows like so:The top called coefficient and the bottom error. This will give us the regression coefficient (the same thing we multiplied our SMH value by), as well as the standard error. Once we have our two boxes highlighted, we will put in our command like so:NOW BEFORE YOU PRESS ENTER! You need to force the LINEST function to only print the two values we want, so to do this, after we put in our known Ys and Known Xs, we are going to use the comma \u201c,\u201d and put 0 then comma \u201c,\u201d and put \u201c1\u201d. This is going to tell Excel we want a negative coefficient (for the DF test) and to print our standard Error:Then, we are going to press ctrl + shift + enter. Or command + shift + enter on a mac. This is going to force Excel to only print the two variables of interesting:And there are our results! Now, to calculate the DF test, all we do is divide the coefficient by the error like so:And here is the result:So what does it mean? Well, there are 3 critical values on Dickey FullerT Critical at 10% confidence = -1.75T Critical at 5% = - 1.616 T Critical at 1% = -2.567 To be significant, the t-statistic needs to be below a critical value. As a vague rule of thumb, in general, the more negative a value is, the more confident we are to reject the null hypothesis, that the data is NOT stationary. Here, we fail to have a very negative value and we fail to come in lower than any of the critical values. As such, we have to accept the null hypothesis and the fact that this data is non-stationary. If we take, by comparison, the t-statistic of SPY and QQQ since 2020, it is a value of -2.048 within a normal distribution. Thus, we can say that the data is stationary up until a confidence level of 5%. However it is not significant within a 1% confidence level. A side note on distribution:While the distribution type does not technically affect the DF results, we should pay attention to whether we are operating with a normal distribution or an abnormal distribution.  So we need to check the distribution, which we can do with SPTS:So should we accept NVDA and SMH as stationary? No. Unfortunately, it is not a stationary dataset and we cannot use SMH to determine the fair market value of NVDA. I wanted to use this example to show you that stationarity is not a rule and it can be a challenge ascertain it in your models. But if you are big into the indices, generally you will find stationarity if you are looking between 3 to 4 years back max. To recap, stationarity depends on a)\tThe distribution type (a normal distribution should be ABOVE the critical values and a non-normal distribution should be below the critical values).b)\tIn both cases, the more negative a value is, the stronger we can reject the null hypothesis. For example, if we returned a value of -4 on a normal distribution, this would indicate strong evidence of stationarity and would create an extremely reliable model. c)\tIf the data distribution is non-normal, we need the value to fall below the critical values. So, for -1.75, we would need the value to be less that -1.75 for 10% confidence, less than -1.61 for 5%, etc. That said, I went ahead and applied the algo despite nonstationary data, to see how it would have faired using SMH as its anchor point. The initial investment was $200 at the start of 2018 and it would only buy NVDA when the value of NVDA fell below the FMV based on SMH. The result? Our $200 would be $734.85 as of today, assuming we bought when NVDA was below FMV and sold when it crossover the FMV according to SMH, for a total return of around 267%.What about if we bought NVDA and just held it from 2018 till now? Our investment would be up to $1636.52 for a total of around 718%. This is why stationarity matters, because it will affect how our investment does! You see it worked well on SPY and QQQ because there was stationarity to ensure consistency, but NVDA does not have it, too erratic. So what about if you have stationarity? If you have stationarity, then good! The principle is, you want to long the stock when your X value is positive (indicating it is undervalued by comparison to your co-integrated pair) and get out and/or short the opposite stock when your x value is negative. As an investment strategy, I generally recommend not shorting, but just getting out when the x value turns negative (i.e. is over-valued), or simply setting a stop-loss to maintain the bulk of your gains and letting it do what it do.  You can also apply this on the shorter timeframes, like the 1 hour or 2 hour or 4 hour, like the examples I showed above. Concluding remarksSo that concludes my very lengthy post. I really hope you learned something from this, took something away. These are really complex topics and there are not a lot of good resources out there on how to do them properly. Even just finding resources on the Dickey Fuller test, which is predominately only used in economics, was difficult. So I wanted to provide some information on these more complex strategies and principles that I think most traders and investors should have some idea about. Hope you enjoyed and safe trades to all!

The chipmaker powerhouse suffered from a combination of troublesome rumors and difficult market conditions that weighed on semiconductor stocks and the tech sector in general. There wasn't major news about Nvidia last month, but its expensive valuation exposed the stock to volatility.\n\nSo what\nNvidia shares charged higher after an excellent quarterly earnings report in August. Investors were wowed by the company's revenue growth, which exploded 101% over the prior year and 88% over the prior quarter. That crushed Wall Street's forecasts, which were already bullish as the semiconductor industry leaned into a cyclical recovery. Nvidia outpaced its peers thanks to surging demand for its products, which are widely used in artificial intelligence and data center applications. Those happen to be some of the hottest topics among investors right now.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nSuperior performance and exposure to AI-fueled investor optimism, and it may have pushed the stock's valuation into unsustainable territory. Nvidia's forward PE ratio climbed above 45, making it vulnerable to a pullback if investment sentiment soured.\n\nNVDA data by YCharts\nThat's exactly what happened in September, which was a \"risk off\" month. Major indexes dropped, with losses among growth stocks and the tech sector outpacing the market as a whole. Investor fears about slowing economic activity are ticking higher, and the Fed's hawkish September commentary dashed hopes that interest rate cuts could be around the corner. It sounds like the central bank will keep interest rates for the foreseeable future in an effort to combat inflation, and that's likely to create a difficult growth environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, that's bad news for growth stocks in the short term. High rates and slow growth usually go hand-in-hand with lower valuations in the equity market. Nvidia's valuation ratios were fairly high for a relatively mature company of that scale, even if it does have impressive sales growth catalysts.\nThat combined poorly with alarming rumors that came out last month. Some people are casting doubt on the demand for Nvidia's data center and AI products, and a slowdown in that market would crush the stock's most important growth catalyst right now. Channel checks suggest that these rumors could be unfounded, but bearish whispers can still cause damage in these situations.\nNow what\nNvidia is a classic example of long-term potential combined with short term risk. The stock is more expensive relative to sales and earnings than most of the other largest companies by market cap. Investors have to pay that premium because Nvidia has more promising growth drivers, but it requires a leap of faith that the company will realize its potential over the next few years. That makes the stock more susceptible to losses when the market drops or if the company's growth narrative is challenged.\nNvidia's valuation still leaves room for big long-term returns, so bullish investors shouldn't be scared. However, it's still a higher-risk proposition than many of its peers. Buyers need to make sure that this stock is part of a portfolio allocation that's aligned with their risk tolerance and investment time horizon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Downie has positions in Nvidia.

Photography/ShutterStock.com\n\n\n\nThe hype surrounding generative artificial intelligence may have cooled from the frenzy seen at the start of this year. But make no mistake, AI stocks continue to be a major catalyst for the technology markets.\nMarket research firm Statista forecasts that the value of the AI stocks in the sector will increase twentyfold between now and 2030 to reach $2 trillion.\nIn the future, AI is expected to influence everything from the video games we play to the cars we drive and the healthcare we receive. Few areas of modern life will be untouched by generative AI.\nThe technology is still in its infancy. In the coming years, AI stocks should grow by leaps and bounds as the technology evolves in terms of its sophistication and capabilities.\nWhere we go from here is anyone\u2019s guess. But artificial intelligence represents a huge new market that should help to lift stocks higher in the coming months and years.\nThese seven are the leading AI stocks in the pack.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\nChipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is arguably the biggest beneficiary and market leader when it comes to the best AI stocks to buy.\nThe company controls between 70% and 80% of the global market for AI microchips. The supercomputer used by\u00a0 OpenAI to develop its generative AI technologies runs on 10,000 Nvidia graphics processing unit chips. And that\u2019s just one computer.\nTo say that Nvidia\u2019s microchips and semiconductors are in-demand is the understatement of the year.\nOwing to surging demand, Nvidia\u2019s last two earnings prints have been blockbusters. At the end of August, Nvidia reported that its revenue in Q2 more than doubled from a year earlier to $13.51 billion, and it rose 88% from the previous first quarter of this year.\nThe company also reported that its gross margins increased 25.3 percentage points to 71.2% during Q2 because of growth in its AI chip sales.\nManagement forecasts that sales in Q3 will grow 170% from a year earlier. NVDA stock has increased 216% this year and is up 635% over five years.\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a clear leader in the AI arms race that is now underway.\nThe Seattle-based technology giant is working with OpenAI to further enhance the capabilities of ChatGPT and its predecessor GPT-4, and also plans to integrate AI into other areas of its business, from its Azure cloud computing unit to its Xbox video games.\nMSFT stock has not been a huge beneficiary of the hype surrounding AI this year. So far in 2023, Microsoft\u2019s share price has risen 38%. Compare that to the 217% gain in NVDA stock since January.\nAnalysts speculate that Microsoft\u2019s shares have been held back by lingering uncertainty related to its $68 billion acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI). However, in time, MSFT stock can be expected to run sharply higher.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD)\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\nWhile Nvidia remains the AI leader in the microchip and semiconductor space, controlling 70% of the global market, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is closing the gap.\nOver the last two years, AMD has taken important market share from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), nearly doubling its share of the Data Center segment.\nAMD\u2019s share of the AI market is expected to grow even further with the release of its new AI microchip called the \u201cMI300X.\u201d\nThe MI300X is AMD\u2019s biggest push into AI yet and is a direct challenge to Nvidia\u2019s chips.\nThe MI300X uses 192 gigabits of memory, which means it can accommodate bigger AI models than other chips, notably Nvidia\u2019s rival H100 chip that supports 120 gigabits of memory.\nAMD\u2019s management team has said that AI represents a strategic growth opportunity for the company, and that the MI300X chip has been designed specifically for large language models and other generative AI applications. AMD stock is up 67% ytd.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM)\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\nShares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) having been trading sideways over the past six months (down 0.03%) after the company posted soft financial results and on geopolitical concerns that China may one-day invade Taiwan, whose territory it claims as its own.\nHowever, investors shouldn\u2019t count out the world\u2019s largest chip maker. The company remains the top producer of the world\u2019s most advanced microchips, semiconductors, and processors, accounting for 60% of the global supply.\nTaiwan Semi produces nearly all the AI chips designed by Nvidia, AMD and others. Taiwan Semiconductors importance to the global chip and AI industries cannot be overstated.\nUnfortunately, in its most recent earnings print, the company posted its first profit decline in four years as demand for consumer electronics weakens worldwide. Regardless, demand for the fabrication of AI chips remains sky high, and the company\u2019s guidance for Q3 revenue of $17.5 billion is in line with analyst forecasts.\nTSM stock is up 20% so far in 2023.\nAlphabet (GOOG/GOOGL)\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\nThe code red issued concerning AI within Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG/NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains in effect.\nThe company behind the popular search engine is moving quickly to not only rollout its own AI chatbot, called \u201cBard,\u201d but also integrate AI into its other technologies and applications.\nMost recently, Alphabet announced that it is adding generative AI technology to its suite of digital assistants and smart home devices.\nThe same technology that underpins Google\u2019s Bard chatbot is also being used in its digital assistant software.\nPeople can now give their digital assistants and connected home devices voice prompts to carry out increasingly sophisticated tasks such as setting timers and making hands-free phone calls on behalf of their owners.\nThe company is also adding generative AI to its work applications such as Gmail and Google Docs, and its Pixel smartphones and Android operating system. GOOGL stock has gained 56% this year.\nAdobe (ADBE)\nSource: r.classen / Shutterstock.com\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), the software company behind Photoshop, Illustrator and PDF, has gone all in on AI.\nThe company recently introduced a new suite of generative AI products that position it as a clear leader in the space and should be a boon to future earnings.\nThe launch of Adobe Firefly this past spring has already proved to be a big hit for the company. Firefly, which uses AI to turn text prompts from users into images has already been used to produce more than two billion pictures, according to the company.\nAdobe is now looking to raise the prices on its various AI features and planning to increase prices by 8% to 10% for its creative cloud plans starting on Nov. 1.\nAnalysts have praised Adobe\u2019s aggressive push into AI, saying the moves the company is making are already paying dividends. And the company has made clear that it plans to continue introducing new AI tools and enhancements for consumers to take advantage of in the coming months and years. ADBE stock is up 57% year to date.\nMarvell Technology (MRVL)\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\nAnother microchip and semiconductor company that has a big opportunity in AI is Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL).\nIn fact, MRVL stock rose more than 30% at the end of May when management highlighted the company\u2019s potential AI catalyst during an earnings call.\nThe company is seeing strong demand and earnings growth, driven in large part by the application of AI across its various business segments.\nMarvell recently beat Wall Street expectations with its Q2 print, reporting a profit of 33 cents per share on sales of $1.34 billion beating analyst estimates.\nManagement has stressed that they see AI being a big catalyst for the company and stock in the years ahead. The strong earnings and expectations for AI have MRVL stock trending higher.\nSince January, MRVL stock has gained 52%, bringing its five year gain to 203%.\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in NVDA, GOOGL and MSFT.

NVIDIA offers the most advanced, highest-performing AI car computers for the transportation industry, with DRIVE Orin selected for use by more than 25 global automakers.\nAlready a tier-one manufacturer of DRIVE Orin-powered electronic control units (ECUs), Foxconn will also manufacture ECUs featuring DRIVE Thor, once available.\nThe upcoming DRIVE Thor superchip harnesses advanced AI capabilities first deployed in NVIDIA Grace CPUs and Hopper and Ada Lovelace architecture-based GPUs \u2014 and is expected to deliver a staggering 2,000 teraflops of high-performance compute to enable functionally safe and secure intelligent driving.\nNext-generation NVIDIA DRIVE Thor.\nHeightened Senses\nUnveiled at GTC last year, DRIVE Hyperion 9 is the latest evolution of NVIDIA\u2019s modular development platform and reference architecture for automated and autonomous vehicles. Set to be powered by DRIVE Thor, it will integrate a qualified sensor architecture for level 3 urban and level 4 highway driving scenarios.\nWith a diverse and redundant array of high-resolution camera, radar, lidar and ultrasonic sensors, DRIVE Hyperion can process an extraordinary amount of safety-critical data to enable vehicles to deftly navigate their surroundings.\nAnother advantage of DRIVE Hyperion is its compatibility across generations, as it retains the same compute form factor and NVIDIA DriveWorks application programming interfaces, enabling a seamless transition from DRIVE Orin to DRIVE Thor and beyond.\nPlus, DRIVE Hyperion can help speed development times and lower costs for electronics manufacturers like Foxconn, since the sensors available on the platform have cleared NVIDIA\u2019s rigorous qualification processes.\nThe shift to software-defined vehicles with a centralized electronic architecture will drive the need for high-performance, energy-efficient computing solutions such as DRIVE Thor. By coupling it with the DRIVE Hyperion sensor architecture, Foxconn and its automotive customers will be better equipped to realize a new era of safe and intelligent EVs.\nSince its inception, Hon Hai Tech Day has served as a launch pad for Foxconn to showcase its latest endeavors in contract design and manufacturing services and new technologies. These accomplishments span the EV sector and extend to the broader consumer electronics industry.\nCatch more on Liu and Huang\u2019s fireside chat at Hon Hai Tech Day.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The company's shares more than tripled in 2023 as customers have been lining up to buy its artificial-intelligence focused graphics cards.\n\nHowever, savvy investors might be wondering if they should use this pullback as an opportunity to buy the stock. That decision could hinge on two factors: Nvidia's valuation and its long-term prospects.\nLet's check if its valuation is attractive enough to consider buying it and then move on to the company's prospects over the next three years to see if they are solid enough to deliver more upside.\nNvidia is expensive, but that's half the story\nThere is no doubt that Nvidia stock is richly valued. The price-to-sales ratio is 35, which is way higher than its five-year average sales multiple of 19.6. The sales multiple shot up tremendously this year thanks to the stock's impressive rally, but it is worth noting that the company's revenue has grown at a faster pace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA PS ratio data by YCharts.\nThere is a similar story with the company's price-to-earnings ratio, which currently stands at 110. The terrific year-over-year growth in earnings per share last quarter explains why the earnings multiple has come down drastically in recent months.\n\nNVDA PE ratio data by YCharts.\nNvidia is growing fast enough to justify its valuation, and more importantly, the company is relatively cheaper right now as its sales and earnings multiples have dropped due to the amazing growth last quarter. And its forward sales and earnings multiples are substantially lower than the trailing multiples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA PE ratio (forward one-year) data by YCharts.\nThe reason for the lower forward multiples is the tremendous growth that Nvidia is expected to deliver in the future. Its top line is forecast to jump to $82 billion in fiscal 2025, triple the fiscal 2023 revenue of $27 billion. Analysts are projecting its earnings to increase to $16.98 per share in fiscal 2025, a fivefold jump from its fiscal 2023 earnings of $3.34 per share.\nThese projections suggest that Nvidia seems capable of maintaining its outstanding growth over the next couple of years, though don't be surprised to see it do so for a longer time.\nSolid prospects point toward more upside\nAI is the biggest catalyst for Nvidia right now, with its graphics processing units (GPUs) in massive demand because of their ability to train large artificial intelligence (AI) models. The demand for the company's AI-focused GPUs is so strong that customers are reportedly having to wait six months to get its flagship H100 data center graphics\u00a0card.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing estimates that those data center GPUs could be in short supply for the next year and a half, but Nvidia is taking steps along with its suppliers to improve their availability. Microsoft chief technology officer Kevin Scott recently said that his company is now finding it easier to get Nvidia's chips.\nNvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress said on the August earnings conference call that the company expects supply to increase each quarter through next year, which should put it in a good position to cater to the demand for its GPUs. The Financial Times reports that Nvidia might even triple its output of H100 GPUs next year, which could help the company deliver faster growth than analysts are anticipating.\nMarket research firm Gartner estimates that the market for AI semiconductors will see secular growth, generating $119 billion in annual revenue in 2027 as compared to $53 billion this year. Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis estimates that Nvidia's share of AI chips stands at 85%, so the company could deliver the $96 billion revenue that analysts are expecting in fiscal 2026.\n\nNVDA revenue estimates\u00a0data by YCharts.\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiply the estimated top line in fiscal 2026 with Nvidia's five-year average sales multiple of 19.6, and its market cap could increase to $1.88 trillion in the next three years. That would be a 66% jump from current levels, which means that investors who buy this AI stock now can expect healthy gains over the next three years.\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The recent surge in artificial intelligence interest has caused an increased need for incredible computing power, causing NVDA stock to skyrocket. The 187% YTD growth is nothing to scoff at, particularly for a company of Nvidia\u2019s size.\nThis has proven that Nvidia is a stock worth owning, rather than trading. Given its rather long, momentum-driven moves, this stock has likely made a few traders plenty of money. However, it\u2019s also a stock that\u2019s proven to be worth buying on pullbacks. Long-term investors who simply bought NVDA stock on every 10%+ pullback have likely done better than the vast majority of traders in this name.\nThus, while I do think some near-term downside could be on the horizon for Nvidia (its valuation is enough to make most investors dizzy), I also think this is a stock that\u2019s likely to retain its status as one worth holding for the long-term.\nInvestors may want to be patient with NVDA stock, but consider buying on future pullbacks, even if the stock appears to be expensive in its current state. Let\u2019s discuss why.\nU.S Chip Ban Isn\u2019t That Scary for Investors\nHeadline-driven selling is something that happens with any stock. Nvidia was obviously hit by the news that the U.S. would be restricting the export of AI chips to China. After all, China remains a massive market for Nvidia, and the ongoing geopolitical tension between the U.S. and China is one of the only major overhangs for this stock.\nThat said, I think investors may want to wait for the dust to settle before panic selling.\nThese trade restrictions between the U.S. and China are typically temporary. Nvidia remains a dominant AI chip provider in China with over 90% market share. Thus, so long as AI demand continues to grow globally, Nvidia should have plenty of runway to grow while these geopolitical issues get hammered out. Nvidia can\u2019t currently meet existing demand, so I\u2019m not worried about this ban at the moment.\nNvidia Is Strong in Generative AI\nOver nearly a decade, the Nvidia Jetson platform gained broad adoption in various industries. Generative AI\u2019s impact extends beyond text and language to computer vision. This benefits autonomous machines and robotics, offering faster development and greater accuracy than traditional methods.\nNvidia has harnessed the capabilities of generative AI for recognizing and interacting with untrained elements. This extends to video search, asset tracking and edge computing, advancing, advancing computer vision. The company\u2019s Jetson Generative AI Lab empowers developers to use open-source generative AI models for edge computing. This new software enables edge-based generative AI, making an easy start for Jetson developers.\nThus, for those bullish on Nvidia\u2019s position in the AI race, this is a key catalyst to watch.\nArm-Based PC Chips by Nvidia\nNvidia is partnering with Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) to expand into CPU design for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows. This move is seen as a challenge to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which gained market share with its in-house Arm-based chips for Macs.\nNvidia also intends to manufacture PC-chips with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) potentially releasing them as early as 2025. Arm-based laptop chip maker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) will also unveil more information about its flagship chip designed by former Apple engineers.\nWhere Is NVDA Stock Headed from Here?\nAI technology offers significant potential for productivity and efficiency gains. As new AI applications continue to emerge, demand for AI chips, like Nvidia\u2019s, remains high. While competitors like AMD and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) enter the AI chip market, Nvidia\u2019s strong position should mitigate their impact.\nBeyond AI, Nvidia has non-AI catalysts, including a rebound in gaming chip demand and the potential to challenge Intel in the PC chip space. Given these factors, NVDA stock presents an appealing long-term investment opportunity, despite its currently pricey valuation.\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a LONG position in AAPL\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

A Comprehensive Guide      GuruFocus Research   October 2, 2023 4 MINUTES_READ              IN_THIS_ARTICLE:  NVDA       VALU         With a daily gain of 2.95%, a 3-month gain of 5.5%, and an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of 4.14, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) presents an interesting case for value investors. Is this stock modestly overvalued or does it offer a hidden bargain? This comprehensive analysis aims to answer this question and provide an in-depth look into NVIDIA's valuation. Company Introduction Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA. Click here to check it out.  NVDA 30-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of NVDA  NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading developer of graphics processing units, essential semiconductors used in artificial intelligence. The company offers not only AI GPUs but also a software platform, Cuda, used for AI model development and training. NVIDIA is also expanding its data center networking solutions, helping to tie GPUs together to handle complex workloads. At a stock price of $447.84 per share, NVIDIA's valuation compared to its GF Value of $386.45, indicates that the stock is modestly overvalued. The following analysis provides a detailed examination of NVIDIA's value, integrating financial assessment with essential company details.   Unveiling NVIDIA (NVDA)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive Guide   Understanding GF Value The GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. It is calculated based on three factors: historical multiples that the stock has traded at, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of business performance. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. NVIDIA's stock is estimated to be modestly overvalued based on this valuation method. Given the stock's current price, the long-term return of NVIDIA's stock is likely to be lower than its business growth.   Unveiling NVIDIA (NVDA)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive Guide   These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk. Assessing NVIDIA's Financial Strength Companies with poor financial strength offer investors a high risk of permanent capital loss. To avoid this, it's crucial to review a company's financial strength before purchasing shares. NVIDIA has a cash-to-debt ratio of 1.46, which ranks worse than 57.08% of 904 companies in the Semiconductors industry. However, the overall financial strength of NVIDIA is 8 out of 10, indicating that the company's financial strength is strong.   Unveiling NVIDIA (NVDA)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive Guide   Profitability and Growth Investing in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, is generally less risky. NVIDIA, with its high profit margins, is a safer investment. The company has been profitable 10 times over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $32.70 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $4.14. Its operating margin is 33.04%, which ranks better than 94.97% of 954 companies in the Semiconductors industry. Overall, the profitability of NVIDIA is ranked 10 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.   STORY_CONTINUES Growth is a crucial factor in the valuation of a company. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of NVIDIA is 34.5%, which ranks better than 87.64% of 874 companies in the Semiconductors industry. However, the 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 20.1%, which ranks worse than 52.58% of 776 companies in the Semiconductors industry.Evaluating Profitability: ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) can also help evaluate its profitability. ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC exceeds the WACC, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. In the past 12 months, NVIDIA's ROIC was 41.26 while its WACC came in at 16.66.  Unveiling NVIDIA (NVDA)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive Guide  ConclusionOverall, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is estimated to be modestly overvalued. The company's financial condition is strong, and its profitability is strong. However, its growth ranks worse than 52.58% of 776 companies in the Semiconductors industry.

U.S. government export controls on advanced semiconductors threatened to cost his chip company hundreds of millions in revenue. His solution was a clever tweak to his flagship AI processors, Ampere A100 and next-gen Hopper H100, followed by a fresh label for the Chinese market. Problem solved, right?  Now the Biden administration\u00a0wants to put a stop\u00a0to the AI gravy train that rocketed Nvidia\u2019s market cap into the\u00a0$1 trillion stratosphere, since it might inadvertently bolster China\u2019s military capabilities. Nvidia\u2019s business with China is critical. In August 2022, the company disclosed that it was anticipating $400 million in quarterly sales from China, which were immediately at risk owing to the initial U.S. government ban. If customers canceled their orders, it would hit them hard. One of the 30 wealthiest entrepreneurs in the world, Huang swiftly unveiled a new line of chips, tailor-made for the Chinese market\u2014the A800 and H800. These chips featured a data transfer rate below the 600 GBps threshold at which Biden\u2019s export ban comes into play. The reason why the White House targeted chips with such high chip-to-chip bandwidth speeds is simple: They are uniquely suited for being networked together in data centers and supercomputing facilities that train and run large AI models, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. News the White House was now closing this key loophole sent shares in the company on their sharpest one-day slump in over two months. The stock closed 4.7% lower on Tuesday and is expected to trade weaker at the start of today\u2019s session. Risks from Taiwan This time the company sought to assure investors its business would be spared any material hit\u2026at least initially. \u201cGiven the strength of demand for our products worldwide, we do not anticipate that the additional restrictions will have a near-term meaningful impact on our financial results,\u201d the company said in a\u00a0regulatory filing on Tuesday. Biden\u2019s renewed crackdown is emblematic of the West reevaluating its strategy toward the world\u2019s most populous authoritarian state. Once considered to be just as much an economic partner as a political rival, China is now viewed more as a risk than an opportunity, especially after Beijing supported Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s ongoing war in Ukraine. The White House fears China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, may be stockpiling high-tech chips in preparation for a possible military invasion of his own in Taiwan.   Story Continues China lays claim to the island nation, but younger inhabitants\u2014having seen what happened to Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy after it fell under direct control of Beijing\u2014are drifting towards support of\u00a0formal independence.In terms of its impact on the global economy, a war in Taiwan (or even a potential blockade) would be orders of magnitude worse than effects from the conflict in Ukraine. Taiwan is absolutely critical to the global supply of semiconductors: Nvidia outsources all production of its flagship A100 and H100 chips to TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.), the most advanced foundry for chip production worldwide.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy Dashboard   More Info  Recommended Stories   We\u02bcre unable to load stories right now. \n\n\n  Copyright \u00a9 2025 Yahoo.

Moore31 Oct 20233 min readSamuel K. Moore is IEEE Spectrum\u2019s semiconductor editor.\n        Nicholas Little\n    In a keynote address at the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design Monday, Nvidia chief technology officer Bill Dally revealed that the company has been testing a large-language-model AI to boost the productivity of its chip designers.\u201cEven if we made them 5 percent more productive, that\u2019s a huge win,\u201d Dally said in an interview ahead of the conference. Nvidia can\u2019t claim it\u2019s reached that goal yet. The system, called ChipNeMo, isn\u2019t ready for the kind of large\u2014and lengthy\u2014trial that would really prove its worth. But a cadre of volunteers at Nvidia is using it, and there are some positive indications, Dally said.ChipNeMo is a specially tuned spin on a large language model. It starts as an LLM made up of 43 billion parameters that acquires its skills from one trillion tokens\u2014fundamental language units\u2014of data. \u201cThat\u2019s like giving it a liberal arts education,\u201d said Dally. \u201cBut if you want to send it to graduate school and have it become specialized, you fine-tune it on a particular corpus of data\u2026in this case, chip design.\u201dThat took two more steps. First, that already-trained model was trained again on 24 billion tokens of specialized data. Twelve billion of those tokens came from design documents, bug reports, and other English-language internal data accumulated over Nvidia\u2019s 30 years work designing chips. The other 12 billion tokens came from code, such as the hardware description language Verilog and scripts for carrying things out with industrial electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Finally, the resulting model was submitted to \u201csupervised fine-tuning,\u201d training on 130,000 sample conversations and designs.The result, ChipNeMo, was set three different tasks: as a chatbot, as an EDA-tool script writer, and as a summarizer of bug reports.Acting as a chatbot for engineers could save designers time, said Dally. \u201cSenior designers spend a lot of time answering questions for junior designers,\u201d he said. As a chatbot, the AI can save senior designer\u2019s time by answering questions that require experience, like what a strange signal might mean or how a specific test should be run.Chatbots, however, are notorious for their willingness to lie when they don\u2019t know the answer and their tendency to hallucinate. So Nvidia developers integrated a function called retrieval-augmented generation into ChipNeMo to keep it on the level. That function forces the AI to retrieve documents from Nvidia\u2019s internal data to back up its suggestions.The addition of retrieval-augmented generation \u201cimproves the accuracy quite a bit,\u201d said Dally. \u201cMore importantly, it reduces hallucination.\u201dIn its second application, ChipNeMo helped engineers run tests on designs and parts of them. \u201cWe use many design tools,\u201d said Dally. \u201cThese tools are pretty complicated and typically involve many lines of scripting.\u201d ChipNeMo simplifies the designer\u2019s job by providing a \u201cvery natural human interface to what otherwise would be some very arcane commands.\u201dChipNeMo\u2019s final use case, analyzing and summarizing bug reports, \u201cis probably the one where we see the prospects for the most productivity gain earliest,\u201d said Dally. When a test fails, he explained, it gets logged into Nvidia\u2019s internal bug-report system, and each report can include pages and pages of detailed data. Then an \u201cARB\u201d (short for \u201caction required by\u201d) is sent to a designer for a fix, and the clock starts ticking.ChipNeMo summarizes the bug report\u2019s many pages into as little as a single paragraph, speeding decisions. It even can write that summary in two modes: one for the engineer and one for the manager.Makers of chip-design tools, such as Synopsys and Cadence, have been diving into integration of AI into their systems. But according to Dally, they won\u2019t be able to achieve the same thing Nvidia is after.\u201cThe thing that enables us to do this is 30 years of design documents and code in a database,\u201d he said. ChipNeMo is learning \u201cfrom the entire experience of Nvidia.\u201d EDA companies just don\u2019t have that kind of data.From Your Site ArticlesHow Generative AI Helped Me Imagine a Better Robot \u203aEngineering Bias Out of AI \u203aGoogle, Intel, Nvidia Battle in Generative AI Training - IEEE Spectrum \u203aHow Will AI Affect the Semiconductor Industry? - IEEE Spectrum \u203aPublic AI Training Datasets Are Rife With Licensing Errors - IEEE Spectrum \u203aAI-Powered Proof Generator Helps Debug Software - IEEE Spectrum \u203aChip Design: AI Alone Isn\u2019t Ready for Chip Design - IEEE Spectrum \u203aRelated Articles Around the WebAI Prompt Engineering Isn't the Future \u203aTraining for AI engineers | Microsoft Learn \u203aedachip designnvidiallmsdebuggingelectronic design automationSamuel K.

This month it expanded to all of CAL FIRE\u2019s 21 command centers.\nALERTCalifornia, powered by DigitalPath, can detect fires from cameras positioned across the golden state.\nDigitalPath began by building out a management platform for a network of cameras used to confirm California wildfires after a 911 call.\nThe company quickly realized there would be no way to have people examine images from the thousands of cameras relaying images to the system every ten to fifteen seconds.\nSo Ethan Higgins, the company\u2019s system architect, turned to AI.\n\nThe AI Podcast \u00b7 DigitalPath\u2019s Ethan Higgins On Using AI to Fight Wildfires \u2013 Ep. 211\nThe team began by training a convolutional neural network on a cloud-based system running an NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU and later transitioned to a system running on eight A100 GPUs.\nThe AI model is crucial to examining a system that sees almost 8 million images a day streaming in from over 1,000 first-party cameras, primarily in California, and thousands more from third-party sources nationwide, he said.\nImpact of Wildfires\nAll anomalies being tracked throughout California as of Sept. 20, 2023. Image Credit: DigitalPath\nIt\u2019s arriving just in time.\nWildfires have ravaged California over the past decade, burning millions of acres of land, destroying thousands of homes and businesses and claiming hundreds of lives.\nAccording to CAL FIRE, in 2020 alone, the state experienced five of its six largest and seven of its 20 most destructive wildfires.\nAnd the total dollar damage of wildfires in California from 2019 to 2021 was estimated at over $25 billion.\nThe new system promises to give first responders a crucial tool to prevent such conflagrations.\nIn fact, during a recent interview with DigitalPath, the system detected two separate fires in Northern California as they ignited.\nEvery day, the system detects between 50 and 300 events, offering invaluable real-time information to local first responders.\nBeyond Detection: Enhancing Capabilities\nExample of multiple cameras detecting a single anomaly. Image Credit: DigitalPath.\nBut AI is just part of the story.\nThe system is also a case study in how innovative companies can use AI to amplify their unique capabilities.\nOne of DigitalPath\u2019s breakthroughs is its system\u2019s ability to identify the same fire captured from diverse camera angles. DigitalPath\u2019s system efficiently filters imagery down to a human-digestible level. The system filters 8 million daily images down to just 100 alerts, or 1.25 thousandths of one percent of total images captured.\n\u201cThe system was designed from the start with human processing in mind,\u201d Higgins said, ensuring that authorities receive a single, consolidated notification for every incident.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to catch every fire we can,\u201d he adds.\nExpanding Horizons\nDigitalPath eventually hopes to expand its detection technology to help California detect more kinds of natural disasters.\nAnd having proven its worth in California, DigitalPath is now in talks with state and county officials and university research teams across the fire-prone Western United States under its ALERTWest subsidiary.\nTheir goal: to help partners replicate the success of UC San Diego and ALERTCalifornia, potentially shielding countless lives and homes from the wrath of wildfires.\nFeatured image credit: SLworking2, via Flickr, Creative Commons license, some rights reserved. \n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Climate | GPU | Smart Spaces | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

For inspiration, check out the hauntingly adorable work of artists like iryna.blender3d on Twitter.\n\nThe #SeasonalArtChallenge continues on with an incredible render from iryna.blender3d (IG). \ud83c\udf83\nShare your spooky/Halloween-themed art with #SeasonalArtChallenge for a chance to be featured on the Studio or @NVIDIAOmniverse channels! \ud83d\ude4c pic.twitter.com/lOxcYNhBJl\n\u2014 NVIDIA Studio (@NVIDIAStudio) October 9, 2023\n\nThe Super RTX VSR Update 1.5\nRTX VSR\u2019s AI model has been retrained to more accurately identify the difference between subtle details and compression artifacts to better preserve image details during the upscaling process. Finer details are more visible, and the overall image looks sharper and crisper than before.\nRTX VSR v1.5 improves detail and sharpness.\nRTX VSR version 1.5 will also de-artifact videos played at their native resolution \u2014 prior, only upscaled video could be enhanced. Providing a leap in graphical fidelity for laptop owners with 1080p screens, the updated RTX VSR makes 1080p resolution, which is popular for content and displays, look smoother at its native resolution, even with heavy artifacts.\nRTX VSR now de-artifacts video played at native resolution.\nAnd with expanded RTX VSR support, owners of GeForce RTX 20 Series GPUs can benefit from the same AI-enhanced video as those using RTX 30 and 40 Series GPUs.\nRTX VSR 1.5 is available as part of the latest Game Ready Driver, available for download today. Content creators downloading NVIDIA Studio Drivers \u2014 designed to enhance features, reduce repetitiveness and dramatically accelerate creative workflows \u2014 can install the driver with RTX VSR releasing in early November.\nRunebee-lievable Streaming\nRunebee has been livestreaming for over 10 years, providing a space for viewers to hang out and talk about games, movies or whatever else is going on in life. Over the years, she\u2019s realized how common a desire for escapism is.\n\u201cThings aren\u2019t always sunshine and rainbows, so it\u2019s nice to have some company that can help take your mind off things,\u201d said Runebee.\n\nRunebee has amassed over 100K followers on Twitch, YouTube and Instagram, crediting her success to thorough preparation of her setup. Her technology-forward approach ensures efficiency and reliability \u2014 allowing her focus to be on performance.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of planning involved in streaming, but at the end of the day, hitting the \u2018start streaming\u2019 button is the most important step, and NVIDIA GPU-acceleration is a massive factor in allowing it to go as smoothly as it does,\u201d said Runebee.\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d have this smooth of a stream just by upgrading to a GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU.\u201d \u2013 Runebee\n\nOBS is Runbee\u2019s preferred open-source software for video recording and livestreaming on Twitch. For maximum efficiency, Runebee deploys her GeForce RTX 4080 RTX GPU, taking advantage of the eighth-generation NVIDIA encoder, NVENC, to independently encode video, which frees up the graphics card to focus on livestreaming.\n\u201cStreaming games and running OBS used to kill my CPU, and NVENC has taken so much stress off,\u201d said Runebee. \u201cI was hardly even able to stream PC games until I switched to NVENC.\u201d\nFor livestreamers, RTX 40 Series GPUs can offer support for real-time AV1 hardware encoding, providing a 40% efficiency boost compared to H.264 and delivering higher quality than competing GPUs.\n\n\u201cAs I started building more PCs with NVIDIA GPUs, I never had a reason to switch!\u201d \u2013 Runebee\n\nRunebee can export recordings of her livestreams with Adobe Premiere Pro in half the normally required time thanks to GeForce RTX 40 Series dual encoders working together, dividing the work evenly to double output.\nThey\u2019re capable of recording up to 8K, 60 frames per second content in real time via GeForce Experience and OBS Studio.\n\nAlways looking to improve her livestreaming process, Runebee plans on experimenting with the NVIDIA Broadcast app, which transforms any room into a home studio by upgrading standard webcams, microphones and speakers into premium smart devices using the power of AI.\n\nRunebee encourages those interested in livestreaming to at least give their potential passion project a shot. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to meet tons of new friends, become more articulate at describing the things you love \u2014 be it games or movies \u2014 and cultivate a community to share your passions with,\u201d she said.\nTwitch livestreamer Runebee\u2019s setup.\nFollow Runebee on Twitch.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

Unlike current methods for customizing an LLM, it lets a single training run create one model that can serve dozens or even hundreds of use cases, saving time and money.\nNVIDIA researchers created SteerLM to teach AI models what users care about, like road signs to follow in their particular use cases or markets. These user-defined attributes can gauge nearly anything \u2014 for example, the degree of helpfulness or humor in the model\u2019s responses.\nOne Model, Many Uses\nThe result is a new level of flexibility.\nWith SteerLM, users define all the attributes they want and embed them in a single model. Then they can choose the combination they need for a given use case while the model is running.\nFor example, a custom model can now be tuned during inference to the unique needs of, say, an accounting, sales or engineering department or a vertical market.\nThe method also enables a continuous improvement cycle. Responses from a custom model can serve as data for a future training run that dials the model into new levels of usefulness.\nSaving Time and Money\nTo date, fitting a generative AI model to the needs of a specific application has been the equivalent of rebuilding an engine\u2019s transmission. Developers had to painstakingly label datasets, write lots of new code, adjust the hyperparameters under the hood of the neural network and retrain the model several times.\nSteerLM replaces those complex, time-consuming processes with three simple steps:\n\nUsing a basic set of prompts, responses and desired attributes, customize an AI model that predicts how those attributes will perform.\nAutomatically generating a dataset using this model.\nTraining the model with the dataset using standard supervised fine-tuning techniques.\n\nMany Enterprise Use Cases\nDevelopers can adapt SteerLM to nearly any enterprise use case that requires generating text.\nWith SteerLM, a company might produce a single chatbot it can tailor in real time to customers\u2019 changing attitudes, demographics or circumstances in the many vertical markets or geographies it serves.\nSteerLM also enables a single LLM to act as a flexible writing co-pilot for an entire corporation.\nFor example, lawyers can modify their model during inference to adopt a formal style for their legal communications. Or marketing staff can dial in a more conversational style for their audience.\nGame On With SteerLM\nTo show the potential of SteerLM, NVIDIA demonstrated it on one of its classic applications \u2014 gaming (see the video below).\nToday, some games pack dozens of non-playable characters \u2014 characters that the player can\u2019t control \u2014 which mechanically repeat prerecorded text, regardless of the user or situation.\nSteerLM makes these characters come alive, responding with more personality and emotion to players\u2019 prompts. It\u2019s a tool game developers can use to unlock unique new experiences for every player.\n\nThe Genesis of SteerLM\nThe concept behind the new method arrived unexpectedly.\n\u201cI woke up early one morning with this idea, so I jumped up and wrote it down,\u201d recalled Yi Dong, an applied research scientist at NVIDIA who initiated the work on SteerLM.\nWhile building a prototype, he realized a popular model-conditioning technique could also be part of the method. Once all the pieces came together and his experiment worked, the team helped articulate the method in four simple steps.\nIt\u2019s the latest advance in model customization, a hot area in AI research.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a challenging field, a kind of holy grail for making AI more closely reflect a human perspective \u2014 and I love a new challenge,\u201d said the researcher, who earned a Ph.D. in computational neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University, then worked on machine learning algorithms in finance before joining NVIDIA.\nGet Hands on the Wheel\nSteerLM is available as open-source software for developers to try out today. They can also get details on how to experiment with a Llama-2-13b model customized using the SteerLM method.\nFor users who want full enterprise security and support, SteerLM will be integrated into NVIDIA NeMo, a rich framework for building, customizing and deploying large generative AI models.\nThe SteerLM method works on all models supported on NeMo, including popular community-built pretrained LLMs such as Llama-2 and BLOOM.\nRead a technical blog to learn more about SteerLM.\nSee notice regarding software product information.\nExplore generative AI sessions and experiences at NVIDIA GTC, the global conference on AI and accelerated computing, running March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., and online.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Gaming | Inference | Machine Learning | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA Research | Open Source | Trustworthy AI \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

That reach now includes areas that touch edge, robotics and logistics systems: defect detection, real-time asset tracking, autonomous planning and navigation, human-robot interactions and more.\nNVIDIA today announced major expansions to two frameworks on the NVIDIA Jetson platform for edge AI and robotics: the NVIDIA Isaac ROS robotics framework has entered general availability, and the NVIDIA Metropolis expansion on Jetson is coming next.\nTo accelerate AI application development and deployments at the edge, NVIDIA has also created a Jetson Generative AI Lab for\u00a0developers to use with the latest open-source generative AI models.\nMore than 1.2 million developers and over 10,000 customers have chosen NVIDIA AI and the Jetson platform, including Amazon Web Services, Cisco, John Deere, Medtronic, Pepsico and Siemens.\nWith the rapidly evolving AI landscape addressing increasingly complicated scenarios, developers are being challenged by longer development cycles to build AI applications for the edge. Reprogramming robots and AI systems on the fly to meet changing environments, manufacturing lines and automation needs of customers is time-consuming and requires expert skills.\nGenerative AI offers zero-shot learning \u2014 the ability for a model to recognize things specifically unseen before in training \u2014 with a natural language interface to simplify the development, deployment and management of AI at the edge.\nTransforming the AI Landscape\nGenerative AI dramatically improves ease of use by understanding human language prompts to make model changes. Those AI models are more flexible in detecting, segmenting, tracking, searching and even reprogramming \u2014 and\u00a0 help outperform traditional convolutional neural network-based models.\nGenerative AI is expected to add $10.5 billion in revenue for manufacturing operations worldwide by 2033, according to ABI Research.\n\u201cGenerative AI will significantly accelerate deployments of AI at the edge with better generalization, ease of use and higher accuracy than previously possible,\u201d said Deepu Talla, vice president of embedded and edge computing at NVIDIA. \u201cThis largest-ever software expansion of our Metropolis and Isaac frameworks on Jetson, combined with the power of transformer models and generative AI, addresses this need.\u201d\n\nDeveloping With Generative AI at the Edge\nThe Jetson Generative AI Lab provides developers access to optimized tools and tutorials for deploying open-source LLMs, diffusion models to generate stunning interactive images, vision language models (VLMs) and vision transformers (ViTs) that combine vision AI and natural language processing to provide comprehensive understanding of the scene.\nDevelopers can also use the NVIDIA TAO Toolkit to create efficient and accurate AI models for edge applications. TAO provides a low-code interface to fine-tune and optimize vision AI models, including ViT and vision foundational models. They can also customize and fine-tune foundational models like NVIDIA NV-DINOv2 or public models like OpenCLIP to create highly accurate vision AI models with very little data. TAO additionally now includes VisualChangeNet, a new transformer-based model for defect inspection.\nHarnessing New Metropolis and Isaac Frameworks\nNVIDIA Metropolis makes it easier and more cost-effective for enterprises to embrace world-class, vision AI-enabled solutions to improve critical operational efficiency and safety problems. The platform brings a collection of powerful application programming interfaces and microservices for developers to quickly develop complex vision-based applications.\n\nMore than 1,000 companies, including BMW Group, Pepsico, Kroger, Tyson Foods, Infosys and Siemens, are using NVIDIA Metropolis developer tools to solve Internet of Things, sensor processing and operational challenges with vision AI \u2014 and the rate of adoption is quickening. The tools have now been downloaded over 1 million times by those looking to build vision AI applications.\nTo help developers quickly build and deploy scalable vision AI applications, an expanded set of Metropolis APIs and microservices on NVIDIA Jetson will be available by year\u2019s end.\n\nHundreds of customers use the NVIDIA Isaac platform to develop high-performance robotics solutions across diverse domains, including agriculture, warehouse automation, last-mile delivery and service robotics, among others.\nAt ROSCon 2023, NVIDIA announced major improvements to perception and simulation capabilities with new releases of Isaac ROS and Isaac Sim software. Built on the widely adopted open-source Robot Operating System (ROS), Isaac ROS brings perception to automation, giving eyes and ears to the things that move. By harnessing the power of GPU-accelerated GEMs, including visual odometry, depth perception, 3D scene reconstruction, localization and planning, robotics developers gain the tools needed to swiftly engineer robotic solutions tailored for a diverse range of applications.\n\nWith the general availability of the latest Isaac ROS 2.0 release, developers can now create and bring high-performance robotics solutions to market with Jetson.\n\u201cROS continues to grow and evolve to provide open-source software for the whole robotics community,\u201d said Geoff Biggs, CTO of the Open Source Robotics Foundation. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s new prebuilt ROS 2 packages, launched with this release, will accelerate that growth by making ROS 2 readily available to the vast NVIDIA Jetson developer community.\u201d\nDelivering New Reference AI Workflows\nDeveloping a production-ready AI solution entails optimizing the development and training of AI models tailored to specific use cases, implementing robust security features on the platform, orchestrating the application, managing fleets, establishing seamless edge-to-cloud communication and more.\nNVIDIA announced a curated collection of AI reference workflows based on Metropolis and Isaac frameworks that enable developers to quickly adopt the entire workflow or selectively integrate individual components, resulting in substantial reductions in both development time and cost. The three distinct AI workflows include: Network Video Recording, Automatic Optical Inspection and Autonomous Mobile Robot.\n\u201cNVIDIA Jetson, with its broad and diverse user base and partner ecosystem, has helped drive a revolution in robotics and AI at the edge,\u201d said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. \u201cAs application requirements become increasingly complex, we need a foundational shift to platforms that simplify and accelerate the creation of edge deployments. This significant software expansion by NVIDIA gives developers access to new multi-sensor models and generative AI capabilities.\u201d\nMore Coming on the Horizon\u00a0\nNVIDIA announced a collection of system services which are fundamental capabilities that every developer requires when building edge AI solutions. These services will simplify integration into workflows and spare developer the arduous task of building them from the ground up.\nThe new NVIDIA JetPack 6, expected to be available by year\u2019s end, will empower AI developers to stay at the cutting edge of computing without the need for a full Jetson Linux upgrade, substantially expediting development timelines and liberating them from Jetson Linux dependencies. JetPack 6 will also use the collaborative efforts with Linux distribution partners to expand the horizon of Linux-based distribution choices, including Canonical\u2019s Optimized and Certified Ubuntu, Wind River Linux, Concurrent Real-Time Redhawk Linux and various Yocto-based distributions.\nPartner Ecosystem Benefits From Platform Expansion\nThe Jetson partner ecosystem provides a wide range of support, from hardware, AI software and application design services to sensors, connectivity and developer tools. These NVIDIA Partner Network innovators play a vital role in providing the building blocks and sub-systems for many products sold on the market.\nThe latest release allows Jetson partners to accelerate their time to market and expand their customer base by adopting AI with increased performance and capabilities.\nIndependent software vendor partners will also be able to expand their offerings for Jetson.\n\nJoin us Tuesday, Nov. 7, at 9 a.m. PT for the Bringing Generative AI to Life with NVIDIA Jetson webinar, where technical experts will dive deeper into the news announced here, including accelerated APIs and quantization methods for deploying LLMs and VLMs on Jetson, optimizing vision transformers with TensorRT, and more.\nLearn more about Metropolis APIs and microservices on Jetson\nExplore generative AI sessions and experiences at NVIDIA GTC, the global conference on AI and accelerated computing, running March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., and online.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Generative AI | RoboticsTags: Metropolis | NVIDIA Isaac Sim | NVIDIA Jetson \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The project aims to help governments mitigate natural disaster damage by providing the information needed for decision-makers to bolster building structures or perform post-disaster recovery.\nAfter a natural disaster such as an earthquake, local governments send teams to check and evaluate building conditions. Manually done, it can take up to months to go through the full stock of a city.\nWang\u2019s project uses AI to accelerate the evaluation process \u2014 cutting the time needed to a few hours. The AI model is trained using images sourced from Google Street View and local governments to assign scores to buildings based on Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) P-154 standards, which provide assessment guidelines based on factors like wall material, structure type, building age and more. Wang also collaborated with the World Bank Global Program for Resilient Housing to collect images and perform annotations, which were used to improve the model.\nThe collected images are placed in a data repository. The AI model reads the repository and performs inference on the images \u2014 a process accelerated by NVIDIA DGX A100 systems.\n\u201cWithout NVIDIA GPUs, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to do this,\u201d Wang said. \u201cThey significantly accelerate the process, ensuring timely results.\u201d\nWang used the DGX A100 nodes in the University of Florida\u2019s supercomputer, HiPerGator. HiPerGator is one of the world\u2019s fastest AI supercomputers in academia, delivering 700 petaflops of AI performance, and was built with the support of NVIDIA founder and UF alumnus Chris Malachowsky and hardware, software, training and services from NVIDIA.\nThe AI model\u2019s output is compiled into a database that feeds into a web portal, which shows information \u2014 including the safety assessment score, building type and even roof or wall material \u2014 in a map-based format.\n\nWang\u2019s work was funded by the NVIDIA Applied Research Accelerator Program, which supports research projects that have the potential to make a real-world impact through the deployment of NVIDIA-accelerated applications adopted by commercial and government organizations.\nA Helping Eye\nWang says that the portal can serve different needs depending on the use case. To prepare for a natural disaster, a government can use predictions solely from street view images.\n\u201cThose are static images \u2014 one example is Google Street View images, which get updated every several years,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s good enough for collecting information and getting a general understanding about certain statistics.\u201d\nBut for rural areas or developing regions, where such images aren\u2019t available or not frequently updated, governments can collect the images themselves. Powered by NVIDIA GPUs, the timely delivery of building assessments can help accelerate analyses.\nWang also suggests that with enough refinement, his research could also create ripples for the urban planning and insurance industries.\nThe project is currently being tested by a few local governments in Mexico and is garnering interest in some African, Asian and South American countries. At its current state, it can achieve over 85% accuracy in its assessment scores, per \u200cFEMA P-154 standards.\nSurvey of the Land\nOne challenge Wang cites is the variation in urban landscapes in different countries. Different regions have their own cultural and architectural styles. Not trained on a large or diverse enough pool of images, the AI model could be thrown off by factors like paint color when performing wall material analysis. Another challenge is urban density variation.\n\u201cIt is a very general limitation of current AI technology,\u201d Wang said. \u201cIn order to be useful, it requires enough training data to represent the distribution of the real world, so we\u2019re putting efforts into the data collection process to solve the generalization issue.\u201d\nTo overcome this challenge, Wang aims to train and test the model for more cities. So far, he\u2019s tested about eight cities in different countries.\n\u201cWe need to generate more detailed and high-quality annotations to train the model with,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the way we can improve the model in the future so that it can be used more widely.\u201d\nWang\u2019s goal is to get the project to a point where it can be deployed as a service for more general industry use.\n\u201cWe are creating application programming interfaces that can estimate and analyze buildings and households to allow seamless integration with other products,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are also building a user-friendly application that all government agencies and organizations can use.\u201d\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | ResearchTags: Artificial Intelligence | Education | GPU | Inference | Public Sector | Social Impact | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Its mission: improving surgical outcomes and patient safety.\n\u201cThe Atlas provides a collection of multimedia tools for brain surgeons, allowing them to mentally rehearse an operation the night before a real surgery,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Cohen-Gadol, founder of Atlas Meditech and its nonprofit counterpart, Neurosurgical Atlas. \u201cWith accelerated computing and digital twins, we want to transform this mental rehearsal into a highly realistic rehearsal in simulation.\u201d\nNeurosurgical Atlas offers case studies, surgical videos and 3D models of the brain to more than a million online users. Dr. Cohen-Gadol, also a professor of neurological surgery at Indiana University School of Medicine, estimates that more than 90% of brain surgery training programs in the U.S. \u2014 as well as tens of thousands of neurosurgeons in other countries \u2014 use the Atlas as a key resource during residency and early in their surgery careers.\nAtlas Meditech\u2019s Pathfinder software is integrating AI algorithms that can suggest safe surgical pathways for experts to navigate through the brain to reach a lesion.\nAnd with NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for connecting and building custom 3D pipelines and metaverse applications, the team aims to create custom virtual representations of individual patients\u2019 brains for surgery rehearsal.\nCustom 3D Models of Human Brains\nA key benefit of Atlas Meditech\u2019s advanced simulations \u2014 either onscreen or in immersive virtual reality \u2014 is the ability to customize the simulations, so that surgeons can practice on a virtual brain that matches the patient\u2019s brain in size, shape and lesion position.\n\u201cEvery patient\u2019s anatomy is a little different,\u201d said Dr. Cohen-Gadol. \u201cWhat we can do now with physics and advanced graphics is create a patient-specific model of the brain and work with it to see and virtually operate on a tumor. The accuracy of the physical properties helps to recreate the experience we have in the real world during an operation.\u201d\nTo create digital twins of patients\u2019 brains, the Atlas Pathfinder tool has adopted MONAI Label, which can support radiologists by automatically annotating MRI and CT scans to segment normal structures and tumors.\n\u201cMONAI Label is the gateway to any healthcare project because it provides us with the opportunity to segment critical structures and protect them,\u201d said Dr. Cohen-Gadol. \u201cFor the Atlas, we\u2019re training MONAI Label to act as the eyes of the surgeon, highlighting what is a normal vessel and what\u2019s a tumor in an individual patient\u2019s scan.\u201d\n\nWith a segmented view of a patient\u2019s brain, Atlas Pathfinder can adjust its 3D brain model to morph to the patient\u2019s specific anatomy, capturing how the tumor deforms the normal structure of their brain tissue.\nBased on the visualization \u2014 which radiologists and surgeons can modify to improve the precision \u2014 Atlas Pathfinder suggests the safest surgical approaches to access and remove a tumor without harming other parts of the brain. Each approach links out to the Atlas website, which includes a written tutorial of the operative plan.\n\u201cAI-powered decision support can make a big difference in navigating a highly complex 3D structure where every millimeter is critical,\u201d Dr. Cohen-Gadol said.\nRealistic Rehearsal Environments for Practicing Surgeons\u00a0\nAtlas Meditech is using NVIDIA Omniverse to develop a virtual operating room that can immerse surgeons into a realistic environment to rehearse upcoming procedures. In the simulation, surgeons can modify how the patient and equipment are positioned.\nUsing a VR headset, surgeons will be able to work within this virtual environment, going step by step through the procedure and receiving feedback on how closely they are adhering to the target pathway to reach the tumor. AI algorithms can be used to predict how brain tissue would shift as a surgeon uses medical instruments during the operation, and apply that estimated shift to the simulated brain.\n\n\u201cThe power to enable surgeons to enter a virtual, 3D space, cut a piece of the skull and rehearse the operation with a simulated brain that has very similar physical properties to the patient would be tremendous,\u201d said Dr. Cohen-Gadol.\nTo better simulate the brain\u2019s physical properties, the team adopted NVIDIA PhysX, an advanced real-time physics simulation engine that\u2019s part of NVIDIA Omniverse. Using haptic devices, they were able to experiment with adding haptic feedback to the virtual environment, mimicking the feeling of working with brain tissue.\nEnvisioning AI, Robotics in the Future of Surgery Training\nDr. Cohen-Gadol believes that in the coming years AI models will be able to further enhance surgery by providing additional insights during a procedure. Examples include warning surgeons about critical brain structures that are adjacent to the area they\u2019re working in, tracking medical instruments during surgery, and providing a guide to next steps in the surgery.\nAtlas Meditech plans to explore the NVIDIA Holoscan platform for streaming AI applications to power these real-time, intraoperative insights. Applying AI analysis to a surgeon\u2019s actions during a procedure can provide the surgeon with useful feedback to improve their technique.\nIn addition to being used for surgeons to rehearse operations, Dr. Cohen-Gadol says that digital twins of the brain and of the operating room could help train intelligent medical instruments such as microscope robots using Isaac Sim, a robotics simulation application developed on Omniverse.\nView Dr. Cohen-Gadol\u2019s presentation at NVIDIA GTC.\nSubscribe to NVIDIA healthcare news.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Pro GraphicsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Digital Twin | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Open Source | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  With the help of AI, robots, tractors and baby strollers \u2014 even skate parks \u2014 are becoming autonomous. One developer, Kabilan KB, is bringing autonomous-navigation capabilities to wheelchairs, which could help improve mobility for people with disabilities.\n\nThe undergraduate from the Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences in Coimbatore, India, is powering his autonomous wheelchair project using the NVIDIA Jetson platform for edge AI and robotics.\nThe autonomous motorized wheelchair is connected to depth and lidar sensors \u2014 along with USB cameras \u2014 which allow it to perceive the environment and plan an obstacle-free path toward a user\u2019s desired destination.\n\u201cA person using the motorized wheelchair could provide the location they need to move to, which would already be programmed in the autonomous navigation system or path-planned with assigned numerical values,\u201d KB said. \u201cFor example, they could press \u2018one\u2019 for the kitchen or \u2018two\u2019 for the bedroom, and the autonomous wheelchair will take them there.\u201d\nAn NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit processes data from the cameras and sensors in real time. It then uses deep learning-based computer vision models to detect obstacles in the environment.\n\nThe developer kit acts as the brain of the autonomous system \u2014 generating a 2D map of its surroundings to plan a collision-free path to the destination \u2014 and sends updated signals to the motorized wheelchair to help ensure safe navigation along the way.\nAbout the Maker\nKB, who has a background in mechanical engineering, became fascinated with AI and robotics during the pandemic, when he spent his free time searching up educational YouTube videos on the topics.\nHe\u2019s now working toward a bachelor\u2019s degree in robotics and automation at the Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences and aspires to one day launch a robotics startup.\nKB, a self-described supporter of self-education, has also received several certifications from the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, including \u201cBuilding Video AI Applications at the Edge on Jetson Nano\u201d and \u201cDevelop, Customize and Publish in Omniverse With Extensions.\u201d\nOnce he learned the basics of robotics, he began experimenting with simulation in NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for building and operating 3D tools and applications based on the OpenUSD framework.\n\u201cUsing Omniverse for simulation, I don\u2019t need to invest heavily in prototyping models for my robots, because I can use synthetic data generation instead,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the software of the future.\u201d\nHis Inspiration\nWith this latest NVIDIA Jetson project, KB aimed to create a device that could be helpful for his cousin, who has a mobility disorder, and other people with disabilities who might not be able to control a manual or motorized wheelchair.\n\u201cSometimes, people don\u2019t have the money to buy an electric wheelchair,\u201d KB said. \u201cIn India, only upper- and middle-class people can afford them, so I decided to use the most basic type of motorized wheelchair available and connect it to the Jetson to make it autonomous.\u201d\nThe personal project was funded by the Program in Global Surgery and Social Change, which is jointly positioned under the Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School.\nHis Jetson Project\nAfter purchasing the basic motorized wheelchair, KB connected its motor hub with the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and lidar and depth cameras.\nHe trained the AI algorithms for the autonomous wheelchair using YOLO object detection on the Jetson Nano, as well as the Robot Operating System, or ROS, a popular software for building robotics applications.\nThe wheelchair can tap these algorithms to perceive and map its environment and plan a collision-free path.\n\u201cThe NVIDIA Jetson Nano\u2019s real-time processing speed prevents delays or lags for the user,\u201d said KB, who\u2019s been working on the project\u2019s prototype since June. The developer dives into the technical components of the autonomous wheelchair on his blog. A demo of the autonomous wheelchair has also been featured on the Karunya Innovation and Design Studio YouTube channel.\nLooking forward, he envisions his project could be expanded to allow users to control a wheelchair using brain signals from electroencephalograms, or EEGs, that are connected to machine learning algorithms.\n\u201cI want to make a product that would let a person with a full mobility disorder control their wheelchair by simply thinking, \u2018I want to go there,\u2019\u201d KB said.\nLearn more about the NVIDIA Jetson platform.\n\n\nCategories: Inner Geek | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | Education | Embedded Computing | Machine Learning | Omniverse | Social Impact | Synthetic Data Generation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  NVIDIA researchers are collaborating with academic centers worldwide to advance generative AI, robotics and the natural sciences \u2014 and more than a dozen of these projects will be shared at NeurIPS, one of the world\u2019s top AI conferences.\nSet for Dec. 10-16 in New Orleans, NeurIPS brings together experts in generative AI, machine learning, computer vision and more. Among the innovations NVIDIA Research will present are new techniques for transforming text to images, photos to 3D avatars, and specialized robots into multi-talented machines.\n\u201cNVIDIA Research continues to drive progress across the field \u2014 including generative AI models that transform text to images or speech, autonomous AI agents that learn new tasks faster, and neural networks that calculate complex physics,\u201d said Jan Kautz, vice president of learning and perception research at NVIDIA. \u201cThese projects, often done in collaboration with leading minds in academia, will help accelerate developers of virtual worlds, simulations and autonomous machines.\u201d\nPicture This: Improving Text-to-Image Diffusion Models\nDiffusion models have become the most popular type of generative AI models to turn text into realistic imagery. NVIDIA researchers have collaborated with universities on multiple projects advancing diffusion models that will be presented at NeurIPS.\n\nA paper accepted as an oral presentation focuses on improving generative AI models\u2019 ability to understand the link between modifier words and main entities in text prompts. While existing text-to-image models asked to depict a yellow tomato and a red lemon may incorrectly generate images of yellow lemons and red tomatoes, the new model analyzes the syntax of a user\u2019s prompt, encouraging a bond between an entity and its modifiers to deliver a more faithful visual depiction of the prompt.\nSceneScape, a new framework using diffusion models to create long videos of 3D scenes from text prompts, will be presented as a poster. The project combines a text-to-image model with a depth prediction model that helps the videos maintain plausible-looking scenes with consistency between the frames \u2014 generating videos of art museums, haunted houses and ice castles (pictured above).\nAnother poster describes work that improves how text-to-image models generate concepts rarely seen in training data. Attempts to generate such images usually result in low-quality visuals that aren\u2019t an exact match to the user\u2019s prompt. The new method uses a small set of example images that help the model identify good seeds \u2014 random number sequences that guide the AI to generate images from the specified rare classes.\nA third poster shows how a text-to-image diffusion model can use the text description of an incomplete point cloud to generate missing parts and create a complete 3D model of the object. This could help complete point cloud data collected by lidar scanners and other depth sensors for robotics and autonomous vehicle AI applications. Collected imagery is often incomplete because objects are scanned from a specific angle \u2014 for example, a lidar sensor mounted to a vehicle would only scan one side of each building as the car drives down a street.\n\n\nCharacter Development: Advancements in AI Avatars\nAI avatars combine multiple generative AI models to create and animate virtual characters, produce text and convert it to speech. Two NVIDIA posters at NeurIPS present new ways to make these tasks more efficient.\n\nA poster describes a new method to turn a single portrait image into a 3D head avatar while capturing details including hairstyles and accessories. Unlike current methods that require multiple images and a time-consuming optimization process, this model achieves high-fidelity 3D reconstruction without additional optimization during inference. The avatars can be animated either with blendshapes, which are 3D mesh representations used to represent different facial expressions, or with a reference video clip where a person\u2019s facial expressions and motion are applied to the avatar.\nAnother poster by NVIDIA researchers and university collaborators advances zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis with P-Flow, a generative AI model that can rapidly synthesize high-quality personalized speech given a three-second reference prompt. P-Flow features better pronunciation, human likeness and speaker similarity compared to recent state-of-the-art counterparts. The model can near-instantly convert text to speech on a single NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU.\n\nResearch Breakthroughs in Reinforcement Learning, Robotics\nIn the fields of reinforcement learning and robotics, NVIDIA researchers will present two posters highlighting innovations that improve the generalizability of AI across different tasks and environments.\n\nThe first proposes a framework for developing reinforcement learning algorithms that can adapt to new tasks while avoiding the common pitfalls of gradient bias and data inefficiency. The researchers showed that their method \u2014 which features a novel meta-algorithm that can create a robust version of any meta-reinforcement learning model \u2014 performed well on multiple benchmark tasks.\nAnother by an NVIDIA researcher and university collaborators tackles the challenge of object manipulation in robotics. Prior AI models that help robotic hands pick up and interact with objects can handle specific shapes but struggle with objects unseen in the training data. The researchers introduce a new framework that estimates how objects across different categories are geometrically alike \u2014 such as drawers and pot lids that have similar handles \u2014 enabling the model to more quickly generalize to new shapes.\n\nSupercharging Science: AI-Accelerated Physics, Climate, Healthcare\nNVIDIA researchers at NeurIPS will also present papers across the natural sciences \u2014 covering physics simulations, climate models and AI for healthcare.\n\nTo accelerate computational fluid dynamics for large-scale 3D simulations, a team of NVIDIA researchers proposed a neural operator architecture that combines accuracy and computational efficiency to estimate the pressure field around vehicles \u2014 the first deep learning-based computational fluid dynamics method on an industry-standard, large-scale automotive benchmark. The method achieved 100,000x acceleration on a single NVIDIA Tensor Core GPU compared to another GPU-based solver, while reducing the error rate. Researchers can incorporate the model into their own applications using the open-source neuraloperator library.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nA consortium of climate scientists and machine learning researchers from universities, national labs, research institutes, Allen AI and NVIDIA collaborated on ClimSim, a massive dataset for physics and machine learning-based climate research that will be shared in an oral presentation at NeurIPS. The dataset covers the globe over multiple years at high resolution \u2014 and machine learning emulators built using that data can be plugged into existing operational climate simulators to improve their fidelity, accuracy and precision. This can help scientists produce better predictions of storms and other extreme events.\nNVIDIA Research interns are presenting a poster introducing an AI algorithm that provides personalized predictions of the effects of medicine dosage on patients. Using real-world data, the researchers tested the model\u2019s predictions of blood coagulation for patients given different dosages of a treatment. They also analyzed the new algorithm\u2019s predictions of the antibiotic vancomycin levels in patients who received the medication \u2014 and found that prediction accuracy significantly improved compared to prior methods.\n\nNVIDIA Research comprises hundreds of scientists and engineers worldwide, with teams focused on topics including AI, computer graphics, computer vision, self-driving cars and robotics.\nExplore generative AI sessions and experiences at NVIDIA GTC, the global conference on AI and accelerated computing, running March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., and online.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AI | Research | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Healthcare and Life Sciences | NVIDIA Research | Science | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And there\u2019s support for six new G-SYNC Compatible gaming displays.\nTo download and install, head to the Drivers tab of GeForce Experience or GeForce.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III campaign early access begins November 2nd* for all pre-purchases, with the full release following on November 10th.\nIn the cinematic campaign, Captain Price and Task Force 141 face off against the ultimate threat, the ultranationalist war criminal Vladimir Makarov, who\u2019s extending his grasp across the world, causing Task Force 141 to fight like never before. Once you\u2019ve dug into the action-packed single-player campaign, head online to defeat Zombies in an exciting open-world co-op experience that takes the Zombies mode everyone knows and loves to the next level. If you prefer Multiplayer, dip into the selection of Core Multiplayer maps from the 16 iconic launch maps of 2009\u2019s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 that are being brought over and modernized for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.\nIn each mode, GeForce gamers can accelerate frame rates with AI-powered DLSS, or maximize image quality with DLAA. And gameplay gets even more responsive thanks to the day-one inclusion of NVIDIA Reflex in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III\u2019s built-in benchmark, cranking all settings to max at 4K sees performance increase by 1.8X on average when activating DLSS 3, enabling max setting gameplay at over 100 FPS on the GeForce RTX 4070, and at up to 200 FPS on the GeForce RTX 4090:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEvery frame of action counts in Call of Duty. Once again, NVIDIA introduces major innovations with DLSS 3 Frame Generation. Along with DLSS Super Resolution and Reflex, it allows us to bring faster and smoother gameplay to the PC version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.\u201d - Marc-Alexandre Milot, Design Director, Beenox\nAt 1440p, DLSS 3 boosts performance by 1.6X, enabling 100 FPS+ gameplay on the entire lineup of GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards, and up to 240 FPS gameplay on the GeForce RTX 4090:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 1080p, DLSS 3\u2019s 1.5X performance boost enables you to hit esports frame rates on all GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, and allows you to max out the highest refresh rate displays on the GeForce RTX 4090, which achieves a 300 FPS result:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn GeForce RTX 40 Series laptops, DLSS 3 increases performance by 1.6X at both 1080p and 1440p, enabling all owners to game at fast frame rates, and at up to 230 FPS on GeForce RTX 4090 laptops:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith such fast frame rates on so many GPUs, you may want to supercharge image quality with NVIDIA DLAA, an AI-based anti-aliasing mode that utilizes the same technology developed for DLSS. DLAA uses a native resolution image to maximize image quality, rather than boosting performance, and in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III DLAA can be combined with DLSS Frame Generation for the highest possible image quality, and excellent performance.\nAlso, be sure to activate NVIDIA Reflex, which has helped GeForce gamers reduce system latency in Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Call of Duty: Vanguard, Modern Warfare, Modern Warfare II, and Call of Duty: Warzone\u2122. In Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Reflex reduces system latency by up to 28%.\nTogether with the high frame rates delivered by DLSS and low latency delivered by Reflex, competitive players receive the definitive experience on GeForce RTX 40 Series PCs and laptops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Jusant\nEnjoy meditative vibes in DON\u2019T NOD\u2019s Jusant, an action-puzzle climbing game launching later today.

And at 1080p, performance tops 300 FPS thanks to a 1.9X average DLSS boost:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For RoboCop: Rogue City\nThe city of Detroit has been hit by a series of crimes, and a new enemy is threatening the public order. Embody RoboCop in an all-new investigation that leads you right into the heart of a shadowy project that takes place between the RoboCop 2 and 3 movies.

This follows the announcement of TensorRT-LLM for data centers last month.\nNVIDIA has also released tools to help developers accelerate their LLMs, including scripts that optimize custom models with TensorRT-LLM, TensorRT-optimized open-source models and a developer reference project that showcases both the speed and quality of LLM responses.\nTensorRT acceleration is now available for Stable Diffusion in the popular Web UI by Automatic1111 distribution. It speeds up the generative AI diffusion model by up to 2x over the previous fastest implementation.\nPlus, RTX Video Super Resolution (VSR) version 1.5 is available as part of today\u2019s Game Ready Driver release \u2014 and will be available in the next NVIDIA Studio Driver, releasing early next month.\nSupercharging LLMs With TensorRT\nLLMs are fueling productivity \u2014 engaging in chat, summarizing documents and web content, drafting emails and blogs \u2014 and are at the core of new pipelines of AI and other software that can automatically analyze data and generate a vast array of content.\nTensorRT-LLM, a library for accelerating LLM inference, gives developers and end users the benefit of LLMs that can now operate up to 4x faster on RTX-powered Windows PCs.\nAt higher batch sizes, this acceleration significantly improves the experience for more sophisticated LLM use \u2014 like writing and coding assistants that output multiple, unique auto-complete results at once. The result is accelerated performance and improved quality that lets users select the best of the bunch.\nTensorRT-LLM acceleration is also beneficial when integrating LLM capabilities with other technology, such as in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where an LLM is paired with a vector library or vector database. RAG enables the LLM to deliver responses based on a specific dataset, like user emails or articles on a website, to provide more targeted answers.\nTo show this in practical terms, when the question \u201cHow does NVIDIA ACE generate emotional responses?\u201d was asked of the LLaMa 2 base model, it returned an unhelpful response.\nBetter responses, faster.\nConversely, using RAG with recent GeForce news articles loaded into a vector library and connected to the same Llama 2 model not only returned the correct answer \u2014 using NeMo SteerLM \u2014 but did so much quicker with TensorRT-LLM acceleration. This combination of speed and proficiency gives users smarter solutions.\nTensorRT-LLM will soon be available to download from the NVIDIA Developer website. TensorRT-optimized open source models and the RAG demo with GeForce news as a sample project are available at ngc.nvidia.com and GitHub.com/NVIDIA.\nAutomatic Acceleration\nDiffusion models, like Stable Diffusion, are used to imagine and create stunning, novel works of art. Image generation is an iterative process that can take hundreds of cycles to achieve the perfect output. When done on an underpowered computer, this iteration can add up to hours of wait time.\nTensorRT is designed to accelerate AI models through layer fusion, precision calibration, kernel auto-tuning and other capabilities that significantly boost inference efficiency and speed. This makes it indispensable for real-time applications and resource-intensive tasks.\nAnd now, TensorRT doubles the speed of Stable Diffusion.\nCompatible with the most popular distribution, WebUI from Automatic1111, Stable Diffusion with TensorRT acceleration helps users iterate faster and spend less time waiting on the computer, delivering a final image sooner. On a GeForce RTX 4090, it runs 7x faster than the top implementation on Macs with an Apple M2 Ultra. The extension is available for download today.\nThe TensorRT demo of a Stable Diffusion pipeline provides developers with a reference implementation on how to prepare diffusion models and accelerate them using TensorRT. This is the starting point for developers interested in turbocharging a diffusion pipeline and bringing lightning-fast inferencing to applications.\nVideo That\u2019s Super\nAI is improving everyday PC experiences for all users. Streaming video \u2014 from nearly any source, like YouTube, Twitch, Prime Video, Disney+ and countless others \u2014 is among the most popular activities on a PC. Thanks to AI and RTX, it\u2019s getting another update in image quality.\nRTX VSR is a breakthrough in AI pixel processing that improves the quality of streamed video content by reducing or eliminating artifacts caused by video compression. It also sharpens edges and details.\n\nAvailable now, RTX VSR version 1.5 further improves visual quality with updated models, de-artifacts content played in its native resolution and adds support for RTX GPUs based on the NVIDIA Turing architecture \u2014 both professional RTX and GeForce RTX 20 Series GPUs.\nRetraining the VSR AI model helped it learn to accurately identify the difference between subtle details and compression artifacts. As a result, AI-enhanced images more accurately preserve details during the upscaling process. Finer details are more visible, and the overall image looks sharper and crisper.\nRTX Video Super Resolution v1.5 improves detail and sharpness.\nNew with version 1.5 is the ability to de-artifact video played at the display\u2019s native resolution. The original release only enhanced video when it was being upscaled. Now, for example, 1080p video streamed to a 1080p resolution display will look smoother as heavy artifacts are reduced.\nRTX VSR now de-artifacts video played at its native resolution.\nRTX VSR 1.5 is available today for all RTX users in the latest Game Ready Driver. It will be available in the upcoming NVIDIA Studio Driver, scheduled for early next month.\nRTX VSR is among the NVIDIA software, tools, libraries and SDKs \u2014 like those mentioned above, plus DLSS, Omniverse, AI Workbench and others \u2014 that have helped bring over 400 AI-enabled apps and games to consumers.\nThe AI era is upon us. And RTX is supercharging at every step in its evolution.\nExplore generative AI sessions and experiences at NVIDIA GTC, the global conference on AI and accelerated computing, running March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., and online.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | GeForce | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA RTX | TensorRT \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers will receive the definitive day-one experience: frame rates are multiplied by an average of 4.5X at 4K, ray tracing is even more immersive thanks to Ray Reconstruction, and Reflex makes gameplay even more responsive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe new Ray Reconstruction feature in DLSS 3.5 renders our fully ray-traced world more beautifully than ever before, bringing you deeper into the story of Alan Wake 2\u201d - Tatu Aalto, Lead Graphics Programmer Remedy Entertainment\nFull ray tracing, also known as path tracing, accurately simulates light throughout an entire scene. It is used by visual effects artists to create film and TV graphics that are indistinguishable from reality, but until the arrival of GeForce RTX GPUs with RT Cores, and the AI-powered acceleration of NVIDIA DLSS, full ray tracing in real-time video games was impossible. Throughout Alan Wake 2 you\u2019ll witness spectacular scenes and jaw-dropping set pieces that leverage the power of GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs and NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 to deliver the definitive experience.\nAlan Wake 2 includes the complete suite of DLSS technologies, maximizing frame rates and image quality using the power of AI. DLSS Super Resolution enables all GeForce RTX gamers to significantly accelerate frame rates. DLSS Frame Generation multiplies performance on GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards, desktops and laptops by up to 4.5X. Reflex reduces system latency, making gameplay even more responsive. And our newest groundbreaking feature, DLSS Ray Reconstruction, replaces several hand-tuned ray tracing denoisers with a new unified AI model, elevating the image quality of ray-traced effects and full ray tracing to new heights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivating ray tracing and DLSS in Alan Wake 2 on a GeForce RTX GPU automatically enables Ray Reconstruction, replacing two denoisers with a unified AI model that enhances the quality of ray tracing, making gameplay more immersive, and graphics more realistic. In addition, Ray Reconstruction runs up to 14% faster in our benchmarks, further accelerating performance for GeForce RTX gamers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBryan Catanzaro, NVIDIA Vice President of Applied Deep Learning Research gives you the rundown on Ray Reconstruction in his DLSS Tech Talk\nRay Reconstruction enhances every second of gameplay, while also increasing your performance. This free upgrade is the latest in a long list of AI enhancements that make GeForce RTX GPUs the only option for gamers wanting the very best experiences at the highest resolutions, with cutting-edge features like full ray tracing.\nBattling the supernatural at the absolute highest settings will demand the very best hardware, and DLSS\u2019 AI acceleration.\nTo enable DLSS, head to Options > Graphics, scroll to Resolution Upscaling, select DLSS, and then pick the performance mode you want to use under \u201cRender Resolution\u201d. We recommend Quality for 1080p, Balanced or Quality for 1440p, and Performance for 4K.\nAt 4K, with every setting maxed and full ray tracing enabled, activating Frame Generation, Ray Reconstruction and Super Resolution sees frame rates multiply astronomically. On the GeForce RTX 4090, performance multiplies by 4.1X, enabling owners to play Alan Wake 2 at its very best at over 120 FPS at 4K. And the GeForce RTX 4080 and GeForce RTX 4070 Ti see their performance multiplied by 4.7X, for max setting 4K gameplay at 100 FPS and 80 FPS, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll performance captured on pre-release build\nAt 1440p, GeForce RTX 40 Series frame rates multiply by an average of 3X with full ray tracing and every other setting maxed out, enabling 80 FPS+ gameplay on the GeForce RTX 4070 and above:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 1080p, the most popular gaming resolution, performance multiplies by 2.7X on average, enabling owners of faster cards to play at up to 190 FPS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to upgrade to the GeForce RTX 40 Series to experience Alan Wake 2 with maxed out fully ray-traced effects, check out our Alan Wake 2 GeForce RTX 40 Series bundle, available until November 13th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuyers of eligible GeForce RTX 4070, 4070 Ti, 4080 and 4090 graphics cards and desktop PCs, or a laptop with a GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU, RTX 4080 Laptop GPU, or RTX 4070 Laptop GPU from select retailers and etailers will receive a digital copy of the game*, to play when released on October 27th.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nWhen the U.S. restricts exports of certain goods somewhere, it typically gives American companies a few weeks to ship already ordered and sometimes paid for goods to their partners. But instead of giving Nvidia and other companies some extra time to ship their AI and HPC GPUs to China, the U.S. Department of Commerce decided to speed up the implementation of its\u00a0latest export curbs. As a result, Nvidia can no longer ship A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S GPUs to China, effective immediately.\n\n\"On October 23, 2023, the United States Government informed Nvidia [\u2026] that the licensing requirements of the interim final rule [concerning AI and HPC processors] dated October 18, 2023, applicable to products having a 'total processing performance' of 4800 or more and designed or marketed for datacenters, is effective immediately, impacting shipments of the Company's A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products,\" an Nvidia's\u00a0filing\u00a0with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reads.\n\nOn November 16, the U.S. government revealed its plans to require Nvidia and other companies to get an export license from the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security to supply their powerful processors with certain levels of 'processing density' to China, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam. These licensing requirements were originally to be effective after a 30-day period, so starting November 16. Instead, the U.S. government decided to speed up their implementation.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia needs to get a license to ship its ship its A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S cards and modules for AI and HPC computing to China and a number of other countries immediately, which essentially means that they can no longer ship these products to their partners. Yet, it is unclear whether this also applies to shipping the GeForce RTX 4090 and L40 processors to the aforementioned countries. If yes, the\u00a0best graphics cards\u00a0for gaming could end up in short supply and get considerably more expensive in China, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam.\n\nMeanwhile, given demand for Nvidia's high-end products, including A100, H800, L40, and L40S AI and HPC GPUs, the company does not expect any immediate impact on its financial results.\n\n\"Given the strength of demand for the Company's products worldwide, the Company does not anticipate that the accelerated timing of the licensing requirements will have a near-term meaningful impact on its financial results,\" Nvidia said. They'll just sell AI GPUs previously destined for China to someone else, in other words.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (1)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

As the company evolves into artificial intelligence computing, it is now looking to take on fellow tech companies with new Arm-based processors. Interested consumers may have to wait a while for the official release of the Arm-based products to come into play as Nvidia \"quietly\" works on the new designs.\nAs Nvidia continues to dominate parts of the tech industry, its products are widely seen and bought by many consumers. It keeps a steady line with the ever-growing advancements in modern tech, notably when it involves artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and semiconductors. Especially in the gaming industry, Nvidia is synonymous with PC players who are looking for the best of the best. But as technology continues to quickly progress, it's vital that companies are up to speed, with the Arm-based architecture particularly coming to mind with its recent developments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\t\t\tNvidia Leak Suggests Super Refresh Coming Soon for GeForce RTX Graphics Cards\n\t\t\n\nA new Nvidia leak is hinting at a refresh for three of the tech company's most popular and highest-powered graphics cards currently on the market.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a report from Reuters, Nvidia is working to bring new CPUs to the PC crowd that can run Microsoft's Windows operating system. The new CPUs will utilize technology from Arm Holdings, which aims to bring the powerful benefits of reduced instruction set computer architecture. In an effort to achieve superior performance and presentation, Nvidia and Microsoft plan on launching the new tech sometime in 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to Nvidia making CPUs with enhanced Arm technology, AMD is also planning on releasing its own line of chips to coincide with Nvidia's aim for a 2025 launch window. In fact, AMD recently launched a powerful mobile GPU to compete against Nvidia in the graphics card market. Both companies will then be joining Qualcomm since its exclusivity deal with Microsoft will expire next year in 2024. The deal concerned an exclusive agreement with Microsoft to design Arm-based chips. With the expiration approaching, competitors can then work with the Qualcomm corporation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tASUS ROG Strix NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti GPU\n\t\t\t\n\n\nThe Asus ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4070 Ti is powered by Nvidia's Ada Lovelace architecture. It also utilizes DLSS 3 technology for enhanced performance. The card comes with full ray tracing capabilities for realistic visuals. It also features 4th generation Tensor cores. These cores deliver up to four times the performance compared to brute-force rendering of the previous generation. Axial-tech fans are used in the design to facilitate better airflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee at Amazon\n\n\nThe rise of the Arm-based wave of products has gone into the competitive space ever since Apple introduced its silicon chips in 2020. Initially an effort to move away from Intel products, Apple designed its own, which now powers its hardware and software products. Given how efficient and powerful Apple silicon chips are in the industry, Microsoft aims to achieve similar success.\nThere's no question that other technological advances will come into question (artificial intelligence, virtual reality functionality, cloud gaming stability, etc.), so it's easy to see the influence that Arm-based products can provide. PC players are always demanding the best products that they can use for their builds, and it's essential that tech giants stay on top of the status quo.\nMORE: The Best NVIDIA GPUs To Buy in 2023\nSource: Reuters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Games\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nPC Gaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat Is the Best Order to Play the Final Fantasy Series?\n\t\t\n\n\nFinal Fantasy\n\nTo experience Square Enix's legendary mainline Final Fantasy series in optimal order, it's best to move from classic storytelling to modern action.\n\n\nPosts\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nJosh Cotts\n\n\n21 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0:30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDice Dreams: Free Rolls For March 2025\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nUsama Ali\n\n\n1 day ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPC Gamers Can Claim 2 Free Games, But They Have to Act Fast\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nDalton Cooper\n\n\n1 day ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDays Gone Broken Road DLC Can Now Be Wishlisted on Steam\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nJo Craig\n\n\n1 day ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMarch 25 is Going to Be a Sad Day for Nintendo Fans\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nDalton Cooper\n\n\n3 days ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tA New Genshin Impact Character's VA is Already Being Replaced\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nMichael Brandon Ingram\n\n\n3 days ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tReignbreaker: All Status Effects, Explained (Bleed, Stun, Root, and Coat)\n\t\t\n\n\nReignbreaker\n\nStatus effects in Reignbreaker will give you an edge against your enemies if you learn to use them.

Under a microscope, a state-of-the-art chip like an NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU (above) looks like a well-planned metropolis, built with tens of billions of transistors, connected on streets 10,000x thinner than a human hair.\nMultiple engineering teams coordinate for as long as two years to construct one of these digital megacities.\nSome groups define the chip\u2019s overall architecture, some craft and place a variety of ultra-small circuits, and others test their work. Each job requires specialized methods, software programs and computer languages.\nA Broad Vision for LLMs\n\u201cI believe over time large language models will help all the processes, across the board,\u201d said Mark Ren, an NVIDIA Research director and lead author on the paper.\nBill Dally, NVIDIA\u2019s chief scientist, announced the paper today in a keynote at the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design, an annual gathering of hundreds of engineers working in the field called electronic design automation, or EDA.\n\u201cThis effort marks an important first step in applying LLMs to the complex work of designing semiconductors,\u201d said Dally at the event in San Francisco. \u201cIt shows how even highly specialized fields can use their internal data to train useful generative AI models.\u201d\nChipNeMo Surfaces\nThe paper details how NVIDIA engineers created for their internal use a custom LLM, called ChipNeMo, trained on the company\u2019s internal data to generate and optimize software and assist human designers.\nLong term, engineers hope to apply generative AI to each stage of chip design, potentially reaping significant gains in overall productivity, said Ren, whose career spans more than 20 years in EDA.\nAfter surveying NVIDIA engineers for possible use cases, the research team chose three to start: a chatbot, a code generator and an analysis tool.\nInitial Use Cases\nThe latter \u2014 a tool that automates the time-consuming tasks of maintaining updated descriptions of known bugs \u2014 has been the most well-received so far.\nA prototype chatbot that responds to questions about GPU architecture and design helped many engineers quickly find technical documents in early tests.\nA code generator will help designers write software for a chip design.\nA code generator in development (demonstrated above)\u00a0 already creates snippets of about 10-20 lines of software in two specialized languages chip designers use. It will be integrated with existing tools, so engineers have a handy assistant for designs in progress.\nCustomizing AI Models With NVIDIA NeMo\nThe paper mainly focuses on the team\u2019s work gathering its design data and using it to create a specialized generative AI model, a process portable to any industry.\nAs its starting point, the team chose a foundation model and customized it with NVIDIA NeMo, a framework for building, customizing and deploying generative AI models that\u2019s included in the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform. The selected NeMo model sports 43 billion parameters, a measure of its capability to understand patterns. It was trained using more than a trillion tokens, the words and symbols in text and software.\nChipNeMo provides an example of how one deeply technical team refined a pretrained model with its own data.\nThe team then refined the model in two training rounds, the first using about 24 billion tokens worth of its internal design data and the second on a mix of about 130,000 conversation and design examples.\nThe work is among several examples of research and proofs of concept of generative AI in the semiconductor industry, just beginning to emerge from the lab.\nSharing Lessons Learned\nOne of the most important lessons Ren\u2019s team learned is the value of customizing an LLM.\nOn chip-design tasks, custom ChipNeMo models with as few as 13 billion parameters match or exceed performance of even much larger general-purpose LLMs like LLaMA2 with 70 billion parameters. In some use cases, ChipNeMo models were dramatically better.\nAlong the way, users need to exercise care in what data they collect and how they clean it for use in training, he added.\nFinally, Ren advises users to stay abreast of the latest tools that can speed and simplify the work.\nNVIDIA Research has hundreds of scientists and engineers worldwide focused on topics such as AI, computer graphics, computer vision, self-driving cars and robotics. Other recent projects in semiconductors include using AI to design smaller, faster circuits and to optimize placement of large blocks.\nEnterprises looking to build their own custom LLMs can get started today using NeMo framework available from GitHub and NVIDIA NGC catalog.\nExplore generative AI sessions and experiences at NVIDIA GTC, the global conference on AI and accelerated computing, running March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., and online.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AI | ResearchTags: Artificial Intelligence | Events | Hardware | Inference | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA Foundation | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA Research \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Training a large language model with a trillion parameters, for example, takes thousands of GPUs running for weeks, though research is underway to reduce model size and enable model training on smaller systems while still maintaining high levels of AI model accuracy.\nThe new NVIDIA RTX GPU and AMD CPU-powered AI workstations provide the power and performance required for training such smaller models, as well as local fine-tuning, and helping to offload data center and cloud resources for AI development tasks. The devices let users select single- or multi-GPU configurations as required for their workloads.\nSmaller trained AI models also provide the opportunity to use workstations for local inferencing. RTX GPU and AMD CPU-powered workstations can be configured to run these smaller AI models for inference serving for small workgroups or departments.\nWith up to 48GB of memory in a single NVIDIA RTX GPU, these workstations offer a cost-effective way to reduce compute load on data centers. And when professionals do need to scale training and deployment from these workstations to data centers or the cloud, the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform enables seamless portability of workflows and toolchains.\nRTX GPU and AMD CPU-powered workstations also enable cutting-edge visual workflows. With accelerated computing power, the new workstations enable highly interactive content creation, industrial digitalization, and advanced simulation and design.\nUnmatched Power, Performance and Flexibility\nAMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 7000 WX-Series processors provide the CPU platform for the next generation of demanding workloads. The processors deliver a significant increase in core count \u2014 up to 96 cores per CPU \u2014 and industry-leading maximum memory bandwidth in a single socket.\nCombining them with the latest NVIDIA RTX Ada Generation GPUs brings unmatched power and performance in a workstation. The GPUs enable up to 2x the performance in ray tracing, AI processing, graphics rendering and computational tasks compared to the previous generation.\nAda Generation GPUs options include the RTX 4000 SFF, RTX 4000, RTX 4500, RTX 5000 and RTX 6000. They\u2019re built on the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture and feature up to 142 third-generation RT Cores, 568 fourth-generation Tensor Cores and 18,176 latest-generation CUDA cores.\nFrom architecture and manufacturing to media and entertainment and healthcare, professionals across industries will be able to use the new workstations to tackle challenging AI computing workloads \u2014 along with 3D rendering, product visualization, simulation and scientific computing tasks.\nAvailability\nNew workstations powered by NVIDIA RTX Ada Generation GPUs and the latest AMD Threadripper Pro processors will be available starting next month from BOXX and HP, with other system integrators offering them soon.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA RTX | Rendering | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Cisco announced the launch of Room Kit EQX and the expansion of its Cinematic Meetings capabilities \u2014 both powered by NVIDIA\u2019s AI engine \u2014\u00a0with the goal of enhancing collaboration experiences with audio and video intelligence and enabling more equitable hybrid meetings.\u00a0\n\"In order for people to want to come to the office, companies must fundamentally reimagine and reconfigure workspaces to provide seamless and immersive collaboration experience,\u201d said Jeetu Patel, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Cisco Security and Collaboration. \"Our collaboration with NVIDIA helps make this possible as we expand our portfolio of AI-powered solutions that unlock the potential of hybrid workers.\u201d\u00a0\nThe integration of video devices supporting AI and machine learning is critical to ensuring the longevity of investments made to deliver hybrid work experiences. The tight integration of Cisco\u2019s world-class hardware, leading conference room operating system, RoomOS, and NVIDIA\u2019s AI capabilities allows Cisco to deliver the industry\u2019s most capable AI and machine learning platform\u2014 enabling 20x the AI capabilities of previous generations.\u00a0\n\u201cEdge AI is playing a vital role in bringing autonomy and improving productivity across many industries,\u201d said Deepu Talla, Vice President of Embedded and Edge Computing, NVIDIA. \u201cCisco and NVIDIA have been pioneering the use of AI to enhance collaboration in the workplace, and the new line of products will bring transformative technology to this space.\u201d\u00a0\nRoom Kit EQX = Beautiful, Future-of-Meeting Rooms\u00a0\nCisco has reimagined its portfolio of devices with NVIDIA AI modules, featuring solutions for any cost point and workspace. The highest priority for many customers is refreshing medium to large spaces, which are often flagship rooms for high-stakes meetings. Up until now, video-enabling these spaces has been complex, requiring integrators to stitch together multiple audio, video and furniture components, and requiring a specialist on-site to deploy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Room Kit EQX is a new, integrated collaboration solution that allows customers to deploy beautiful, future-of-meeting rooms simply and consistently across sites. \u00a0\r\n\u00a0\nBenefits for hybrid workers include:\u00a0\n\nSimplified deployment and maintenance: Customers benefit from flexible mounting options, including wall-mounted or free-standing, in some cases eliminating the need for permits and added building costs. This device also eliminates the need for patchwork speaker solutions, mounting options and furniture enclosures, reducing both time and cost to deploy flagship spaces.\u00a0\nAdvanced audiovisual capabilities: Leveraging the NVIDIA Jetson edge AI platform to power advanced camera, audio and speech intelligence, the EQX reduces the feeling of distance between in-person and remote participants.\u00a0\nInteroperability across platforms: On RoomOS mode, the EQX features native Webex Meetings and powerful video interoperability with third-party meeting platforms. The EQX also natively supports Microsoft Teams Rooms augmented with the full-featured Webex Meetings.\u00a0\nUnified management and security: IT admins can take advantage of device management and workspace analytics capabilities in Cisco Control Hub.\u00a0\n\nThe Room Kit EQX is available now. Please see here for more information.\u00a0\u00a0\nCinematic Meetings through Distance Zero\u00a0\nWith an increasingly digitized and globalized workforce, meetings where everyone is physically present are no longer the norm. Cisco\u2019s Cinematic Meetings capabilities leverage an NVIDIA Jetson system-on-module to deliver collaboration experiences that reduce the impact of distance and make all meeting attendees feel like they\u2019re in the room, even if they aren\u2019t, a concept Cisco is calling Distance Zero. To create more equitable and inclusive meeting experiences for all meeting attendees, Cisco is bringing Distance Zero experiences to new workspaces and use cases:\u00a0\n\nNew immersive workspace setups: Cisco is unveiling the blueprint for an all-new campfire-like boardroom experience. At the center of the configuration are four quad cameras and screens at eye-level, all configured in a circular arrangement to provide an immersive view of the content and remote participants. To ensure an equitable and inclusive experience, this setup creates the feeling of face-to-face collaboration for remote and in-person attendees alike.\u00a0\u00a0\nHybrid presentations: Customers can now experience cinematic meetings in auditorium and training style rooms. Cisco devices seamlessly switch cameras and views to provide remote participants with the best view of speakers, their content and close-up audience reactions. And in a new hybrid presenter mode, a remote and an in-room speaker can easily take the stage together for virtually in-person hybrid presentations.\u00a0\n\nThese solutions are generally available. Please see here for more information. \u00a0\nContinued Collaboration Between Cisco and NVIDIA\u00a0\nCisco and NVIDIA have worked together since 2015\u2014 years ahead of today\u2019s AI boom\u2014 to create various industry-leading devices that address some of the biggest challenges of workplace collaboration including meeting equity and video fatigue. We look forward to continued efforts to empower today's flexible workforce with innovative AI-powered solutions for seamless collaboration.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAbout Cisco\u00a0\nCisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the worldwide technology leader that securely connects everything to make anything possible.

NVIDIA Research Breakthrough Puts New Spin on Robot Learning\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI agent uses LLMs to automatically generate reward algorithms to train robots to accomplish complex tasks.\t\t\t\n\n\nOctober 20, 2023 by Angie Lee \n\n\n\n\n\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5 video.

Isaac Gym is built on NVIDIA Omniverse, a development platform for building 3D tools and applications based on the OpenUSD framework. Eureka itself is powered by the GPT-4 large language model.\n\u201cReinforcement learning has enabled impressive wins over the last decade, yet many challenges still exist, such as reward design, which remains a trial-and-error process,\u201d said Anima Anandkumar, senior director of AI research at NVIDIA and an author of the Eureka paper. \u201cEureka is a first step toward developing new algorithms that integrate generative and reinforcement learning methods to solve hard tasks.\u201d\n\nAI Trains Robots\nEureka-generated reward programs \u2014 which enable trial-and-error learning for robots \u2014 outperform expert human-written ones on more than 80% of tasks, according to the paper. This leads to an average performance improvement of more than 50% for the bots.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/franka_cabinet.mp4\nRobot arm taught by Eureka to open a drawer.\nThe AI agent taps the GPT-4 LLM and generative AI to write software code that rewards robots for reinforcement learning. It doesn\u2019t require task-specific prompting or predefined reward templates \u2014 and readily incorporates human feedback to modify its rewards for results more accurately aligned with a developer\u2019s vision.\nUsing GPU-accelerated simulation in Isaac Gym, Eureka can quickly evaluate the quality of large batches of reward candidates for more efficient training.\nEureka then constructs a summary of the key stats from the training results and instructs the LLM to improve its generation of reward functions. In this way, the AI is self-improving. It\u2019s taught all kinds of robots \u2014 quadruped, bipedal, quadrotor, dexterous hands, cobot arms and others \u2014 to accomplish all kinds of tasks.\nThe research paper provides in-depth evaluations of 20 Eureka-trained tasks, based on open-source dexterity benchmarks that require robotic hands to demonstrate a wide range of complex manipulation skills.\nThe results from nine Isaac Gym environments are showcased in visualizations generated using NVIDIA Omniverse.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/humanoid.mp4\nHumanoid robot learns a running gait via Eureka.\n\u201cEureka is a unique combination of large language models and NVIDIA GPU-accelerated simulation technologies,\u201d said Linxi \u201cJim\u201d Fan, senior research scientist at NVIDIA, who\u2019s one of the project\u2019s contributors. \u201cWe believe that Eureka will enable dexterous robot control and provide a new way to produce physically realistic animations for artists.\u201d\nIt\u2019s breakthrough work bound to get developers\u2019 minds spinning with possibilities, adding to recent NVIDIA Research advancements like Voyager, an AI agent built with GPT-4 that can autonomously play Minecraft.\nNVIDIA Research comprises hundreds of scientists and engineers worldwide, with teams focused on topics including AI, computer graphics, computer vision, self-driving cars and robotics.\nLearn more about Eureka and NVIDIA Research.\nExplore generative AI sessions and experiences at NVIDIA GTC, the global conference on AI and accelerated computing, running March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., and online.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AI | Research | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Isaac | NVIDIA Research | Omniverse | Open Source | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Reports suggest that the European Commission (EC) is currently investigating claims that Nvidia strategically utilizes its AI chips to sustain its dominant 80% market share. It\u2019s also worth noting that, as of October 2, an EU executive, according to Reuters, has dismissed the existence of any formal investigation into Nvidia\u2019s AI chips.\nMeanwhile, Goldman Sachs also added it to its \u201cAmericas Conviction List,\u201d while maintaining the price target of $605 per share. According to Goldman Sachs analyst Steven Kron, Nvidia will maintain its standing due to its competitive industry advantage and AI revolutionization. Nvidia\u2019s stock is up in the early Monday trading session.\nNvidia\u2019s chips are used all over the world, and they are partly responsible for the success of Open AI\u2019s ChatGPT.\nWall Street is highly optimistic\nWall Street is quite bullish on Nvidia\u2019s stock. Analysts predict the company\u2019s revenue will rise to $81 billion in fiscal 2024. Nvidia\u2019s revenue has increased more than sixfold between fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2023.\nIn the Q2 earnings call, management also mentioned that its H100 GPU chips are in high demand. It might drive revenue to $16 billion in Q3. Nvidia will report Q3 fiscal 2024 earnings on November 21.\nAccording to TipRanks, Nvidia is a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 with an average target price of $639.82, meaning a 47% upside potential in the next 12 months. The high-end price target is $1,100, which would represent a whopping 155% increase from the September 29 closing price of $430.89.\nNVDA 12-month price target.

Later this year, Gcore intends to add an additional 128 servers with Nvidia H100 GPUs to its Luxembourg cluster and another 25 with A100 GPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 Nvidia\n\n\n\nThe new generative AI cluster is located in Luxembourg. The cloud provider already had an AI IPU-based offering in the country, another in Amsterdam, and a third in Wales.The new cluster will enable users to accelerate their AI and machine learning (ML) training.Users will have direct access to the AI clusters and deployments using the managed Kubernetes with Nvidia GPU nodes and will be able to set up workspaces in MLOps and large-scale models.\"We at Gcore are immensely proud to be a part of the transformation and development of the AI landscape,\" said Andre Reitenbach, CEO at Gcore. \"With the launch of Gcore\u2019s Generative AI Cluster, we are ushering in a new era of opportunities for AI development and research in Europe and the UK. This launch underlines Gcore\u2019s commitment to providing cutting-edge infrastructure and fostering AI-driven innovation.\u201dGcore has PoPs in over 140 regions and more than 20 cloud locations. The company was founded in 2014, first launching its CDN and hosting services in 2016.Other companies developing cloud-based AI solutions include Australia's Firmus, AWS, Oracle, and Lambda Labs which has raised $44 million to build its own AI cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in Cloud & Hyperscale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to build business-ready hybrid cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05 Nov 2024\n\n\n\n\nOracle lays off several hundred OCI staff - report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nAchieving sustainable data centers through circular design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in IT Hardware & Semiconductors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture-proof your datacenter with DDC S-Series\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12 Feb 2025\n\n\n\n\nMeta in talks to acquire AI chip startup FuriosaAI \u2013 report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nSoftware and hardware co-design: Optimizing next-gen compute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nLuxembourg\n\n\nNvidia A100\n\n\nA100\n\n\nDGX\n\n\nAndre Reitenbach\n\n\nGcore\n\n\nNvidia DGX H100\n\n\nH100\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

As it begins to mature, it now encounters a major challenge in the form of how best to integrate artificial intelligence (AI)-optimized hardware, software, and semiconductor chips.\u00a0The \u2018big three\u2019 public cloud services \u2013 Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and market leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) \u2013 may face an existential crisis with the rise of generative AI and the hardware needed to power large language models (LLMs) and other workloads.(Image credit: Shutterstock)Why is big tech racing to partner with Nvidia for AI?Out of these three, AWS is especially vulnerable to losing market share, according to the experts, with another company \u2013 Nvidia \u2013 holding all the cards.With its hold on the AI hardware segment, Nvidia is moving quickly to shore up its leverage by deepening partnerships with major cloud providers, apart from one: AWS. This could work to shake up a public cloud market which we had assumed was set.AWS skips the Nvidia AI party\u2026 but at what cost?Public cloud market leader AWS depended on a four-part approach to create and dominate the public cloud market. This plan included:Creating infrastructure according to popularity / demand for servicesLeveraging first-mover advantageMaking silicon in-house, save billions of dollarsControling product end-to-endThis four-part formula served AWS well, says Dylan Patel, chief analyst at SemiAnalysis, but with the advent of AI, another cloud leader emerged. Nvidia, the semiconductor chip designer of choice for high-performance computing (HPC), LLM training and inference, now competes against the companies it also partners with.\u00a0\u201cNvidia has big ambitions in AI,\u201d says Jay Goldberg, CEO of technology and finance consulting firm D2D Advisory. \u201cIt wants to move beyond only selling semiconductors to providing a complete AI solution to end-customers. This includes providing extensive software tools and even its own cloud service.\u201dCloud Pro NewsletterStay up to date with the latest news and analysis from the world of cloud computing with our twice-weekly newsletterContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.RELATED RESOURCE(Image credit: IBM)Discover how IBM watsonx.data supports a range of current standard technologies\n\nDOWNLOAD NOW\u201cWe are witnessing an intense competition among these cloud providers to capitalize on the significant revenue opportunities presented by the thriving AI applications,\u201d adds Sameh Boujelbene, VP of data center and campus ethernet switch market research at Dell\u2019Oro Group. \u201cNvidia is seizing this pivotal moment in the market to leverage its dominance in AI hardware and generate revenue from cloud-based software solutions.\u201cNvidia made early investments in AI and deep learning, recognizing their potential long before they became mainstream,\u201d Boujelbene adds. \u201cThis head start allowed it to develop and refine its technology to cater specifically to AI applications.\u201dNetworking is key to Nvidia\u2019s cloud ambitionsAWS has resisted this push, and its approach to Nvidia could close the gap between it and its major competitors Azure and GCP. The service of which Goldberg and Boujelbene speak is Nvidia\u2019s AI as a service offering, Nvidia AI. It gives customers access to the power of a supercomputer to train LLM, develop AI inference models, and monitor data.\u00a0\u201cSo far, Nvidia has been careful to position its cloud computing ambitions in partnership with the public cloud providers,\u201d says Goldberg. \u201cBeyond this, Nvidia's dominant position in AI semiconductors and limited supplies has allowed it to ration allocation of those chips.\u201dAWS is left out, says Patel, because it refuses to leverage Nvidia\u2019s networking product NVLink. Leveraging the tool would give Nvidia too much control, in the eyes of AWS, Patel tells ITPro.\u00a0(Image credit: Nvidia)\u201cThe new GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip platform] \u2026 uses the Grace Hopper Superchip, which can be connected with additional Superchips by NVIDIA NVLink\u2122, allowing them to work together to deploy the giant models used for generative AI\u2026. gives the GPU full access to the CPU memory, providing a combined 1.2TB of fast memory when in dual configuration.\u201dNetworking remains a critical piece of Nvidia\u2019s full-stack solution, according to Boujelbene. In addition to NVLink, Boujelbene points out the firm\u2019s InfiniBand and Ethernet offerings. The H100s can reach 3.5 times their normal performance when using NVLink between GPU nodes, Nvidia claims. He notes AWS isn\u2019t the only one cautious about integrating NVLink.But, Patel warns, once Nvidia\u2019s much anticipated GH200 Grace Hopper chip arrives, the firm will most likely make NVLink mandatory for other companies to gain access to the chip\u2019s power and performance. Patel has inferred this from Nvidia\u2019s product announcement, in which it all but came out and said NVLink is needed to get the most out of its tools.How Nvidia is directly challenging cloud providersNvidia is using its popular H100 chips as leverage by prioritizing Azure, GCP, and smaller players such as Coreweave, Equinix, and Lambda to receive the first available shipments of the in-demand H100s. By doing so, the firm is folding cloud providers into its cloud ambitions, and AWS sticks out like a sore thumb because it won\u2019t play ball, Patel says.The demand for H100s comes from the chip\u2019s raw speed in both inference and LLM training. Even with Nvidia\u2019s price spikes, H100s still provide the best performance per dollar from any of the latest GPUs.AWS occupies an almost too-big-to-fail position in the market, and it can certainly afford stick to its principles and remain in control, but this puts it in the rare position of playing catchup. \u201cNvidia is the leading provider of GPUs and AI accelerated compute for the cloud services providers,\u201d says Goldberg. \u201cThey rely on Nvidia for providing the best GPUs, along with the CUDA software tools, which power the training of AI models.\u201dTo compete, AWS developed its own inference and training software called Trainium and Inferentia, Patel adds. But they\u2019re below standard capabilities, they\u2019re struggling to gain traction in the market, and aren\u2019t competitive after offering steep discounts.\u00a0(Image credit: Getty Images)The costs of building generative AI platforms are racking upNvidia is assuming the role of gatekeeper for the \u2018big three\u2019 cloud service providers in this AI age. The firm uses its software \u2013 CUDA \u2013 and hardware \u2013 H100 and GH200 \u2013 to retain partnerships and pressure holdouts.Nvidia also struck partnerships with Microsoft, Oracle, Google, and minor players to roll out a lower-margin DGX as a service operation. This gives customers access to Nvidia\u2019s latest suite of cloud-ready systems without needing hardware. According to Patel, AWS is the only major cloud provider not offering Nvidia\u2019s AI as a service model, jeapordizing its position as the market leader.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\nAmazon Web Services (AWS)\nMicrosoft Azure\n\n\nLisa SparksSocial Links NavigationLisa D Sparks is an experienced editor and marketing professional with a background in journalism, content marketing, strategic development, project management, and process automation.

Factors such as increasing Treasury yields, soaring interest rates, European recession concerns, and escalating tensions in the Middle East have all contributed to this setback.\u00a0\nFurthermore, October 31 reports revealed that NVDA faces yet another threat, with $5 billion in company orders being at risk of cancellation due to newly implemented US regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Picks for you\n  \n\n\n\n                  Here\u2019s why Bitcoin\u2019s pullback is a buy signal and not a bear market warning\n              \n1 hour ago\n\n\n\n                  Economist says the real Trump trade is ditching U.S. stocks for foreign markets\n              \n4 hours ago\n\n\n\n                  How Dogecoin could trigger next market crash, according to commodity strategist\n              \n7 hours ago\n\n\n\n                  Legal expert warns Ripple v.

In total, orders for the next year exceeded $5 billion, the report said.\nNvidia stock price analysis\nShares of Nvidia were sitting at $411.61 at press time, up 1.6% in the past 24 hours.\nThe stock fell more than 4.4% on the week and around 6% across the month amid the broader market sell-off.\nNVDA 1-month price chart. Source: Finbold\nYear-to-date, Nvidia\u2019s shares are still up more than 187%, making it the best-performing stock tracked by the S&P 500 index.\nRegarding the impact of the new export controls, Nvidia\u2019s spokesman said that the company has been actively engaged in efforts to distribute its advanced AI computing systems, which utilize graphics chips impacted by the regulations, to customers within the United States and other regions.\u00a0\nAdditionally, they are exploring options to secure supplementary supply.\n\n\u201cThese new export controls will not have a meaningful impact in the near term.\u201d\n\u2013 the spokesman said. \n\nThe restrictions are part of the broader Biden administration\u2019s strategy to limit China\u2019s access to advanced technology, which it believes could enhance China\u2019s military and cyberwarfare capabilities.\nBuy stocks now with Interactive Brokers \u2013 the most advanced investment platform\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

These would include GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip hardware alongside Nvidia AI Enterprise software.Details are sparse, but the custom designs will reportedly be based on Nvidia HGX reference designs, and feature eight H100 Tensor Core GPUs per system, GH200 Superchips, OVX reference designs, and Nvidia networking.The AI factories will enable users to train AI models, enhance factory workflows, and run simulations before physical deployment in the physical world.The companies said Foxconn is expected to build \u201ca large number of systems\u201d based on Nvidia CPUs, GPUs, and networking for its global customer base, which is \u2018looking to create and operate their own AI factories.'\u201cA new type of manufacturing has emerged \u2014 the production of intelligence. And the data centers that produce it are AI factories,\u201d said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\u201cFoxconn, the world\u2019s largest manufacturer, has the expertise and scale to build AI factories globally. We are delighted to expand our decade-long partnership with Foxconn to accelerate the AI industrial revolution.\u201d\u201cNvidia and Foxconn are building these factories together. We will be helping the whole industry move much faster into the new AI era,\u201d added Foxconn Chairman and CEO Young Liu.At the same time, Foxconn said it was also developing a number of platforms based on Nvidia technologies.Foxconn's Smart EV solution will be built on Nvidia Drive Hyperion 9, a platform for autonomous automotive fleets, and Nvidia\u2019s Drive Thor system-on-a-chip for the automotive industry. Foxconn's Smart Manufacturing robotic systems will be built on the Nvidia Isaac autonomous mobile robot platform.The company's Smart City offering will incorporate the Nvidia Metropolis video analytics platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in IT Hardware & Semiconductors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture-proof your datacenter with DDC S-Series\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09 Jan 2025\n\n\n\n\nArm and SoftBank considering Ampere takeover \u2013 report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nSoftware and hardware co-design: Optimizing next-gen compute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in AI & Analytics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnterprise adoption trends\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13 Jan 2025\n\n\n\n\nEverseen and Google Cloud team up for Vision AI for retail stores\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nThe impact of tech refresh on sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nGrace Hopper Superchips\n\n\nH100\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\nFoxconn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

The company left investors astounded by its performance, revealing quarterly earnings that exceeded even the loftiest Wall Street projections.\nIn May 2023, Nvidia reported a staggering quarterly profit exceeding $2 billion, accompanied by revenue surging to an impressive $7 billion, far surpassing expectations.\u00a0\nNvidia\u2019s unique position in the AI landscape sets it apart, with its powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) acting as the linchpin for large-scale data processing and generative AI models like ChatGPT. Notably, the company reportedly commands an 80% share of the GPU market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Picks for you\n  \n\n\n\n                  Here\u2019s why Bitcoin\u2019s pullback is a buy signal and not a bear market warning\n              \n1 hour ago\n\n\n\n                  Economist says the real Trump trade is ditching U.S. stocks for foreign markets\n              \n4 hours ago\n\n\n\n                  How Dogecoin could trigger next market crash, according to commodity strategist\n              \n7 hours ago\n\n\n\n                  Legal expert warns Ripple v.

Source: Finbold\nWall Street\u2019s projections on NVDA\nWhile some may think that NVDA\u2019s eye-popping 2023 ascent made it an overvalued stock poised for correction, Wall Street analysts are not likely to agree with those views.\nIn fact, they believe the chipmaker can witness further upside in the months ahead.\nBased on 38 analysts\u2019 projections issued in the past three months, the consensus 12-month forecast for Nvidia\u2019s shares currently stands at $650.53, implying over 41% upside from its current level, according to TipRanks.\nAnalysts\u2019 12-month price forecasts for NVDA. Source: TipRanks\nFurthermore, the stock has an average rating of a \u2018Strong Buy,\u2019 based on 37 \u2018Buy\u2019 and 1 \u2018Hold\u2019 recommendations the analysts offered in the previous three months. Notably, none of the analysts recommend to sell the stock.\nTD Cowen strategists see 50% more upside in NVDA\u00a0\nCompared to the aforementioned average price target, one Wall Street analyst recently offered an even more bullish prediction last week.\nNamely, TW Cowen strategist Matthew Ramsay and his team of analysts reiterated their Outperform rating on NVDA and hiked the price target on the stock from $600 to $700.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe believe the industry is in the early innings of two transformational paradigm shifts toward ubiquitous acceleration and generative artificial intelligence, with Nvidia\u2019s wide moat potentially expanding.\u201d\n\u2013 analysts wrote. \n\nNvidia\u2019s stock was down 0.7% at $457 in the premarket trading on Tuesday.\u00a0\nBuy stocks now with Interactive Brokers \u2013 the most advanced investment platform\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Still, some growth companies can be trusted for a long period, and they have the potential to increase your future wealth significantly. As the stock market is back on track after a turbulent few years and big companies are starting to roar again, now is the time for investors to dive in and set themselves up for huge profits in the future.\nAnalysts are hopeful, predicting that growth stocks will gain three to four times over the next decade. With this anticipated appreciation, investors desiring substantial profits should consider these companies to invest in.\nNavigating this landscape, one finds that growing companies that offer above-average earnings growth and high returns are usually the go-to choice for investors aiming for a financially secure future. These companies, often embedded in sectors marked by innovation and rapid development, become the precursor of not just profit but transformation in the market landscape.\nLet\u2019s dive into the best three growth stocks investors should consider for the next 10 years.\nNvidia (NVDA)\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\nNvidia\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA), the leading maker of graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) chips, is having a great year. Its share price has soared by 178% year-to-date (YTD), and revenue has crossed $32 billion YTD. In its last quarter\u2019s earnings, the company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.70, beating estimates by 61 cents. For Q3, analysts predicted that EPS will rise to $3.36, and revenue is estimated to reach $15.89 billion.\nIn addition, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh has made a prediction, suggesting that by 2027, Nvidia\u2019s AI segment alone could be pulling in a jaw-dropping $300 billion. When you stack that against this year\u2019s AI earnings projection of about $25 billion-$30 billion, it\u2019s clear Nvidia is onto something big. Rakesh is also betting that Nvidia will remain in the top position in AI chip-making, cornering about 75% of the market.\nFurthermore, Nvidia recently introduced a robotic hand with an AI agent named Eureka. It can perform tasks that a human hand does, like spinning a pen or opening a drawer. It uses AI learning advancement to perform these tasks. Instead of being hardwired with a set playbook, it picks up skills on the fly, making mistakes, learning, and even tuning in to human feedback to improve. This innovation represents a significant stride in AI and robotics and could be a game-changer for the company. So, investing in Nvidia offers robust long-term upside potential and could give substantial profit to its investors in the future.\nMeta Platforms (META)\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\nIn the rapidly evolving world of technology and social media, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has continually risen above the ranks, not just in name but in innovation and market performance. This growth can be attributed to the company\u2019s innovative strides and expansion in diverse technological realms. Meta Platforms reported a great financial performance this year, with the stock price increasing by 150% YTD. The company\u2019s revenues so far have reached $127 billion, marking a solid increase year-over-year.\nAlongside the increase in revenue, total costs and expenses also witnessed a surge, amounting to $25 billion. Despite the uptick in expenses, efficient management and operational efficacy ensured profitability. In simpler terms, Meta Platforms is making more money, spending a bit more, but still keeping a good amount of profit.\nAnd if you own shares in the company, you\u2019re likely happy because the value of each share is going up. All of this tells us that Meta Platforms is a strong company that\u2019s growing and making its shareholders more money. According to analysts, by 2030, the stock will reach $\u202f1,331.38. If this prediction materializes, META stock will grow 343.1% from its current price.\nMoreover, Meta Platforms has some exciting plans for the future as well. The company wants to add AI chatbots to its social sites like Facebook and Instagram. Chris Cox, a top executive at Meta, shared this idea at a Big Tech talk. He imagines these bots as helpful buddies online, always ready to give users a hand with their to-do lists or keep them company.\nIn conclusion, as Meta Platforms continues to conquer the world of AI with its innovations, the company has so much upside potential in the future. Passionate investors looking for a bright long-term future should invest in META stock.\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\nSource: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com\nMicrosoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT), a leader in the modern world of technology, has been on a promising growth path recently. Over the past five years, its stock price has increased by 218/%. The company\u2019s AI approach is really helping it gain momentum. Its AI endeavors are prominent across a wide range of applications. From the integration of AI into productivity tools like Microsoft Office and cloud services like Azure to the creation of conversational AI models like ChatGPT, Microsoft\u2019s AI influence is far-reaching.\nIn financial terms, Microsoft has been doing consistently well in the market. Its stock has increased 40% in 2023. Impressively, Microsoft\u2019s revenue increased by 6.88%. EPS for the current year was $9.68, which was a 0.31% increase from 2022.\nAccording to analysts, \u201cAssuming Microsoft achieves the 12.8 percent earnings growth expected by analysts over the next five years, the stock\u2019s EPS would reach roughly $17.70. If the P/E ratio remains at roughly 30 times, the stock will trade at around $530 within five years.\u201d\nAt its yearly event, Microsoft announced that it is making its search engine Bing even smarter by integrating ChatGPT. Looking to the future, Microsoft plans to make Microsoft 365 Copilot generally available for enterprise customers. This advanced AI assistant is set to revolutionize work processes. Building on Bing Chat Enterprise, it emphasizes enterprise-grade security, privacy, compliance and responsible AI within Microsoft 365.\nMoreover, Microsoft is also moving toward the gaming industry with the purchase of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) for $69 billion. This purchase put Microsoft among the top gaming businesses in the world. Microsoft now owns popular games like \u201cWarcraft,\u201d \u201cDiablo,\u201d \u201cOverwatch,\u201d \u201cCall of Duty,\u201d and \u201cCandy Crush.\u201d\nIn conclusion, the next era will be all about AI and technology. Investing in Microsoft will be a wise decision for investors who know that tech companies are going to see massive growth in the next decade.\nOn the date of publication, Nauman Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Businesses and consumers frequently invest in resources that can expand their productivity and capabilities. This makes investing in robotics stocks a lucrative concept.\nRobots are present in many elements of our lives. Smart speakers can play music, provide weather updates and turn on the lights in your home. Many businesses use chatbots on their websites to create better customer experiences and reduce their overhead.\nCompanies that provide robotic devices and software can profit from the rising demand in this space. The corporations that produce raw materials robotic devices rely on can also expand their market share with this innovative technology.\nThe robotics industry is likely to experience more evolution in the future. These three robotics stocks look ready to generate long-term returns for investors.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\nNvidia\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) has been a large player in the AI industry. Many investors recognize the company for its advancements in that industry, but Nvidia is also well-positioned in the robotics industry.\nMany robotic devices rely on Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs). These semiconductors form the backbone of many advanced technologies. As robotics companies make innovations to their technology and challenge limits, they will need advanced chips like Nvidia\u2019s to create progress.\nNvidia has done its part for investors, with shares nearly tripling year-to-date. The stock has gained more than 600% over the past five years and looks like an attractive pick for investors with lengthy time horizons.\nOne area of concern for the juggernaut is the recent chip rules in the United States. The U.S. is currently restricting which of Nvidia\u2019s AI chips can go to China. The ruling stands to hurt Nvidia\u2019s revenue, but leadership is confident.\nNvidia hinted at\u00a0strengthening demand\u00a0for its products in an SEC filing in response to the new law. Investors can use the short-term headwinds as an opportunity to get exposure to a promising company.\nAmazon (AMZN)\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\nAmazon\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is an e-commerce giant that has stretched out into many business models, including its highly profitable Amazon Web Services. The company also has a separate robotics fulfillment division that aims to speed up deliveries.\nThese robots can help Amazon increase its efficiency while lowering costs. The end result can be higher profit margins for the tech conglomerate. Amazon stock can certainly use the boost.\nIgnoring a 51% year-to-date gain, Amazon shares have been flat for a few years. The stock has gained 47% throughout the past five years, with all of those gains coming in the current year. Amazon was one of the many tech stocks that got hit hard in 2022.\nAmazon\u2019s sales have been picking up lately, and it\u2019s a sign that more stock gains can follow. In the second quarter, Amazon reported\u00a011% year-over-year sales growth. Amazon generated $6.7 billion in net income.\nAmazon gives investors exposure to many industries, including robotics. The company is a household name that continues to innovate and look for opportunities to increase profit margins.\nSymbotic (SYM)\nSource: shutterstock.com/Tex vector\nSymbotic\u00a0(NASDAQ:SYM) produces robots used in warehouses to speed up production. The company has\u00a0large clients\u00a0such as\u00a0Walmart\u00a0(NYSE:WMT),\u00a0Target\u00a0(NYSE:TGT), and\u00a0Albertson\u2019s\u00a0(NYSE:ACI) that use its robotic devices.\nA recent partnership with\u00a0SoftBank\u00a0(OTCMKTS:SFTBY) can lead to further gains. The two companies are working on a joint venture that aims to deliver logistics and warehousing robotic solutions to smaller businesses.\nThis partnership can help Symbotic address companies with smaller budgets and gain market share in the process. At the moment, a Symbotic client must invest millions of dollars in the company\u2019s software and robotics. Minimizing the barrier to entry will make the company\u2019s products and services more accessible.\nWhile the partnership is an exciting component of Symbotic\u2019s long-term growth narrative, investors have had plenty to cheer about. Shares have gained roughly 250% year-to-date and are up by more than 300% ever since the SPAC in less than two years.\nSymbotic\u2019s top-line growth is impressive, and the company is closing in on a profitable quarter. When Symbotic flips the switch to profitability, shares can gain significant momentum. If you are looking for robotics stocks, this is a great place to start.\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in NVDA.

The equity is getting special attention today, though, last seen up 2.6% at $446.10 at last check, after Goldman Sachs added it to its \"conviction list.\"\nThe analyst in coverage said Nvidia is now \"the principal 'shovel supplier' in the AI 'gold rush.'\" Per White's data, 5,104,461 calls and 4,812,945 puts were exchanged in the last two weeks, with the weekly 9/29 430-strike call standing as the most popular contract in this time period.\n\nThe shares have taken a breather from their Aug. 24, record high of $502.66, with the $400 region containing their latest pullback, as it did in June and August. Nvidia stock\u00a0 could today conquer the 20-day moving average for the first time since Sept. 7, too. So far in 2023, NVDA is up 204.6%.\n\nThis could be an excellent opportunity to weigh in on the security's next move with options, which are affordably priced right now. This is per NVDA's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 38%, which ranks in the extremely low 10th percentile of its annual range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow @Schaeffers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhich of These SUB-$5 Stocks Could 26x From Here?\u00a0(AD)\nHe called a rare 11x on Tesla\u2026\nThen he called a 26x on Workhorse\u2026\nThen an even rarer 35x on Nio Inc\u2026\nNow Tim Bohen says these 5 tiny \u201cAmerica First\u201d stocks are next up in 2025.\nThey\u2019re trading for less than $5 right now.\nBut thanks to Elon & Trump\u2019s new alliance\u2026\nThey could be off to the races in Trump\u2019s first 100 days.\nAnd right now for a limited time\u2026\nYou can get the names & tickers for just $1 here.\u00a0(AD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFeatured Articles from Trusted Partners:\n\ud83d\ude80 One Stock Pick Could Change Everything in 2025\nWhat if one stock pick could define your success next year?

With the potential to turn a modest investment into a potential fortune, boasting returns of up to 120 times, it has garnered the attention of investors worldwide.As the world becomes increasingly reliant on artificial intelligence, the financial burdens of AI development have soared. This has created a significant roadblock for many tech companies. The solution to this problem is not just a financial necessity; it's a technological imperative. That's where the \"Nvidia Killer\" comes in.\u00a0For years, NVDA has held the crown as the kingpin of AI. It's been the go-to stock for investors seeking exposure to AI's immense potential. However, as history has repeatedly demonstrated, no monopoly lasts forever. The \"Nvidia Killer\" is emerging as a potential contender, challenging NVDA's dominance and offering investors an alternative path to capitalize on the AI revolution. While you won't find the stock on our Artificial Intelligence Stocks Under $10 list, we can give you some details about the \"Nvidia Killer\" below.\u00a0So let's get into it\u2026\u00a0\nNvidia Could Crash Soon\nNvidia\u2019s days are numbered\u2026 \nBecause there\u2019s a new player in the AI market\u2026A Californian company that developed a groundbreaking chip \u2014 one that outperforms Nvidia\u2019s chips 100x.\nThe U.S. Air Force is just one elite client that was allowed to use it early.\nBut soon this chip will be available to the mainstream.\nAnd if you position yourself before it reaches the mass market, you could turn every $1 into $120\u2026 \nThe U.S. Air Force is just one elite client that was allowed to use it early.\nJust like early Nvidia investors did.\nKeith Kohl just published an urgent presentation on this unique opportunity.\nGet the full story here while there\u2019s still time.\nA Glimpse into the FutureAs the tech world awaits the next AI generation, the \"Nvidia Killer\" is poised for a monumental leap.

A new report from venture capital firm Accel found that U.S. technology companies have seen $2.4 trillion added to their market capitalizations this year from the hype and expectations surrounding generative AI. Accel\u2019s analysis found the share prices of the biggest U.S. technology firms have risen an average of 36% so far in 2023 \u2014 much of that thanks to AI. Accel\u2019s report also found that cloud computing and software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies such as Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) are also benefitting from expectations surrounding AI, and have seen their stocks increase an average of 29% this year.\nGiven that AI technologies are widely considered to still be in their infancy, investors can expect big growth and sizable returns moving forward. Here are seven AI stocks that will change the world and create many millionaires in the process.\n\nBaidu (BIDU)\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\nChinese tech firm Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) has just come out and claimed it has developed a generative AI system that matches the technology used in the ChatGPT and GPT-4 chatbots. Analysts and investors are taking the claims seriously given that Baidu is widely regarded as China\u2019s leading AI developer. And, until now, the AI systems coming out of China have paled in comparison to those produced by U.S. firms such as OpenAI. Baidu CEO Robin Li said at a public presentation recently that the company\u2019s newly released ERNIE 4.0 chatbot \u201cstands on par with GPT-4 in terms of overall performance.\u201d\nThe latest chatbot from Baidu is currently available to invited users only, though the company plans to roll it out more broadly in 2024. The previous version of Baidu\u2019s ERNIE chatbot was ranked as the best among China\u2019s tech companies based on its algorithm and development tools, according to market research firm IDC. News that a new version of the ERNIE chatbot is available and could rival the most advanced American technologies has come as a bit of a surprise given the stricter government controls placed around the development of AI within China. This development suggests Baidu might be further ahead than many U.S. companies in developing AI.\nBIDU stock has risen 28% over the last 12 months.\nNvidia (NVDA)\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\nWhat more can be said about microchip and semiconductor powerhouse Nvidia\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) at this point? The company is the hands-down leader when it comes to AI and technology powering chatbots, large language learning models and supercomputers. OpenAI, the privately held company behind ChatGPT, is now considering making its own microchips because it can\u2019t get Nvidia chips fast enough. That\u2019s how great the demand is for Nvidia\u2019s technology right now.\nMeeting the skyrocketing global demand for its chips and semiconductors is the main challenge facing Nvidia. It\u2019s also why the company\u2019s financial results have been crushing Wall Street expectations, why NVDA stock has tripled so far this year and is up more than 650% over five years. Many analysts and industry observers say that how far AI ultimately goes will largely depend on how powerful Nvidia\u2019s future chips and semiconductors become. Any investor wanting to capitalize on the growth of AI should own NVDA stock.\n\n\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\n\n\nSince its initial public offering in 2004, Alphabet\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG,\u00a0 NASDAQ:GOOGL) has created generational wealth for many investors. An investment of $15,000 in the company\u2019s stock on its Aug. 19, 2004 IPO would be worth $1 million today. Going forward, Alphabet\u2019s shares are likely to continue outperforming due in large part to the current catalyst the company has in AI. From its DeepMind research unit to the Bard chatbot and its smart home devices, Alphabet is pushing the envelope when it comes to AI. And the company is only starting to monetize the new technology.\nAlphabet\u2019s leadership position in AI is beginning to reflect in the company\u2019s share price, which has gained 57% year-to-date and is starting to pull ahead of other mega-cap tech stocks like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Analysts seem to be in agreement that Alphabet is among the best-positioned companies to benefit from future advances in AI. Unlike many AI companies, Alphabet is involved in all aspects of the technology, from the theory behind its development to its practical applications. GOOGL stock should respond accordingly.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD)\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\nWhile it\u2019s not as big a beneficiary of AI as Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a dark horse in the race for artificial intelligence supremacy among microchip and semiconductor companies. Over the last two years, AMD\u2019s share of the Data Center segment, including the graphics processing units (GPUs) used to power AI models such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, has nearly doubled to $1.3 billion. And, AMD is about to release a new AI microchip called the MI300X that many analysts see as a game changer. The MI300X marks AMD\u2019s biggest push into AI yet and is a formidable rival to Nvidia\u2019s strong AI microchip \u2014 the H100.\nAt the same time, AMD is getting closer to Microsoft and the two companies are forming strategic alliances for developing future AI technologies. Microsoft is increasing its use of AMD\u2019s chips, and AMD is starting to develop chips specifically for Microsoft\u2019s use. The two tech titans could form a strong future alliance. All of this activity is helping to power AMD\u2019s financial results higher. The company is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings on Oct. 31. AMD expects full production of its MI300X microchip to ramp up now, with sales reflected in its earnings prints beginning in early 2024.\nAMD stock is up 64% this year and up 344% over five years.\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\nInvestors can\u2019t currently buy shares of privately held OpenAI, the company that ushered in this year\u2019s AI boom with the launch in November 2022 of ChatGPT, which some analysts refer to as the AI \u201cBig Bang\u201d moment. However, investors can do the next best thing \u2014 buy Microsoft stock. The software company invested $10 billion in OpenAI and has been aggressively capitalizing on the technology, adding it to its Bing search engine, as well as to video games and cloud computing. Microsoft is more closely associated with OpenAI than any other company.\nMicrosoft is continuing to push the bounds of AI forward, already using it to help healthcare companies make sense of their mountains of data. Many analysts say the AI catalyst is not yet reflected in MSFT stock, and there is plenty of upside ahead for stockholders. The median price target on Microsoft\u2019s share price is currently $400, implying a 20% upside from current levels. The other thing that distinguishes Microsoft from other tech companies is its size and diversity. While AI offers the company a huge new market, it is only one area of strength. Microsoft is also a leader in video games, cloud computing and software. MSFT stock is up 39% so far in 2023.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\nThe strategic importance of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u00a0(NYSE:TSM) to the world of AI, and the world at large for that matter, cannot be overstated. As the largest microchip and semiconductor foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor is responsible for making over 60% of the world\u2019s supply of advanced microchips, semiconductors and processors. The company\u2019s strategic role provides it, and Taiwan, with what\u2019s called a \u201csilicon shield.\u201d It\u2019s been estimated that a Chinese blockade of Taiwan would disrupt over $2 trillion in economic activity by severing the primary source of advanced chips and semiconductors from global supply chains, crippling the tech industry in the process.\nCompanies ranging from Nvidia to Apple rely on Taiwan Semiconductor, as do most governments. Without its foundry business, advancements in AI technologies would grind to a halt. As such, TSM stock is a very good one to own. Even Warren Buffett praised Taiwan Semiconductor as one of the world\u2019s best-run companies. While Buffett sold most of his stake in TSM stock over geopolitical concerns, he said he continues to greatly admire the company\u2019s operations and the wide competitive moat around its business and stock. TSM stock is up 43% over the last 12 months and has risen 137% over five years.\nMeta Platforms (META)\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\nWhat metaverse? For Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), it is now all about AI. The company, led by Mark Zuckerberg, has pivoted hard this year towards AI and largely abandoned its previous plan to create a digital realm known as the metaverse \u2014 a place consumers would access through its virtual reality headsets. While the headsets still figure into the company\u2019s plans, they are more likely to gain access to AI applications than buying a virtual house in the virtual world. At the company\u2019s Meta Connect developer conference held in September, it was all about AI.\nAt the conference, Meta unveiled several generative AI chatbots and announced other AI technologies aimed at positioning the company as a competitor to OpenAI and especially Alphabet. Zuckerberg also announced that Meta Platforms is launching a text-to-image platform called Emu that will be available across several apps, and adding AI photo editing tools to its Instagram social media platform. Plus, Meta recently introduced a new AI Studio platform that enables developers to build their own AI chatbots. META stock has increased 160% this year.\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in NVDA, MSFT, AAPL and GOOGL.

Since its launch last November, the powerful AI chatbot has effectively carved a niche in research, organizing copious amounts of data and pointing toward some of the best long-term stocks to buy.\nIts responses, while rich in company knowledge, sometimes missed the mark on timely insights. Yet, after some engaging dialogue, it presented three compelling picks that offer tremendous upside potential. \nHere, we unpack these selections, not just through the lens of ChatGPT\u2019s massive knowledge reservoir but by infusing and incorporating a dose of real-time market acumen.\nAlphabet\u00a0(GOOG,GOOGL)\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\nSince its stock market debut in 2004, Alphabet\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been a wealth magnet. Thus, the AI revolution is scripting its next chapter of success. \nWith its DeepMind division of the Bard chatbot, and smart home gadgets, Alphabet isn\u2019t just playing in the AI sandbox. It\u2019s effectively shaping it. Additionally, the monetization era for these tech marvels is expected to skyrocket Alphabet\u2019s performance over the long term.\nThe proof is in the numbers, with GOOG stock up more than 50% this year, as it stands on the frontline of AI beneficiaries. Unlike its peers, Alphabet is sailing the entire AI ocean, from theoretical whispers to practical roars. And let\u2019s not forget, Google\u2019s colossal footprint in internet search isn\u2019t shrinking, commanding a lion\u2019s share of 83.4%. Hence, its unrivaled market presence is not merely a shield. Now, it\u2019s a robust fortress, effectively keeping revenue dips at bay, even when economic waves seem relentless.\nTesla (TSLA)\nSource: Zigres / Shutterstock.com\nTesla\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA) is doing so much more than navigating market currents. It is effectively riding the wave, turning challenges into strategic recalibrations. This EV giant\u2019s pricing strategies and the resultant margin dance aren\u2019t admissions of defeat but proof of its savvy knack for timely evolution.\nThe company\u2019s relatively subdued Q3 delivery and production figures are a temporary detour on Tesla\u2019s highway toward enduring success. A slight earnings and revenue miss is essentially a mere hiccup for a company no stranger to shattering market expectations. Remember, it\u2019s the EV pioneers, the first brush with such a miss since 2019, underscoring its history of consistency.\nAs we gaze ahead, we see the promise and incredible potential of the Cybertruck. More than a product, the truck is a proclamation of perpetual innovation. Even Musk proposes prudence, highlighting the Herculean tasks that wait. Nevertheless, Tesla\u2019s narrative weaves in bold diversification involving energy storage, solar ventures, and a flirtation with autonomous ferrying. These effectively paint a financial landscape rich with revenue gains.\nNvidia (NVDA)\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\nNvidia\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is nothing short of a colossus in the AI chip realm, which is set to be an industry front-runner in the sector. With a pioneering spirit and an unchallenged 90% market share, Nvidia is the vanguard of the AI revolution, a sector poised for colossal long-term growth. \nMoreover, it\u2019s not just about the chips. Data centers hungry for AI capabilities are feeding the company\u2019s sales, propelling a staggering 171% sales leap in its most recent quarter. And as the Internet of Things (IoT) casts its net even wider, Nvidia finds itself at the heart of it all, driving innovations, especially in the automotive domain.\nThe digits tell a dazzling tale. NVDA stock has skyrocketed, clocking more than a 180% gain this year and an astonishing 750% over five years. The horizon looks even brighter, with revenue and EBITDA projections aiming skyward at 43% and 52%, respectively.

The Ada Lovelace architecture is categorically redefining the GPU performance landscape. Positioned as NVIDIA\u2019s flagship offering, this juggernaut of a card supersedes the RTX A6000, a formidable and still very relevant predecessor in its own right.\n\nThe NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada GPU was recently released, and we were lucky enough to get one here in the lab for some extended testing. The Ada Lovelace architecture is categorically redefining the GPU performance landscape. Positioned as NVIDIA\u2019s flagship offering, this juggernaut of a card supersedes the RTX A6000, a formidable and still very relevant predecessor in its own right.\nYet, the superficial resemblance in nomenclature belies a watershed of advancements under the hood. Both GPUs were featured in high-profile reviews: the RTX 6000 Ada in our Dell Precision 7960 review and the RTX A6000 in the HP Z6 G5 and Lenovo Thinkstation PX.\n\nNVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Vs. NVIDIA RTX A6000\nAt first glance, the RTX 6000 Ada and its predecessor, the RTX A6000, share similar specifications: 48GB of GDDR6 memory, 4x DisplayPort 1.4a outputs, 300W TDP, and identical form factors. However, diving deeper reveals a monumental shift. The RTX 6000 Ada is a marquee product within NVIDIA\u2019s Ada Lovelace architecture, in stark contrast to the RTX A6000\u2019s roots in the Ampere architecture.\n\n\n\n\nSpecification\nNVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada\nNVIDIA RTX A6000\n\n\nArchitecture\nAda Lovelace\nAmpere\n\n\nCuda Cores\n18,176\n10,752\n\n\nMemory Size\n48GB GDDR6\n48GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Interface\n384-bit\n384-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n960GB/s\n768GB/s\n\n\nGPU Display Connectors\n4x DisplayPort 1.4a\n4x DisplayPort 1.4a\n\n\nDisplay Output\n4x 4096 x 2160 @ 120 Hz\n4x 5120 x 2880 @ 60 Hz\n2x 7680 x 4320 @ 60 Hz\n4x 4096 x 2160 @ 120 Hz,\n4x 5120 x 2880 @ 60 Hz,\n2x 7680 x 4320 @ 60 Hz\n\n\nRay Tracing Generation\nThird Generation\nSecond Generation\n\n\nRay Tracing (RT) Cores\n142\n84\n\n\nTensor Core Generation\nFourth Generation\nThird Generation\n\n\nTensor Cores\n568\n336\n\n\nSingle-Precision Performance\n91.1 Teraflops\n38.7 Teraflops\n\n\nRT Core Performance\n210.6 Teraflops\n75.6 Teraflops\n\n\nTensor Performance\n1457.0 Teraflops\n309.7 Teraflops\n\n\nNVLink\nNo\nYes\n\n\nPower Connector\n1x PCIe CEM5 16-pin\n1x 8-pin CPU\n\n\nPrice As of Testing (USD)\n$6,800\n$4,650\n\n\n\nRTX 6000 Ada Spec Sheet | RTX A6000 Spec Sheet\n\nWhen you venture into the intricacies of the architecture, the differences come into sharp focus. Cuda Core counts, Memory Bandwidth, Ray Tracing (RT) Cores, and Tensor Cores all diverge in favor of the RTX 6000 Ada. Notably, it boasts a staggering 18,176 Cuda Cores, eclipsing the RTX A6000\u2019s 10,752. But it\u2019s not just about raw numbers but how these spec differences translate into real-world, measurable performance metrics. Let\u2019s get down to the brass tacks.\n\nNVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Performance Benchmarks\nTo assess the comparative might of these GPUs, we orchestrated a dual within our TYAN Transport HX FT65T-B8050 testing rig, equipped with the newly released AMD EPYC GenoaX 96 Core CPU. This platform proves to be robust and reliable in minimizing bottlenecks. We swapped GPUs through this to keep all of the environmental variables the same to look at only the GPU as the variable.\nTest Bench Key Specs\n\nAMD Genoa-X 9684X\n8 x 64GB Kingston DDR5-5600\nSolidigm P41 Plus (21x 1TB)\nSolidigm P5430 15.36TB\nWindows Server 2022\nNVIDIA Production Branch Driver 537.58\n\n\nSPECviewperf2020\nThe SPECviewperf 2020 benchmark is the worldwide standard for measuring professional applications\u2019 graphics performance under the OpenGL and Direct X application programming interfaces. The viewsets (or benchmarks) represent graphics content and behavior from actual applications without having to install the applications themselves. These viewsets include 3D Max, CATIA, Creo, Energy, Maya, Medical, Siemens NX, and Solidworks. Higher numbers are better.\nThe RTX 6000 ADA tops the scores of the A6000 up to 2x in some of these tests, but others stay a little closer together.\n\n\n\nViewsets\nNVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada\nNVIDIA RTX A6000\n\n\n3dsmax-07\n208.75\n137.15\n\n\nCatia-06\n129.27\n101.31\n\n\nCreo-03\n176.18\n141.58\n\n\nEnergy-03\n88.62\n43.1\n\n\nMaya-06\n529.54\n341.36\n\n\nMedical-03\n131.12\n68.33\n\n\nSnx-04\n928.91\nNA\n\n\nSolidworks-05\n291.22\n168.18\n\n\n\nESRI\nNext up is the Environmental Systems Research Institute (Esri) benchmark. Esri is a supplier of Geographic Information System (GIS) software. Esri\u2019s Performance Team designed their PerfTool add-in scripts to launch the ArcGIS Pro automatically. This application uses a \u201cZoomToBookmarks\u201d function to browse various predefined bookmarks and create a log file with all the key data points required to predict the user experience. The script automatically loops the bookmarks three times to account for caching (memory and disk cache). In other words, this benchmark simulates heavy graphical use that one might see through Esri\u2019s ArcGIS Pro software.\nThe tests consist of three main datasets. Two are 3-D city views of Philadelphia, PA, and Montreal, QC. These city views contain textured 3-D multipatch buildings draped on a terrain model and draped aerial images. The third dataset is a 2-D map view of the Portland, OR region. This data contains detailed information for roads, land use parcels, parks and schools, rivers, lakes, and hill-shaded terrain.\nThe Montreal animation is first.

With that in mind we leveraged our Quarch IEC Mains Power Analysis Module. Here we measured base system power draw at idle, and then loading the card up with Luxmark for the under load measurement. Across both idle and load, the new RTX 6000 has a measurable power savings, which is impressive given the significant performance increase the card offers.\n\n\n\nSystem Power Draw\nNVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada\nNVIDIA RTX A6000\n\n\nIdle\n255.1W\n262.9W\n\n\nLoad\n552.5W\n567.1W\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada isn\u2019t just a successor to the RTX A6000 workstation GPU; it\u2019s a comprehensive overhaul. The spec sheet and physical resemblance might suggest incremental improvements, but make no mistake: this GPU has metamorphosed the game. Even better, it delivers this massive performance jump in the same power envelope, delivering more performance per watt over the A6000.\n\nThe NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada doesn\u2019t merely inherit the title of \u2018Best Workstation GPU\u2019; it earns it with astounding performance metrics and a forward-looking architecture. The RTX A6000 has officially passed the torch, and the RTX 6000 Ada holds it high making it a clear selection for our \u201cBest of 2023\u201d recognition.\n\nEngage with StorageReview\nNewsletter\u00a0|\u00a0YouTube\u00a0| Podcast\u00a0iTunes/Spotify\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter\u00a0|\u00a0TikTok\u00a0|\u00a0RSS Feed\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \nFacebookTwitterPinterestEmail \n\n\n\n \n\nJordan Ranous\nAI Specialist; navigating you through the world of Enterprise AI.

However, don\u2019t let it chase you from the markets. Instead, as Warren Buffett says, be \u201cgreedy when others are fearful,\u201d and consider these top stocks to buy on the dip.\nOr, as he explained at an\u00a0annual shareholder meeting: \u201cDuring such scary periods, you should never forget two things: First, widespread fear is your friend as an investor because it serves up bargain purchases. Second, personal fear is your enemy. It will also be unwarranted,\u201d as quoted by MarketWatch.\nIn short, while others run scared, consider top stocks to buy on the dip.\nNvidia (NVDA)\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\nWeakness has become an opportunity in\u00a0Nvidia\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA). After running from about $150 to $500 this year, Nvidia pulled back to about $405 thanks to the broad market pullback, but now it\u2019s one of the premium stocks to buy on the dip. \nNow oversold on relative strength, MACD and Williams\u2019 %R I\u2019d like to see the tech giant retest $500 again shortly. Longer-term, NVDA is a $600 stock.\nBetter, earnings went through the roof.\u00a0Adjusted EPS of $2.70 a share\u00a0came in above expectations for $2.08. Revenue jumped 101% year over year to $13.5 billion, which was also above expectations for $11.2 billion. \nFor the current quarter, the company expects to see revenue of about $16 billion, which is also ahead of expectations. NVDA also announced plans to buyback $25 billion in stock.\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY)\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\nMany times, when\u00a0Occidental Petroleum\u00a0(NYSE:OXY) dips, Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway will buy so consider this one of the best Buffet stocks to buy on the dip. \nIn fact, the firm just bought another\u00a03.9 million shares, increasing its stake to 228 million shares, which is worth about $14.5 billion. That now gives Buffett a 25.8% stake in Occidental Petroleum.\n\u201cBuffett probably isn\u2019t done building his stake in the company, given that Berkshire Hathaway has received the green light from regulators\u00a0to own up to 50% of the company,\u201d\u00a0as noted by Business Insider.\nMicroStrategy (MSTR)\nSource: DCStockPhotography / Shutterstock.com\nIn hopes of a Bitcoin ETF, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) is back up to $34,700. And as long as BTC can continue to rocket higher, MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) will follow. \nIn fact, from a current price of $406.76, I\u2019d like to see MSTR test $500 again near-term. It\u2019s another of the top stocks to buy on the dip. That\u2019s because MSTR now owns about $4.68 billion worth of Bitcoin. So, the higher the value of BTC, the higher the potential value of MSTR.\u00a0\nAccording to CoinDesk.com, \u201cMicroStrategy now holds approximately 158,245 BTC, which were acquired at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4.68 billion at an average purchase price of roughly $29,582 per bitcoin.\nTake-Two Interactive (TTWO)\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\nTake-Two Interactive\u00a0(NASDAQ:TTWO) is another of the stocks to buy on the dip, especially as the company nears the release of its hotly anticipated\u00a0Grand Theft Auto VI. \nEven before its release,\u00a0analysts believe it could see at least $1 billion at launch, and sell around 25 million copies initially.\u00a0\n\u201cIn fiscal 2025, we expect to enter this new era by launching several groundbreaking titles that we believe will set new standards in our industry and enable us to achieve over $8 billion in net bookings and over $1 billion in adjusted unrestricted operating cashflow,\u201d\u00a0said company CEO Strauss Zelnick.\nAnalysts like TTWO here, too. JP Morgan, for example, just raised its price target on the stock to $165 from $162, with an overweight rating. The firm noted, \u201cThe company\u2019s fiscal 2025 guidance for $8B-plus in bookings implies a substantial ramp-up in content before March 2025.\u201d\nAmazon (AMZN)\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\nEven\u00a0Amazon\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) should be bought on every dip \u2013 especially ahead of the 2023 holidays. According to\u00a0Adobe\u00a0(NASDAQ:ADBE), online holiday sales are expected to reach\u00a0$228.1 billion this year, a 4.8% jump year over year.\u00a0\nThe report also estimates that about 51% of online spending will be done on mobile devices, as well. In addition, according to Deloitte,\u00a0e-commerce sales will rise between 10.3% and 12.8%\u00a0this year. All of which is solid news for companies like Amazon.\nAnalysts at DA Davidson just raised their price target on AMZN to $157 from $150. Truist also raised its target to $176. Evercore ISI also raised its target to $195 from $190. All after AMZN posted solid earnings. EPS came in at\u00a094 cents, as compared to expectations for 58 cents. Revenue of $143.1 billion was also above expectations for $141.4 billion.\nWhile Amazon Web Services slightly missed expectations for $23.2 billion, with a print of $23.1 billion,\u00a0CEO Andy Jassy is optimistic, especially with generative artificial intelligence likely to drive billions of dollars of revenue to it.\u00a0\nAgree Realty (ADC)\nSource: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock\nAgree Realty\u00a0(NYSE:ADC)\u00a0is a beaten-down real estate investment trust trading at a 52-week low. Not only does it currently yield 5.46%, but some of its top clients are its high-grade tenants, including\u00a0AutoZone(NYSE:AZO),\u00a0Costco\u00a0(NASDAQ:COST),\u00a0Home Depot\u00a0(NYSE:HD),\u00a0Target\u00a0(NYSE:TGT),\u00a0and\u00a0McDonald\u2019s\u00a0(NYSE:MCD), for example.\u00a0\nAs of June, the company\u2019s portfolio consisted of 2,004 properties located in 49 states and contained approximately 41.7 million square feet of gross leasable area. Insiders are also buying. \nBoard member John Rakolta bought about 30,000 shares for just under $1.9 million, as I\u00a0also noted on Oct. 1. CEO Joey Agree bought 10,000 shares. Executive chairman and founder Richard Agree bought about 11,751 shares for just under $740,000.\nPlus, consider this. The\u00a0REIT owns retail properties that secured by triple net leases, where the tenant pays the property expenses such as real estate taxes, building insurance, and maintenance. All in addition to rent and utilities. \nIn addition, with properties leased to\u00a0grocery, home improvement, dollar stores, and drug stores, it\u2019s less susceptible to recession.\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)\nSource: Maxx-Studio/ShutterStock.com\nOr, if you want to diversify at a low cost, consider a beaten-down exchange-traded fund like the\u00a0Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund\u00a0(NYSEARCA:XLK),\u00a0especially with the artificial intelligence and machine learning booms in their infancy. \nWith an expense ratio of 0.10%, the ETF tracks the\u00a0price and yield performance of the Technology Select Sector Index.\nAfter dropping from about $172.50 to $161.12, the XLK ETF appears to have caught strong support again. From here, I\u2019d like to see it rally back to $177.50.\nI should also note the XLK ETF is technically oversold on RSI, MACD, and Williams\u2019 %R. The last time it was this oversold, it bounced from about $160 to a high of $172.83.\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

As the world ventures into 2024, three AI stocks promise exciting opportunities and transformative forces that will shape industries and redefine possibilities. Having said that, there are some game-changing AI stocks that you should consider adding to your portfolio.\nThis article unveils the top on the AI market, where three distinct giants emerge from the crowd. It dives deep into the technologies, achievements and market dynamics that make the trio the forces to reckon with in the AI landscape.\nThe first stock, renowned for its hardware prowess, is the cornerstone of AI research and development. Its GPUs are the preferred choice for AI enthusiasts worldwide. With its advanced identity and access management solutions, the second boasts a rapidly growing customer base and a knack for delivering exceptional value. Meanwhile, the third is setting benchmarks in AI infrastructure and engineering innovations.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\nNvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) hardware leadership is a cornerstone of its rapid growth. The company\u2019s GPUs are purpose-built for accelerating deep learning workloads, making them the\u00a0preferred choice\u00a0for AI researchers and developers worldwide. \nNvidia\u2019s latest hardware, including the Hopper GPU, is designed to excel in training large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 and its successors. These LLMs are becoming indispensable across various industries, including healthcare, science and drug discovery.\nIn detail, Nvidia\u2019s hardware prowess extends across a diverse product portfolio. It ranges from power-efficient GPUs suitable for edge computing to high-performance GPUs that power data centers. This comprehensive hardware ecosystem allows Nvidia to cater to a broad spectrum of AI applications. It is ensuring the company\u2019s continued relevance as AI continues to evolve.\nOn the other hand, Nvidia\u2019s software stack is a critical pillar of its long-term success. The company provides a suite of software tools, which includes compilers, libraries and frameworks like TensorRT and CUDA. All of these are meticulously crafted to optimize AI workloads for Nvidia GPUs. Furthermore, Nvidia actively collaborates with open-source AI software projects like PyTorch\u00a0and PaxML, fostering an innovation ecosystem in AI development.\nOne of the distinguishing aspects of Nvidia\u2019s software ecosystem is its focus on continuous optimization and evolution. Nvidia capitalizes on AI workloads that are highly diverse and ever-changing, spanning from large language models to generative AI and other data science tasks.\nLastly, Nvidia\u2019s software team actively engages with AI companies, sharing expertise and optimizing different software stack layers. Therefore, this collaborative approach ensures that Nvidia\u2019s software remains at the forefront of AI technology.\nOkta (OKTA)\nSource: Shutterstock\nOkta (NASDAQ:OKTA) may benefit substantially from its core strengths in the identity and access management (IAM) space. \nTo begin with, Okta\u2019s ability to attract and retain a diverse range of customers is a vital component of its long-term value creation. Okta added\u00a0350 new customers in the last quarter alone, expanding its customer base to more than 18,400\u2014an impressive 12% growth. This customer base growth demonstrates Okta\u2019s appeal across various industries and signifies the increasing demand for advanced IAM solutions.\nFurthermore, Okta\u2019s success in expanding its product portfolio within its existing customer base indicates its commitment to delivering value. The case of Ryder Truck Rentals, a long-time Okta customer, showcases Okta\u2019s capacity to upsell. Ryder leveraged the Okta Workforce Identity Cloud and adopted Okta Identity Governance (OIG) to replace its legacy identity governance provider.\n This upsell significantly improves the onboarding experience for Ryder\u2019s new employees while simultaneously reducing operational costs. The data-driven approach here indicates that Okta can adapt its solutions to the evolving needs of its clients, enhancing their operational efficiency while ensuring security and compliance.\nFinally, Okta\u2019s growing presence in the high-value customer segment, with contracts exceeding $1 million in annual contract value (ACV), is a pivotal driver of its growth. Q2 fiscal 2024 marked one of Okta\u2019s strongest quarters in the $1 million-plus ACV category, highlighting the trust large enterprises place in Okta\u2019s solutions. Okta easily earns its spot on our list of game-changing AI stocks.\u00a0\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI)\nSource: Shutterstock\nSuper Micro Computer\u2019s (NASDAQ:SMCI) performance is a robust indicator of its prospects. In the recently reported fiscal year, the company achieved annual revenue with an impressive\u00a037% YoY\u00a0growth rate. Similarly, the company\u2019s financial prowess extends to its quarterly results, where it reached a landmark figure in revenue, marking 34% YoY growth and a staggering 70% QoQ surge.\nFurthermore, Super Micro Computer\u2019s non-GAAP earnings per share witnessed remarkable growth, increasing by 109% YoY. This significant growth, compared to $5.65 in the previous year, exceeded the higher end of the revised guidance range and signifies the company\u2019s substantial operating leverage and continued customer preference for its rack-scale Total IT Solutions. These figures consistently exceeded the company\u2019s guidance, demonstrating its solid top- and bottom-line performance.\nOne of Super Micro Computer\u2019s standout strengths lies in its leadership in AI infrastructure. The company\u2019s AI platforms, focusing on the Nvidia HGX-based Delta Next solution, have gained significant traction in the market. These platforms are designed to meet the demands of LLMs, making them well-suited for rapidly growing AI applications.\nThe company\u2019s comprehensive suite of products, including Delta-Next, Redstone-Next, and eight-GPU OVX systems, has set industry benchmarks for excellence. Super Micro Computer has also gained significant traction with solutions from other industry leaders like Intel\u2019s (NASDAQ:INTC) Gaudi 2, PVC and AMD\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMD)\u00a0MI-250\u00a0accelerator solutions.\nFinally, the company\u2019s engineering capabilities play a pivotal role in promptly delivering optimized AI products and solutions.

However, despite this strong 2023 performance, caution is likely warranted going forward for two key reasons. I\u2019m neutral on PP based on its heavy concentration risk and its sky-high fees.\u00a0\nWhat is the PP ETF\u2019s Investment Process?\nPP is an actively-managed ETF that seeks to achieve long-term capital appreciation by investing in what it calls U.S.-listed \u201cinnovative companies,\u201d according to mketf.com.\u00a0\nThe fund manager defines these innovative companies as those that are \u201cinvolved in the development of new products or services, technological advancements, consumer engagement, and/or disruptive approaches with respect to business growth that the Sub-Adviser expects to have a significant impact on the market or industry in which the company operates.\u201d\u00a0\nPP will then invest in \u201cInnovative Companies that, in Kevin\u2019s view, also have more \u2018pricing power\u2019 than their peers.\u201d Meet Kevin (the fund manager) defines pricing power as the \u201cability to potentially increase prices for products and services without a corresponding drop in demand.\u201d\nTo select the innovative companies that the fund will invest in, Kevin then screens an \u201cextremely large initial universe of U.S.-listed companies with a minimum market capitalization of $100 million utilizing a proprietary screening methodology. Then, Kevin analyzes the remaining initial universe of companies to identify those innovative companies that Kevin perceives as having pricing power versus their peers.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\t\n\n\nThese are all good traits to look for when investing in a company, but this approach also leaves quite a bit up to the discretion of the fund manager. \nAt this point, it might be a good time to take a quick detour and ask, who is the eponymous \u201cKevin\u201d of the Meet Kevin Pricing Power ETF?\u00a0\nWho is Kevin?\nThe Kevin of \u201cMeet Kevin\u201d is Kevin Pathraff, a popular YouTube personality with nearly 1.9 million subscribers. He describes himself as a licensed financial advisor and real estate broker, and he is also a commentator on topics including finance, politics, and news. He is perhaps best known as a real estate investor whom Curbed described as a \u201clandlord influencer.\u201d \nHe also ran as a Democrat to replace California governor Gavin Newsome during the 2021 gubernatorial recall election, where he won 9.6% of the vote but ultimately came up short.\u00a0\nMeet Kevin\u2019s Holdings\nOne key reason for caution with the PP ETF is that there is quite a bit of concentration risk here. The fund holds just 16 positions, and its top 10 holdings make up 85.8% of the fund.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\n\nBelow, you\u2019ll find an overview of PP\u2019s top 10 holdings using TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\u00a0\n\nPerhaps most concerning, top holding Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) makes up a quarter of the fund\u2019s assets. This has been a great thing for PP investors this year, as shares of Tesla surged and took the price of PP with it, but Tesla is a volatile stock, and this outsized position in the firm can lead to a lot of downside for PP investors if Tesla slumps.\nSimilarly, PP also has fairly large positions in both Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) of 13.4% and 10.0%, respectively, meaning that nearly 50% of the fund\u2019s assets are in just these three stocks. \nFurthermore, many of these holdings are what you could call priced for perfection. For instance, Tesla trades at 63.7 times earnings, while Nvidia trades at nearly 100 times earnings. Other top holdings like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) trade for 35.1 times earnings and 261 times earnings (53.8 times forward earnings), respectively. When stocks trade with valuations this high, they can go down quickly when things go wrong.\u00a0\nPart of the reason that investors use ETFs is to gain diversified exposure to specific sectors of the economy or large swaths of the stock market, which helps to limit downside risk, but you aren\u2019t going to benefit from that in a fund with this much concentration in just a handful of stocks.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\n\nSky-High Expense Ratio\nThe other reason for caution with the PP ETF is its strikingly high expense ratio of 0.77%.\u00a0\nAn expense ratio of 0.77% means that an investor allocating $10,000 into this fund will pay $77 in fees in year one, which is pretty steep. But that\u2019s nothing compared to how these fees can compound over time. Assuming the fund returns 5% per year going forward and keeps this expense ratio, this same investor will pay $246 in fees over the course of three years.\u00a0Over the course of 10 years, the investor would pay $1,155 in fees, meaning that well over 10% of their initial investment would be eaten up by fees. \nIs PP Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\nTurning to Wall Street, PP earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 12 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average PP stock price target of $28.36 implies 39.1% upside potential.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\nPP is a unique ETF with an interesting strategic focus, and I\u2019ll give the fund credit for that. It\u2019s also done very well for its holders year-to-date, and its active manager picked some strong winners this year, which it also deserves credit for. However, I\u2019m also concerned about the fund\u2019s high level of concentration in just a small number of expensive stocks, which could see these year-to-date gains quickly go in the other direction (as they have recently) if disproportionately large positions like Tesla or Nvidia struggle.\u00a0\nThe ETF\u2019s expense ratio of 0.77% is also quite high. In fairness, PP is an actively-managed ETF, so it\u2019s natural that its expenses are going to be higher than those of an index fund. However, this is still a lot to pay for a new ETF that is yet to establish much of a long-term track record, or really any ETF for that matter.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\n\nYou can alternatively invest in ETFs like the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) or the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLK) that give you exposure to the same stocks like Tesla and Nvidia for a fraction of the price. QQQ\u2019s expense ratio is 0.20%, while XLK\u2019s is just 0.10%. Plus, these funds have built up strong track records of consistent success over many years, whereas PP has not been around for long enough to do this, having launched in November 2022. \nThe ETF is certainly an interesting one, but for these reasons, as they say on Shark Tank, \u201cI\u2019m out.\u201d\u00a0\nDisclosure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\n\n\n FACEBOOK\n\n\n\n\n TWITTER\n\n\n\n\n EMAIL\n\n\n\n\n COPY LINK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tStart Trading Futures\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n\n\n\n\nAMD\n\n\n\n103.88\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-0.71 (-0.68%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t03:21:05 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time AMD charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENPH\n\n\n\n61.36\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-2.44 (-3.82%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t03:21:03 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time ENPH charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA\n\n\n\n116.86\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-2.67 (-2.23%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t03:21:06 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time NVDA charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTSLA\n\n\n\n227.00\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-11.01 (-4.63%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t03:21:06 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time TSLA charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTTD\n\n\n\n54.36\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-2.14 (-3.79%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t03:21:00 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time TTD charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMORE \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFind News\n\t\t\t\tNews\n\n\n\n\n\nGO\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n            See also:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                - Explore more categories\n            \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

The low since then was reached in October of last year. With the S&P 500 firmly in this trading range, I decided to look at what option buyers are focusing on.\nI will be using our buy-to-open option volume data, which is aggregated from three different exchanges and only considers options that were initiated by buyers. This means that it excludes closing volume and option selling. This data is more likely to represent straight speculation, which provides a better gauge of investor sentiment.\nCall Buying Falls off a Cliff\nThe chart below shows the SPX, along with the ratio of buy-to-open (BTO) call volume on SPX stocks to put volume over the past 63 trading days (three months). The ratio has fallen sharply recently and is low relative to the data since 2016. Ratios can fall because of a drop in the numerator (less calls) or an increase in the denominator (more puts). Let\u2019s see what\u2019s driving the ratio.\n\nCall buying spiked during the rally from May through August, but as stocks cooled, the call buying was less fervent. Put buying has not been nearly as volatile as call buying, but it\u2019s been trending higher and near its highest levels since 2016. In this case, the ratio has dropped because of both a fall in call buying and a rise in put buying.\n\nOptions Trends Breakdowns Sector-by-Sector\nFinally, here is a look at how option buyers have been treating specific sectors. The table below shows the top 20 sectors by BTO volume. It shows the average BTO call/put ratio since 2016 as a benchmark. Then I will show the ratio for the past three months. The last column is a ratio of the current BTO ratio to the average historical ratio. A value above one means more call buyers now relative to put buyers compared to the past. A value below one means there\u2019s currently more put buyers relative to call buyers when compared to the past.\nThe wide-ranging technology hardware sector has the highest volume, including heavy-hitter, household name stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The call/put ratio for this sector has typically been about 1.94 since 2016 but is currently at 1.40. This is similar to the overall numbers in the chart, which makes sense given that it is the sector with the most volume.\nRetail is the first sector that is different from the others. Call buyers are more prevalent now than in the past, which is different from stocks overall. The last sector I\u2019ll point out is pharmaceutical stocks, which have typically seen over two calls bought for every put going back to 2016. But over the past three months, option buyers have bought more puts than calls. So, overall, option buyers seem less bullish now than usual. They are especially less bullish on pharmaceutical companies. Retailing is one sector option buyers look to be bullish on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow @Schaeffers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhich of These SUB-$5 Stocks Could 26x From Here?\u00a0(AD)\nHe called a rare 11x on Tesla\u2026\nThen he called a 26x on Workhorse\u2026\nThen an even rarer 35x on Nio Inc\u2026\nNow Tim Bohen says these 5 tiny \u201cAmerica First\u201d stocks are next up in 2025.\nThey\u2019re trading for less than $5 right now.\nBut thanks to Elon & Trump\u2019s new alliance\u2026\nThey could be off to the races in Trump\u2019s first 100 days.\nAnd right now for a limited time\u2026\nYou can get the names & tickers for just $1 here.\u00a0(AD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFeatured Articles from Trusted Partners:\n\ud83d\ude80 One Stock Pick Could Change Everything in 2025\nWhat if one stock pick could define your success next year?

But as much as I want to recommend AMD GPUs and make people join Team Red, I keep bringing Nvidia back to the conversation as it continues to dominate in certain key areas, allowing gamers to have a better overall experience. Even in 2023, when the gap between AMD and Nvidia GPUs is narrower than ever, there are some legitimate reasons to stick with Nvidia. Allow me to highlight a few of them below. \n1 \n\n                            More raw performance\n                    \n\nNvidia has the most powerful graphics card on the market right now in the form of the GeForce RTX 4090. We called it \"The untouchable king of performance\" in our review, and it still holds true to this day. There's simply nothing in the name of competition for the RTX 4090 from AMD at the moment, and it remains to be seen if that changes anytime soon. The Radeon RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 XTX are both excellent GPUs, but they're not even competing for the same piece of the pie and only go head to head with the RTX 4080.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf like me, you're chasing the best performance to run all modern AAA titles at high-resolutions, then you simply can't go wrong with Nvidia. That may not be true as you move down the ladder to look at something like the RTX 4070 or lower that's in a weaker spot due to lower price-to-performance ratio, but that's where Nvidia's DLSS upscaling technology enters the scene, once again turning the tide in favor of Nvidia. DLSS upscaling is currently at its best, and that brings me to my next point. \n2 \n\n                            Nvidia is winning the upscaling battle\n                    \n\nGaming at native resolution is slowly becoming a thing of the past as almost all new games support resolution upscaling technologies like DLSS and FSR. While FSR has also matured alongside AMD GPUs over the years, it still trails behind Nvidia's upscaling tech. Nvidia's DLSS 3, in particular, is nothing less than \"Unicorn Magic\" as I like to put it, because of how much of an improvement it offers over the previous versions to deliver a massive boost in frame rates. It does all that while maintaining a good overall image quality that looks closer to native resolution. I honestly can't remember the last time I played a game at its native resolution besides benchmarking and testing new hardware, because that's how good Nvidia's upscaling is at maintaining visual fidelity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotably, the Ray Reconstruction feature introduced with the new DLSS 3.5 makes ray tracing more realistic than ever. It goes hand-in-hand with Nvidia's DLSS Frame Generation feature to deliver an excellent experience, and it's one of those things which you simply can't experience with an AMD GPU. AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR and FSR 2.0) also have a lot of good things going for them, but they're both at least a generation behind what Nvidia has managed to achieve with DLSS in 2023. Yes, AMD has introduced FSR 3.0 with the goodness of frame generation, but it's limited to only two titles at the moment, neither of which has been a great showcase of the tech so far. Besides that, FSR 3.0 isn't an AMD-exclusive feature, and you can use it with any GeForce RTX 20-series GPU and above. \n3 \n\n                            Improving the experience with features like Ray Reconstruction\n                    \n\nContinuing on the topic of ray tracing, I'd like to highlight how Nvidia's Ray Reconstruction has been a game changer (quite literally) in shaping my experience of playing Cyberpunk 2077. It's essentially a feature that takes ray tracing to new heights, simulating realistic shadows, reflections, and more, to improve the overall visual fidelity. Without getting into too many details, it's safe to say that Nvidia's Ray Reconstruction is both smarter than hand-tuned Denoisers and also generates better lighting effects, meaning you get clearer, higher-quality ray traced reflection and shadows while gaming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Nvidia\n\nTitles like Cyberpunk 2077 running at RT Overdrive mode can be extremely taxing on your GPU, but that's where Nvidia's other helpful technologies like Frame Generation comes into the picture. The fact that I can play Cyberpunk 2077 with Psycho graphics mode (max settings), complete with Path Tracing on an RTX 4070 Ti-enabled rig with high frame rates on the board goes to show how capable and useful these technologies are. I say that because the same title with exact same graphics settings without any upscaling doesn't run nearly as smooth as it does with everything enabled on this rig. All these features are exclusive to Nvidia GPUs at the moment, once again making them a better choice. I am sure AMD is well aware of improvements Nvidia has made to shape the overall gaming experience, but it doesn't have much to showcase at the moment. I can only see DLSS getting better from here on out, and I hope AMD's FSR 3.0 evolves into something better and is supported by more titles. \n            Closing thoughts\n    \nAMD's older graphics cards weren't nearly as popular the ones it has on the market right now, and they're indeed very easy to recommend in 2023. That being said, it's also hard to ignore how Nvidia continues to dominate the space by building on its strength, especially now with all the AI and machine learning advancements. Nvidia also has an upper hand with its Reflex tech to reduce latency while gaming, and I also like how Nvidia has more partners pumping out better and more ambitious GPUs with crazy design and heatsinks, unlocking more performance.\nI am optimistic about the future of Team Red, especially after looking at the current lineup of AMD GPUs on the market, and its increasing effort to catch up with Nvidia's upscaling technologies. I honestly can't wait to see what AMD has in store for us over the next few years, but I personally don't see myself turning away from Nvidia, at least until things starts falling into place for AMD. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nAMD\n\n\n\n\nGPU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support XDA.

Analyst Cuts Price Target By $100 On More China Chip Curbs But Sees Strong 2023 Finish\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenzinga\n\nOct. 20, 2023, 05:54 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmidst broader market fluctuations in August and September, and concerns triggered by\u00a0fresh U.S. restrictions on chip sales\u00a0to China,\u00a0Nvidia Corp.\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) saw its shares pull back from their $500-plus highs. In anticipation of the upcoming semiconductor earnings season,\u00a0KeyBanc Capital Markets\u00a0analyst\u00a0John Vinh\u00a0shared his insights on what\u2019s ahead for Nvidia investors.\nRating Adjustment:\u00a0Vinh, who has an Overweight rating on Nvidia shares, cut the stock\u2019s price target from $750 to $650. The semiconductor giant is slated to unveil its third-quarter results after the market\u2019s close on Nov. 21.\nNvidia Thesis:\u00a0Vinh anticipates a marginal near-term effect on Nvidia from the updated U.S. export restrictions. He believes the company will manage to compensate with global demand and expects China to accelerate purchases ahead of the Nov. 15 implementation of the new export controls.\nHowever, to reflect the challenges posed by additional China restrictions, Vinh has lowered his fiscal year 2025 estimates for Nvidia. Historically, China has accounted for 20-25% of the company\u2019s data center revenue. \nHe suggests that the adverse effects from these export restrictions will likely be more pronounced in the latter half of next year, with revenue from Chinese data center sales expected to gravitate towards the lower end of the range.\n\t\t\n\n\nVinh\u2019s revised projections for 2025 include revenue and earnings per share figures of $96.8 billion and $20.84, respectively, down from his earlier forecast of $116 billion and $25.63. This adjustment informed his revised price target of $650, calculated with a valuation multiple of 31 times the estimated earnings for 2025.\nSee Also:\u00a0Best Semiconductor Stocks\nIn the latter half of the current fiscal year, Vinh expects Nvidia to benefit from increased Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) supply and strong demand for L40S, as well as a shift towards higher ASP H100 GPUs.\nHe also anticipates that Nvidia will surpass expectations in the third quarter and provide above-consensus guidance for the fourth quarter. KeyBanc\u2019s third-quarter estimates for Nvidia stand at $17 billion in revenue and earnings of $3.57 per share, compared to the consensus forecast of $16.9 billion in revenue and earnings of $3.35 per share.\n\u201cStreet sentiment on the name is cautiously positive, given its unique position in monetizing generative AI upsides, offset by LT concerns over the impact of the new export controls to China,\u201d Vinh noted.\n\t\t\n\n\nLooking ahead, investors are likely to focus on the long-term implications of the new China restrictions, as well as developments related to the H100 new L40S, initial insights into 2024, order visibility, and updates on CoWoS and the company\u2019s ability to meet demand.\nNvidia Price Action: Nvidia stock ended Thursday\u2019s session down 0.23% at $421.01, according to Benzinga Pro data. This marks a pullback from its all-time high of $502.66 hit in late August. In premarket trading on Friday, the stock rose 0.38% to $422.60.\nRead Next: Forget Gigafactories: Nvidia Teams Up With Big Apple Supplier To Build \u2018AI Factories\u2019 \u2014 Should Tesla Be Worried?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\n\n\n FACEBOOK\n\n\n\n\n TWITTER\n\n\n\n\n EMAIL\n\n\n\n\n COPY LINK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNVIDIA NewsMORE  \n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX PRO Comes to Workstations and Servers for Designers, Developers, Data Scientists and Creatives to Build and Collaborate With Agentic AIGlobeNewswire 19m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces DGX Spark and DGX Station Personal AI ComputersGlobeNewswire 22m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces Spectrum-X Photonics, Co-Packaged Optics Networking Switches to Scale AI Factories to Millions of GPUsGlobeNewswire 37m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell Ultra AI Factory Platform Paves Way for Age of AI ReasoningGlobeNewswire 47m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Dynamo Open-Source Library Accelerates and Scales AI Reasoning ModelsGlobeNewswire 1h \n\n\n\nNvidia GTC 2025: Rubin, reasoning, robotics and moreSeeking Alpha 1h \n\n\n\nGeneral Motors and NVIDIA Collaborate on AI for Next-Generation Vehicle Experience and ManufacturingGlobeNewswire 2h \n\n\n\nNVIDIA and Telecom Industry Leaders to Develop AI-Native Wireless Networks for 6GGlobeNewswire 2h \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tStart Trading Futures\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n\n\n\n\nNVDA\n\n\n\n116.41\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-3.12 (-2.61%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t03:12:55 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time NVDA charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFind News\n\t\t\t\tNews\n\n\n\n\n\nGO\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n            See also:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                - Explore more categories\n            \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Investment & Digital Content Specialistfor\u00a0Investor HubFollow AuthorOct 13, 2023, 03:47pm EDTUpdated Oct 13, 2023, 03:47pm EDTShareSaveCommentWhen it comes to AI, investors have more choices than just Nvidia and the MAMAA stocks. getty\nInvesting In Artificial Intelligence\nArtificial intelligence (AI), a non-mainstream concept up until 2021, is now the talk of the town. From the idea of basic automated tasks to extensive news coverage, AI is everywhere.\n\n\nAI has generated a phenomenal amount of interest over a short period of time. Google Trends data suggests the term \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d reached its peak popularity (100) between April 30 and May 6, 2023. On that same scale of 100, interest in AI currently stands at 78. This interest, coupled with AI\u2019s tremendous utility, has helped it garner massive investment, over recent years. Worldwide private investment in AI shot up from $48 billion in 2020 to more than $90 billion in 2021 and in 2022. Goldman Sachs research indicates there\u2019s potential to cross $110 billion in 2023.\n\nThe launch and growth of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT AI chatbot provides evidence. Launched in November 2022, ChatGPT set records in terms of the number of users. It\u2019s free, easy to use, versatile and its timing matched perfectly with the rising interest in AI. The tool just took a week from launch to cross above 100 million users. Compare that to TikTok, which took nine months to cross that number while Netflix\nNFLX\n had to wait for 3.5 years before it could boast more than 100 million users.\n\nLarge tech companies have been heavily investing in AI, while many new AI-focused start-ups have cropped up. According to an MIT study, about 92% of large companies are getting returns on their AI investments. The study highlighted the importance of using available AI tools, investing in complementary technology and creating a supportive infrastructure, as key for AI to lead to growth. Smaller AI-focused firms, due to limited resources, are often not able to put all this together. However, if they do, the risk and return numbers could both be substantially higher than any large firm foraying into AI.\n\nNvidia (NVDA), with its first-mover advantage, is a dominant leader in the AI semiconductor chips space. So much so that it is now being investigated for anti-competition abuses. You would find the company listed on almost every top AI stocks list on the web, with retail as well as institutional investors piling into the stock with both hands. NVDA has returned nearly 300% over the last 12 months. But a lot of these gains may be purely sentiment-driven so you may want to wait for the stock to start trading at more reasonable valuations. The AI picks from the MAMAA stocks (Meta Platforms, Amazon\nAMZN\n, Microsoft, Apple\nAAPL\n and Alphabet) also have high P/Es, with cloud giants Amazon, Microsoft\nMSFT\n and Google (GOOG), trading at forward P/E ratios of 60, 30 and 25, respectively. NVDA has a P/E of 110.\nIn this article, we look beyond Nvidia and MAMAA stocks, in search of more reasonable valuations. We identify three other AI stocks that investors can consider buying.\nFrom healthcare to retail, finance to education... AI is the catalyst for innovation across major industries. Ignite your portfolio\u2014get the names of the top companies driving the AI revolution in this exclusive Forbes report, 12 Top AI Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nAre AI Stocks Booming Now?\nAI stocks have been on the rise since March 2020. November 2021 marked a very visible peak in most AI stocks\u2019 price history so far. Third-quarter 2023 has been yet another good period for blue-chip AI stocks such as Nvidia, Microsoft, Advanced Micro Devices\nAMD\n , Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Amazon and Alphabet/Google (GOOGL). Year to date, these stocks are up about 220%, 37%, 68%, 21%, 49% and 54%, respectively. The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 index has gained about 13% over the same period.\nAI stocks definitely have had a good run so far in 2023. Nvidia, particularly\u2013powered by its first-mover advantage, investment and innovation into AI\u2013has been the forerunner of the surge in AI stocks. However, the supply shortage of AI chips globally remains a bottleneck. The number of companies using generative AI technology is increasing by the day, leading to increased demand for AI chips. However, supply chains of semiconductor chips continue to experience some strain. Tech behemoth Microsoft has now included GPU supply as a possible operational risk to its business in its latest annual report.\n3 Top AI Stocks Besides Nvidia & MAMAA \nNvidia manufactures and supplies more than 80% of the market for semiconductor chips that are needed to run AI applications. Nvidia and its investors have been reaping the benefits of the company having a dominant position in the AI economy so far.\nAs I mentioned, NVDA has delivered a whopping 220% return to its investors YTD and about 290% over the past one year. It currently trades at around $468 per share, not far from its 52-week high price of $503. The consensus price for the stock per analysts is currently set at about $643 indicating there could still be some scope for further gains in the stock. However, with Nvidia stock trading at an exuberant multiple (TTM P/E = 110) as compared to peers (sector median P/E of 25) and the broad market (P/E = 24), investors looking for an entry point may want to exercise some caution there.\nAnd while AI investors wait for NVDA stock to provide a better entry point, they would definitely want to know where else lies an opportunity. However, as AI continues to surge, investor FOMO (fear of missing out) is a given. So, we\u2019ve looked beyond Nvidia and the MAMAA stocks to identify three other AI stocks (at decent valuation) that investors may consider buying.\n1. Nice\nNICE\n \nKey Metrics\n\n\nMarket capitalization: $10.6 billion\nNICE stock price (as of 10/10/23 close): $163.40\n52-week range: $160.20 - $231.54\nForward P/E: 19.22\nEPS (Normalized): $2.15\nDividend Yield: NA\n\n\nIsrael-based global enterprise software provider Nice Ltd. is a strong and growing player in the AI and cloud space. It is a focused B2B SaaS company providing customer interaction solutions, and financial crime and compliance solutions.\nIt pioneered chatbots even before ChatGPT came into the limelight. Its CXone offers a best-in-class and complete cloud customer experience. Add to it, its Enlighten AI solutions that allow every customer interaction to be analyzed automatically and objectively allowing a seamless and more meaningful flow. Nice is an official Microsoft ISV Connect Partner and its customer engagement solutions are integrated with Amazon Connect's cloud-based contact center. These partnerships along with the company\u2019s continuous strive to innovate, indicate that the company should be able to maintain its current positive revenue and income trajectory. Restructuring its pricing model from per-user-based to usage-based should allow more fundamentals-driven growth to the company.\nExisting trends favoring more adoption and growth in AI and Cloud are likely to make NICE a long-term play. The current stock price trading near its 52-week low and at a P/E of just around 19.2, could be a great opportunity to enter a stock with positive long-term potential.\nFrom healthcare to retail, finance to education...

C3.ai (AI)\nKey Metrics\n\n\nMarket capitalization: $10.9 billion\nAI Stock price (as of 10/10/23): $26.72\n52-week range: $10.16 - $48.87\nForward P/E: NA\nEPS Normalized: -$0.18\nDividend Yield: NA\n\n\nCalifornia-based C3.ai (AI) is an artificial intelligence software provider that is accelerating digital transformations, globally, through its enterprise-scale AI applications. The company was founded in 2009 by billionaire businessman and technologist, Thomas Seibel. C3 is currently into its AI Platform, AI Applications and Generative AI. The advent and rapid growth of AI in its various forms bear testimony to the growth prospects this firm likely has.\nThe company\u2019s revenues from bookings are mainly (83%) driven by AI applications with defense and oil being major contributors in terms of industry. The company is looking for an industry mix more tilted towards defense, and less towards oil, going forward. C3 is also at the end of phase 1 of its transition to a consumption-based revenue model (from a subscription-based model). The company isn\u2019t profitable yet given the massive operating expenses it currently incurs being an early-stage firm. C3 continues to invest heavily in product development, including application development and enhancements. Consequently, R&D costs amount to about 75% of revenues, while selling general and administrative (SG&A) costs go up to 95% of revenues. However, the company has a strong balance sheet supported by solid underlying fundamentals and a robust net cash position.\nThis AI stock (pun intended!) has been on a tear gaining about 120% over the past year, and over 140% year to date. AI stock is currently trading about 45% below its 52-week-high of $48.87, which might seem to get C3 bulls interested. However, given the negative earnings as the company\u2019s efforts toward achieving profitability remain underway, conservative investors may want to wait and watch.\nIn all, C3.ai seems to be a high-risk, high-reward bet with the possibility of a short squeeze (with short interest at about 40%).\n3. Oracle\nORCL\n\nKey Metrics\n\n\nMarket capitalization: $302.2 billion\nORCL Stock price (as of 10/10/23): $109.71\n52-week range: $61.65 - $127.54\nForward P/E: 19.87\nEPS Normalized: $1.32\nDividend Yield: 1.45%\n\n\nThis 45-year-old tech veteran needs no introduction. Since 1977, Oracle (ORCL) has come a long way and has more than $300 billion in market capitalization now. Oracle\u2019s SaaS offering along with OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) are the two main pillars on which this empire stands. The company has been increasingly fueling its OCI offering with emerging AI applications, providing a boost to demand.\nAt its recent Oracle CloudWorld 2023, the company showcased its latest innovations including AI on OCI and the use of generative AI to differentiate their Fusion, NetSuite, and other applications. ORCL now offers generative AI solutions in a range of industries from healthcare to customer service. \u201cAI development companies have signed contracts to purchase more than $4 billion of AI training capacity in Oracle's Generation 2 cloud. That's twice as much AI training as we had booked at the end of the last Q4,\u201d revealed the company\u2019s CTO and founder Larry Ellison in ORCL\u2019s September earnings call.\nOracle-Cohere\u2019s generative AI differs from the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership in that it also offers sentiment analysis which also determines feelings and opinions behind the text. The technology at Oracle is also capable of providing more contextually relevant answers that are more specific to an industry or organization.\nOracle is the fourth largest cloud vendor in the U.S. after Amazon, Microsoft and Google. And while AMZN, MSFT and GOOGL trade at forward price multiples of 60, 30 and 25, respectively, ORCL stock can be bought at a much more favorable P/E around 20 as markets take their time to realize Oracle\u2019s AI potential. The stock trades at about $110 and analysts' consensus price for the stock is currently set at $$127.96.\nArtificial Intelligence ETFs\nWhile these are our top three stock picks from the AI stocks universe (beyond NVDA and MAMAA), investors who prefer to gain a more diversified exposure to the booming artificial intelligence industry may consider the following exchange-traded funds:\nGlobal X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF \nBOTZ\n\n\n\nAUM: $2.1 billion\nExpense ratio: 0.69%\n\n\nFirst Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence & Robotics ETF \nROBT\n\n\n\nAUM: $410 million\nExpense ratio = 0.65%\n\n\nMethodology Used \nGiven the inflated valuations that Nvidia and the AI stocks from MAMAA are trading at, we are highlighting three other top AI stocks in this article. In selecting these, we filtered out companies, whose businesses could benefit greatly from AI. We\u2019ve then looked at the fundamental strength of the business and if there are catalysts in place to drive future growth. We also looked at forward valuation multiples to narrow down the list to stocks that may be offering a good point of entry for investors. Given negative earnings currently, the earnings multiple for C3.ai cannot be determined but the stock\u2019s strong focus on AI makes it a great pick for those with the capacity to take on the risk.\nBottom Line\nTargeted investments such as in AI stocks always carry higher risk than other mature industries and broader investments such as the market benchmark, the S&P 500. Nonetheless, the robust and increasing demand for AI and the market potential lying ahead are undeniable. There definitely is a strong case for an investment in AI stocks being worthy of the risk. Going with selective AI stocks (such as the ones highlighted above) or diversified ETFs may help limit one\u2019s risk.\nWhat To Read Next\n\n\nIs Coinbase Stock A Buy After Bitcoin ETF Ruling?\nBest Technology Stocks To Buy For The Long Term\nBest Bonds For Income\n\n\nFrom healthcare to retail, finance to education...

The objective is to obtain daily leveraged exposure equivalent to -200% of the fund's net assets. To maintain this exposure, daily rebalancing is performed to make adjustments in response to NVDA's daily price movements. As a geared product, the fund is intended as a short-term tactical tool, rather than as a long-term investment vehicle. As a result, returns may deviate from the expected -2x if held for longer than a single day due to compounding. This strategy is high-risk and does not include a defensive position as part of its overall process. It's important to note that the fund could potentially lose money over time, even if NVDA's performance weakens. The fund is expected to invest in money market funds, deposit accounts, and short-term debts.Show moreClassification\ufeffAsset ClassEquityCategorySectorFocusInformation technologyNicheSemiconductorsStrategyVanillaGeographyU.S.Weighting schemeSingle assetSelection criteriaSingle assetNVDQ analysis\ufeff\ufeffWhat's in the fundExposure typeBonds, Cash & OtherMiscellaneousCashBonds, Cash & Other100.00%Miscellaneous65.44%Cash34.56%NVDQ news\ufeff\ufeffKeep readingTechnicals\ufeff\ufeffSummarizing what the indicators are suggesting.OscillatorsNeutralSellBuyStrong sellStrong buyStrong sellSellNeutralBuyStrong buyOscillatorsNeutralSellBuyStrong sellStrong buyStrong sellSellNeutralBuyStrong buySummaryNeutralSellBuyStrong sellStrong buyStrong sellSellNeutralBuyStrong buySummaryNeutralSellBuyStrong sellStrong buyStrong sellSellNeutralBuyStrong buySummaryNeutralSellBuyStrong sellStrong buyStrong sellSellNeutralBuyStrong buyMoving AveragesNeutralSellBuyStrong sellStrong buyStrong sellSellNeutralBuyStrong buyMoving AveragesNeutralSellBuyStrong sellStrong buyStrong sellSellNeutralBuyStrong buySeasonals\ufeff\ufeffDisplays a symbol's price movements over previous years to identify recurring trends.Related funds\ufeffBroaden your horizons with more funds linked to NVDQ via country, focus, and more.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLove in every\n#TradingView100M+Traders and investors use our platform.#1Top website in the world when it comes to all things investing.1.5M+Mobile reviews with 4.9 average rating.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) investors have learned that the hard way this week. The semiconductor giant\u2019s stock has tumbled about 10% in the past five days due to concerns about President Joe Biden\u2019s crackdown on the sale of artificial intelligence chips to China. Nvidia is a leading player in the world of AI.\nAdding to the short-term pain for Nvidia? Analysts at Citi and Morgan Stanley both cut their cut price targets on the stock this week following the news about China. The two firms each previously had a price target of $630. Morgan Stanley lowered its to $600 while Citi dropped its forecast to $575. Morgan Stanley called the new White House restrictions \u201ca significant setback.\u201d\nBut are the growing economic and tech tensions between America and China just an excuse to take some Nvidia profits off the table? After all, Nvidia\u2019s stock is still up nearly 200% this year, a much bigger gain than rivals Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) as well as the broader Philadelphia Semiconductor Index and the Nasdaq.\nThe optimism about Nvidia, a company that is now worth more than $1 trillion, is warranted. Analysts expect the company\u2019s revenue to more than double this fiscal year (which ends in January 2024) and surge another 50% in the following year. Wall Street has steadily boosted its earnings forecasts for the company over the past few months. Nvidia is now expected to post earnings gains of nearly 80% a year over the next three to five years.\nDespite these amazingly strong fundamentals, the stock still trades at a reasonable valuation of about 25 times earnings estimates for Nvidia\u2019s next fiscal year.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that even though Citi and Morgan Stanley trimmed their price targets on Nvidia, they did not cut their ratings. Citi reiterated its \u201cbuy\u201d call on Nvidia while Morgan Stanley maintained its \u201coutperform\u201d recommendation on the stock.\nThe rest of Wall Street continues to be extremely bullish on Nvidia as well. According to TipRanks, 37 of the 38 analysts who cover the stock have it rated a \u201cbuy\u201d and the consensus price target for Nvidia is about $645.50\u2026 more than 50% above its current price.\n\nThe Bottom Line on NVDA Stock\nThe bottom line? Nvidia is a diversified company whose graphic processors are used in video games, for crypto mining and numerous other applications beyond artificial intelligence. Nvidia also generates just 20% of its overall revenue from China, including Hong Kong. That\u2019s obviously still a significant chunk of sales, but not enough to derail Nvidia\u2019s global dominance.\nInvestors should find out more about the impact of the frosty U.S.-China relations on Nvidia next month when the company reports earnings for its fiscal third quarter on Nov. 21. Nvidia easily topped consensus forecasts in its previous three quarters. So, buying the stock now before results are released could be a good bet.\nAs of this writing, Paul R.

For the believers, this year's outsize move in AI stocks is just a taste of things to come, given that we are still in the early innings of this technological sea change. For skeptics, today's huge growth in AI-related names amounts to a pull-forward of demand and a near-term bubble.\nBut if you're in the former camp, which I lean toward, then the August-to-September pullback presents an opportunity to get in on long-term AI winners after short-term traders have taken profits. Meanwhile, two of the biggest winners year to date are Nvidia (NVDA -2.53%) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI -7.44%). Having roughly tripled this year, both stocks have also pulled back 15.5% and 27.9%, respectively, from their recent all-time highs.\nFor those looking to get in on the AI megatrend, which is the better buy right now?\n\nNvidia's and Super Micro's AI advantages\nWhy have these two stocks been such AI winners? Because each has been building a business model optimized for AI computing not just this year, but actually over the course of the last couple of decades. So when the AI trend started taking off in earnest, both were in pole position to capitalize.\nFor Nvidia, its background was in high-end graphics chips for gamers. But in 2006, Jensen Huang and his team realized that GPUs could be programmed for general-purpose computing, ideal for massive workloads that needed to be processed in parallel. Thus, the company developed its CUDA software platform, allowing developers to use GPUs not just for graphics but also for high-performance computing.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, this year's gains are actually far from an \"overnight success\" but rather one nearly 20 years in the making.\nSimilarly, Super Micro Computer has long been pegged as a \"commodity\" server provider in a highly competitive, low-margin industry; however, it's more differentiated than many think. In fact, SMCI has been profitable every year since its founding in 1993. \nAs CEO Charles Liang explained in an interview just last week, Super Micro was founded and run in Silicon Valley, where costs are higher than for Asian original design manufacturers (ODMs). Therefore, SMCI had to differentiate, and it does so in three main ways.\nFirst, it developed a \"building block\" architecture for its servers, rather than mass-producing optimized models. By optimizing each server component at a more micro level, SMCI can mass-customize servers for specific applications and exacting customer requirements. Second, the company has been focused on energy-efficient designs and cooling systems for about two decades, long before it was fashionable. With AI solutions being incredibly power-hungry and heat-generative, SMCI's energy-efficient designs are also in demand with AI. And finally, SMCI's Silicon Valley presence enables a closer working relationship with Nvidia and other chipmakers, allowing Super Micro to often be first to market with the latest designs and solutions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nHow strong is the moat?\nNvidia has a strong head start in AI, but it is unclear if it will run away with the vast majority of AI chip spend. Certainly, its lead looks relatively safe for the next few quarters. However, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.73%) will be ramping up its MI300 AI chip soon, and Intel's (INTC 1.28%) Gaudi accelerators are already in use, with a leading-edge version called Falcon Shores set to hit the market in 2025. \nNvidia's CUDA software will make its lead difficult to overcome. But AMD, Intel, and the rest of Big Tech are also collaborating on building out open-source AI programming languages that can program not only Nvidia GPUs but also others. So while its lead is formidable, Nvidia has a lot of well-funded companies gunning for its hardware and software moats.\nMeanwhile, if one is already a higher-end standard-model server original equipment manufacturer such as Dell\u00a0or HP Enterprise, it will probably be somewhat difficult to copy Super Micro's building block modular solutions, as these high-end server providers would have to change their entire manufacturing architecture to do so. But Asian ODMs, which sell individual server components in \"white box\" solutions, may be able to compete in modular designs in the future. However, it will also be difficult, as most component ODMs don't do the kinds of optimized integration Super Micro does.\nSo looking two or three years out, it's possible competitors can catch up to Nvidia and Super Micro, if they invest and innovate aggressively. But both companies seem to have formidable moats for the next couple of years.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValuation based on AI growth\nObviously, Nvidia looks much more expensive than Super Micro, at 105 times earnings versus Super Micro's 23 P/E ratio.  But these trailing ratios don't tell us much, as the determinant of value will be related to each company's forward growth.\nOf note, AMD's Lisa Su recently forecast that AI accelerators will grow at a 50% annualized rate, from a $30 billion market recently to a $150 billion market by 2027. Meanwhile, back in May, research firm Trendforce estimated that AI server shipments would grow nearly 40% this year, then at a high-20% rate for the next three years through 2026. However, this is for shipments, not revenue. Given that AI-related servers are much more expensive than regular servers, revenue growth associated with shipments could be higher.\nAssuming a 50% compound annual growth rate for 2024 through 2026, both Nvidia and Super Micro look much cheaper than their trailing valuations suggest.\nNvidia made over $10 billion in data center revenue last quarter out of $13.5 billion in total revenue, and it has guided for $16 billion in total revenue next quarter. That seems to put it on pace for about $40 billion in data-center revenue in 2023. Assuming a 50% growth rate from 2024 through 2026, Nvidia's data-center revenue would reach $135 billion, with total revenue probably closer to $150 billion or so.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's non-GAAP net profit margin was a stunning 50% last quarter; assuming it can maintain that pace, Nvidia would be earning about $75 billion in 2026. If achieved, Nvidia trades at just 14.3 times that 2026 earnings projection today. \nMeanwhile, Super Micro earned 52% of revenue from AI systems last quarter, equating to $1.13 billion. Assuming continued growth, Super Micro is probably on track to make $4 billion in AI-related revenue in 2023 out of about $8 billion in total revenue. Assuming a 50% growth rate in AI servers and modest growth in non-AI servers, AI-related revenue would reach $13.5 billion in 2026 and total revenue would be around $18 billion. At a 10% net profit margin -- margins were 9% over the past 12 months -- Super Micro would be earning $1.8 billion in 2026. Today, Super Micro trades at just eight times that profit outlook. \nCan Nvidia and Super Micro do better than these figures?\nOf course, Nvidia typically gets a big premium today by virtue of its having a current monopoly on general-purpose AI GPUs, with an estimated 80% to 95% market share.\nMeanwhile, Super Micro has only an estimated 7% market share of the global server market, according to analysts at Barclays.  However, within the AI server market, analysts at Northland Capital recently estimated that Super Micro's market share jumped from 7% to 17% over the course of the June quarter -- a rather stunning improvement in a short time period.  The 50% of revenue from AI systems was also much higher than at its peers, who generally reported about 20% of revenue from AI systems last quarter. \n\n\n\n\n\nSo while Nvidia is looking strong today, it seems it may be easier for Super Micro to expand on its 17% AI market share than Nvidia will be able to expand on its 90% or so market share. And given that Super Micro can make servers for Nvidia, AMD, or Intel, it can still grow even if these challengers eventually make inroads.\nThe verdict\nI own Super Micro and not Nvidia. But if I had to buy one today, it would be a difficult choice. After all, Nvidia isn't that much more expensive based on these very rough 2026 projections.\nStill, I think will be an easier task for Super Micro to improve on its lower market share and expand its lower margin today than it will be more Nvidia to improve its already-high market share and margins. That's why even though Nvidia may have more proprietary AI technology and thus be the more essential AI company, Super Micro may actually be the better AI stock, given its lower valuation and prospects for improvement.\nAfter all, SMCI has actually outperformed Nvidia's stock this year. While both should continue to do well, I'd expect SMCI's stock to continue doing a tad better going forward. But I also wouldn't scoff at anyone picking Nvidia or owning both stocks for their high-growth AI plays.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBilly Duberstein has positions in Super Micro Computer and has the following options: short January 2025 $110 puts on Super Micro Computer, short January 2025 $125 puts on Super Micro Computer, short January 2025 $130 puts on Super Micro Computer, short January 2025 $280 calls on Super Micro Computer, short January 2025 $380 calls on Super Micro Computer, and short January 2025 $85 puts on Super Micro Computer.

The graphics chip giant is leading the AI revolution thanks to prescient investments in AI processing years before anyone was talking about ChatGPT. And that\u2019s translated into some huge wins for the company and investors. But Nvidia is just one company, and as the AI explosion continues to reverberate across the tech industry, major players ranging from Amazon (AMZN) to OpenAI and Microsoft (MSFT) to Meta (META) find themselves competing for all the chips Nvidia can pump out. And there are simply not enough. Now a new race between tech\u2019s biggest players is heating up, in which they\u2019re building their own AI chips that will give them the ability to outwit each other without having to rely so heavily on Nvidia.   \u201cNo one wants to be completely beholden to one company,\u201d TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O\u2019Donnell told Yahoo Finance. \u201cEverybody wants to have a variety of different options to purchase from again. And oh, by the way, there can be advantages if you start to write your own software and design your own chips to run things specifically for you.\u201d  On top of that, AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are building chips and platforms to rival Nvidia\u2019s and steal away customers and market share. But Nvidia isn\u2019t resting on its laurels. The company is already working on an upgraded version of its next-generation super-chip, the GH200, which it offers improved memory technology and will be available through manufacturing partners later next year. Nvidia's current most-advanced chip, the H100, sits in a 10.5-inch graphics card \u2014 which is then bundled together into a server rack alongside dozens of other H100 cards to create one massive computer. The GH100, meanwhile, combines an H100 chip with an Arm CPU and more memory. \u201cNvidia is synonymous with AI, just as much as if you ask for a tissue, what would you say? I want a Kleenex,\u201d explained Glenn O\u2019Donnell, VP and director at research firm Forrester. The numbers tell the story. In its most recent quarter, Nvidia's revenue jumped 101% to $13.5 billion, with data center revenue, the segment that includes AI sales, up a stunning 171% versus the same period a year ago.   Jensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., speaks during the Hon Hai Tech Day in Taipei on Oct.18, 2023. (I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images)  \u00b7 I-HWA CHENG via Getty Images \u201cIt has become the brand immediately associated with that world. And Intel, AMD, and some others actually do have some good technology to compete. But overcoming that mindshare and breaking into that expensive ecosystem that Nvidia has isn't going to be an easy thing to do,\u201d O\u2019Donnell added. And the company is increasingly creating the kind of foundational models that tech firms use to develop AI software, ensuring that its customers stick around well into the future.   Story Continues Customers are creating competitionStill, with demand surging, and chips selling for tens of thousands of dollars, companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, and others are increasingly leaning on their own specialized chips to power their AI ambitions called ASICs, or application-specific integrated circuits. Think of them as specialized chips for AI tasks.ASICs, unlike GPUs, are designed for a specific task, such as AI processing. And while they\u2019re expensive to develop, they can provide benefits in the long run by using less power, and giving companies greater control over the hardware they use to power their AI software.According to The Information, Microsoft has been working on its own AI chip since 2019, and in May, Meta announced it was developing its own AI hardware. Google, in August, debuted its latest AI infrastructure, and Tesla, meanwhile, is building a supercomputer based on its own chips.  Intel CEO Patrick Gelsinger is working to help the company gain a larger share of the AI chip market. (Andrew Harnik/AP Photo)  \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESSAnd while each of those companies will still need to get their hands on Nvidia chips for now, building their own hardware could cut into the graphics giant\u2019s lead in the long run.\u201cIf these companies are successful with these other homegrown silicones, Nvidia may see more competition than it has gotten used to and this will affect its margin,\u201d explained Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman. \u201cThe margin is the area I think is going to be most affected when competition really starts to settle in.\u201dStill, Newman is careful to point out that Nvidia isn\u2019t in trouble, per se, rather, it won\u2019t be able to necessarily rely on hyper-scalers like Microsoft and Amazon in the future.\u201cIf you do the math, the conclusion that you will come to is that GPUs are really good from an ecosystem and performance standpoint, but chances are with AI ASICs you're going to be able to deliver better results faster at a fraction of the cost profile,\u201d explained Chirag Dekate, VP and analyst for quantum technologies, AI infrastructures, and supercomputing at Gartner.\u201cAll of these cloud providers have come to the conclusion that the AI workload is going to be so pervasive in the ecosystems that a GPU-only strategy might not be good enough, and you might need to have an AI ASIC strategy to deliver better cost value propositions to end users,\u201d Dekate added.

Both companies are working to try to catch up with Nvidia in the AI space, rolling out their own chips and software designed to better combat the category leader.According to Dekate, Intel and AMD are working out their AI strategies and, for now, could have a marginal impact on Nvidia\u2019s market share. But as the companies further develop their hardware and, more importantly, software, they could pose a greater threat in the future.That said, the AI chip race is still in its early stages, and while Nvidia is winning by a mile, it will need to keep innovating if it intends to hold on to its lead.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

Unlike the semiconductor market, EDA market isn\u2019t cyclical and is resilient to economic cycles. \n\n\nI\u2019m sorry to say it, but Nvidia (NVDA) stock is doomed.\nThat\u2019s the bad news. The good news is that, as Nvidia falls, certain other stocks are going to soar as they benefit from Nvidia\u2019s demise. \nYou need to be buying those other stocks today.\nHere\u2019s the story\u2026\n\nThe Rise of Electronic Design Automation\nNvidia, the darling of the 2023 \u201cArtificial Intelligence Boom,\u201d has benefitted from a huge short-term surge in demand for its AI chips. But those chips are built for general-purpose AI. They are \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d chips. They worked great when everyone was building general AI applications. But now, everyone is working on customer AI applications.\nThat means the market is shifting away from Nvidia\u2019s one-size-fits-all chips and toward custom AI chips.\nTesla (TSLA) is making this shift. So is Microsoft (MSFT). And Alphabet (GOOGL). And Amazon (AMZN). And Meta (META). And pretty much every major tech firm.\nThey\u2019re all making their own custom AI chips for their specific AI applications. They\u2019re all shifting away from Nvidia. They\u2019re all shifting toward custom AI chips.\nBut making custom AI chips is not easy. \nTo make them, companies typically use what is called Electronic Design Automation, or EDA, software.\nEDA software provides tools for electronic engineers to design, analyze, and simulate electronic systems and integrated circuits (ICs). It\u2019s essential for developing everything from simple microcontrollers to complex custom circuits. Engineers use EDA software to:\n\nDraw electronic circuit schematics.\nSimulate circuit behavior, catching issues before building prototypes.\nDesign printed circuit boards and ICs.\nConduct timing, power, and signal integrity analyses.\n\nIn essence, EDA software ensures designs function properly and meet performance standards. It\u2019s basically the planning software for the chips industry.\nThe Best Way to Play the AI Chip Boom\nWhen you want to make a chip, you use EDA software. And, importantly, the more complex and custom the chip, the more you need EDA software.\nBecause of this, the EDA software market is primed for a huge boom in Nvidia\u2019s demise. \nAs Big Tech firms increasingly shift away from Nvidia and the more they pursue their own custom AI chip-building efforts, those Big Tech firms will increasingly use EDA software to make highly complex AI chips.\nToday, EDA software providers sell their software to chipmakers and electronic design firms. In the not-too-distant future, they\u2019ll sell to those folks, and Tesla\u2026 and Amazon\u2026 and Microsoft\u2026 and Alphabet\u2026 so on and so forth.\nTheir customer list is about to increase by an order of magnitude.\nSo will their revenues. \nThe EDA software market is expected to sustain double-digit growth throughout the rest of the decade. Importantly, it will sustain that growth without much volatility. Growth rates won\u2019t be all over the place; up 40% one year and then down 20% the next.\nThat\u2019s because the EDA market \u2013 unlike the semiconductor market \u2013 is not cyclical. Semiconductor demand ebbs and flows with economic cycles. But companies design chips in good times and bad. Demand is impressively resilient.\nSource: Bloomberg\nFor those reasons, we think the EDA software market represents the best way to play the AI Chip Boom.\nForget NVDA stock. It was the best play for the first wave of the AI Chip Boom, or the wave wherein everyone was building general-purpose AI applications and needed general-purpose AI chips.\nEDA software stocks are the best way to play the second wave of the AI Chip Boom \u2013 wherein custom AI applications reign supreme.\nThe Final Word\nThe bottom line is that it is time to sell NVDA stock. And it is time to buy EDA software stocks instead. \nThe best picks?\nSynopsys (SNPS) and Cadence (CDNS).\nSynopsys is the undisputed leader in the EDA software market with what we estimate to be about 40% market share.

Share prices of the semiconductor giant more than tripled in 2023, thanks mainly to the surging interest in artificial intelligence (AI)-related stocks.\nBut what if you'd bought the stock before its AI-fueled rally started?\nLet's say someone bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia shares at the beginning of 2020, well before the AI hype of the past year began. That investor would be sitting on price gains of more than 660% and that $1,000 investment would be worth $7,630. Another way to describe the growth would be to say Nvidia stock has risen more than sevenfold since the beginning of 2020.\n\nNVDA data by YCharts\nThose impressive gains can be attributed to more than just the enthusiasm for anything AI. Let's take a look at the growth drivers that have sent this chipmaker soaring since the beginning of the decade and check if they could help this tech stock sustain its momentum in the future as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gaming and data center businesses have been pillars of Nvidia's growth\nNvidia's revenue has grown at a breathtaking pace from 2020 to 2023. The company reported revenue\u00a0of $10.9 billion for fiscal 2020 (which ended on Jan. 26, 2020). That figure jumped to an impressive\u00a0$27 billion in fiscal 2023 (which ended on Jan. 29, 2023).\n\nNvidia's annual gaming revenue increased from $5.5 billion in fiscal 2020 to $9 billion during this three-year period, clocking a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of almost 18%. However, the gaming business has seen its ups and downs. Sales of gaming graphics cards that power personal computers (PCs) jumped impressively in 2021 and 2022 thanks to the novel coronavirus pandemic.\nAs people stayed at home to avoid spreading the virus, sales of gaming hardware such as graphics cards surged. Nvidia's gaming revenue jumped to $7.7 billion in fiscal 2021 and then to $12.5 billion in fiscal 2022. It fell to $9 billion in fiscal 2023 as oversupply struck the PC market and sales of graphics cards plunged.\nThe data center business, on the other hand, has enjoyed outstanding secular growth. Nvidia's revenue from this segment has surged from just under $3 billion\u00a0in fiscal 2020 to a record $15 billion in fiscal 2023. It is worth noting that the company's data center revenue\u00a0in the first six months of fiscal 2024 stands at $14.6 billion, suggesting that it could generate significantly higher revenue from this business this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's worth noting here is that Nvidia is now primarily a data center company, as it generated 76% of its revenue from this segment in the first six months of fiscal 2024. The gaming business produced 18% of overall revenue during the same period. For comparison, gaming accounted for half of Nvidia's revenue in fiscal 2020, while the data center business was relatively small at 27% of the top line.\nBut the bottom line is that these two segments remain the heavy lifters for Nvidia. Together they accounted for a significant chunk of the company's revenue for the past three years. That's why it would be a good idea to take a look at where these segments are headed in the future.\nWhat does the future look like for Nvidia's key businesses?\nStarting off with gaming, the good news for Nvidia is that revenue is again on a growth path. Gaming-related revenue increased\u00a022% year over year in the previous quarter to $2.5 billion. The impressive year-over-year growth was a result of stability in the PC market as well as a large installed base of Nvidia's existing graphics card users, who are currently in an upgrade window.\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress believes that gaming GPU demand is now back following last year's slump. Market research firm TechNavio estimates that the gaming GPU market could grow at an annual rate of 16% through the end of 2027, jumping from an annual revenue of $30.5 billion in 2022 to $64 billion in 2027.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is in a solid position to make the most of this secular growth opportunity since it controls\u00a080% of the discrete GPU market. Throw in the fact that Nvidia could also win big from the nascent cloud gaming market where it is currently the dominant player, and it is easy to see that the gaming business is built for growth in the long run.\nSimilarly, the data center business is sitting on a massive catalyst in the form of AI. We have already seen that the company's data center revenue shot up remarkably this year, and the trend is likely to continue as demand for AI servers increases. After all, Nvidia reportedly controls\u00a0more than 80% of the market for AI chips, which is expected to clock 29% annual growth through 2030 and generate $304 billion in annual revenue at the end of the forecast period. Not surprisingly, Nvidia's AI-related revenue is expected to jump at a terrific pace in the long run.\nAll this explains why analysts anticipate outstanding growth in Nvidia's earnings over the next three years.\n\nNVDA EPS Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YCharts\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the chart above indicates, Nvidia's earnings could jump to $20 per share in fiscal 2026. Multiplying that by the company's five-year average forward earnings multiple of 41 points toward a stock price of $820 after three years, which would be an 80% jump from current levels. So a $1,000 investment in Nvidia right now could be worth $1,800 in three years, which is why investors looking for a growth stock should consider buying it before it jumps higher.\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Register for this free strategy session today.\r\nNvidia Corp. NVDA stock has been a runaway winner this year, thanks to the company\u2019s head start in the field of artificial intelligence. But Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD has shown intent to catchup and create its own space in the hot-and-happening technology area. \nAgainst this backdrop, here\u2019s a look at how an NVDA Vs AMD head-to-head stock match-up compares:\nNVDA vs. AMD: A Comparative Analysis \nNvidia rebounded from 2022\u2019s weakness and began to rally at the start of the year, and since then, there has been no looking back. By virtue of the breathtaking rally,  the chipmaker is now the top-performing S&P 500 stock of the year and the best-performing mega-cap tech stock. It has clocked a gain of over 275% over the past year.\nThe weakness that was seen in Nvidia in 2022 was primarily due to the economic slackening that began to manifest in the wake of the Fed\u2019s monetary policy tightening that began in March of that year. Mid-year, the company was caught in the crossfires of U.S.-China tensions as the U.S. banned sales of high-performance chips to China, which happens to be one of the major customers of the Santa Clara, California-based company.\nAll these changed with the coming of age of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, which began to gain popularity with the launch of the GPT-3 version of the chatbot in late November. Software giant Microsoft Corp.\u2018s MSFT incremental $10 billion investment in OpenAI served to fire additional interest in AI and its applications.\nHow is Nvidia benefiting from the AI explosion that is beginning to take shape? The GPT-3 version that was used in ChatGPT late last year was powered by 20,000 graphic processors from Nvidia, Bloomberg reported, citing data from SimilarWeb. OpenAI has since then launched GPT-4, the next iteration of its large-language model. \nAMD\u2019s shares, meanwhile, have fallen way behind Nvidia since the start of the year as the chipmaker lacked the AI-boost to push its stock higher. This is despite the Lisa Su-led company making a remarkable comeback since its Ryzen line of processors launched in 2017. AMD has been slowly and steadily chipping away into Intel, Inc.\u2019s INTC share of the CPU market since then.\nAMD shares have gained over 83% in the past year. The underperformance relative to Nvidia can squarely be blamed on the former being late to the AI party. Realizing the potential, AMD has announced two AI chips, the M1300A and M1300X, which are seen as a potent rival to Nvidia\u2019s H100 high-performance GPU processor. AMD expects to ramp up production and start shipments of its AI chips later this year.\n\nFigure: Comparison of market price trajectory of NVDA and TSLA over a period of one year.\nChart Courtesy of Benzinga\nNVDA Or AMD: Which Offers Better Returns?\nWith Nvidia clearly outperforming AMD over one year, it is a no-brainer that a hypothetical $1,000 invested in the former would have fetched a higher return than a similar sum invested in the latter. \nThe initial investment of $1,000 would have nearly quadrupled with Nvidia and would be worth $3,751.3 now. AMD would have returned a more modest $1,830.42 on a $1,000 initial investment.\n\nFigure: Comparison of scaled returns delivered by NVDA and AMD over a period of one year.\nChart Courtesy of Benzinga\nSee Also: Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks\nDO NVDA And AMD Often Move Together \nLinear regression analysis, which gives the correlation between two variables \u2014 in this case, the stock performances of Nvidia and AMD, throws up a coefficient of determination of 0.85. The number suggests a fairly positive correlation between the stocks. This implies the variance in the stock performance is less of a directional move and has more to do with the degree of upside.\n\nFigure: Linear regression analysis of NIO and LI to see if there is a correlation in how the stocks move.\nChart Courtesy of Benzinga\nNVDA Or AMD: What About Dividends?\n Nvidia was initially incorporated in California in April 1993 and was then reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in April 1998. The company went public on Jan. 22, 1999, and the stock opened for trading at $12 on its debut session. \nThe chipmaker initiated dividends in late 2012. The company slashed its dividend from $0.16 a share to $0.04 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since Aug. 2021, it has been paying a stable dividend of $0.04 a share.\nThe chip maker has split its shares five times in the past, with the latest one implemented in June 2000.\nAMD, which went public much earlier, ie, in Sept. 1972, paid a dividend of $0.01 per share only once in April 1995. The company has not been paying dividends since and has affected six stock splits so far.\n\nFigure: Comparison of how much dividends NVDA and AMD have declared over the latest three years..\nChart Courtesy of Benzinga\nNVDA Or AMD: Which Offers Better PE?\nThe forward price-earnings multiple of Nvidia and AMD stand at 26.8 and 25.9, respectively. This compares to the semiconductor industry P/E of 22.8. Despite the gains over the past year, both stocks do not appear overvalued on P/E basis. \nThe forward P/E is a valuation measure based on the current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share for the next twelve months.\nThe price-earnings growth ratio, another valuation measure calculated by dividing P/E by the estimated earnings growth, shows Nvidia has an attractive valuation, while AMD is overvalued. Typically, a PEG ratio of less than one suggests the stock is undervalued and is a potential buy.\n\nChart Courtesy of Benzinga\nWhat Analysts Think Of NVDA And AMD?\nThe scope of upside potential is better for Nvidia than AMD, as measured by the percentage change between the current price and the analysts\u2019 average price target. \n\nConclusion\nNvidia is a complete AI package. The company has the \u201centire AI silicon stack,\u201d namely the advanced GPU, advanced networking embedded in the silicon, and advanced memory embedded,\u00a0said Baird analyst  Ted Mortonson, according to Business Insider. \nCNBC Mad Money host and Nvidia fan Jim Cramer said he would not sell Nvidia stock in the wake of rumors of the company\u2019s customers developing AI chips. Rumor has it that Microsoft and its partner OpenAI have been separately working on their own in-house developed AI chips.\nMeanwhile, AMD, on its part, could be gearing up for its hour of glory in the AI arena. Following a post-earnings sell-off in early August, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said, \u201cWe think this [AMD] isa significant outperformer vs. semis from here.\u201d The analyst sees the next-gen data center GPU MI300 launching in the fourth quarter as having significant potential in an inference market, suddenly looking for much more cost-effective solutions. \nAMD\u2019s stock trajectory going forward will hinge on its ability to maintain and grow the server and desktop CPU market vis-a-vis rival Intel and the ramp-up and uptake of the company\u2019s AI chips. \nNvidia settled Monday\u2019s session down 1.07% at $452.73, and AMD edged 0.25% to $106.97, according to Benzinga Pro data.\nImage Source \u2013 Shutterstock\nRead Next: This Investment Manager Just Sold Nvidia Stock, Says Microsoft Will Be The \u2018Number One Beneficiary Of AI\u2019AMDAdvanced Micro Devices Inc$103.84-0.72%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock \u2013 anytime.Reveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum11.93Growth82.27Quality87.35Value13.53Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewINTCIntel Corp$26.091.54%MSFTMicrosoft Corp$382.62-1.56%NVDANVIDIA Corp$116.94-2.16%Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Nvidia reached the $1 trillion mark earlier this year after its revenue guidance exploded higher on a flurry of orders relating to the generative AI industry. Nvidia is widely thought to offer the highest value chips for generative AI workloads.\nTraders are still keeping their eyes on Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) earnings that arrive after Tuesday\u2019s market close. Wall Street consensus expects AMD to post earnings of $0.68 per adjusted share on $5.69 billion in sales.\nNvidia stock forecast: Head-and-shoulders chart pattern calls for $328 target\nThe daily chart below offers up a textbook head-and-shoulders pattern. The \u201chead\u201d came on August 24 at an all-time high of $502.66. The pinnacle of each \u201cshoulder\u201d gave up in mid-July and mid-October in the area between $476 and $481.\nThe neckline of the chart pattern starts at the August 14 bottom at $403.11 and rises through the September 21 bottom at $409.80. This means that NVDA stock broke through the neckline on Thursday, October 26, just above $415.\nHead-and-shoulders patterns are bearish signals, and the price target comes from the difference between the top of the head ($502.66) and the neckline break (~$415.50). This conjures up an $87 downside movement that is expected to curtail near $328.\nNvidia reached resistance in the vicinity of $328 back in November 2021, although that rally did momentarily climb above $346. Another more recent point of historical resistance is the $318.28 high from May 18, earlier this year.\n\n\n\nNVDA daily stock chart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nShare:\n\n  Feed news\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Credit: Nvidia\n\n\n\n \nEvery Wednesday and Friday, TechNode\u2019s Briefing newsletter delivers a roundup of the most important news in China tech, straight to your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nOn Tuesday, US chip giant Nvidia revealed that the US government has instructed it to immediately halt the export of certain high-end artificial intelligence chips to China, as regulators have expedited the enforcement of new restrictions, which were originally scheduled to take effect from Nov. 16.Why it matters: The US withdrew Nvidia\u2019s 30-day exemption period for chip exports to China on Oct. 23, implementing the new regulation 24 days earlier than expected. Currently, Chinese customers, such as Tencent and ByteDance, can no longer obtain any AI-related products from Nvidia.\u00a0Details: The US government notified Nvidia of the immediate implementation of export restrictions on AI chips starting Oct. 23, as per Nvidia\u2019s announcement to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The affected products include five GPUs (graphics processing units): A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S.On Oct. 17, the US Department of Commerce announced a series of new restrictions on chip exports, addressing loopholes identified after the US imposed export limitations on chips last October. These new regulations broaden the definition of advanced AI chips and impose additional licensing requirements on chip products destined for over 40 countries and regions, aiming to prevent resale to China. According to the regulations, the new restrictions will take effect from Nov. 16.\nFollowing the implementation of the new regulations, Nvidia must cease shipping A800 and H800 chips to China unless it has express permission from the US government. A800 and H800 chips are alternative solutions Nvidia offered in place of the originally prohibited A100 and H100 chips, following the initial AI chip export restrictions imposed by the US last October. The Nvidia L40S, an advanced GPU for data centers, will also be affected by the new restrictions.\nDue to the widespread global demand for these products, the sudden acceleration of US restrictions is not expected to have a short-term impact on the company\u2019s financial performance, Nvidia said in its announcement.\u00a0\nHowever, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang earlier stated that the new ban is expected to significantly impact Nvidia\u2019s sales in the Chinese market, though he added that the company remains committed to complying with US regulations.\u00a0\nSeveral AI industry professionals in China have voiced concerns and doubts over the new measures, according to a report by local media outlet TMTPost. They worry about the potential impact of the new restrictions on the future training of large-scale AI models in China, which could result in a tech gap compared to US-based AI companies like OpenAI.Context: In August, Nvidia reported a fourfold increase in its Data Center revenue over the last two years, establishing itself as a leader in AI chips with a market share of over 70%. Nvidia\u2019s stock continues to rise, as the company achieved a market cap of $1 trillion earlier in 2023.The data center sector comprises processors such as central processing units (CPUs), data processing units (DPUs), and graphic processing units (GPUs). GPUs are favored for AI applications due to their ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. \nSupport TechNodeWith a small team, TechNode provides timely news and thoughtfully researched articles for worldwide readers interested in learning more about the Chinese tech industry.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tOne-time\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMonthly\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tAnnually\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tOne-time\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$60\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$120\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$365\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOther\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDonation amount\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMonthly\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$10\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$20\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$30\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOther\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDonation amount\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tper month\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAnnually\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$60\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$120\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$365\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOther\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDonation amount\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tper year\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tYour contribution is appreciated.\t\t\n\n\t\t\tDonate Now\t\t\n\n \n\n\nRelated\n \n\nTagged: AI,\u00a0CHINA,\u00a0Chips,\u00a0government,\u00a0Highlight,\u00a0News,\u00a0NVIDIA \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJessie Wu\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJessie Wu is a tech reporter based in Shanghai.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Arm)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia already commands about 80% of the discrete graphics processors for PCs, as well as most of the AI and HPC GPU market. But it looks like the company is ready to take on yet another major market: processors for client PCs that run Microsoft Windows, reports\u00a0Reuters. AMD, which has historically competed against Intel on this market with x86 offerings, is also venturing into Arm-based CPUs for desktops and laptops, the news agency claims, citing two sources with knowledge of the matter. Both companies aim to introduce their Arm SoCs for client PCs in 2025.AMD and Nvidia's decision to offer Arm-based CPUs will be a\u00a0strategic move, in collaboration with Microsoft's broader initiative to enhance Arm-based processors for Windows PCs, aiming to compete more effectively against the Arm-based\u00a0system-on-chips used by Apple in\u00a0its\u00a0Mac computers.\u00a0\n\nIn 2016, Microsoft selected Qualcomm to lead the initiative of transitioning the Windows operating system to Arm's instruction set architecture, traditionally used in smartphones due to its energy efficiency. Qualcomm was given exclusive rights by Microsoft to create chips compatible with Windows up until the year 2024. But once the exclusivity is expired, some big new players are set to enter this market.\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s involvement is crucial, as it aims to encourage and facilitate the development and adoption of Arm-based processors within the PC industry. This encouragement stems from a strategic vision to diversify the processor ecosystem beyond the established x86 architecture primarily owned by Intel. Microsoft's plans also seem motivated by the efficiency and performance\u00a0demonstrated\u00a0by Apple's custom Arm-based chips, which have significantly improved battery life and overall performance in Mac computers.\"Microsoft learned from the 90s that they do not want to be dependent on Intel again, they do not want to be dependent on a single vendor,\" said Jay Goldberg, chief executive of D2D Advisory, in a conversation with Reuters. \"If Arm really took off in PC (chips), they were never going to let Qualcomm be the sole supplier.\"Entering the domain of CPUs for PCs marks a significant expansion for Nvidia,\u00a0though not exactly unexpected since the company already tried to address tablets and smartphones with its Tegra offerings in mid-2010s (but largely failed).Re-entering the Arm-based PC CPU market\u00a0is not\u00a0going to be\u00a0without competitive and technological challenges.\u00a0AMD and\u00a0Nvidia will be competing against established players like\u00a0Apple and\u00a0Qualcomm, which has\u00a0been producing Arm-based chips for laptops since 2016\u00a0and 2020, respectively.\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile,\u00a0success in this endeavor involves overcoming substantial technical barriers. A key challenge lies in the existing heavy investments in the x86 computing architecture, which has been a staple in software development for PCs. Transitioning to Arm-based\u00a0CPUs\u00a0requires addressing compatibility issues, as code developed for x86 chips will not directly run on the\u00a0Arm ISA, necessitating\u00a0porting software from x86 to Arm.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more CPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (91)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

If you want to get technical, they already ship an ARM Cortex-A5 core for the Platform Security Processor in Ryzen/Epyc chips. I didn't read the SemiAccurate article, is it paywalled?\n\nNvidia, on the other hand, definitely has ambitions of challenging Intel and AMD's CPUs or APUs. Whether or not they will make that dream a reality is another story. One thing's for sure, Nvidia never needed to acquire ARM to make that happen. It's entirely possible for one of the licensees to make custom ARM cores.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsetx\n\n\nThose ARM shills again... Part of plan to make ARM look more interesting for investment?\n\nI see what MS wants from ARM (to threaten Intel), but what is there for AMD? Razor-thin margins? Paying more to ARM for nothing?

The curbs were initially scheduled to take effect 30 days after their announcement on October 17 and are designed to prevent China, Iran, and Russia from acquiring advanced AI chips.\nThe banned chips are advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) that are commonly used for training and running deep learning AI applications similar to ChatGPT and AI image generators, among other uses. GPUs are well-suited for neural networks because their massively parallel architecture performs the necessary matrix multiplications involved in running neural networks faster than conventional processors.\nThe Biden administration initially announced an advanced AI chip export ban in September 2022, and in reaction, Nvidia designed and released new chips, the A800 and H800, to comply with those export rules for the Chinese market. In November 2022, Nvidia told The Verge that the A800 \"meets the US Government\u2019s clear test for reduced export control and cannot be programmed to exceed it.\" However, the new curbs enacted Monday specifically halt the exports of these modified Nvidia AI chips. The Nvidia A100, H100, and L40S chips are also included in the export restrictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia mentioned in its Tuesday filing that it does not anticipate a near-term financial impact from the move. \"Given the strength of demand for the Company\u2019s products worldwide, the Company does not anticipate that the accelerated timing of the licensing requirements will have a near-term meaningful impact on its financial results,\" it wrote.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD), another company affected by these curbs, did not comment to Reuters on the matter. Intel, which started selling its Gaudi 2 chips in China in July, said it is \"reviewing the regulations and assessing the potential impact.\"\nTo help mitigate the effects of last year's chip bans, the US Commerce Department has extended special authorizations for major foreign chip makers, such as SK Hynix, Samsung, and TSMC, to receive crucial US chipmaking tools for their plants in China. TSMC is now seeking permanent US authorization for its China operations through the \"validated end-user\" process, while South Korean giants Samsung and SK Hynix can indefinitely supply US chip equipment to their China plants without separate US approvals.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            No GPUs for you: US blocks sales of AI chips to China and Russia\n          \n\n            Government aims to \"keep advanced technologies out of the wrong hands.\"\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            TSMC, Samsung seeking permanent US licenses to operate China chip plants\n          \n\n            Report: US weighing new export controls to block China's access to AI chips.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Listing image:\n    \n      Nvidia\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenj Edwards\nSenior AI Reporter\n\n\n\n\nBenj Edwards\nSenior AI Reporter\n\n\n      Benj Edwards is Ars Technica's Senior AI Reporter and founder of the site's dedicated AI beat in 2022.

After all, on the latest conference call with analysts, CEO Elon Musk said that while Tesla may look expensive for a car company, \"success in this regard in the long term, I think, has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company in the world by far.\" He added, \"If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it's not clear what the limit is.\"\nOn the positive side, it appears that other large tech companies may agree with Musk, as they are each pursuing the same technology. On the downside, they are also incredibly competitive AI companies such as Nvidia (NVDA -2.53%) and Foxconn, whose parent company is Hon Hai Precision (HNHPF -2.15%).\nThese two recently announced they're teaming up to turbocharge their autonomous vehicle game and take on Tesla.\n\nFoxconn aims to become the biggest EV assembler in the world\nYou may know Foxconn as the main assembler of iPhones in China, but the global electronics manufacturing giant is now aiming at the electric vehicle market as a key future growth driver. This includes the production of standardized parts and platforms, which automakers can use in their own branded EV designs.\nIn fact, Foxconn believes it can use its incredible economies of scale and buying power to become the largest electric vehicle contract assembler in the world. Back in March, TechCrunch reported that while Foxconn was targeting 5% of the EV market by 2025, it also harbors ambitions to build 50% of all EVs over the long-term. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe automobile industry is shifting from an old model when car companies would design their own engines and proprietary parts to one more like the electronics industry, in which OEMs use mostly outsourced semiconductors made by parts specialists. Foxconn is hoping to lead this change, developing a supply chain of battery and chip specialists. The company even bought the old General Motors\u00a0plant in Lordstown, Ohio, back in 2021, as a step toward this EV future. \nNvidia and Foxconn team up to take on Tesla\nLast week, Nvidia and Foxconn announced a new partnership, in which Nvidia will provide artificial intelligence infrastructure to Foxconn. These partnerships appear to span three realms: helping Foxconn's customers implement AI, bringing artificial intelligence and automation to Foxconn's own factories, and to add Nvidia's autonomous driving capabilities to Foxconn's EV manufacturing platforms.\nOne of the key parts for future cars is the electronic control unit, or the \"brain\" that senses a car's surrounding environment and reacts autonomously.\nThe new Nvidia collaboration will bring Nvidia's DRIVE Hyperion 9, its ECU powered by the Nvidia Thor, its system-on-a-chip designed for autonomous driving applications. The press release said:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a contract manufacturer, Foxconn will offer highly automated and autonomous, AI-rich EVs featuring the upcoming NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion 9 platform, which includes DRIVE Thor and a state-of-the-art sensor architecture. This will enable Foxconn and its automotive customers to realize a new era of functionally safe and secure software-defined cars.\u00a0\n\nLook out Tesla?\nIf Tesla (TSLA -5.00%) is regarded as the Apple\u00a0of electric vehicles, then Foxconn aspires to be the \"Android.\" counterpart. Of course, while Tesla does have a custom FSD chip on board its vehicles, it also uses Nvidia chips to for training those AI autonomy models.\u00a0\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has pointed to Tesla's full self-driving mode as a key determinant of Tesla's future value. However, it is unclear whether Tesla can be truly differentiated on this front if it still uses Nvidia chips, at least for training. Moreover, as Nvidia clearly has excellent tech, it's unclear if Tesla's on-board autonomous chip can really win out over Nvidia's Thor, which other brands can access. \nIf Nvidia and Foxconn partner closely, using Nvidia's leading AI technology chops and Foxconn's scale to gather data, it could pose a threat to Tesla's presumptive lead in autonomy, whether for a robo-taxi service or other market-leading capabilities.\nOf course, Foxconn is just at the beginning of its EV journey, targeting the 5% threshold. Tesla currently has a 50% share in U.S. electric vehicles, but that market share is slipping, down from 65% last year, as more models enter the market. And of course, Tesla's share is lower in other countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nScale generates more data, which is then processed, which leads to greater autonomous capabilities. But if Tesla and Foxconn's customers have the same processing capabilities and Foxconn can scale through its third-party customers, it may generate a comparable competitive autonomous capability in the future.\nWhile this is not an immediate concern, it is something for Tesla shareholders to monitor.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBilly Duberstein has positions in Apple.

On the Windows-based PC front, only Qualcomm has offered Arm-based SoCs for notebooks in recent years, but it looks like it will soon be joined by AMD and NVIDIA, two notable players in the PC space, according to a\u00a0Reuters\u00a0report.\nWhile neither AMD nor NVIDIA has confirmed plans to offer Arm-based SoCs for client PCs, it will not be the first time these companies either planned or offered Arm-powered processors for the Windows ecosystem. Furthermore, this move will align with Microsoft's broader vision to push the adoption of Arm-based processors into Windows PCs to make them more competitive against Apple's offerings.\nMicrosoft has spearheaded initiatives promoting the utilization of Arm-based processors, intending to diversify and evolve beyond the prevailing x86 architecture, predominantly controlled by Intel, for years. At first, the company attempted to do this in the late 2000s but saw no major success for years. However, AMD tried to develop a competitive Arm-based SoC (but had to fold development due to insufficient budgets), whereas NVIDIA offered its Tegra processor.\u00a0\nMicrosoft's renewed attempt to push Arm into Windows PCs kicked off in 2016 when the company signed a deal with Qualcomm, under which the latter produced PC-oriented Snapdragon application processors. In contrast, Microsoft tailored its Arm version of Windows specifically for these SoCs.\n\"Microsoft learned from the 90s that they do not want to be dependent on Intel again, they do not want to be dependent on a single vendor,\" said Jay Goldberg, chief executive of D2D Advisory, in a conversation with Reuters. \"If Arm really took off in PC (chips), they were never going to let Qualcomm be the sole supplier.\"\nThat deal between Microsoft and Qualcomm is set to expire in 2024 when AMD, NVIDIA, and others will be able to release their Windows PC-oriented SoCs. But it remains to be seen what exactly the two companies will offer.\nAMD, Intel's arch-rival on the x86 CPU market for decades, may be inclined to expand its offerings. However, this move will not fit into its contemporary data center-oriented strategy. Furthermore, NVIDIA has also focused primarily on data center business in recent years.\u00a0\nOn the one hand, both companies are interested in making high-volume products of PCs. On the other hand, both earn tons of money on AI, HPC, and data center CPUs and GPUs, and both use all production capacity they can to meet demand for their high-margin offerings. Yet, historically, companies that solely concentrated on enterprise hardware went extinct or became parts of more prominent entities.\nSource:\u00a0Reuters\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n43 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nmeacupla - Wednesday, October 25, 2023 - link\nnvidia has been making ARM based chips for years, so I can see them offering a design that would work well.AMD... Have they even hired an expert ARM chip designer?\n\n\n\nmode_13h - Wednesday, October 25, 2023 - link\n> nvidia has been making ARM based chips for yearsHow long since their last Denver core?  All of their current SoCs have cores designed by ARM, themselves.  I had even assumed Nvidia dissolved its ARM core design group, especially after its plans to acquire ARM came to light.\n\n\n\nmeacupla - Wednesday, October 25, 2023 - link\nIt's been a while with Denver, but their latest one is most likely going to be an Orin in Nintendo Switch2.\n\n\n\niphonebestgamephone - Thursday, October 26, 2023 - link\nThose are said to be a78 cores, yet another stock arm design.\n\n\n\nmode_13h - Friday, October 27, 2023 - link\nDenver?  No way.  Project Denver cores are VLIW, with a JIT compiler to translate the code.  It's not easy to find details on them, but here's a choice sentence from a developer blog about Jetson TX2:\"TX2\u2019s CPU Complex includes a dual-core 7-way superscalar NVIDIA Denver 2 for high single-thread performance with dynamic code optimization\"Source: https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/jetson-tx2-deliv...\n\n\n\niphonebestgamephone - Wednesday, November 1, 2023 - link\nOrin.\n\n\n\nDesierz - Wednesday, October 25, 2023 - link\nIf you ask Jim Keller, a CPU is a CPU.  You don't need an an 'expert ARM chip designer'. You just need an an 'expert CPU designer'. AMD already has those.\n\n\n\nmeacupla - Wednesday, October 25, 2023 - link\nOkay, well if that holds true, I hope AMD can slap together a strong candidate.\n\n\n\nFWhitTrampoline - Wednesday, October 25, 2023 - link\nYes but an ARM ISA based Instruction Decoder takes up less die area/transistors to implement than an x86 ISA Instruction Decoder so the custom ARM chips like Apple's A14 Cyclone can fit 8 Instruction decoders on the front of that core's design whereas Golden Cove has only 6 Instruction Decoders on its front there with only one of those 6 being a complex x86 Instruction Decoder and the reminder being simplified x86 Instruction Decoders. Arm Holdings has a core that coming with 10 Instruction Decoders but that design lack any Micro-op cache to store already decoded instructions. \n\n\n\niphonebestgamephone - Thursday, October 26, 2023 - link\nThe x4?

We hope to redress this imbalance and accelerate cutting-edge work in AI.\"Voltage Park offers GPUs for as little as $1.89 an hour per GPU (though does not share details about the type of commitment needed for that price point). On-demand customers can lease between one and eight GPUs, while those looking to lease up to 248 GPUs need a short-term lease, and numbers up to 4,088 would need a year-long lease.Compared to Amazon Web Services' (AWS) on-demand offering through its P5 nodes which have eight H100s, the price is fractional. AWS charges $98.32 an hour for that offering, compared with the $15.12 that Voltage Park would, based on this pricing system, offer.The company will host AI clusters in Texas, Virginia, and Washington. Some of the Nvidia chips are already available, while it expects to fully deploy by February 2024.Jed McCaleb, the financier of the project, built his billions through the founding of three cryptocurrency companies: Mt. Gox, Ripple, and Stellar. Ripple's cryptocurrency was called XRP, and the founders received 20 billion XRP which was worth $80bn at its peak.Any profit from Voltage Park goes directly to its parent organization, the non-profit Navigation Fund. McCaleb is not directly involved with the operation of either organization.The company's website links to FLOP Auction, a site that offers 'access to 23,000 Nvidia H100s' operated by Voltage Park via an auction process rather than traditional sales contracts.FLOP Auction says its compute clusters are deployed across data centers in Washington, Texas, Virginia, and Utah, and has 30MW of power under contract.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in HPC & Quantum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19 Feb 2025\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft develops topological quantum chip, claims \"truly meaningful quantum computer\" just years away\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26 Feb 2025\n\n\n\n\nQuantum Machines raises $170m in oversubscribed funding round\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nThe architecture of a supercomputer: A journey into advanced HPC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in Cloud & Hyperscale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe State of Data and AI in Europe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20 Sep 2024\n\n\n\n\nCMA extends UK cloud market investigation by up to four months\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nAchieving sustainable data centers through circular design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nVoltage Park\n\n\nJed McCaleb\n\n\nEric Park\n\n\nTexas\n\n\nNvidia H100 Hopper\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\nH100\n\n\nGPU\n\n\nWashington\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

I highlighted a few of those reasons to consider an Nvidia GPU over an AMD one recently, going over things like DLSS and the raw performance of RTX GPUs. AMD graphics cards, however, have also come a long way, and they aren't trailing too far behind in 2023. \nIn fact, there are some good reasons to consider them over Nvidia's options, and I certainly won't count them out of the race. If you are in the market to buy a new graphics card and are split between AMD and Nvidia, then here are a few reasons why you should consider an AMD GPU for your build. \n1 \n\n                            More value for money\n                    \n\nI wouldn't necessarily call AMD GPUs \u2014 or pretty much any GPU for that matter \u2014 cheap, but they're certainly cheaper than Nvidia's offerings. AMD GPUs reign supreme when viewed from a price-to-performance perspective, and it's not even close. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX, for instance, undercuts its closest competition from Nvidia, the RTX 4080, by $200. In fact, the RX 7900 XTX has the same amount of VRAM as the RTX 4090, but it costs $600 less.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar comparisons can be made in the budget and mid-range segment, where you'll fetch better value with an AMD GPU. The RX 6650 XT is an excellent value pick for those looking for a GPU that costs less than $250 in the U.S. The same is true for the RX 6600. In fact, our collection of the best budget GPUs in 2023 is mostly populated by AMD's offerings, which goes to show that you really need to ride the AMD wave to get the best bang for your buck while shopping for a GPU in 2023.\nI hope to see some well-priced GPUs from Nvidia in 2024, but it seems highly unlikely, considering its outrageous pricing strategy this generation. Long story short, AMD GPUs are cheaper than their Nvidia counterparts this generation, and the price difference is often enough to cover a huge chunk for your other PC parts like an SSD or a motherboard. The performance gap is also not as wide as it used to be, as AMD GPUs have greatly improved. The company is also constantly working to improve the experience for gamers with upscaling technologies like FSR and Fluid Motion Frames. \n2 \n\n                            More video memory (VRAM) for the price\n                    \n\nI briefly touched on this while highlighting the RX 7900 XTX in the pricing section above, but I believe the AMD GPUs deserve a special mention in the VRAM department. You can also view this as an extension of the price-to-performance conversation, but it's high time we acknowledge the fact that AMD GPUs offer more VRAM than their similarly priced Nvidia counterparts.\nThe RTX 4090 with 24GB VRAM costs $1,600, whereas AMD's RX 7900 XTX will give you the same amount of VRAM for around $600 less. Our Radeon RX 7900 XTX vs Nvidia RTX 4090 comparison will tell you that there's more to the RTX 4090 that makes it more ferocious, but it's a good example to show how AMD is winning the VRAM battle big time here, as it has been for quite some time now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RTX 4080 with 16GB of VRAM costs $1,200 today, whereas you can get the same amount of VRAM for far less when you choose to go with Team Red. The Radeon RX 7900 XT is arguably a better deal than the RTX 4080 as you get very similar performance and more VRAM for less. In fact, you can get an RX 6800 with 16GB of memory for a fraction of the price to beat the RTX 4080 if you pay heed to more video memory.\nYes, there's no need to stuff an excess of VRAM on a relatively less powerful GPU, as we mentioned in our VRAM explainer, but I believe the $800 RTX 4070 Ti could definitely use more than 12GB VRAM. In fact, AMD brings more VRAM to the table almost all the time when you compare its GPUs with a similarly specced offering from Nvidia.\nVRAM is more important than ever in gaming now as we continue to get more demanding titles with bigger and better worlds with more details and more ray-traced elements. It's also equally important as you move up the resolution ladder and want to take advantage of the newer gaming monitors out there. Of course, how much VRAM you need entirely depends on your system's appetite for it based on the tasks you throw at it, but there is no denying that AMD is the way to go if you belong to \"the more, the merrier\" club, and if you use applications that demand more VRAM. \n3 \n\n                            Diminishing returns in upscaling technologies\n                    \n\nIt's true that Nvidia's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) upscaling technology is better and more capable than AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) at the moment. But we've reached a point where the difference in performance between FSR and DLSS isn't as significant as it used to be. Having tested the latest iterations of both DLSS and FSR, I can safely say that they both do a commendable job of upscaling, delivering clean visuals for the most part with higher frames on the board. Here's how much of an improvement I could see while comparing DLSS and FSR in Forspoken, which is one of the two titles that support AMD's FSR 3: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpscaling quality preset\n\n\nAvg. FPS\n\n\n\n\nDLSS\n\n\nQuality\n\n\n78\n\n\n\n\nDLSS\n\n\nUltra Performance\n\n\n82\n\n\n\n\nFSR 3.0\n\n\nQuality\n\n\n75\n\n\n\n\nFSR 3.0\n\n\nUltra Performance\n\n\n85\n\n\n\n\nFSR 3.0\n\n\nNative AA\n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth technologies also support frame generation, which uses AI to interpolate a fake/generated frame between two original frames for smoother gameplay at high FPS. Yes, Nvidia's DLSS technology is more widely used and cleans up the frames well for a better presentation overall, but AMD's technology has also caught up and is constantly improving, meaning we're likely to see diminishing returns from here on out.\nI would also like to point out that Nvidia's DLSS 3.0 with Frame Generation is compatible only with its current 40-series cards. AMD's FSR 3.0, on the other hand, works with Radeon 5000 series GPUs and above. The fact that your one or two-year-old Nvidia GPU is already looking down on you with a lack of support makes AMD's offering more appealing. \n            Closing thoughts\n    \nA GPU is not only one of the most important components of a PC, but it's also among the most expensive ones. That's exactly why you should explore all the options and consider only the ones that would last you for at least a few years. AMD has some great GPUs out there that are very easy to recommend right now. They're relatively cheaper, perform well while maintaining power efficiency, and are more readily available than their Nvidia counterparts in the U.S. You can even consider buying the last-generation AMD GPUs that stack up well against the current-gen GPUs at a lower price.\nIt's very easy to get lost with all the options out there as we're spoiled for choices now after the GPU shortage, but it's hard to go wrong with either of them. So feel free to pick the ones you like and those that suit your needs and budget.

The curbs were initially scheduled to take effect 30 days after their announcement on October 17 and are designed to prevent China, Iran, and Russia from acquiring advanced AI chips.\n \n \n \n\n\n\nMore Tech News From Around The Web\n\n\n \n \n\n\nCitrix Bleed exploit lets hackers hijack NetScaler accounts @ Bleeping Computer\nAmazon Now Lets Advertisers Use Generative AI To Pretty Up Their Product Shots @ Slashdot\n1Password confirms attacker tried to pull list of admin users after Okta intrusion @ The Register\nApple To Make Tools and Parts To Fix Phones and Computers Available Nationwide, White House Says @ Slashdot\nHackers can force iOS and macOS browsers to divulge passwords and a whole lot more @ Ars Technica\nMicrosoft Now Wants You To Take a Poll Before Installing Google Chrome @ Slashdot\nQualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 promises 30 percent faster CPU @ Ars Technica\niFixit pries open Google Pixel 8 Pro with clamps and picks @ The Register\nReverse-Engineered GBA Board Could Come In Handy @ Hackaday\nMillions of smart meters will brick it when 2G and 3G turns off @ The Register\nPower Queen P300W Power Station @ FunkyHome\n\n \n \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVideo News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviousAlan Wake 2 Launches This Week \u2013 Is Your PC Ready? \n\nNextLOL, Squadron 42 Is Announced To BE Feature Complete \n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\n\n\n \n\nJeremy Hellstrom\nCall it K7M.com, AMDMB.com, or PC Perspective, Jeremy has been hanging out and then working with the gang here for years.

What's next?\" asked host Ryan Patel question during a wide-ranging interview for\u00a0HP's online show \"The Moment\"\u00a0that was posted on YouTube on October 26.\n\"Ageing gracefully. No more tattoos,\" the 60-year-old shot back. \"It hurts way more than anybody tells you,\" Huang added.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThis isn't the first time Huang has complained about his tattoo.\n\n\nBack in November 2017, he told Fortune he wanted to extend the tattoo but recalled \"crying like a baby\" during the process.\n\"My kids were with me, and they're like, 'Dad, you've gotta control yourself,'\" he told the media outlet.\nIt's not immediately clear when Huang got the current tattoo on his left arm. Nvidia's stock has split five times since the company went public in 1999. Nvidia's stock is now $411.61 apiece, nearly doubling this year following the company's blockbuster first-quarter\u00a0and\u00a0second-quarter results from the generative artificial intelligence boom.\n\n\nThe stock surge has, in turn, boosted Huang's fortune by 166% this year \u2014 his estimated net worth is $36.7 billion as of October 31, according to\u00a0Bloomberg's Billionaires Index.\nThe tattoo, alongside his black leather jacket, underpins Huang's rebellious signature motorcyclist aesthetic.\nWhen asked how he felt about his status as a fashion icon thanks to his jacket, Huang had a modest response: \"Don't give me that. I'm happy that my wife and my daughter dress me.\"\n\n\nNvidia's share price closed 1.6% higher at $411.61 apiece on Monday. The stock is up over 180% so far this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech\n\n\nNews\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider\n      subscribers.

The GPU will succeed the Hopper H100 chip and deliver a major leap in compute performance & AI capabilities.\nRelated Story Watch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For UnveilingTo realize swift manufacturing and supply during launch, NVIDIA is now selecting its supply chain partners reports suggest that Wistron has been selected as the primary partner who will supply substrates for the production of the Blackwell GPUs. Both Wistron and Foxconn were in the race to secure these orders however reservations with yields and other factors led to Wistron winning all of the early-stage orders.\nNVIDIA's GB200 (B100) AI server is scheduled to be launched in 2024. The supply chain has entered the certification stage. There are rumors in the market that Hon Hai originally planned to win the B100 substrate order, but recently the certification has been \"blocked\". Wistron maintains the Original order share.\nIt is rumored that Huida originally planned to include Hon Hai as the second AI-GPU server substrate supplier for the next-generation B100 series. However, due to yield rate and other considerations, Wistron will still obtain 100% of the order share, and Wistron is also taking advantage of the opportunity. The early stage orders for AI-GPU modules are reportedly successful.\nvia CTEE\nUDN also mentions that NVIDIA will be shifting its orders of H100 and B100 GPUs to Foxconn in North America. These are specifically for the H100 & B100 modules so while the substrates are provided by Wistron, it is likely that Foxconn will be the end supplier who will be offering the fully packaged AI modules.\nAll orders for NVIDIA's highest-end H100 AI server modules in North America were handed over to Hon Hai, which will be produced in factories in Mexico, the United States, and Hsinchu, Taiwan, the NVIDIA B100 module order that the industry is most concerned about will also be contracted by Hon Hai in the future.\nvia UDN\nImage Source: NVIDIA\nAs per the latest reports, NVIDIA has fast-forwarded the launch of its Blackwell B100 AI GPUs which are now said to launch in Q2 2024. The GPUs are said to utilize SK hynix's HBM3e memory, offering the highest bandwidth and transfer speeds in the industry. Besides this, the new GPUs are going to retain NVIDIA's dominance within the AI segment where it already has a market share hold of 90%. Next year is going to be a heated battle with other chipmakers also picking up the pace within the AI segment such as AMD, Intel, Tenstorrent, and more.\nNews Source: Dan Nystedt\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Copilot Now Offers Free, Unlimited Access To Voice And Think Deeper, Enhancing User Experience With Advanced Reasoning And Natural Conversations\n\nEzza Ijaz\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXbox\u2019s Muse AI Model Is A One-of-a-Kind Model That Can Generate Gameplay\n\nFrancesco De Meo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHPE Now Shipping NVIDIA\u2019s Grace Blackwell \u201cGB200 NVL72\u201d Servers With Direct Liquid Cooling Tech\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeepSeek Is Sending Unencrypted Data To Chinese Servers, As Its iOS App Suffers From Multiple Severe Security Flaws\n\nAli Salman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n121\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n47\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n40\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

It is also worth noting that the segment's revenue fell 15% sequentially on account of \"lower overall automotive demand, particularly in China.\" However, there is one pure-play automotive semiconductor company that has been growing at a much faster pace than Nvidia's automotive business -- Indie Semiconductor (INDI -7.83%).\nShares of Indie Semiconductor jumped an impressive 18% on Oct. 16 after the company released its preliminary revenue figure for the third quarter of 2023. Let's see why that was the case, and why investors would do well to buy Indie stock before it steps on the gas.\nIndie Semiconductor is growing at a red-hot pace\nIndie expects Q3 revenue to land above $60 million, which means that it is likely to deliver a year-over-year jump of more than 100% compared to the prior-year period's revenue\u00a0of $30 million. It was earlier anticipating its revenue to double on a year-over-year basis, so its top line is set to grow at a slightly faster pace than it was originally expecting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe California-based chipmaker, which provides\u00a0semiconductor solutions for the automotive industry, has been growing at a terrific pace as its offerings address fast-growing areas such as ADAS, autonomous vehicles, in-car entertainment, and electric vehicles. Its revenue in the first six months of 2023 has almost doubled year over year to $92.5 million, and its Q3 performance indicates that the trend is set to continue.\nMoreover, Indie's Q3 revenue suggests that the company has hit an annual revenue run rate of $240 million. For comparison, the company finished 2022 with a top line of\u00a0$111 million. It is worth noting that analysts are anticipating the company to exit 2023 with a top line of $226 million, which would translate\u00a0into 104% growth over the prior year. Even better, Indie Semiconductor is projected to sustain solid levels of growth for the next couple of years as well.\n\nINDI Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts\nThe above chart indicates that Indie's revenue is on track to grow nearly fivefold within a space of just three years from 2022 levels. That's not surprising, as the company has built a solid ecosystem of automotive customers that includes the likes\u00a0of BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Ford, Hyundai, and BYD, among many others.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nMore importantly, the automotive niches that Indie serves are growing at a faster pace than the overall automotive semiconductor market. The company points out that the overall automotive semiconductor market could be worth\u00a0$81 billion in 2028, which would be nearly double 2021's size of $41 billion. On the other hand, Indie's addressable market is expected to hit $56 billion in 2028, up 143% from 2021 levels.\nIndie Semiconductor seems to have built a solid future pipeline already. The company estimates that it was sitting on a strategic backlog worth $4.3 billion at the end of 2022. According to Indie, the strategic backlog is \"an estimate of the revenue we expect to recognize from product orders over the next ten years.\" It wouldn't be surprising to see this metric grow further as the size of its serviceable market improves further.\nIndie is a no-brainer buy\nIndie Semiconductor stock is trading\u00a0at just 4.9 times sales, which is significantly cheaper than Nvidia's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 35. Of course, this is not an apples-to-apples comparison, as Nvidia is a much bigger company with multiple growth drivers, one of which is the automotive business. Indie, on the other hand, is a semiconductor company that's exclusively focused on automotive.\nHowever, Indie's pure-play nature has allowed it to carve a niche for itself in the automotive semiconductor market, and that's evident from the company's impressive growth and nice backlog. Even better, Indie is outperforming Nvidia's automotive business. Also, the stock seems to be attractively valued considering the eye-popping pace of growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuming it does hit $524 million in revenue in 2025 and maintains a P/S ratio of 4 at that time, its market cap could jump to almost\u00a0$2.1 billion. That points toward a 135% jump from current levels within three years. That's why investors looking for a cheaper semiconductor stock than Nvidia that's growing at a breathtaking pace may want to buy Indie before it starts soaring and becomes expensive.\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

This year\u2019s event drew nearly 100 competitors.\nThe race runs nearly 1,900 miles over the course of about four days and pits challengers in a battle not for speed but for greatest energy efficiency.\nUNSW Sydney won the energy efficiency competition and crossed the finish line first, taking the Cruiser Cup with its Sunswift 7 vehicle, which utilizes NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX for energy optimization. It was also the only competitor to race with 4 people on board and a remote mission control team.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a completely different proposition to say we can use the least amount of energy and arrive in Adelaide before anybody else, but crossing the line first is just about bragging rights,\u201d said Richard Hopkins, project manager at Sunswift and a UNSW professor. Hopkins previously managed Formula 1 race teams in the U.K.\nRace organizers bill the event, which cuts across the entire Australian continent on public roads \u2014 from Darwin in the north to Adelaide in the south \u2014 as the \u201cworld\u2019s greatest innovation and engineering challenge contributing to a more sustainable mobility future.\u201d It\u2019s also become a launchpad for students pursuing career paths in the electric vehicle industry.\nLike many of the competitors, UNSW is coming back after a three-year hiatus from the race due to the COVID-19 pandemic, making this year\u2019s competition highly anticipated.\n\u201cEvery single team member needs to understand what they\u2019re doing and what their role is on the team and perform at the very best during those five-and-a-half days,\u201d said Hopkins. \u201cIt is exhausting.\u201d\nAll In on Energy Efficiency\u00a0\u00a0\nThe race allows participants to start with a fully charged battery and to charge when the vehicles stop for the night at two locations. The remaining energy used, some 90%, comes from the sun and the vehicles\u2019 solar panels.\nUNSW\u2019s seventh-generation Sunswift 7 runs algorithms to optimize for energy efficiency, essentially shutting down all nonessential computing to maximize battery life.\nThe solar electric vehicle relies on NVIDIA Jetson AI to give it an edge across its roughly 100 automotive monitoring and power management systems.\nIt can also factor in whether it should drive faster or slower based on weather forecasts. For instance, the car will urge the driver to go faster if it\u2019s going to rain later in the day when conditions would force the car to slow down.\nThe Sunswift 7 vehicle was designed to mostly drive in a straight line from Darwin to Adelaide, and the object is to use the least amount of power outside of that mission, said Hopkins.\n\u201cSunswift 7 late last year was featured in the Guinness Book of World Records for being the fastest electric vehicle for over 1,000 kilometers on a single charge of battery,\u201d he said.\n\nJetson-Based Racers for Learning\nThe UNSW team created nearly 60 design iterations to improve on the aerodynamics of the vehicle. They used computational fluid dynamics modeling and ran simulations to analyze each version.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t ever put the car through a physical wind tunnel,\u201d said Hopkins.\nThe technical team has been working on a model to determine what speed the vehicle should be driven at for maximum energy conservation. \u201cThey\u2019re working on taking in as many parameters as you can, given it\u2019s really hard to get good driving data,\u201d said Josh Bramley, technology manager at Sunswift Racing.\nSunswift 7 is running on the Robot Operating System (ROS) suite of software and relies on its NVIDIA Jetson module to process all the input from the sensors for analytics, which can be monitored by the remote pit crew back on campus at UNSW.\nJetson is used for all the control systems on the car, so everything from the accelerator pedal, wheel sensors, solar current sensors and more are processed on it for data to analyze for ways AI might help, said Bramley. The next version of the vehicle is expected to pack more AI, he added.\n\u201cA lot of the AI and computer vision will be coming for Sunswift 8 in the next solar challenge,\u201d said Bramley.\nMore than 100 students are getting course credit for the Sunswift Racing team work, and many are interested in pursuing careers in electric vehicles, said Hopkins.\nPast World Solar Challenge contestants have gone on to work at Tesla, SpaceX and Zipline.\nTalk about a bright future.\nLearn more about the NVIDIA Jetson platform for edge AI and robotics.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AI | RoboticsTags: NVIDIA Jetson \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Because you have to,\" he said.\nJensen Huang built Nvidia into a trillion-dollar company, but if he had to do it over, he wouldn't start a company again.\n\n\nFounding the AI chip manufacturer was \"a million times harder than I expected it to be,\" the Nvidia CEO said on an episode of the tech podcast \"Acquired\" released this week.\n\"At that time, if we realized the pain and suffering and just how vulnerable you're going to feel, and the challenges that you're going to endure, the embarrassment and the shame, the list of all the things that go wrong, I don't think anybody would start a company,\" he said. \"Nobody in their right mind would do it.\"\n\n\nHuang went on to say it's actually helpful for entrepreneurs to underestimate how challenging it can be to start a business.\n\"That's kind of the superpower of an entrepreneur. They don't know how hard it is, and they only ask themselves 'How hard can it be?' And to this day, I trick my brain into thinking, 'How hard can it be?' Because you have to,\" he said. \"You have to get yourself to believe that it's not that hard because it's way harder than you think. And so if I go taking all of my knowledge now and I go back, and I said I'm going to endure that whole journey again, I think it's too much. It is just too much.\"\nThough the journey was rocky, things worked out pretty well for Huang. Business is booming for Nvidia, thanks to the generative AI arms race. The fight over the chips that provide the computing power necessary for AI's large language models ushered Nvidia into the exclusive club of companies with trillion-dollar market caps this year, joining heavyweights like Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple.\n\n\nHuang's wallet has grown accordingly. In Forbes' annual list of the 400 richest Americans, Huang saw the biggest gain in net worth percentage-wise and cracked the top 20 for the first time. He has an estimated net worth of $37.3 billion, according to Forbes.\nHuang has even become something of a fashion icon for his signature black leather jackets. Some online resellers have gone so far as to sell copycat jackets using his name. or even image in their marketing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI\n\n\nEntrepreneurship\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider\n      subscribers.

In 2021, the chipmaker introduced an Arm-based data center CPU called Grace. It features 72 cores and 117 megabyte of onboard cache.\u00a0\nNvidia doesn\u2019t sell the chip on its own, but rather as part of a compute module called the GH200 Superchip. The module (pictured) combines a single Grace CPU with a graphics processing unit and up to 480 megabytes of memory. According to Nvidia, it\u2019s designed to speed up artificial intelligence applications deployed in data centers.\nLaunching a PC processor would give Nvidia access to a large market where it currently doesn\u2019t have a presence. Intel Corp.\u2019s client computing group, which mainly sells PC processors, reported $6.8 billion in revenue for the quarter ended June 1. During the same time frame, AMD generated sales of $998 million in the client chip market.\nIt\u2019s less clear why AMD would seek to build an Arm-based CPU. The company already offers two separate lines of PC processors, the Ryzen and Threadripper product families, that have won a significant amount of market share from Intel in recent years. As of April, one of AMD\u2019s high-end Ryzen chips reportedly ranked as the world\u2019s fastest gaming CPU.\nOne reason companies choose to use Arm\u2019s CPU designs is because they\u2019re seen as having an edge in energy efficiency. That\u2019s why practically all handsets ship with Arm-based silicon. However, AMD\u2019s PC processors are already considered to be highly competitive as far as power consumption is concerned.\nOne factor that may be behind the company\u2019s quest for an Arm-based CPU is software compatibility.\u00a0\nOn their own, applications written for Arm chips can\u2019t run on a processor with a different architecture. Running them requires complicated software that slows down the computer on which it\u2019s installed. Any Arm-based CPU that AMD brings to market in the future could make do without such software, which would translate into speed improvements for users.\u00a0\nCurrently, Qualcomm Inc. is the only major chipmaker that develops Arm-based processors for Windows machines. The company launched its first entry into the category in 2016. According to today\u2019s Reuters report, Qualcomm has an \u201cexclusivity arrangement\u201d with Microsoft in this part of the chip market that will run through the end of the year.\nNvidia and AMD reportedly plan to launch their Arm-based CPUs as soon as 2025. That timing is presumably influenced by the 2024 expiry date Qualcomm\u2019s exclusivity arrangement with Microsoft. According to today\u2019s report, Microsoft is actively encouraging potential Qualcomm rivals to build their own Arm-based PC chips.\u00a0\nMicrosoft\u2019s goal is said to be the development of Windows computers with similar \u201cefficiency\u201d as Apple Inc.\u2019s Macs. Apple ships its newest Macs with internally-developed chips based on Arm designs. Those chips reportedly can\u2019t match the performance of top-end CPUs from Intel and AMD, but they\u2019re considerably more power-efficient.\nMicrosoft is reportedly encouraging chipmakers to equip their Arm-based PC processors with \u201cadvanced AI features.\u201d Nvidia should be particularly well-positioned to deliver such a capability. AMD, for its part, already ships its consumer processors with features designed to speed up machine learning applications. \nImage: Nvidia\n\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content. \u00a0\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\n\n\n\u201cTheCUBE\u00a0is an important partner to the industry.

The version 1.5 update delivers greater overall graphical fidelity, upscaling for native videos and support for GeForce RTX 20 Series GPUs.\nNVIDIA Creative Director and visual effects producer Sabour Amirazodi returns In the NVIDIA Studio to share his Halloween-themed project: a full projection mapping show on his house, featuring haunting songs, frightful animation, spooky props and more.\n\nGet ready for some Halloween magic! \ud83c\udf83\nCheck out this amazing artwork by @itsfunkyboy as part of our #SeasonalArtChallenge.\ud83d\udc7b \nDon't miss the chance to showcase your own spooky creations using #SeasonalArtChallenge for a chance to be featured. \ud83d\ude4c pic.twitter.com/uKcuFmHK4K\n\u2014 NVIDIA Studio (@NVIDIAStudio) October 23, 2023\n\nCreators can join the #SeasonalArtChallenge by submitting harvest- and fall-themed pieces through November.\n\nThe latest Halloween-themed Studio Standouts video features ghouls, creepy monsters, haunted hospitals, dimly lit homes and is not for the faint-of-heart.\nRemarkable Ray Reconstruction\nNVIDIA DLSS 3.5 \u2014 featuring Ray Reconstruction \u2014 enhances ray-traced image quality on GeForce RTX GPUs by replacing hand-tuned denoisers with an NVIDIA supercomputer-trained AI network that generates higher-quality pixels in between sampled rays.\n\nPreviewing content in the viewport, even with high-end hardware, can sometimes offer less than ideal image quality, as traditional denoisers require hand-tuning for every scene.\nWith DLSS 3.5, the AI neural network recognizes a wide variety of scenes, producing high-quality preview images and drastically reducing time spent rendering scenes.\nNVIDIA Omniverse and the USD Composer app \u2014 featuring the Omniverse RTX Renderer \u2014 specialize in real-time preview modes, offering ray-tracing inference and higher-quality previews while building and iterating.\nThe feature can be enabled by opening \u201cRender Settings\u201d under \u201cRay Tracing,\u201d opening the \u201cDirect Lighting\u201d tab and ensuring \u201cNew Denoiser (experimental)\u201d is turned on.\nThe \u2018Haunted Sanctuary\u2019 Returns\nSabour Amirazodi\u2019s \u201chome-made\u201d installation, Haunted Sanctuary, has become an annual tradition, much to the delight of his neighbors.\nCrowds form to watch the spectacular Halloween light show.\nAmirazodi begins by staging props, such as pumpkins and skeletons, around his house.\nPhysical props add to the spooky atmosphere.\nThen he carefully positions his projectors \u2014 building protective casings to keep them both safe and blended into the scene.\nAmirazodi custom builds, paints and welds his projector cases to match the Halloween-themed decor.\n\u201cIn the last few years, I\u2019ve rendered 32,862 frames of 5K animation out of the Octane Render Engine. The loop has now become 21 minutes long, and the musical show is another 28 minutes!\u201d \u2014 Sabour Amirazodi\n\nBuilding a virtual scene onto a physical object requires projection mapping, so Amirazodi used NVIDIA GPU-accelerated MadMapper software and its structured light-scan feature to map custom visuals onto his house. He achieved this by connecting a DSLR camera to his mobile workstation, which was powered by an NVIDIA RTX A5000 GPU.\nHe used the camera to shoot a series of lines and capture photos. Then, he translated to the projector\u2019s point of view an image on which to base a 3D model. Basic camera-matching tools found in Cinema 4D helped recreate the scene. Afterward, Amirazodi applied various mapping and perspective correction edits.\nProjection mapping requires matching the virtual world with real-world specifications, done in Cinema 4D.\nNext, Amirazodi animated and rigged the characters. GPU acceleration in the viewport enabled smooth interactivity with complex 3D models.\n\u201cI like having a choice between several third-party NVIDIA GPU-accelerated 3D renderers, such as V-Ray, OctaneRender and Redshift in Cinema 4D,\u201d noted Amirazodi.\n\u201cI switched to NVIDIA graphics cards in 2017. GPUs are the only way to go for serious creators.\u201d \u2014 Sabour Amirazodi\n\nAmirazodi then spent hours on his RTX 6000 workstation creating and rendering out all the animations, assembling them in Adobe After Effects and compositing them on the scanned canvas in MadMapper. There, he crafted individual scenes to render out as chunks and assembled them in Adobe Premiere Pro. Remarkably, he repeated this workflow for every projector.\nOnce satisfied with the sequences, Amirazodi encoded everything using Adobe Media Encoder and loaded them onto BrightSign digital players \u2014 all networked to run the show synchronously.\nAmirazodi used the advantages of GPU acceleration to streamline his workflow \u2014 saving him countless hours. \u201cAfter Effects has numerous plug-ins that are GPU-accelerated \u2014 plus, Adobe Premiere Pro and Media Encoder use the new dual encoders found in the Ada generation of NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs, cutting my export times in half,\u201d he said.\nSmooth timeline movement in Adobe Premiere Pro assisted by the NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU.\nAmirazodi\u2019s careful efforts are all in the Halloween spirit \u2014 creating a hauntingly memorable experience for his community.\n\u201cThe hard work and long nights all become worth it when I see the smile on my kids\u2019 faces and all the joy it brings to the entire neighborhood,\u201d he reflected.\nNVIDIA Creative Director Sabour Amirazodi.\nDiscover more of Amirazodi\u2019s work on IMDb.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The VergeTom Warren is a senior editor and author of Notepad, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.Nvidia and AMD are both reportedly planning to launch Arm-based CPUs for Windows-based PCs. Reuters reports that Nvidia has started designing Arm-based CPUs in what could be a major expansion of Microsoft\u2019s Windows on Arm work. Nvidia and AMD could both be ready with PC chips as soon as 2025, according to Reuters.Microsoft has so far exclusively partnered with Qualcomm for Arm-based versions of Windows 11, and the Reuters report comes on the eve of Qualcomm\u2019s next big Snapdragon launch for Arm-based chips that will likely power Samsung\u2019s upcoming flagship phone. Reuters reports that Microsoft executives will be part of Qualcomm\u2019s announcement tomorrow, including vice president of Windows and Devices Pavan Davuluri.Microsoft\u2019s first Surface tablet, the Surface RT, was powered by Nvidia\u2019s Arm-based Tegra processor, but Windows RT failed to make an impact despite Lenovo, Asus, Samsung, and Dell all trying to push Arm-based Windows devices. We haven\u2019t seen Nvidia Arm-based devices running Windows ever since, as Qualcomm\u2019s close partnership with Microsoft has extended to special processors for Surface Pro tablets.Microsoft\u2019s custom chips for Surface devices. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The VergeAMD and Nvidia potentially joining Qualcomm for Arm-based Windows devices will increase the pressure on Intel to deliver chips that can compete with Apple\u2019s own silicon. Intel-based laptops have struggled to keep up with the battery life and performance that Apple\u2019s M1 and M2 chips deliver, with Meteor Lake CPUs set to arrive in December to try and challenge Apple once again.Microsoft has also been rumored to be working on its own Arm-based chips for servers and potentially even Surface devices. We haven\u2019t seen that materialize yet, with the Windows maker co-engineering an Arm-based SQ1 processor with Qualcomm for the Surface Pro X and a SQ2 variant. AMD also worked with Microsoft to create a custom version of its Ryzen processor for the Surface Laptop 3, and is reportedly working with Microsoft on AI chips.See More: AMDMicrosoftNewsNvidiaTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

The news was quickly followed by Morgan Stanley reporting that NVIDIA could possibly work with Meaditek for its first Arm-based CPU architecture aimed at the consumer PC segment. There are also reports that an official follow-up on this matter could come as early as this Friday in a press conference by Medatek.\nRelated Story MediaTek Is \u2018Doing Some Simulations\u2019 To See If It Will Be Included In U.S. Tariffs, Chief Executive Says That This Year Will Be \u2018Manageable\u2019Now, Chinese tech outlet, UDN (citing Morgan Stanley), is reporting that NVIDIA and MediaTek will be co-partnering to create the very first test chips that utilize TSMC's advanced CoWoS technology which means that we might be looking at a chipset-esque design. The first test chips are expected to be manufactured in the second quarter of 2024 and will enter the high-end notebook market.\nImage Source: NVIDIA\nIt is also reported that the NVIDIA and MediaTek chips will co-package the CPU and GPU on the same interposer so we are likely looking at an Arm-based CPU and a discrete GPU chiplet using NVIDIA's own graphics architectures.\nNVIDIA's Tegra SOCs have been doing this for a while now, plus the company also has its Grace Hopper Superchips which combine a high-end H100 GPU & Arm-based Grace CPUs together. The Tegra and the most recent Orin SOC are mostly used for AI & robotics while the Superchips are used for HPC environments. So there really isn't a true chip by NVIDIA that can be used for the high-end notebook segment to tackle Apple and Intel.\nMediaTek also has experience in the PC notebook market with its Kompanio Arm chips that serve the Chromebook market. A custom Arm architecture designed by MediaTek & NVIDIA while using NVIDIA's in-house discrete GPU architecture can work great for the high-end notebook segment. It will be some time before we see these chips in action and based on the earlier reports, 2025 is said to be the launch timeframe for NVIDIA's CPUs so it's going to be a long ride nevertheless, these developments are definitely interesting and more competition in the PC segment, the better!\nNews Source: Dan Nystedt\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nARM Ends Its Pursuit Of Trying To Revoke Qualcomm\u2019s Chip Design License, Latter\u2019s Chief Executive Confirmed The News To Analysts\n\nOmar Sohail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArm CEO Stresses AI Demand Is Accelerating As Stock Dips 4% Following Earnings\n\nRamish Zafar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMediaTek\u2019s Dimensity 9500 Rumored To Adopt Similar Cluster As Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2 That Includes ARM\u2019s Next-Generation Cortex-X930, But No Custom Cores\n\nOmar Sohail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMediaTek Rumored To Be Preparing A Dimensity 9400+, With A Tipster Mentioning That The SoC Will Be Used In Various Chinese Flagships\n\nOmar Sohail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n99\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSpaceX\u2019s Letter To Trump Admin Blasts Foreign Duties & Fees On Satellite Service\n\n\n\n68\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n49\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\n\n\n41\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n32\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\n12V-2\u00d76 Power Connector Cooks At Over 150\u00b0C With A \u201cWater-Cooled\u201d NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090\n\n\n\n1360\nComments\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Releases Another Hotfix Driver to Resolve Black Screen Issues, Marking the Firm\u2019s Fifth Attempt to Address The Problem\n\n\n\n1300\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1285\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

During the interview, Huang told the hosts that if he were magically 30 again, he wouldn't want to start Nvidia. This is something of a surprise, coming from the founder of one of PC tech's biggest successes and now a trillion-dollar firm.The lengthy interview with AcquiredFM hosts Ben and David contains some fascinating insight, especially about pivotal times during the early days of Nvidia. The most curious thing to hear is that Jensen Huang wouldn't follow the same path if he could turn back the clock by 30 years.\u00a0Huang is very candid about his reasons for not wanting to follow the same path again. \"Building Nvidia turned out to be a million times harder than I expected it to be,\" the Nvidia CEO told the interviewers. With a 20:20 vision of times gone by, many would change some aspects of their life, but Nvidia is such a resounding success it is hard to consider it a source of regret for a founder.The Superpower of an EntrepreneurHuang hints that there is something inside him (and other entrepreneurs), which means they push ahead with projects that others consider impossible. He told the interviewers that the \"superpower of an entrepreneur\" is facing enormous tasks and asking themselves, \"How hard can it be?\" Huang asked himself this question before founding Nvidia as a PC graphics company and subsequently starting the other major ventures Nvidia has made breakthroughs in - like AI and automotive.If the above sounds somewhat negative, Huang's tone in this part of the interview isn't really regretful but more like an impassive observer. He wouldn't willingly follow the whole journey again, saying, \"I think it's too much. It is just too much.\" He references feelings like pain, suffering, shame, and embarrassment. Nevertheless, Huang lives positively and assures the interviewers, \"I'm still enjoying myself immensely and I'm adding a little bit of value, but that's really the trick of an entrepreneur.\" Moreover, he says he is still fooling himself that things are easier than prior experience might indicate.Riva 128 RetrospectiveOlder readers who have watched Nvidia's progress over the years may be interested in the major opening part of the AcquiredFM interview. In this section, Huang talks about the pivotal 'reset' to Nvidia, which precipitated the Riva 128 graphics card in 1997.The Nvidia CEO says the company had its back against a wall, and decided to go all-in with Microsoft DirectX acceleration. It wanted to make the biggest chip, with the largest quantity of the fastest memory available at the time - and at a cost point substantially higher than rivals dared.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.However, with just six months of cash left and no spare funds, Nvidia didn't do physical chip testing, only testing the Riva 128 using simulation before the production run. It turned out that only eight out of 32 DirectX blend modes were supported by shipping silicon. Nevertheless, the Riva 128 succeeded for several reasons, including its delivery of the \"world's first fully accelerated hardware-accelerated pipeline for rendering 3D.\"(Image credit: Future)Razer Boss: Me TooRazer CEO Min-Liang Tan commented upon the AcquiredFM video a few hours ago. We aren't sure if the Razer boss was being serious, but he wrote that \"I'll be honest - I wouldn't start a company either,\" on his LinkedIn feed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (32)\n\n\n\nMark TysonSocial Links NavigationNews EditorMark Tyson is a news editor at Tom's Hardware.

Many current AI agents are programmed to achieve specific objectives, such as beating a game as quickly as possible or answering a question. They can work autonomously toward a particular output but lack a broader decision-making agency.\nFan wondered if it was possible to have a \u201ctruly open-ended agent that can be prompted by arbitrary natural language to do open-ended, even creative things.\u201d\nBut he needed a flexible playground in which to test that possibility.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why we found Minecraft to be almost a perfect primordial soup for open-ended agents to emerge, because it sets up the environment so well,\u201d he said. Minecraft at its core, after all, doesn\u2019t set a specific key objective for players other than to survive and freely explore the open world.\nThat became the springboard for Fan\u2019s project, MineDojo, which eventually led to the creation of the AI bot Voyager.\n\u201cVoyager leverages the power of Chat GPT-4 to write code in Javascript to execute in the game,\u201d Fan explained. \u201cGPT-4 then looks at the output, and if there\u2019s an error from JavaScript or some feedback from the environment, GPT-4 does a self-reflection and tries to debug the code.\u201d\nThe bot learns from its mistakes and stores the correctly implemented programs in a skill library for future use, allowing for \u201clifelong learning.\u201d\nIn-game, Voyager can autonomously explore for hours, adapting its decisions based on its environment and developing skills to combat monsters and find food when needed.\n\u201cWe see all these behaviors come from the Voyager setup, the skill library and also the coding mechanism,\u201d Fan explained. \u201cWe did not preprogram any of these behaviors.\u201d\nHe then spoke more generally about the rise and trajectory of LLMs. He foresees strong applications in software, gaming and robotics and increasingly pressing conversations surrounding AI safety.\nFan encourages those looking to get involved and work with LLMs to \u201cjust do something,\u201d whether that means using online resources or experimenting with beginner-friendly, CPU-based AI models.\n\nThe AI Podcast \u00b7 NVIDIA\u2019s Jim Fan delves into large language models and their industry impact \u2013 Ep. 204\nExplore generative AI sessions and experiences at NVIDIA GTC, the global conference on AI and accelerated computing, running March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., and online.\nYou Might Also Like\nJules Anh Tuan Nguyen Explains How AI Lets Amputee Control Prosthetic Hand, Video Games\nA postdoctoral researcher at the University of Minnesota discusses his efforts to allow amputees to control their prosthetic limb \u2014 right down to the finger motions \u2014 with their minds.\nOverjet\u2019s Ai Wardah Inam on Bringing AI to Dentistry\nOverjet, a member of NVIDIA Inception, is moving fast to bring AI to dentists\u2019 offices.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSapphire Rapids\n(Image credit: Intel)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's AI business is prospering so much that the chipmaker can't satisfy the needs of all its customers.\u00a0As a result, the Korean Economic Daily\u00a0reports that Naver Corporation, the creator of Naver, South Korea's top search portal, has switched from Nvidia GPUs to Intel CPUs, citing AI GPU shortages and price hikes.\n\nNaver Corporation, previously a loyal Nvidia customer, had utilized Nvidia GPUs to power the company's AI model that identifies false listings from real ones in the Naver Map software. The Nvidia GPUs were the cornerstone of the software, performing data processing, inference, and verification workloads.\n\nWhile Nvidia's\u00a0H100\u00a0(Hopper) GPU is selling like hotcakes around the globe, the chipmaker has so many orders that it has been challenging to build enough inventory for a steady supply. For example, the cost of Nvidia's AI accelerators in South Korea has skyrocketed to 80 million won ($59,121), representing a 100% price surge over the same model that initially sold for 40 million won ($29,561) at the beginning of the year. It's challenging to procure Nvidia's AI GPUs even if companies have the cash to spend on them. The lead time has increased to 52 weeks. In response, companies like Naver Corporation have started to look for alternative suppliers.\n\nNaver Corporation has sought solace in the arms of Intel, turning back to CPUs rather than GPUs. GPUs are better for AI inference workloads, sometimes up to 10X faster than a CPU. However, Intel has made great strides with its latest Xeon processors, which have become a legitimate substitute for Nvidia GPUs. According to the Korean publication, Naver Corporation has tapped Intel's 4th Generation Xeon\u00a0Sapphire Rapids\u00a0chips for its AI servers. The South Korean tech giant had decided on Sapphire Rapids after a month of arduous testing.\n\nDue to the\u00a0hastening of the new export restrictions, Nvidia has to re-allocate up to\u00a0$5 billion worth of AI and HPC GPUs. These GPUs were previously heading to the chipmaker's Chinese customers, including Alibaba, Baidu, and Byte Dance. Too bad it didn't happen sooner because it could have helped Nvidia keep Naver Corporation as its customer.\n\nIt's unknown how big of a customer Naver Corporation is to Nvidia. Analysts reportedly think that the Naver Corporation and Intel hookup could negatively impact Nvidia's market share in the global AI market, where the chipmaker seemingly possesses approximately 80% of the pie. Intel isn't the only company that's making moves, either. Rumors going back to May claim that Microsoft is allegedly joining forces with AMD to weaken Nvidia's grip over the AI market. Suffice it to say, extreme pricing on AI-focused GPUs will certainly push companies to look for more cost efficient alternatives as needed.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (3)\n\n\n\nZhiye LiuSocial Links NavigationNews Editor and Memory ReviewerZhiye Liu is a news editor and memory reviewer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

During Intel\u2019s third quarter earnings call on Thursday, Gelsinger told analysts that the threat of either company taking away market share from Intel in the PC CPU (central processing unit) market isn\u2019t something he\u2019s worried about.  \u201cArm and Windows client alternatives \u2026 generally they've been relegated to pretty insignificant roles in the PC business,\u201d Gelsinger said when asked about reports that Nvidia is working on building an Arm-based CPU to rival Intel\u2019s own PC offerings. Qualcomm also recently announced its own Intel challenger. \u201cWe take all competition seriously \u2026 but think history is our guide here. We don't see these as potentially being all that significant overall,\u201d Gelsinger said. \u201cOur momentum is strong. We have a strong roadmap for Meteor Lake launching \u2026 Dec. 14.\u201d   Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger attends the groundbreaking of the new Intel semiconductor manufacturing facility in New Albany, Ohio, Sept. 9, 2022. (Joshua Roberts/REUTERS)  \u00b7 Joshua Roberts / reuters Meteor Lake is Intel\u2019s next-generation chip and marks a major departure from its past designs. The new chips are made up of individual pieces called chiplets that make up the CPU, GPU (graphics processing unit), and other components of a traditional chip to come together to form a whole product. The idea is to make a more efficient and powerful chip that Intel\u2019s corporate customers can easily customize. Meteor Lake also includes a NPU, or neural processing unit, to power AI operations. On Monday, Reuters reported that Nvidia is in the midst of developing its own Arm-based CPUs meant for use in Windows-based PCs to rival Intel and AMD\u2019s existing offerings. Nvidia already develops its Grace Arm-based CPU for data centers, so it\u2019s not the company\u2019s first time getting into the game.   Cristiano Amon, president and CEO of Qualcomm speaks at the 2022 Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, Calif., May 2, 2022. (Mike Blake/REUTERS)  \u00b7 Mike Blake / reuters Qualcomm, meanwhile, unveiled its latest CPU for Windows PCs, dubbed the Snapdragon X Elite, during an event held in Hawaii this week. According to the company, the X Elite will be able to power AI-based tasks and have enough performance\u00a0to tangle with Intel\u2019s PC chips and Apple\u2019s custom chips. Qualcomm has produced its own PC chips in the past, though it ran into compatibility issues when trying to run some Windows apps. The Nvidia report and Qualcomm news come as the global PC market is in the midst of a turnaround after two years of steep sales declines following a massive spike during the pandemic. Consumers purchased millions of PCs at the start of the pandemic to both work from home and stay occupied during lockdowns.   Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.  \u00b7 Yahoo Finance According to research firm Gartner, PC shipments have declined significantly over the past eight quarters. But there\u2019s hope for the industry on the horizon.   Story Continues \u201cThe good news for PC vendors is that the worst could be over by the end of 2023,\u201d Gartner director and analyst Mikako Kitagawa said via a press release in early October. \u201cThe business PC market is ready for the next replacement cycle, driven by the Windows 11 upgrades. Consumer PC demand should also begin to recover as PCs purchased during the pandemic are entering the early stages of a refresh cycle.\u201dThat should give Intel a nice boost going into the next year. But, depending on how Qualcomm\u2019s chips turn out and if Nvidia\u2019s are available by then, it could be a boon for its rivals, as well.Either way, Intel is still far and away the PC market leader, holding 70% of the market as of January 2023, and Gelsinger doesn\u2019t seem concerned about it losing that position anytime soon.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

They were joined by about a dozen other backers including the venture capital arms of General Motors Co., Honda Motor Ltd., Porsche AG and Xerox Holdings Corp.\n\u201cOur mission is to create a green manufacturing industry,\u201d said Seurat co-founder and Chief Executive Officer James DeMuth. \u201cWith our additive manufacturing technology, our print factories will provide our customers with clean manufacturing that can compete with the volumes, quality, and price points of traditional manufacturing.\u201d\nSeurat\u2019s 3D printers are designed to manufacture metal products such as wind turbine parts. According to the company, its machines are powered by optical technology that was originally developed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to support fusion research. Seurat claims that its equipment can produce metal products faster than competing systems and with more fine-grained features.\nScaling challenges\u00a0\nThe starting point of a 3D metal printing project is a container filled with metal powder. The 3D printer focuses a laser beam on the powder, which causes the metal grains to melt and coalesce into a single object. This process is repeated many times to create multiple objects and weld them together into a useful product.\nCurrently, adoption of the technology is limited because 3D metal printers are fairly slow. A printer generates a single laser beam that can only process a few pounds of metal per hour at most. As a result, the technology doesn\u2019t lend itself too well to large-scaling manufacturing.\u00a0\nIndustry players have sought to make their printers faster by equipping them with more laser emitters. The idea is that multiple laser beams can process more metal per hour than a single beam, which in theory leads to faster manufacturing speeds. In practice, however, this arrangement delivers only limited speed improvements.\nSeurat has taken a different approach. Instead of using multiple laser beams to create metal products, the company uses a single beam that it splits into numerous smaller rays. Seurat refers to its technology as area manufacturing.\nAccording to the company, the light in its 3D metal printers starts out as an infrared laser beam. This beam is split into about 2.3 million tiny light rays that are organized into a rectangular pattern. Each ray is a pixel in the rectangle.\u00a0\nIn the next step of the process, Seurat\u2019s 3D printers tune the 2.3 million tiny light beams to melt metal into a specific shape. This tuning is done by combining the infrared laser light with blue light. The task is carried out using a device called an OALV, or optically addressed light valve, that was developed at Lawrence Livermore to support the construction of fusion reactors.\nSeurat says its technology is a more capable alternative to other 3D metal printing methods. By next year, the company expects that its printers will be capable of manufacturing metal products with a feature size of 100 microns. It says rival manufacturing methods can reach a range of only 150 to 2,000 microns.\nFeature size is a metric that influences the level of detail a 3D printer can achieve when creating metal products. The smaller the feature size, the more advanced the printer. As a result, Seurat\u2019s approach theoretically makes it possible to create more sophisticated products than other manufacturing techniques.\u00a0\nThe company expects its hardware to improve significantly over time. Seurat plans to decrease its 3D printing feature size from 100 microns to 75 by 2027. In the same time frame, the company hopes to build printers that can produce 66 pounds of metal products per hour, which is several times more than what current systems support.\nSeurat expects even more significant improvements to materialize next decade. Beyond 2030, the company believes, its technology could be used to build printers that can produce 3,700 pounds\u2019 worth of metal products per hour.\u00a0\nFrom fusion reactors to wind turbines\nSeurat is currently setting up a pilot factory in the Boston area that will be dedicated entirely to 3D metal printing. The company deployed its first printer at the facility earlier this year. According to Seurat, the proceeds from the funding round it announced today will be used to install additional machines and increase production capacity.\nSeurat\u2019s technology is drawing significant industry interest. In the coming years, Siemens Energy AG plans to work with the company to print 59 tons of wind turbine components. Additionally, Seurat has secured letters of understanding for potential manufacturing deals that it says could be worth $750 million.\u00a0\nThe company\u2019s long-term plan is to set up a network of 3D metal printing facilities around the world. Those facilities will be located at or near customers\u2019 factories to simplify logistics. Because its printers are powered by renewable energy, Seurat estimates its plants could avoid up to 100 million tons of CO2 emissions by 2030.\u00a0\nPhoto: Seurat\n\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content. \u00a0\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\n\n\n\u201cTheCUBE\u00a0is an important partner to the industry.

We\u2019re also deep-diving on new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU features, technologies and resources and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.\nReleasing a 3D tutorial dubbed The Easiest VFX Tutorial Ever takes supreme confidence and the skills to back it up.\nSteve Lund a.k.a. CG Geek \u2014 the featured artist of this week\u2019s In the NVIDIA Studio installment \u2014 has both in spades. It\u2019s no surprise that over 1 million people have subscribed to his YouTube channel, which features tutorials on animation and visual effects (VFX) as well as select tech reviews.\n\nCG Geek has been a content creator for over 13 years, starting with videos on stop-motion animation before moving on to 3D software. Films and movies are his primary sources of inspiration. He grew up creating short films with his family \u2014 experimenting with and implementing video effects and 3D characters \u2014 which became a critical foundation for his current work.\nArtists can strengthen their creative arsenal with the new Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio 2, available for pickup today. It\u2019s powered by GeForce RTX 4060, GeForce RTX 4050 or NVIDIA RTX 2000 Ada Generation Laptop GPUs with 13th Gen Intel Core processors, up to 64GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD. It features a bright, vibrant 14.4-inch PixelSense Flow touchscreen, a 120Hz refresh rate, and Dolby Vision IQ and HDR to deliver sharper colors.\nThe versatile Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio 2.\nThe Easiest VFX Tutorial Ever\nCG Geek also happens to be a geek for Blender, free for 3D enthusiasts, who regularly create impressive, individualistic art.\n\u201cI love the amazing Blender 3D community,\u201d he said. \u201cWhenever you need inspiration or creative feedback, they\u2019re the most helpful, kind and talented collective of ever-growing artists.\u201d\nCG Geek wanted to make a tutorial that could prove that virtually anyone could get started in VFX with relative ease, from anywhere, at any time.\nWork on VFX from anywhere \u2014 even the outdoors.\nThe first step, he instructs, is to capture video footage. To keep things simple, CG Geek recommends mounting a camera or mobile device to a tripod. Note that the camera lens determines the focal length and sensor size \u2014 critical details to input in Blender later in the process.\nKeep track of the camera\u2019s focal length and sensor size.\nKeep a close eye on the video footage lighting for shadows and light intensity \u2014 it helps to snap a straight-down photo of the environment the 3D element will populate, namely for light bounces, to help create more realistic shadows.\nSeasoned visual effects artists can capture and scan the entire 3D area.\nNext, secure a 3D model. Create one with guidance from an NVIDIA Studio blog or watch detailed tutorials on the Studio YouTube channel. Alternatively, look online for a 3D model equipped with basic physically based rendering materials, as well as a roughness and normal map.\nSketchfab is an excellent resource for acquiring 3D models.\nNext, combine the video footage and 3D materials. Open Blender, import the video footage and line up the 3D grid floor to the surface where the model will be presented. The 3D grid doubles as a shadow catcher that will grab the shadows being cast from the 3D elements. With an added texture, lighting will bounce back against the object, resulting in heightened realism.\nThe 3D grid floor will determine where the 3D model will be placed.\nThen, light the 3D model to match the video footage. Most commonly, this is achieved by acquiring a high-dynamic range image (HDRI), a panorama with lighting data. CG Geek recommends Poly Haven for free, high-quality HDRIs. The key is picking one that resembles the lighting, color, shadow and intensity of the video footage.\nPoly Haven has HDRIs for use in VFX work.\nUse the HDRI lighting to align the sun\u2019s rotation with the shadows of the footage, adding further realism.\nLighting adjustments in Blender.\nFrom there, import camera information into Blender and render out passes for the 3D model over a transparent background in Cycles. Create as many render layers as possible for added post-render editing flexibility, especially in compositing. Shadowcatcher, glossy passes, Z depth and ambient occlusion layers are recommended for advanced users.\nSpeedy renders in Blender on NVIDIA Studio hardware.\nThese layers can then be combined in popular creative apps like Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, Blackmagic Design\u2019s DaVinci Resolve or any of the over 100 NVIDIA RTX GPU-accelerated apps. This workflow, in particular, will be completed in Blender\u2019s custom compositor.\nSpeedy renders in Blender.\nAdd shadows to the live footage with a multiple overlay. Then, carry over the 3D elements render layer to adjust the intensity of the shadows, helping them mesh better with the video capture. Individual layers can be edited to match the desired tone.\nCG Geek made use of Blender Cycles\u2019 RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in the viewport. \u201cRendering in Cycles with multiple render layers and passes, along with the NVIDIA OptiX Denoiser, made animations and early tests a breeze,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAll my rendering changes can be visualized in real time thanks to the power of NVIDIA Studio before ever even hitting that button.\u201d \u2013 CG Geek\u00a0\n\nFinally, perform simple masking on areas where the 3D model passes in front of or behind objects. CG Geek\u2019s one-minute YouTube tutorial can help guide this process. DaVinci Resolve or Premiere Pro\u2019s AI-powered magic mask features can further speed the process by automatically masking background elements, saving the effort of painstakingly editing videos frame by frame.\nThese AI features are all accelerated by the GeForce RTX 4070 GPU equipped in CG Geek\u2019s ASUS Zenbook 14 NVIDIA Studio laptop.\nAn entire workflow in a single shot.\n\u201cNVIDIA Studio laptops powered by RTX GPUs are great for portability and speed in a compact form factor.\u201d \u2013 CG Geek\n\nFor CG Geek, getting reps in, making mistakes and strengthening weaknesses are the keys to evolving as an artist. \u201cDon\u2019t get hung up on the details!\u201d he stressed. \u201cGive yourself a deadline and then get started on another project.\u201d\nFor more on the basics of 3D VFX and CGI with Blender, accelerated by the NVIDIA Studio platform and RTX GPUs, watch his featured five-minute tutorial.\nContent creator CG Geek.\nCheck out CG Geek on YouTube.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

These rules were originally slated to go into effect 30 days after publication, but it appears Uncle Sam is moving forward with uncharacteristic speed.\nIn an 8K filing released on Monday, Nvidia advised it has received notice from the US Government that the rules governing the sale of AI chips to China were \"effective immediately, impacting shipments of the company\u2019s A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotably missing from this list is Nvidia's RTX 4090, the company\u2019s mightiest gaming GPU. While the export controls are largely targeted at datacenter products, there are rules to prevent the highest performance consumer GPUs from being sold in China without license. Nvidia in its initial SEC filing warned that sales of the RTX 4090 in China would likely be impacted by sanctions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile sale of the A100 and H100 kit in China was already restricted under the previous round of export controls, Nvidia expected it would be allowed to continue selling its less powerful A800, H800, and L40S GPUs in China for a little while longer.\nNvidia declined to comment on the decision, or why the RTX 4090 wasn't included in the list of affected GPUs this time around.\n\nEx-ASML worker accused of stealing chipmaking secrets for China is Huawei to a new job\nBiden admin reveals 31 R&D tech hubs, with $500m up for grabs\nThere's no Huawei Chinese chipmakers can fill Nvidia's shoes... anytime soon\nBiden has brought the ban hammer down on US export of AI chips to China\n\nLast week, silicon-focussed analyst house Trend Force predicted Nvidia may attempt to maximise the number of GPUS allocated to Chinese customers before the export rules went into full force.\nWhether the US Department of Commerce aimed to stop that tactic by implementing the export control rules early isn't clear. We've asked the Department of Commerce for comment; we'll let you know if we hear back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, as we learned this summer, there are a lot of Chinese companies waiting on Nvidia GPUs. According to a Financial Times report from August, Chinese web giants, including Alibaba, Baidu, ByteDance, and Tencent, had ordered a $1 billion worth of A800s and had committed to buying another $4 billion worth of GPUs from Nvidia in 2024. It now appears most of those orders could be left unfulfilled.\nDespite this change, Nvidia doesn't expect the accelerated timeline to cause too many problems for its own bottom line. \"Given the strength of demand for the company's products worldwide, the Company does not anticipate that the accelerated time of the licensing requirements will have a near-term meaningful impact on its financial results,\" the SEC filing reads.\nAs The Register has explored at length, the latest round of export restrictions aren't limited to Nvidia. Intel and AMD's ability to sell high-end AI accelerators and GPUs in China is also likely impacted by the rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Register asked Intel and AMD to see if they'd received similar notices; we'll let you know if we hear anything back. Both companies are due to report their Q3 earnings reports later this month. We may hear more on the impact of these restrictions then. \u00ae \nGet our Tech Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                AI\n

You decide to support humanitarian efforts in Israel, Gaza, or both,\" the email said. The company has raised $4.5 million in the past two weeks, as it is double-matching every dollar of donations received. Huang added his own donation will come separately.\"The devastating war has caused unimaginable suffering and turned the lives of our families in Israel upside down,\" Huang wrote in the email. \"We are all worried for their safety.\"Nvidia's spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nNvidia is one of the US tech companies more directly affected by the war in Israel. The chipmaker has a large presence in the region, after having acquired Israel-based Mellanox for $6.9 billion in 2019, and now has roughly 3,300 employees based in the country. Nearly 400 of those Nvidia employees have returned to military duty, Huang said in a separate email, viewed by Insider.Earlier this month, one of Nvidia's employees was kidnapped by Hamas, as Insider previously reported. Mellanox's founder Eyal Waldman lost his daughter in an attack at a peace festival, and a brother of two Nvidia employees died in the line of duty, Huang said in a separate email from earlier this month, viewed by Insider.\"I extend my deepest condolences to our families who have suffered immense loss,\" Huang wrote earlier this month. \"NVIDIANs worldwide will rise to cover for our colleagues in Israel and pick up and offload whatever work you need. We are here for you.\"\n\nNvidia also canceled its AI conference in Tel Aviv that was scheduled to take place this month in the wake of the intensifying conflict in the region.More than 5,000 have been killed and over 15,000 injured since the war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas started on October 7, and Hamas still holds over 200 hostages, CNBC reports.Do you work at Nvidia?

Traditional semiconductor rivals like AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are entering the AI space, but so are Big Tech names like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL). In the latest episode of Next, Yahoo Finance's Senior Tech Editor Dan Howley breaks down what the chips do, how Nvidia took the lead, and what competitors are doing to catch up. For more from this episode of NEXT: How to play the AI chips race Video Transcript [AUDIO LOGO] - When it comes to the race for AI chips, NVIDIA is dominating the market. But now some of their biggest customers, Tesla, Microsoft, and Amazon are working to reduce their dependence on the company's chips. NVIDIA rivals AMD and Intel are also developing their own AI capabilities. The goal, to chip away at NVIDIA's lead and claim a chunk of the market for themselves.   [AUDIO LOGO] NVIDIA is on top of the tech world and leading the AI revolution thanks to prescient investments it made in AI processing years before anyone was talking about ChatGPT, and that's translated into some huge wins for the company and its investors. But NVIDIA is just one company. And as the AI explosion continues to reverberate across the tech industry, major players ranging from Amazon and OpenAI to Microsoft and Meta find themselves competing for all of the chips NVIDIA can pump out. And it's simply not enough. Now, a new race between tech's biggest players is heating up in which they're building their own AI chips that will give them the ability to outwit each other without having to rely so heavily on Nvidia's chips. This race is setting up to be the next big battlefield in the tech industry. But NVIDIA isn't resting on its laurels. The company is already working on a version of its next generation Superchip, the GH200, which it says offers improved technology and will be available through manufacturing partners later next year.   NVIDIA's current most advanced chip, the H100, sits in a 10.5 inch graphics card which is then bundled together into a server rack alongside dozens of other H100 cards to create one massive computer. The GH200 meanwhile combines an H100 chip with an Arm CPU and more memory. In its most recent quarter, NVIDIA's revenue jumped 101% to $13.51 billion with data center revenue, the segment that includes AI sales, up a stunning 171% versus the year prior. According to Reuters, some estimates put NVIDIA's AI market share at as much as 80%. The reason, it's not only the developers-- it's not only the processors it develops that are required to power AI applications but the complex software necessary to run them as well. And the company is increasingly creating the foundational models that tech firms use to develop AI software, ensuring that its customers stick around well into the future.   Story Continues   But with demand surging and chips selling for tens of thousands of dollars, companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla and others are increasingly leaning on their own specialized chips to power their AI ambitions called ASICs or Applied Specific Integrated Circuits. ASICs unlike GPUs are designed specifically for a specific task such as AI processing. And while they're expensive to develop, they can provide benefits in the long run by using less power and giving companies greater control over the hardware they use to power their AI software.   According to the information, Microsoft has been working on its own AI chips since 2019, and in May, Meta announced it was developing its own AI hardware. Google in August debuted its latest AI infrastructure, and Tesla is building a supercomputer based on its own chips. And while each of those companies will still need to get their hands on NVIDIA chips for now, building their own hardware could cut into the graphics giant's lead in the long run. NVIDIA is also keeping an eye on its traditional competitors, AMD and Intel. Both companies are working to try to catch up with NVIDIA in the AI race rolling out their own chips and software designed to better combat the category leader. That said, the AI chip race is still in its early stages. And while NVIDIA is a mile ahead, it will need to keep Innovating if it intends to hold on to that lead. And with products like its GH200 Superchip on the horizon, it looks prepared to do just that.

It never stops developing, and its continuing efforts in the popular AI field prove it. Its CEO Jensen Huang has done a lot for the industry, but if he could go back in time, would he do anything differently?In a recent episode of the Acquired podcast, Huang made an unexpected confession. If he found himself in 1993 again knowing all that he knows now, he would not start a company at all.\"I wouldn't do it,\" he said. \"Building NVIDIA turned out to have been a million times harder than I expected it to be, any of us expected it to be. At that time, if we realized the pain and suffering and just how vulnerable you're going to feel and the challenges that you're going to endure, the embarrassment and the shame and the list of all the things that go wrong, I don't think anybody would start a company, nobody in their right mind would do it.\"Quite a depressing thought, but it just shows that success and prosperity hide challenges that not everyone can overcome, and even the biggest bosses in the world might have serious regrets.Huang goes on to say that an entrepreneur's \"superpower\" is not knowing how difficult their goal is and asking themselves. \"How hard can it be?\" \u2013 Huang's motto he tricked himself into thinking with every project.Image credit: AcquiredHe brings up many interesting points about establishing and growing a company in the video. NVIDIA positions itself \"in a way that serves a need that usually hasn't emerged\" so when the market appears, there aren't many competitors there.From Huang, we can learn that you should always be near opportunities and create moats through an ecosystem to keep growing and be on top of your game.\u00a0\"Oftentimes, if you created the market, you ended up having what people describe as moats. Because if you build your product right... and it enabled an entire ecosystem around you to help serve that end market... you've essentially created a platform.\"If you were mindful about helping the ecosystem succeed with you, you ended up having this network of networks, and all these developers and all these customers who are built around you.\"Listen to Huang's wisdom here and join our\u00a080 Level Talent platform\u00a0and\u00a0our Telegram channel, follow us on\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Twitter, and\u00a0LinkedIn, where we share breakdowns, the latest news, awesome artworks, and more.Join discussionComments 0You might also likeSubscribeStart receiving our weekly newsletterSubscribe@LevelEighty@80Level@80lv@eighty_levelRound TableAbout & Contact usPrivacy PolicyRepublishing policyTerms of useDisclaimer\u00a9 2025.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Entrepreneur writing about Startups, VC, Leadership & EuropeOct 28, 2023, 02:00am EDTShareSaveCommentJensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA, speaks during a press conference (Photo by Sam Yeh / AFP) AFP via Getty Images\nThis week, I posted on LinkedIn about an often-overlooked topic of entrepreneurship - the loneliness that accompanies leadership.\n\n\nThis post stirred some interesting talks. Many CEOs contacted me and said they also felt lonely and found it hard to show they're human.\n\nBut if it is so difficult why do people still choose to build companies from scratch and become leaders?\n\nJensen Huang, the Founder & CEO at Nvidia, said it perfectly in a recent interview. He said if he knew how hard it was going to be to start Nvidia, he might have skipped it altogether. But it's that same \"I don't know what I don't know\" vibe that keeps him pushing his company to new heights even today. Sometimes, being a bit naive is actually a good thing. This admission underscores a universal truth in the entrepreneurial world: sometimes, not knowing is a blessing. It seems that in the entreprenuerial journey ignorance is bliss.\n\n\nI believe loneliness is closely connected to this naivety that entrepreneus all start with. It\u2019s that naivety that shields us from the brutal truth about how many startups fail, but it also puts us in a bubble. Reaching the top can feel lonely, but remember, it's filled with people who once saw the world through those same rose-colored glasses and made it.\nIn the world of entrepreneurship, the journey from an idea to a successful enterprise is fraught with uncertainties and challenges. Being an entrepreneur isn't just about having a great idea. It's also about navigating a maze filled with pitfalls, surprises and setbacks.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of September 2023By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of September 2023By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nBuilding over ten ventures has given me a front-row seat to the paradoxical role of naivety in entrepreneurship. On the one hand, it acts as a powerful catalyst, pushing individuals to take the leap into the unknown, undeterred by the statistics stacked against them and the ensuing challenges that become a relentless wave on an almost daily basis. On the other hand, it serves as a protective shield, allowing entrepreneurs to remain optimistic in the face of overwhelming odds.\n\nThe entrepreneurial journey is often romanticized as a thrilling adventure, but in reality it is a grueling marathon filled with uncertainty and constant challenges. Entrepreneurs\u2019 naivety allows them to view this journey through rose-tinted glasses, seeing opportunities where others see obstacles. This optimistic outlook is crucia becauses it fosters a unique learning environment where founders learn on the job, adapting and evolving as they navigate through uncharted territories. This hands-on experience cultivates a resilient and resourceful mindset, crucial for long-term success.\n\n\nStriking the right balance is crucial. While naivety can be a powerful motivator, overconfidence can lead to rash decisions, and a lack of awareness can result in missed opportunities. Over the decade, I have learned many things and I continue to learn - if anything that is the great lesson: I am forever a student and building ventures are my classrooms where I continually learn new things about myself.\nI know many CEOs understand the loneliness of leadership. It is a vulnerable place that many feel unwilling to openly discuss for fear of being labelled \u201cweak\u201d when in truth, it is the opposite.\nThe naivety of entrepreneurs serves as both a spark and a shield, propelling individuals forward while protecting them from discouraging realities. Jensen Huang\u2019s story serve as powerful reminder of the role ignorance plays in the entrepreneurial journey.\nFollow me on\u00a0LinkedIn.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Understandably, the price of NVIDIA\u2019s top-end do (almost) everything GPU is extremely high, as is the demand. NVIDIA came out with an alternative for many AI users and those running mixed workloads in the enterprise that is flying under the radar, but that is very good. The NVIDIA L40S is a variant of the graphics-oriented L40 that is quickly becoming the best-kept secret in AI. Let us dive in and understand why.\nWe just wanted to thank Supermicro for supporting this piece by getting us hardware. Since they managed to get us access to so many hard-to-get NVIDIA parts, we will say they are sponsoring this piece.\n\nWe also did a video since many folks saw this piece. You can find that linked above.\nNVIDIA A100, NVIDIA L40S, and NVIDIA H100\nFirst, let us start by saying that if you want to train foundational models today, something like a ChatGPT, then the NVIDIA H100 80GB SXM5 is still the GPU of choice. Once the foundational model has been trained, customizing a model based on domain-specific data or inferencing can often be done on significantly lower-cost and lower-power parts.\nPatrick With The NVIDIA H100 At NVIDIA HQ April 2022 Front Side\nThese days, there are three main GPUs used for high-end inference: the NVIDIA A100, NVIDIA H100, and the new NVIDIA L40S. We will skip the NVIDIA L4 24GB as that is more of a lower-end inference card.\nNVIDIA H100 L40S A100 Stack Top 1\nThe NVIDIA A100 and H100 models are based on the company\u2019s flagship GPUs of their respective generations. Since we are discussing PCIe instead of SXM modules, the two most significant differences between the form factors are NVLink and power consumption. The SXM modules are designed for higher power consumption (roughly twice the PCIe versions) and to be interconnected via NVLink and often NVSwitch topologies in multi-GPU assemblies. You can see an example of one of the highest-end systems available in our recent Supermicro SYS-821GE-TNHR 8x NVIDIA H100 AI server piece.\n\nThe NVIDIA A100 PCIe was launched in 2020 as the 40GB model, and then in mid-2021, the company updated the offering to the A100 80GB PCIe add-in card. Years later, these cards are still popular.\nNVIDIA A100 80GB PCIe 1\nWe first got hands-on with the NVIDIA H100 SXM5 module in early 2022, but systems started showing up in late 2022 and early 2023 as PCIe Gen5 CPUs became available.\nPatrick With The NVIDIA H100 At NVIDIA HQ April 2022\nThe NVIDIA H100 PCIe is the lower-power H100 designed for mainstream servers. One way to think of the PCIe card is a similar amount of silicon running at a different part of the voltage/ frequency curve designed for lower performance but also much lower power consumption.\nNVIDIA H100 Model And NVLink 1\nThere are some differences even within the H100 line. The NVIDIA H100 PCIe is still a H100, but in the PCIe form factor, it has reduced performance, power consumption, and some interconnect (e.g., NVLink speeds.)\nNVIDIA H100 SXM PCIe And NVL Spec Table\nThe L40S is something quite different. NVIDIA took the base L40, a data center visualization GPU using NVIDIA\u2019s newest Ada Lovelace architecture, and changed the tunings so that it was tuned more for AI rather than visualization.\nNVIDIA L40S Model And Top 2\nThe NVIDIA L40S is a fascinating GPU since it retains features like the Ray Tracing cores and DisplayPort outputs and NVENC / NVDEC with AV1 support from the L40. At the same time, NVIDIA transitions more power to drive clocks on the AI portions of the GPU.\nNVIDIA L40S 4x DisplayPort 1\nWe put this on a chart to make it easier to visualize. NVIDIA\u2019s specs sometimes vary even based on the NVIDIA source one views, so this is the best we could find and we will update it if we get an update to the specs. We also included the dual-card H100 NVL that has two enhanced H100s with a NVLink bridge between them, so treat that as a dual-card solution while the rest are single cards.\nHigh-End NVIDIA PCIe AI GPUs 2023 A100 L40 L40S H100\nThere are a few points worth looking at here:\n\nThe L40S is a massively improved card for AI training and inferencing versus the L40, but one can easily see the common heritage.\nThe L40 and L40S are not the cards if you need absolute memory capacity, bandwidth, or FP64 performance. Given the relative share that AI workloads are taking over traditional FP64 compute these days, most folks will be more than OK with this trade-off.\nThe L40S may look like it has significantly less memory than the NVIDIA A100, and physically, it does, but that is not the whole story. The NVIDIA L40S supports the NVIDIA Transformer Engine and FP8. Using FP8 drastically reduces the size of data and therefore, a FP8 value can use less memory and requires less memory bandwidth to move than a FP16 value. NVIDIA is pushing the Transformer Engine because the H100 also supports it and helps lower the cost or increase the performance of its AI parts.\nThe L40S has a more visualization-heavy set of video encoding/ decoding, while the H100 focuses on the decoding side.\nThe NVIDIA H100 is faster. It also costs a lot more. For some sense, on CDW, which lists public prices, the H100 is around 2.6x the price of the L40S at the time we are writing this.\nAnother big one is availability. The NVIDIA L40S is much faster to get these days than waiting in line for a NVIDIA H100.\n\nThe secret is that a new common way to get ahead on the AI hardware side is to not use the H100 for model customization and inference. Instead, there is a shift back to a familiar architecture we covered many years ago, the dense PCIe server. In 2017, when we did DeepLearning11 a 10x NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti Single Root Deep Learning Server cramming NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti\u2019s into a server was the go-to architecture for even large companies like search/ web hyperscalers in certain parts of the world and autonomous driving companies.\nSupermicro 4028GR TR Red V Black NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti 8x GPU\nNVIDIA changed its EULA to outlaw this kind of configuration, and it is making its software focus more on the data center parts for AI inference and training, so things are different now.\nIn 2023, think about the same concept but with a NVIDIA L40S twist (and without server \u201chumping.\u201d)\nSupermicro SYS-521GE-TNRT with 8x NVIDIA L40S Cards Installed\nOne can get similar performance, possibly at a lower price, by buying L40S servers and just getting more lower-cost GPUs than using the H100.\nNext, let us dive into that a bit more.\n\n\n\n \n\n 1 2 \n\n TAGSAda LovelaceH100HopperL40SNVIDIA \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleJabil Buys the Intel Pluggable Silicon Photonics BusinessNext articleHow to Ping over IPv4 on Windows Instead of IPv6 Patrick Kennedyhttps://www.servethehome.comPatrick has been running STH since 2009 and covers a wide variety of SME, SMB, and SOHO IT topics.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. for\u00a0Tirias ResearchFollow AuthorOct 19, 2023, 11:51am EDTShareSaveCommentThe Nvidia Jetson platform continues to expand to support the development of autonomous robotsNvidia\nNvidia has announced what the company called its \u201clargest-ever platform expansion for Edge AI and Robotics,\u201d and rightfully so. In typical Nvidia fashion, the company is bringing together years of work on several different software platforms to meet the needs of a very specific application \u2013 robotics. Nvidia has been developing solutions for robotics, or what should more appropriately be called autonomous machines, for more than a decade. In conjunction with the company\u2019s investment in artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous vehicles, Nvidia was one of the first tech companies to see the potential in future robotics platforms leveraging AI and technology developed for other segments, including automotive.\n\nForbesGenerative AI Breaks The Data Center: Data Center Infrastructure And Operating Costs Projected To Increase To Over $76 Billion By 2028By Jim McGregor\nhe announcement includes adapting generative AI (GenAI) models to the Jetson Orin platform, the availability of Metropolis APIs and microservices for vision applications, the release of the latest Isaac ROS (Robot Operating System) framework and Isaac AMR (autonomous mobile robot) platform, and the release of the JetPack 6 software development kit (SDK). According to Nvidia, these releases include more value than all the other releases over the past 10 years combined. All the areas highlighted in green in the figure below are new or updated in this platform release.\n\nThe entire hardware and software stack for the Nvidia Jetson platformNvidia\nOne of the most significant enhancements is support for GenAI. As we at Tirias Research have indicated in previous articles, GenAI will be transformative for not just people, but also machines. Nvidia is working to enable zero-shot learning, which will enable devices to learn and predict results based on classes of data rather than being trained on specific samples. This will allow for shorter training cycles and more flexible interactions with and use of the resulting models. Nvidia is also predicting a new innovation cycle for autonomous machines as much of the learning shifts from text-based solutions to video or multi-modal (text, audio & video) training. Nvidia also included its new transformer PeopleNet model to increase the accuracy of people identification. But most important is the capability of the Orin platform to execute large language models (LLMs). According to Nvidia, the platform can handle most of the available LLMs and gave examples of models that were as large as the 70-billion parameter version of Meta\u2019s Llama 2 model. In addition, Nvidia has created a Jetson Generative AI Lab for developers to start working with open-source models on the edge.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of September 2023By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of September 2023By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\nForbesGenAI Breaks The Data Center (Part II): Moving GenAI To The Edge Through On-Device ComputingBy Jim McGregor\n\nTo enable this surge in video-based learning and further development around computer vision, Nvidia is also enhancing its Metropolis framework with APIs and microservices for rapid development and management of enterprise applications. This framework extends beyond just the vision, referred to as \u201cpixel perception\u201d in the image below, to include other software solutions that allow a developer to build out a complete computer vision platform for a variety of different applications in which the equipment, connectivity, and vision requirements may vary.\n\n\n The Nvidia expanded Metropolis framework for roboticsNvidia\nThe third part of the release is the enhancement to the Isaac software stack, including the general availability of the Isaac ROS 2.0 GPU-accelerated framework built on the open-source Robotic Operating System (ROS), a new release of the Isaac Sim 2023.1 for the generation of synthetic data and robotics simulation, and Isaac AMR for the development of autonomous mobile robots.\nAnd the final part of the release is JetPack 6, which provides new features, including support for commercial new Linux distributions, new system services, and easily upgradable compute stack and advanced security features.\nWhile these announcements are not about a new hardware platform, they demonstrate how critical software is, which I would argue is more impactful than the hardware as it relates to AI and autonomous machines. It also demonstrates Nvidia\u2019s continued innovation on a platform/solution level. Tirias Research has had the opportunity to evaluate the various Nvidia platforms over the past decade and there is nothing that compares to the ease of use, extensive tutorials, software resources, and performance of the Nvidia Jetson platforms in our opinion. Robots are key to continued improvements in productivity in every industry from agriculture to manufacturing, and like AI training, Nvidia appears to have a strong leadership position with more than 1.2 million developers and 10,000 companies designing with the Jetson platform.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.The author and members of the Tirias Research staff do not hold equity positions in any of the companies mentioned.

In January, NVIDIA announced the discovery of two proteins within a collaboration with Evozyne, a genAI-focused biotech, and had recently announced a partnership with Atlas Meditech, a brain surgery intelligence platform.\nTools for techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy and the expertise needed to operate them can cost companies several millions of dollars, says Powell. \nFurthermore, drug discovery using older methods can take several years. Powell says genAI models such as Alphafold have been able to take amino acid sequences and predict their structure, significantly increasing the speed of mapping. Google DeepMind, an AI industry leader, developed AlphaFold as an AI programme that makes predictions of protein structures.\nNVIDIA is also partnering with several smaller companies and startups through its NVIDIA Inception programme. The free programme helps startups with \u201ctechnical training, go-to-market support and AI platform guidance\u201d, as per NVIDIA\u2019s website. \nPowell explains that within these partnerships, the larger company gives companies in different industries, the platform to market their businesses and propel their development. She also says NVIDIA has a few collaborations in the works that will be announced in the coming months.\nPowell spoke about the importance of collaboration within the genAI space saying: \u201cA computing platform is as good as the developers and applications that live on it.\u201d \nShe added: \u201cWe are not going to have all the ideas for all the applications and we do not even want to. We want to really invite the ideas to the platform and make it better.\u201d\n\n\n\nFree Buyers Guide\nLeading Guide to Artificial Intelligence (AI) Solutions Providers for the Pharmaceutical Industry\nThe document includes detailed information on the manufacturers and suppliers and their products, along with contact details, to inform your purchasing decision.\n\nThank you.\nYour download email will arrive shortly.

Learn More\n\n\n\nIn a research paper released today, Nvidia semiconductor engineers showcased how generative artificial intelligence (AI) can assist in the complex process of designing semiconductors. \nThe study demonstrated how specialized industries can leverage large language models (LLMs) trained on internal data to create assistants that enhance productivity. \nThe research, utilizing Nvidia NeMo, highlights the potential for customized AI models to provide a competitive edge in the semiconductor field.\nSemiconductor design is a highly challenging endeavor, involving the meticulous construction of chips containing billions of transistors on 3D circuitry maps that are like city streets \u2014 but thinner than a human hair. \nIt requires the coordination of multiple engineering teams over a span of years. Each team specializes in different aspects of chip design, employing specific methods, software programs, and computer languages.\nNvidia chip designers came up with a way for LLMs to assist them in creating semiconductor chips.\nMark Ren, an Nvidia Research director, was the lead author of the paper.\n\u201cI believe over time large language models will help all the processes, across the board,\u201d Ren said in a statement.\nThe paper was announced by Bill Dally, Nvidia\u2019s chief scientist, during a keynote at the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design held in San Francisco.\n\u201cThis effort marks an important first step in applying LLMs to the complex work of designing semiconductors,\u201d said Dally, in a statement. \u201cIt shows how even highly specialized fields can use their internal data to train useful generative AI models.\u201d\nThe research team at Nvidia developed a custom LLM called ChipNeMo, trained on the company\u2019s internal data, to generate and optimize software and assist human designers. The long-term goal is to apply generative AI to every stage of chip design, leading to substantial gains in overall productivity. The initial use cases explored by the team include a chatbot, a code generator, and an analysis tool.\nThe most well-received use case thus far is an analysis tool that automates the time-consuming task of maintaining updated bug descriptions. And a prototype chatbot that helps engineers find technical documents quickly and a code generator that creates snippets of specialized software for chip designs are also under development.\nThe research paper focuses on the team\u2019s efforts to gather design data and create a specialized generative AI model. This process can be applied to any industry. The team started with a foundation model and used Nvidia NeMo, a framework for building, customizing, and deploying generative AI models, to refine the model. The final ChipNeMo model, with 43 billion parameters and trained on over a trillion tokens, demonstrated its capability to understand patterns.\nThe study serves as an example of how a deeply technical team can refine a pretrained model with its own data. It highlights the importance of customizing LLMs, as even models with fewer parameters can match or exceed the performance of larger general-purpose LLMs. Careful data collection and cleaning are crucial during the training process, and users are advised to stay updated on the latest tools that can simplify and expedite their work.\nThe semiconductor industry is just beginning to explore the possibilities of generative AI, and this research provides valuable insights. Enterprises interested in building their own custom LLMs can utilize the NeMo framework, which is available on GitHub and the Nvidia NGC catalog, Nvidia said.\nThe paper has a lot of names on it: Mingjie Liu, Teo Ene, Robert Kirby, Chris Cheng, Nathaniel Pinckney, Rongjian Liang, Jonah Alben, Himyanshu Anand, Sanmitra Banerjee, Ismet Bayraktaroglu, Bonita Bhaskaran Bryan Catanzaro, Arjun Chaudhuri, Sharon Clay, Bill Dally, Laura Dang, Parikshit DeshpandeSiddhanth Dhodhi, Sameer Halepete, Eric Hill, Jiashang Hu, Sumit Jain, Brucek Khailany Kishor Kunal, Xiaowei Li, Hao Liu, Stuart Oberman, Sujeet Omar, Sreedhar Pratty, Ambar Sarkar Zhengjiang Shao, Hanfei Sun, Pratik P Suthar, Varun Tej, Kaizhe Xu and Haoxing Ren.\n\n\n\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

The company will also buy some more of the previous version, the A100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 Crusoe Energy\n\n\n\nCrusoe started out offering cryptomining but is switching to offer cloud AI services, along with graphics and scientific computing on its containerized high-performance micro data centers, which are located at oil wells and powered by gas that would otherwise be flared off and wasted.The company says the new GPUs will come online in early 2024, \u201cat a time when the entire compute infrastructure market is constrained due to burgeoning demand from AI/ML workloads, and Crusoe is excited to support this fast-growing market.\u201dThe company is planning to have 20,000 of the H100s available for customers, says CEO Chase Lochmiller, reports the Information, which notes that the chips will be the collateral for the loan.Digging a bit deeper, the Information says Crusoe has three and a half years to pay off the loan, and plans to generate revenue from the chips for seven years. It notes that CoreWeave, an AI cloud located in conventional data centers has also taken out debt to buy H100 GPUs, in a deal which appears the chips to work continuously and not depreciate in value for six years.Whatever the details of the deals, the Information notes: \u201cThe fate of Crusoe and other GPU cloud providers is intertwined with Nvidia's. So long as Nvidia remains dominant, its chips will be valuable for longer. And that will give Crusoe, CoreWeave, and other cloud providers a shot at generating profits.\u201dUpper90 was part of previous funding rounds for Crusoe, including a $350 million Series C equity offering in 2022, led by climate technology venture capital firm G2 Venture Partners (G2VP).G2VP said that Crusoe\u2019s business fits its mandate to \u201cscale technologies that economically decarbonize large existing industries.\"Crusoe says that its use of otherwise wasted gas reduces flaring at oil wells, and burns gas more efficiently, reducing methane emissions, claiming that in 2022 these reductions were the equivalent of taking 170,000 gasoline-powered cars off the road.However, this is also seen as \u201cgreenwashing\u201d as it reduces incidental emissions in the production of oil and gas, which scientists all agree should be left in the ground.Crusoe also makes a new and interesting claim, that \u201cCrusoe Cloud\u2019s new capacity is powered by 100 percent carbon-free energy.\"DCD has asked the company for more on that.\u201cUpper90 is thrilled to expand our partnership with Crusoe which started in 2019 with equipment financing as they scale their innovative AI product offering that combines high-performance computing infrastructure with a positive environmental impact,\u201d said Upper90 co-founder and CEO, Billy Libby. \u201cAs a firm that provides tailored debt solutions to technology companies with predictable revenue or collateral, Crusoe is a great example of businesses we're looking to back.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in Critical Power\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowering the AI era\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06 Nov 2024\n\n\n\n\nFrench government acquires preferred share in Atos' supercomputing unit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nWhere are data centers being built and why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in IT Hardware & Semiconductors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture-proof your datacenter with DDC S-Series\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21 Feb 2025\n\n\n\n\nHyperlume raises $12.5m to support development of optical interconnects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nThe drivers of chip design: AI, efficiency and geopolitics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nflare gas mitigation\n\n\nCrusoe Energy\n\n\nloan\n\n\nUpper90\n\n\nNvidia DGX H100\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\nfunding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

The Taiwan-born Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang and Foxconn chairman Young Liu shared a stage at Foxconn's annual tech showcase in Taipei on Wednesday.\"A new type of manufacturing has emerged - the production of intelligence and the data centres that produce it are AI factories,\" Mr Huang said, according to Reuters, adding that Foxconn had the expertise and scale to build these factories globally.Mr Liu also said Foxconn is trying to \"convert itself from a manufacturing service company to a platform solution company,\" citing smart cities and smart manufacturing as other applications for AI factories.Thanks to the use of the company's advanced chips in AI applications, Nvidia's stock market value has jumped to over $1 trillion as its shares more than tripled in value this year.That made it the fifth publicly traded US company to join the so-called \"Trillion dollar club\", along with Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.Meanwhile, Foxconn, which makes over half of the world's Apple products, has been trying to diversify its business and replicate its success in assembling personal computers and smartphones.In an exclusive interview in June, Mr Liu told the BBC that electric vehicles (EVs) are what will drive its growth in the coming decades.In January, Foxconn and Nvidia announced a partnership to develop autonomous vehicle platforms, in which Foxconn would manufacture electronic control units for cars based on Nvidia's chips.China attacks latest US chip restrictionsNvidia: The chip maker that became an AI superpoweriPhone maker to shift to cars as US-China ties sourArtificial intelligenceNvidiaChina-US relationsRelatedJazz great Herbie Hancock on playing with Miles Davis, AI, and why the piano makes him cry13 hrs agoCultureMarket alters application rules after AI complaints1 day agoEnglandAI offers 'generational opportunity' for schools2 days agoStoke & StaffordshireMore6 Mar 2025US charges Chinese hackers who targeted dissidentsThe Justice Department said Chinese agencies paid as much as $75,000  (\u00a358,200) for each hacked email inbox.6 Mar 2025Business5 Mar 2025What to look out for at China's National People's CongressThe BBC's Stephen McDonell breaks down what to look out for as China's leaders meet this week.5 Mar 2025Asia28 Feb 2025Trump says US will impose additional 10% tariff on ChinaHe also said he would move ahead with 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, which had been paused.28 Feb 2025Business27 Feb 2025Nvidia says AI chip sales strong despite DeepSeek fearsBoss Jensen Huang responds to concerns about an AI bubble sparked by Chinese firm DeepSeek. 27 Feb 202518 Feb 2025DeepSeek 'shared user data' with TikTok owner ByteDanceSouth Korea's data protection regulator says user data was sent to the Chinese owner of TikTok.18 Feb 2025TechnologyBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.

The restrictions were supposed to be introduced 30 days from 17 October.That was when President Joe Biden's administration announced measures to block countries, including China, Iran and Russia, from buying high-end AI chips designed by Nvidia and others.Nvidia did not say why the timeline had been moved forward.In a statement to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Nvidia said the US government said these curbs were \"effective immediately\", but added that \"given the strength of demand for the Company's products worldwide, the Company does not anticipate that the accelerated timing of the licensing requirements will have a near-term meaningful impact on its financial results\". The new restrictions bar exports of Nvidia's advanced AI chips, which had been designed for the Chinese market to comply with earlier export regulations.The acceleration of the introduction of the US curbs is the latest move in the ongoing technology dispute between Washington and Beijing.Nvidia: The chip maker that became an AI superpowerChina attacks latest US chip restrictionsChinese authorities have yet to publicly comment on Nvidia's announcement, but it hit back at the Biden administration's decision to impose new restrictions on advanced chip exports when it was announced last week.The country's foreign ministry said the curbs \"violate the principles of the market economy and fair competition\".The move was seen as an attempt to close loopholes that became apparent after an initial wave of chip controls last October.At the time, the US said the measures were designed to prevent China from receiving cutting-edge technologies that it could use to strengthen its military, especially in the field of AI.Soaring demand for Nvidia's AI chips has pushed up its share price more than threefold, making it one of the most valuable companies in the world.In May the firm joined technology giants Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft in the elite club of companies with stock market valuations of more than $1 trillion (\u00a3822bn).California-based Nvidia has come to dominate the market for chips used in AI systems.Chip giant Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which also supplies AI chips to China, has not made any announcement about the accelerated export curbs. It did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.The US Department of Commerce declined to comment on Nvidia's statement when contacted by the BBC.Nvidia and Foxconn to build 'AI factories' togetherChina attacks latest US chip restrictionsNvidia: The chip maker that became an AI superpowerChip firm briefly worth $1 trillion amid AI boomAI chip giant Nvidia sees sales more than doubleArtificial intelligenceNvidiaUnited StatesSemiconductorsChina-US relationsRelatedJazz great Herbie Hancock on playing with Miles Davis, AI, and why the piano makes him cry13 hrs agoCultureMarket alters application rules after AI complaints1 day agoEnglandAI offers 'generational opportunity' for schools2 days agoStoke & StaffordshireMore39 mins agoMoment drink falls on man's lap leading to $50m settlementA jury found Starbucks responsible for the incident, which caused a Postmates driver third-degree burns to his genital area.39 mins agoUS & Canada1 hr agoMissing American Sudiksha Konanki's family asks she be declared deadPolice have been searching for the missing University of Pittsburgh student, who was on spring break in Punta Cana, for the past two weeks. 1 hr agoWorld2 hrs agoTourist detained in US arrives back in UK, father saysPaul Burke says his daughter Becky has been released from a US immigration centre.2 hrs agoWales3 hrs agoTop US Supreme Court justice rebukes Trump's call to impeach judgeChief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement after Trump called for a judge that halted his deportations to be impeached.3 hrs agoUS & Canada6 hrs agoIrish-US exports continue to surge ahead of expected tariffsPresident Donald Trump has vowed to impose a sweeping range of tariffs on Irish goods on 2 April.6 hrs agoWorldBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.

Known as KGMoN, this global team of nine all-star data scientists and engineers use NVIDIA-accelerated techniques to compete in Kaggle challenges.\nThis Google-sponsored competition challenged participants to detect American Sign Language fingerspelled characters and translate them into text.\n\u201cIt was challenging due to the novelty of the problem \u2014 less research has been done compared to other areas,\u201d said Henkel, who worked on the competition with Darragh Hanley, senior researcher at AI solutions company DoubleYard. \u201cWhile normally you\u2019d be working in computer vision, speech recognition or speech-to-text, this falls somewhere in between.\u201d\nTheir work could help provide deaf and hard-of-hearing users of web search, map directions and texting apps the option to fingerspell words instead of using a keyboard. It could also power a dedicated sign-language-to-speech app, enabling faster, smoother communication between signers and non-signers.\nAdapting Speech Recognition AI for Fingerspelling\nInstead of word-based signs, the challenge focused on digits, special characters and phrases that are commonly spelled out \u2014 such as phone numbers, addresses and URLs.\nHenkel and his teammate\u2019s winning solution used an end-to-end model adapted from speech recognition AI. The pair also used data augmentation to bolster a training dataset of over 3 million fingerspelled characters, which were captured via smartphone videos and then converted into x, y and z coordinates that corresponded to the position of the signer\u2019s face, hand and pose in each frame of the video.\n\u201cData augmentation was essential, because an AI for fingerspelling needs to generate well across different signers,\u201d Henkel said. \u201cPeople have different styles, dialects and speeds of fingerspelling \u2014 and they may be signing at different distances from a selfie camera.\u201d\nThe duo developed their solution using a PyTorch container in NGC \u2014 NVIDIA\u2019s hub of software, services and tools \u2014 and trained the model on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs. The main model architecture they used, called Squeezeformer, is available in the NVIDIA NeMo generative AI framework.\nFrom AI Enthusiast to Kaggle Grandmaster\nHenkel first joined Kaggle six years ago after completing his doctorate degree at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in math, seeing it as an effective forum to learn about data science, AI and neural networks. Since joining the Kaggle community \u2014 first while leading a deep learning startup, and then as an NVIDIAN \u2014 he\u2019s participated in about 60 competitions, working with fellow KGMoN members as well as external collaborators.\n\u201cAfter my first Kaggle competition, I was amazed by how much you can learn by tackling a hands-on, real-world project in an environment where people openly share ideas, approaches, data and code,\u201d Henkel said. \u201cYou can see examples of solid and robust experimentation, model design and validation \u2014 it\u2019s a really dense and effective way of learning.\u201d\nHe recommends that beginners jump in to tackle Kaggle challenges they find interesting, no matter their skill level.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be scared of a complicated problem, as long as you\u2019re interested in the topic,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t have a high chance of winning a big prize, you get the most valuable learning experience by observing what others do and discuss on Kaggle.\u201d\nSince it was founded in 2020, the KGMoN team has won dozens of Kaggle competitions. All KGMoN members have earned the exclusive rank of grandmaster in Kaggle\u2019s competition category \u2014 achieved by just 300 of the community\u2019s 14 million members. In addition to participating in competitions, KGMoN members also publish open-source code and contribute to discussions on the platform.\nLearn more about the KGMoN team\u00a0and about NVIDIA life, culture and careers. \n\n\nCategories: NVIDIA LifeTags: NVIDIA NeMo | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The robot runs an expanding collection of NVIDIA Jetson-enabled edge AI to build 3D models of reefs and to track creatures and plant life. It also runs models to navigate and collect data autonomously.\nWHOI, whose submarine first explored the Titanic in 1986, is developing its CUREE robot for data gathering to scale the effort and aid in mitigation strategies. The oceanic research organization is also exploring the use of simulation and digital twins to better replicate reef conditions and investigate solutions like NVIDIA Omniverse, a development platform for building and connecting 3D tools and applications.\nCreating a digital twin of Earth in Omniverse, NVIDIA is developing the world\u2019s most powerful AI supercomputer for predicting climate change, called Earth-2.\nUnderwater AI: DeepSeeColor Model\nAnyone who\u2019s gone snorkeling knows that seeing underwater isn\u2019t as clear as seeing on land. Over distance, water attenuates the visible spectrum of light from the sun underwater, muting some colors more than others. At the same time, particles in the water create a hazy view, known as backscatter.\nA team from WARPLab recently published a research paper on undersea vision correction that helps mitigate these problems and supports the work of CUREE. The paper describes a model, called DeepSeeColor, that uses a sequence of two convolutional neural networks to reduce backscatter and correct colors in real time on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX while undersea.\n\u201cNVIDIA GPUs are involved in a large portion of our pipeline because, basically, when the images come in, we use DeepSeeColor to color correct them, and then we can do the fish detection and transmit that to a scientist up at the surface on a boat,\u201d said Stewart Jamieson, a robotics Ph.D. candidate at MIT and AI developer at WARPLab.\n\nEyes and Ears: Fish and Reef Detection\nCUREE packs four forward-facing cameras, four hydrophones for underwater audio capture, depth sensors and inertial measurement unit sensors. GPS doesn\u2019t work underwater, so it is only used to initialize the robot\u2019s starting position while on the surface.\nUsing a combination of cameras and hydrophones along with AI models running on the Jetson Orin NX enables CUREE to collect data for producing 3D models of reefs and undersea terrains.\nTo use the hydrophones for audio data collection, CUREE needs to drift with its motor off so that there\u2019s no interference with the audio.\n\u201cIt can build a spatial soundscape map of the reef, using sounds produced by different animals,\u201d said Yogesh Girdhar, an associate scientist at WHOI, who leads WARPLab. \u201cWe currently (in post-processing) detect where all the chatter associated with bioactivity hotspots is,\u201d he added, referring to all the noises of sea life.\nThe team has been training detection models for both audio and video input to track creatures. But a big noise interference with detecting clear audio samples has come from one creature in particular.\n\u201cThe problem is that, underwater, the snapping shrimps are loud,\u201d said Girdhar. On land, this classic dilemma of how to separate sounds from background noises is known as the cocktail party problem. \u201cIf only we could figure out an algorithm to remove the effects of sounds of snapping shrimps from audio, but at the moment we don\u2019t have a good solution,\u201d said Girdhar.\nDespite few underwater datasets in existence, pioneering fish detection and tracking is going well, said Levi Cai, a Ph.D. candidate in the MIT-WHOI joint program. He said they\u2019re taking a semi-supervised approach to the marine animal tracking problem. The tracking is initialized using targets detected by a fish detection neural network trained on open-source datasets for fish detection, which is fine-tuned with transfer learning from images gathered by CUREE.\n\u201cWe manually drive the vehicle until we see an animal that we want to track, and then we click on it and have the semi-supervised tracker take over from there,\u201d said Cai.\n\nJetson Orin Energy Efficiency Drives CUREE\nEnergy efficiency is critical for small AUVs like CUREE. The compute requirements for data collection consume roughly 25% of the available energy resources, with driving the robots taking the remainder.\nCUREE typically operates for as long as two hours on a charge, depending on the reef mission and the observation requirements, said Girdhar, who goes on the dive missions in St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nTo enhance energy efficiency, the team is looking into AI for managing the sensors so that computing resources automatically stay awake while making observations and sleep when not in use.\n\u201cOur robot is small, so the amount of energy spent on GPU computing actually matters \u2014 with Jetson Orin NX our power issues are gone, and it\u2019s made our system much more robust,\u201d said\u00a0\u00a0Girdhar.\nExploring Isaac Sim to Make Improvements\u00a0\nThe WARPLab team is experimenting with NVIDIA Isaac Sim, a scalable robotics simulation application and synthetic data generation tool powered by Omniverse, to accelerate development of autonomy and observation for CUREE.\nThe goal is to do simple simulations in Isaac Sim to get the core essence of the problem to be simulated and then finish the training in the real world undersea, said Yogesh.\n\u201cIn a coral reef environment, we cannot depend on sonars \u2014 we need to get up really close,\u201d he said. \u201cOur goal is to observe different ecosystems and processes happening.\u201d\nUnderstanding Ecosystems and Creating Mitigation Strategies\nThe WARPLab team intends to make the CUREE platform available for others to understand the impact humans are having on undersea environments and to help create mitigation strategies.\nThe researchers plan to learn from patterns that emerge from the data. CUREE provides an almost fully autonomous data collection scientist that can communicate findings to human researchers, said Jamieson. \u201cA scientist gets way more out of this than if the task had to be done manually, driving it around staring at a screen all day,\u201d he said.\nGirdhar said that ecosystems like coral reefs can be modeled with a network, with different nodes corresponding to different types of species and habitat types. Within that, he said, there are all these different interactions happening, and the researchers seek to understand this network to learn about the relationship between various animals and their habitats.\nThe hope is that there\u2019s enough data collected using CUREE AUVs to gain a comprehensive understanding of ecosystems and how they might progress over time and be affected by harbors, pesticide runoff, carbon emissions and dive tourism, he said.\n\u201cWe can then better design and deploy interventions and determine, for example, if we planted new corals how they would change the reef over time,\u201d said Girdar.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX, Omniverse and Earth-2.\nImage credit: Austin Greene, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: NVIDIA Isaac Sim | NVIDIA Jetson | Omniverse | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Developers can clone the GitHub repository to download the scripts needed to run the models and the associated applications on devices such as Jetson AGX Orin and Jetson Orin Nano.\n\nNVIDIA focuses on major categories of foundation models in the generative AI ecosystem.\n\n\nLarge language models capable of engaging in conversations resembling those of humans\nVision language models that enable language language models to perceive and comprehend the real world through a camera\nDiffusion models that are capable of converting simple text prompts into stunning visual creations\n\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of September 2023By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of September 2023By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nThe investments made in technologies such as Jetson-containers and the TAO Toolkit are enabling NVIDIA to extend generative AI capabilities to the edge.\n\nNVIDIA Isaac Framework\nThe Isaac framework, based on the open-source Robot Operating System or ROS, brings perception capability to edge devices.\n\n\nNVIDIA announced major improvements to perception and simulation capabilities with new releases of the Isaac ROS and Isaac Sim software at ROSCon 2023. Isaac ROS, which is based on the widely used open-source ROS, adds perception to automation by providing eyes and ears to things that move. By leveraging the power of GPU-accelerated GEMs, such as visual odometry, depth perception, 3D scene reconstruction, localization, and planning, robotics developers gain the tools necessary to rapidly engineer robotic solutions tailored to a wide range of applications.\nDevelopers can now create and bring high-performance robotics solutions to market with Jetson thanks to the general availability of the latest Isaac ROS 2.0 release.\nNVIDIA Metropolis Framework\nThe NVIDIA Metropolis framework includes GPU-accelerated SDKs and developer tools for building, deploying, and scaling AI-enabled video analytics and IoT applications from the edge to the cloud.\nThe Metropolis framework is an end-to-end vision AI development toolkit that handles all the stages of the pipeline. It combines multiple components, such as NVIDIA DeepStream, NVIDIA TensorRT and the TAO Toolkit, to accelerate the development and deployment of vision AI models in the cloud or at the edge.\nAccording to NVIDIA, an expanded set of Metropolis APIs and microservices on Jetson will be available by the end of the year to help developers quickly build and deploy scalable vision AI applications.\nKey Takeaways\nNVIDIA is moving fast to enable the Jetson family of devices to run generative AI models. While most of these models are confined to the cloud, NVIDIA is leveraging its investments in Jetpack software, Container Toolkit, TAO Toolkit, Isaac and Metropolis to put the power of generative AI in the hands of embedded developers.\nCustomers can confidently run generative AI applications based on their private data by deploying foundation models such as LLama 2 and Stable Diffusion at the edge.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.
