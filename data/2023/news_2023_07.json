The company's stock has seen a gain of 2.78% today and an 8.29% increase over the past four weeks. In this article, we will delve into NVIDIA's GF Score and its individual components to provide a comprehensive analysis of the company's performance and potential. Understanding NVIDIA's GF Score  Warning! GuruFocus has detected 11 Warning Signs with NVDA. Click here to check it out.  NVDA 30-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of NVDA  NVIDIA's GF Score stands at 82 out of 100, indicating good outperformance potential. The GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus, which uses five aspects of valuation and has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks. A higher GF Score generally signifies higher returns. When compared to its competitors, NVIDIA's GF Score is slightly lower than Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) with a GF Score of 83, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) with a GF Score of 93, and Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN) with a GF Score of 94.   NVIDIA Corp (NVDA): A Comprehensive GF Score Analysis   Financial Strength Analysis  NVIDIA's Financial Strength Rank is 7 out of 10, indicating a strong financial situation. This rank is based on factors such as interest coverage (17.29), debt to revenue ratio (0.47), and Altman Z score (34.96). These figures suggest that NVIDIA is well-positioned to manage its debt burden and maintain its financial stability. Profitability Rank Analysis  The company's Profitability Rank is 10 out of 10, indicating high profitability and consistency. This rank is based on factors such as Operating Margin (17.37%), Piotroski F-Score (5), and a consistent profitability record over the past 10 years. This suggests that NVIDIA has a strong track record of profitability, which is a positive sign for potential investors. Growth Rank Analysis  NVIDIA's Growth Rank is 10 out of 10, indicating strong revenue and profitability growth. This rank is based on the 5-year revenue growth rate (25.70%), 3-year revenue growth rate (34.50%), and 5-year EBITDA growth rate (19.40%). These figures suggest that NVIDIA has been successful in expanding its business operations and improving its profitability over the years. GF Value Rank Analysis  The company's GF Value Rank is 1 out of 10, reflected by its significantly-high price-to-GF-Value ratio of 1.61. This suggests that NVIDIA's stock may be overvalued at its current price, which could be a potential concern for value investors.   Story Continues Momentum Rank AnalysisNVIDIA's Momentum Rank is 3 out of 10, indicating a relatively low momentum ratio. This suggests that the company's stock price performance may not have a strong upward trend in the near term.ConclusionIn conclusion, NVIDIA's overall performance, as indicated by its GF Score and individual ranks, is quite impressive. The company has demonstrated strong financial strength, high profitability, and robust growth. However, its poor GF Value Rank and Momentum Rank suggest that the stock may be overvalued and lack strong upward momentum.

Or a value-priced alternative to Nvidia?TSMC is set to report earnings on Thursday.Revenue is expected to drop, but guidance is key to investors.Is TSMC undervalued relatives to Nvidia?Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC, (TSM) will report quarterly fiscal results for April to June before the opening bell on Thursday, July 20. Retail investors may join a rally if TSMC delivers impressive results.Analysts\u2014according to a Reuters poll\u2014expect a 27% decline in quarterly profits from a year ago and a 13% decline in net revenue over the same period. Company executives will hold an earnings call Thursday at 2 a.m. EDT. The biggest drag on growth is a broader slowing in economic activity among central bank rate hikes.Lowered ExpectationsTSMC\u2019s revenue is forecasted to drop to $5.6 billion in the quarter from $7.6 billion a year ago. A normalization in supply chains in the post-COVID period have dragged down chip pricing. The chip sector is typically slower in the second quarter because of seasonal factors.In the TSMC June revenue report released last week, the company said revenue declined 11.4% from May and 11.1% from June 2022. While that is concerning, the company expects AI applications to boost growth in the second half of this year. If executives sound optimistic, it could incite a rally.TSMC versus NVDA \u2013 A better-valued play on AI?TSMC, as Nvidia's (NVDA) primary contract supplier, capitalizes on the artificial intelligence wave currently taking place. However, Nvidia outclasses TSMC significantly in year-to-date performance (see chart below).Much of this performance gap could be caused by retail investors' preference for NVDA, catapulting the chip maker into the world of meme stocks. Nvidia often ranks within the top five most-mentioned stocks on Reddit's popular WallStreetBets forum.The fundamentals spotlight TSMC as a potential value play. A comparison of Nvidia and TSMC's forward earnings shows TSMC offers better value.In terms of the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio\u2014an investor-favored metric for assessing a company's stock price relative to its earnings\u2014TSMC's PE ratio stands at 16.9. This is significantly lower, and thus notably more appealing, than NVDA\u2019s PE ratio of 244. Based on this analysis, TSMC appears a more attractive investment. Will TSM recognize Nvidia\u2019s stock price momentum after earnings? The upcoming earnings report will reveal the answer soon.Thomas Westwater, a tastylive financial writer and analyst, has eight years of markets and trading experience. @fxwestwater\u00a0For live daily programming, market news and commentary, visit tastylive or the YouTube channels tastylive (for options traders), and tastyliveTrending for stocks, futures, forex & macro.Trade with a better broker, open a tastytrade account today. tastylive, Inc. and tastytrade, Inc. are separate but affiliated companies.Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors.

Nvidia also adapted its graphics cards to the specialized needs of data centers, as its semiconductors help whisk information around the ether. The most obvious opportunity -- at least in recent memory -- is artificial intelligence (AI), which dominates the headlines. Nvidia AI chips are arguably the gold standard for providing the computational horsepower necessary to train and run AI models once training is complete.\nYet there's one opportunity that is largely flying under the radar that could turn out to be Nvidia's next big growth engine.\n\nImage source: Nvidia.\n\nLet's go for a drive\nA quick look at the company's latest investor presentation reveals the opportunity that could help \"drive\" Nvidia's future growth -- transportation. The company has long touted a total addressable market (TAM) of over $1 trillion. Investors might be surprised to find that $300 billion of that opportunity is tied to the auto industry. Nvidia estimates that there will be in the neighborhood of 100 million vehicles per year that will require hardware for assisted driving and autonomous systems.\u00a0\nThis includes systems provided to car and truck makers, tier-1 automotive parts suppliers, robotaxi companies, and even mobility systems for smart factories. It also encompasses autonomous vehicle (AV) software, simulation systems, sensors, and the cloud computing necessary to tie it all together.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, before you dismiss this idea, this technology isn't limited to mass adoption of fully self-driving systems -- level 5 systems -- which could be years or even decades away. Nvidia's Drive system provides end-to-end solutions for all manner of advanced driving and driver-assist systems.\nA host of automakers introduced -- or are on the verge of introducing -- level 2 and level 3 systems that can \"steer, accelerate or decelerate, and pass other cars without human input,\" according to Nvidia. The company goes on to say some vehicles can \"maneuver around incidents or traffic jams,\" with input from the driver. These systems allow drivers to take their hands off the wheel or feet off the pedals.\n\nShow me the money\nNvidia is quick to point out that its automotive segment is still in the early stages of development. During the company's fiscal 2023 (ended Jan. 29), the segment generated revenue of just $903 million, or just 3% of Nvidia's total sales. That said, this segment will likely become more important over time. Nvidia points out that while infotainment systems historically drove revenue in the segment, the future opportunity will be fueled by AV systems and its AI cockpit platform, and the full software stack. Furthermore, the company says that the \"adoption of centralized car computing and software-defined vehicle architectures\" will be the primary driver of future growth.\nThis opportunity will begin to play out in the near future. Nvidia already notched more than $14 billion in design wins, which will unfold over the coming six years. Furthermore, given the long and growing list of automotive partners and the recent acceleration in AI technology, Nvidia will not only add new partners in the coming years, but also likely expand on its existing relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat this means for Nvidia investors\nKnowledgeable investors will note that there's a degree of overlap between AI and Nvidia's automotive aspirations -- and they'd be right. However, much of the discussion is centered on how AI will increase productivity, largely the result of improving software and its integration with cloud computing. Nvidia has listed the automotive segment as a separate and distinct opportunity.\nIn fact, the global AV market topped out at roughly $147 billion in 2022 and is expected to climb to $2.3 trillion by 2030, according to estimates by Next Move Strategy Consulting.\u00a0\nNvidia continues to attract a veritable who's-who of automakers, parts suppliers, and software developers to tap this large and growing opportunity. Don't be surprised if -- sometime soon -- this becomes Nvidia's next big growth driver.\n\n\n\nDanny Vena has positions in Nvidia. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Nvidia.

To skip our detailed analysis of the semiconductor industry and the impact of AI on the sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Buy For The AI Boom. The Impact Of Artificial Intelligence The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has revolutionized almost every industry and sector in the market today, and the technology sector is perhaps the most heavily impacted by this frenzy. Semiconductor companies, in particular, are well-positioned to benefit from the AI boom, with many companies reporting higher sales and revenue forecasts directly correlated with the developments being seen in this space today. One example is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which forecasted its second-quarter revenue to come in at $11 billion, going above analyst estimates. Jensen Huang, the founder, and CEO of the company, noted that they will be increasing the supply of their family of products to meet the rising demand for them. On May 24, Needham & Co.'s Global Semiconductor Analyst, Rajvindra Gill, was invited on CNBC to share his insights on NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) first-quarter earnings report. Here's what he had to say: \"If you look at their guide for July, it's $11 billion. That's $4 billion over the Street. I thought it was a typo when I first looked at it - it's a massive guide up. Some of that might be higher pricing for their H-100.\"  According to Gill, the \"massive guide up\" may have to do a lot with the increasing demand for NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) H-100, a demand he considers to be genuine and highly beneficial for the company. All in all, the company seems to have paved for itself a path for success in the rapidly transforming AI space at present and in the future. In an interview on CNBC Overtime this May, CEO Huang had the following to say on the future of AI: \"We have reinvented computing for the first time since the IBM system 360 60 years ago. There's a trillion dollars worth of data center infrastructure based on the old method of doing computation. Now we have accelerated computing and we have the killer app for computing called generative AI.\"  According to Huang, NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) recent partnership with ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is also \"a fantastic growth opportunity\" for both these companies in relation to their AI endeavors. The latter company is now offering the former access to immense amounts of data and \"the engine for transforming all of that data and domain expertise into generative AI models.\"   Story Continues Considering the immense benefits to be gained from active involvement in the AI space, many semiconductor companies are throwing in their cap with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). For example, Lisa Su, the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), mentioned in her June interview with CNBC that her company will be working on producing its own next-generation AI chip by the end of 2023. The next-generation GPU is aimed to pave the way for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to rival other semiconductor companies working on AI products today. Here are some comments from Su's interview:\"Everybody's talking about AI. We've been working on this roadmap for many, many years. M1-300 is our newest generation chip and frankly, it's incredible. I mean, the amount of technology we have on this, a hundred and fifty-three billion transistors. Everybody's talking about ChatGPT and Large Language Models, and M1-300 is actually designed exactly for this use case.\" Rising Demand For AI ChipsAccording to the interview, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) expects to sample its new chip by the third quarter and be in production by the end of 2023. Su's comments also signal that the company is focusing on making AI, particularly generative AI, its priority as it produces its new chips to meet the demand for AI chips. Here's what Su noted on this matter:\"What we see is that there's a tremendous demand for GPUs in AI space, for both training and inference. We work with all of the largest cloud manufacturers as well as many of the largest enterprise guys. And so, you know, the key is 'let's get these products to market as fast as possible.'\" According to Su, the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for chips like these is $30 billion in 2023, which her company plans to grow to over $150 billion. This highlights how not just the two companies mentioned here but others like QUALCOMM, Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) and more will also have their eyes set on the prize in this space. Consequently, several semiconductor companies today are aiming to produce semiconductors and chips for AI to leave their mark and satisfy their customers. As this continues, these companies may soon become some of the best AI stocks or AI chip makers in the market. We have thus compiled a list of the companies we think are the best ones to play the AI boom.  10 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Buy For The AI Boom  Photo by Slejven Djurakovic on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe used a stock screener to get our list of the top semiconductors stocks in the market today and then ranked them using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter when 943 hedge funds were tracked.

CEO Elon Musk often says some wild things, but praise for competitors isn't often among them.\u00a0\nThat's why it was noteworthy that Musk mentioned none other than AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA -2.53%) on the call a couple of times. The implications for Nvidia shareholders are significant.\n\nTesla's Dojo will use Nvidia AI chips after all\nA couple of years ago, Tesla officially announced its newest supercomputer, Dojo -- a massive data center used to train its full self-driving (FSD) software for its cars. Along with the announcement, it was revealed the electric vehicle leader had also developed its own chip, called the D1, to train the AI algorithms needed for FSD. This was a big deal, because up to this point, Tesla had been using Nvidia GPUs to power this AI training. \u00a0\nThis is in keeping with Tesla's practice of designing its own hardware and software in-house when it deems it necessary, either to cut costs and dependence on suppliers, or when something it needs isn't available on the market. Back in 2018, Tesla announced it had designed its own chips for the on-board computers in its cars, ditching the systems Nvidia had designed for the EV maker (a lineup of GPUs it had dubbed \"Tesla\"). \u00a0\nAs far as I could tell, the Dojo D1 custom chip announcement was once again a defeat for Nvidia, which has tons of competitors trying to duplicate what it has accomplished in AI chip design. Few, if any, have been successful like Tesla has been in these efforts.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBut then again, there's more to this story.\nMusk doles out praise for Nvidia\nTurns out that this new Dojo data center will be using plenty of Nvidia GPUs after all. Tesla needs to process an enormous amount of real-world footage recorded by its cars on the road (used to train the FSD algorithm, which relies entirely on cameras, versus a blend of cameras and other sensors adopted by other automotive companies). In commenting on this, Musk clarified that Dojo will use a blend of Nvidia and custom-designed D1 chips. \n\nLater in the call, Musk expanded on those comments, doling out praise for Nvidia and its co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang:\n\nWe're using a lot of Nvidia hardware. We'll continue to use -- we'll actually take Nvidia hardware as fast as Nvidia will deliver it to us. Tremendous respect for Jensen and Nvidia. They've done an incredible job. And frankly, I don't know, if they could deliver us enough GPUs, we might not need Dojo. But they can't. They've got so many customers. They've been kind enough to, nonetheless, prioritize some of our GPU orders. \n\nWhat Tesla will spend on Dojo in the next year\nMusk also said that Tesla will spend \"well over $1 billion on Dojo\" through the end of 2024 (not just with Nvidia, but no doubt with other suppliers too). That's also significant, given that Dojo is already up and running now. This speaks to the value of the newest Nvidia AI systems' ability to quickly shred its way through massive amounts of video data. Dojo is in operation, but the latest and greatest hardware (as well as some Tesla in-house-designed software) can apparently offer a big upgrade. \n\n\n\n\n\nAs to Nvidia not being able to get enough GPUs to Tesla, those \"many other customers\" Musk refers to include all the public cloud computing infrastructure giants (each of which operate many data centers around the world): Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alphabet Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud, to name just the biggest publicly traded four. All of these companies are seemingly in a race to add Nvidia hardware to their data centers so as not to be left behind in a new AI era.\u00a0\nThe implied reality here is that Tesla's own D1 chip isn't as good as Nvidia's, but Tesla will have to make do with what's available.\u00a0\nSuch is the position of strength Nvidia finds itself in right now. With generative AI (including self-driving car AI software) all the rage right now, the GPU designer is the premium option, and it can't keep up with demand. The question now is how long the line out the door will last for what is now the world's most valuable semiconductor company.\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Learn more. Updates to this post have been made below, covering how to get started with OpenUSD.\nFrom smart factories to next-generation railway systems, developers and enterprises across the world are racing to fuel industrial digitalization opportunities at every scale.\nKey to this is the open-source Universal Scene Description (USD) framework, or OpenUSD, along with metaverse applications powered by AI.\nOpenUSD, originally developed by Pixar for large-scale feature film pipelines for animation and visual effects, offers a powerful engine for high-fidelity 3D worlds, as well as an expansive ecosystem for the era of AI and the metaverse. Across automotive, healthcare, manufacturing and other industries, businesses are adopting OpenUSD for various applications.\nHow Developers Use OpenUSD\nDevelopers can use the extensibility of OpenUSD to integrate the latest AI tools, as well as top digital content-creation solutions, into their custom 3D workflows and applications.\nAt enterprises like BMW Group, in-house developers are building custom applications to optimize and interact with their digital twin use cases. The automaker developed an application that allows factory planners to collaborate in real time on virtual factories using NVIDIA Omniverse, an OpenUSD development platform for building and connecting 3D tools.\nStartups like Move.ai, SmartCow and SyncTwin\u00a0are also developing groundbreaking metaverse technologies with OpenUSD. Using USD in Omniverse\u2019s modular development platform allows startups and small businesses to easily launch new tools in the metaverse for larger enterprises to use.\nIn addition, leading 3D modeling and visualization solution providers, including Esri, Bentley Systems and Vectorworks, are connecting their technologies with OpenUSD to enable new capabilities in the metaverse and reach more customers. Building on OpenUSD ensures their applications can be continuously expanded to meet the industrial metaverse\u2019s evolving needs.\n\u201cUSD helps us provide customers with even more flexibility in the 3D design process,\u201d said Dave Donley, senior director of rendering and research at Vectorworks. \u201cBy embracing USD, Vectorworks and its users are poised to lead the charge toward a more collaborative and innovative future in industries such as architecture, landscape design and entertainment.\u201d\nWhy Developers Use OpenUSD\nLinear and siloed workflows used to be the norm in 3D content creation. Today, enterprises must integrate their diverse, distributed, highly skilled teams and expand their offerings to remain competitive \u2014 most notably in generative AI.\nFluid design collaboration is critical for this, as is the ability for developers to work in open, modular and extensible frameworks. As the pace of AI and metaverse innovation increases, businesses attempting to build new features and capabilities in closed environments are likely to lag behind.\nThe 3D worlds of the metaverse \u2014 which are ushering in a new era of design, simulation and AI advancements \u2014 require a common framework to enable scalability and interconnection. As with the 2D web, the success of the metaverse will depend on its interoperability as governed by open standards and protocols.\nOpenUSD is well-suited for diverse metaverse applications due to its extensibility and ability to support a wide variety of properties for defining and rendering objects. More than just a file format, the interchange framework connects a robust ecosystem of creative and developer tools.\nCesium, a platform for 3D geospatial workflows, uses USD to enable enterprises building industrial metaverse applications in construction, robotics, simulation and digital twins for climate change.\n\u201cLeveraging the interoperability of USD with 3D Tiles and glTF, we create additional workflows, like importing content from Bentley LumenRT, Trimble Sketchup, Autodesk Revit, Autodesk 3ds Max and Esri ArcGIS CityEngine into NVIDIA Omniverse in precise 3D geospatial context,\u201d said Shehzan Mohammed, director of 3D engineering and ecosystems at Cesium.\n3D tools interoperate seamlessly with OpenUSD, allowing users to work efficiently across various tools and pipelines. USD\u2019s efficient referencing and layering allows teams to non-destructively edit projects in real time and preserve all source content, enabling iterative, collaborative workflows. Designed to handle large-scale scenes with millions of assets and complex datasets, OpenUSD is ideal for developers building applications to support virtual worlds.\nLearn more about the unique capabilities of USD in the video below, as well as in the article, \u201cWhat You Need to Know About Universal Scene Description.\u201d\n\nOmniverse: The Platform for Building With OpenUSD\nNVIDIA Omniverse interconnects diverse 3D tools and datasets with OpenUSD to unlock new possibilities for large-scale, physically accurate virtual worlds and industrial digitalization applications.\nBuilt for developers by developers, Omniverse is open and highly modular. Omniverse Code and Kit enable developers to build advanced, real-time simulation solutions for industrial digitalization and perception AI. They can use all of the platform\u2019s key components, such as Omniverse Nucleus and RTX Renderer, and core technologies to develop solutions designed for their customer needs.\nPeople of all experience levels can build with OpenUSD on Omniverse. Beginners can develop tools with little to no code using existing platform extensions. Experienced developers can use templates or build from scratch with Python or C++ to produce their own powerful apps and extensions \u2014 as well as combine them with existing ones to create tools customized for their needs. In addition, visual programming tools like OmniGraph make it easy to set up and perform advanced procedural tasks with just a few clicks.\nFor example, a warehouse simulation tool can be developed by combining extensions for building layout, warehouse objects, smart object placement and user interfaces that can be fine-tuned for specific needs.\nPlus, Omniverse foundation applications like USD Composer and USD Presenter are modular, so users can work with just the functionality they need, and add their own code or extensions to customize apps for different workflows. Developers can easily access and tap into the Python source code of Omniverse extensions in Omniverse Kit.\nGet Started Developing With OpenUSD\nEvaluating whether applications and assets are compatible with OpenUSD is simple with the RunUSD validation service. Join the OpenUSD Developer Program to get access to the service, along with curated OpenUSD resources. For the latest tutorials and more, visit the OpenUSD resources page.\nGet started with NVIDIA Omniverse by downloading the standard license free, or learn how Omniverse Enterprise can connect your team. Developers can check out these Omniverse resources to begin building on the platform.\u00a0\nStay up to date on the platform by subscribing to the newsletter and following NVIDIA Omniverse on Instagram, LinkedIn, Medium, Threads and Twitter.

What has catalyzed the massive double-digit swing for RXRX stock? Well, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) just invested $50 million to \u201cboost Recursion\u2019s drug-discovery companies.\u201d\nPrior to today\u2019s announcement, RXRX stock sat in negative territory for the year. Now, at the time of this writing, shares are up more than 50% year-to-date (YTD). As The Wall Street Journal\u00a0points out, earlier this morning, Recursion added nearly $1 billion to its market capitalization.\nAs Bloomberg reports, the rally in RXRX stock is a sign that AI hype has finally begun to shift into the biotech sector, which badly needs the enthusiasm. According to Keybanc analyst Scott Schoenhaus, the agreement between Recursion and Nvidia represents \u201ca meaningful validation step for the AI to drug/molecule development space in general.\u201d\nOn the technical front, Bloomberg also points out that RXRX has received interest from short sellers. Fintel notes that RXRX\u2019s short interest stands at 13.44% of its float. Its short interest ratio clocks in at 14.05 days to cover.\n\nRisks and Rewards for RXRX Stock\nWhy has RXRX stock jumped so high on news of Nvidia\u2019s investment?\nThe upside potential for biotech enterprises integrating AI and machine learning (ML) protocols primarily centers on accelerated processing capabilities. Advanced algorithms can crunch datasets without skipping a beat, theoretically decreasing the time between hypothesis and commercialization.\nIn addition to shorter drug development timelines, AI and ML may also help lower costs. Essentially, rather than fumbling around with pathways that eventually lead to scientific dead ends, digitally intelligent solutions could help focus efforts toward initiatives with the greatest probabilities of success.\nFor RXRX stock, which has suffered sharp losses against a long-term framework, AI may put the underlying company on the right track again. Still, investors need to be aware of separating the sizzle from the steak.\nAs the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mentioned in a recent discussion paper, AI/ML should be used to \u201cfacilitate innovation while protecting public health.\u201d Additionally, on the technological side, AI also still greatly depends on data.

Nvidia is the world's largest producer of discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) for high-end video games and data centers. Its data center business has grown like a weed over the past few years as more organizations upgraded their servers to process advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) tasks.\nWolfspeed, formerly known as Cree, develops wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductors made from silicon carbide and gallium nitride -- which can operate at higher voltages, temperatures, and frequencies than traditional silicon chips. The resilience and energy efficiency of its WBG chips make them well suited for short-length LEDs, lasers, military radars, and 5G base stations. Wolfspeed also sells silicon carbide materials to electric vehicle (EV) makers for the production of batteries and powertrains.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBut over the past five years, Nvidia generated a whopping gain of more than 1,000% for its investors. Wolfspeed's stock declined 3% during that period as the benchmark Philadelphia Semiconductor Index advanced about 150%. Will Nvidia continue to outperform most of its industry peers, or is it finally time for Wolfspeed to shine?\nThe bull and bear case for Nvidia\nNvidia's growth accelerated significantly during the pandemic as people bought new PCs for online classes, remote work, and high-end gaming. Its sales of data center GPUs also soared as more companies upgraded their servers to cope with the high usage of cloud-based services and the need to crunch all that data with AI algorithms. Its acquisition\u00a0of the data center networking company Mellanox in April 2020 also expanded its data center business and inorganically boosted its sales.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia's revenue rose 53% in fiscal 2021\u00a0(which ended in Jan. 2021) and 61% in fiscal 2022.\u00a0Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) grew 73% in fiscal 2021 and 78% in fiscal 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in fiscal 2023, its revenue stayed nearly flat as its adjusted EPS\u00a0dropped 25%. That abrupt slowdown was caused by difficult comparisons to the pandemic, plummeting sales of new PCs, and intense macro headwinds for data center operators. At the time, analysts expected that slowdown to continue throughout fiscal 2024.\nHowever, the rise of generative AI platforms like ChatGPT and DALL-E over the past year flipped that bearish thesis on its head. That sudden paradigm shift sparked a buying frenzy in Nvidia's top-tier data center GPUs, and analysts now expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to increase 59% and 113%,\u00a0respectively, for the full year.\nThe bulls believe the AI boom prematurely halted Nvidia's cyclical downturn and will kick off a new multiyear growth cycle. The bears believe the bulls are counting their eggs before they hatch, and they'll note that a lot of that growth has already been priced into its shares at 55 times forward earnings and 23 times this year's sales.\nThe bull and bear cases for Wolfspeed\nWolfspeed's growth cooled off during the pandemic as the crisis disrupted its supply chains and curbed the expansion of China's EV market. That's why its revenue declined 16% in fiscal 2020 (which ended in June 2020). In fiscal 2021, its revenue rose 12% as its automotive\u00a0and radio frequency (RF) chip markets gradually stabilized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fiscal 2022, its revenue grew 42% as the auto, industrial, and energy markets\u00a0experienced post-pandemic recoveries. It expects its revenue to rise between 20% and 23% in fiscal 2023 -- even though it still faces tough macro headwinds -- as it starts recognizing revenues from its newly opened Mohawk Valley fab in upstate New York in the second half of the year.\nThat new fab is the world's largest 200 mm silicon carbide plant, and Wolfspeed believes it will reach a 20% capacity utilization rate by the end of fiscal 2024.\u00a0Over the long term, it expects that rate to continue climbing as silicon carbide chips gradually replace traditional silicon chips, and it expects the expansion of the new fab's 200 mm chipmaking technologies to reduce its overall die cost by more than 50%.\nThose rising gross margins, along with its recent divestments and other\u00a0cost-cutting measures, could help it eventually turn a profit. But for now,\u00a0analysts expect it to stay unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis through at least 2025.\nThe bulls will argue that Wolfspeed's first-mover advantage in the silicon carbide space could make it a great long-term investment and that its stock isn't too expensive at eight times this year's sales. The bears believe Wolfspeed will struggle to narrow its losses as it ramps up its production of 200 mm chips and that other larger chipmakers -- most notably ON Semiconductor\u00a0and STMicroelectronics -- are also\u00a0gradually creeping into the silicon carbide market.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe better buy: Nvidia stock\nNvidia's stock is pricey, but it's easy to see why it deserves a premium valuation. Wolfspeed could continue to expand over the next few years, but it faces tougher competitive headwinds than Nvidia and doesn't have a clear path toward profitability. I wouldn't rush to buy either of these semiconductor stocks right now, but it certainly seems like Nvidia will continue outperforming Wolfspeed for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\nLeo Sun has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

From transportation to medicine, AI is opening up new possibilities that were previously relegated to the realm of science fiction. The proliferation of AI across almost every sector of the global economy could represent a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for growth investors.\nAdobe (ADBE -2.31%) and Nvidia (NVDA -2.53%) are two companies at the forefront of the AI revolution. Adobe is adding generative AI tools like Firefly to its content-creation software, which allows users to create and alter content based on text prompts. On the other hand, Nvidia is a top computer chip maker whose products are used in a wide variety of applications -- including autonomous vehicles, virtual computing, and cryptocurrency mining -- and are central to many AI technologies.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhich of these top AI stocks is the better buy right now?\nThe case for Adobe\nAdobe, with a market cap of around $224 billion, is still focused on growth. The large-cap tech company does not pay dividends to its shareholders at the moment. However, Adobe rewards its shareholders in other ways. For example, it bought back 7.7 million shares in its fiscal first and second quarters of 2023.\nAdobe reported record Q2 revenue of $4.82 billion in June, driven in large part by its Digital Media business. This segment is projected to be a key contributor to the company's expected revenue growth in the coming years. Turning to the specifics, analysts estimate that Adobe will grow its revenue by 9.8% in 2023 and 12% in 2024.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuying into Adobe's supercharged growth story isn't cheap, however. With a forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio of 30.6, the digital content creator's shares are considerably more expensive than its large-cap tech peers (average forward-looking P/E ratio of 17).\u00a0\nHowever, AI features like Firefly ought to drive sustainable levels of top-line growth for years to come. Firefly should help the company both retain current customers and attract new users to its suite of products by making complex editing tools like Photoshop more accessible for beginners. As a result, Adobe's stock arguably deserves its premium valuation.\u00a0\nThe case for Nvidia\u00a0\nNvidia is one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market capitalization of over $1 trillion. The company rewards its shareholders with a modest dividend of 0.04% per year, as well as a generous stock buyback program.\u00a0\nIn 2023, Nvidia's management is authorized to buy back $15 billion worth of its own stock. The company also has plenty of room to increase its dividend, as it only paid out 8.33% of its earnings to shareholders over the prior 12 months. However, management seems more interested in reinvesting its profits into growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough Nvidia is a leader in AI, it faced some challenges in its 2024 fiscal first quarter. During the three-month period, revenue dropped by 13% relative to the same period a year ago. This double-digit revenue decline was mainly due to lower demand for its gaming and professional visualization products. On the bright side, Nvidia's revenue from its data center and automotive segments grew by a healthy 14% and 114%, respectively.\u00a0\n\nAnalysts expect Nvidia to quickly bounce back from this disappointing fiscal first quarter. For the rest of its fiscal 2024, the company is projected to grow its annual revenue by a noteworthy 58.2%, and by another 27.4% in fiscal year 2025. Nvidia's exceptional growth prospects reflect the rising demand for AI-based solutions across a wide range of industries.\nThe downside is that Nvidia's stock price likely already reflects its impressive growth potential. The company's shares trade at a whopping 55.2 times forward earnings, which is much higher than the average of its large-cap tech peers and Adobe.\nVerdict\nIn this head-to-head matchup, Adobe screens as the better AI play. The simple reason is that Nvidia's shares are incredibly expensive at current levels. And while Adobe's stock is far from cheap, its AI initiatives could support additional share price appreciation over the next two years. Nvidia, on the other hand, appears ripe for a pullback, based on its enormous premium.\n\n\n\nGeorge Budwell has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Adobe and Nvidia. The Motley Fool recommends the following options: long January 2024 $420 calls on Adobe and short January 2024 $430 calls on Adobe.

Musk discussed Tesla\u2019s massive need for high-powered Nvidia chips during Tesla\u2019s Q2 earnings call, during which he discussed the company\u2019s custom-built supercomputer.  \u201cWe\u2019re using a lot of Nvidia hardware,\u201d Musk said during the earnings call. \u201cWe\u2019ll actually take Nvidia hardware as fast as Nvidia will deliver it to us. Tremendous respect for [CEO] Jensen [Huang] and Nvidia. They\u2019ve done an incredible job.\u201d Shares of both Nvidia and Tesla were down 2% and 7%, respectively, Wednesday along with the rest of the broader market and tech sector. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    116.84 -2.69 (-2.25%)  As of 3:19:51 PM EDT. Market Open.   NVDA TSLA   Advanced Chart    According to Musk, Nvidia has too many customers vying for its products. And while the company has prioritized some of Tesla\u2019s orders, Nvidia can\u2019t provide as many chips as the electric automaker requires. Tesla has worked with Nvidia for years, and the electric automaker already runs a Nvidia-powered supercomputer. But because of the boom in AI, demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips is pressuring customers like Tesla.   Nvidia Corp CEO Jensen Huang speaks at the COMPUTEX forum in Taipei, Taiwan May 29, 2023. (REUTERS/Ann Wang)  \u00b7 Ann Wang / reuters To address this, Musk says Tesla is building its own supercomputer, called Dojo, that runs on custom silicon. The company says it's beginning construction of the machine this month. \u201cIf [Nvidia] could deliver us enough GPUs, we might not need Dojo, but they can\u2019t,\u201d Musk said. Nvidia is benefiting handsomely from the AI boom, and its growth is unlikely to slow anytime soon. Tesla\u2019s need for Nvidia, and its own hardware, also points to the wide breadth of the AI market and variety of use cases that range from Musk\u2019s pursuit of self-driving vehicles to smart home systems.  The current explosive interest in AI kicked off when OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT generative AI chatbot in November 2022. One of the fastest-growing apps in history, ChatGPT jump-started a generative AI revolution. Microsoft (MSFT), which is investing billions in OpenAI, used the company\u2019s technology in its Bing chatbot and Edge web browser it launched in February.   Sign up for the Yahoo Finance newsletter.  \u00b7 Yahoo Finance Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) followed that news with its own AI announcements during its Google I/O conference in May. Meta (META) is already working on its own generative AI capabilities, and according to Bloomberg, Apple (AAPL) is also developing its version of the technology. Shares of Microsoft and Alphabet are up 45% and 36%, respectively, year to date. Nvidia\u2019s shares are up a whopping 214% thanks in part to the fact that it\u2019s the market leader in AI chips that companies need to train and operate their AI platforms.   Story Continues During its first quarter earnings report, Nvidia issued second quarter guidance that blew away Wall Street\u2019s expectations. The company says it will bring in $11 billion in revenue in the current quarter plus or minus 2%. Wall Street anticipated $7.2 billion.We\u2019ll see if it meets or exceeds those expectations when the company reports its earnings on Aug. 23.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

That's nearly double the 6.5% gains of the S&P 500, compounding its impressive gains so far in 2023, with the stock up an eye-popping 189% as of market close on June 30.\nHelping fuel the semiconductor giant's rally was a wave of price target increases from Wall Street, as analysts scrambled to update their models in the wake of Nvidia's exceptionally strong guidance for the current quarter.\n\nImage source: Nvidia.\n\nSo what\nIt's worth stepping back to explain why analysts have been so bullish regarding Nvidia's prospects. The company signaled an inflection point in the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) when Nvidia reported the financial results of its fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended April 30). The company generated revenue of $7.2 billion, a decline of 13% year over year, resulting in net income of $2 trillion, down 26%.\nWhile that might not seem like much to write home about, it was Nvidia's blockbuster forecast that took Wall Street by surprise. For the second quarter, management is guiding for revenue of $11 billion, up 64% year over year and 53% sequentially. CFO Colette Kress cited \"growing demand for generative AI\" as driving its forecast higher.\u00a0\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley raised their price target on Nvidia to $500, up from $400, while simultaneously naming the stock a \"top pick\" in the semiconductor space. This suggests potential upside for investors of 18% -- even after the stock's nearly 200% gains so far this year. The investment bank cited growing demand for AI, suggesting that only Nvidia was in a position to \"beat and raise this year,\" according to The Fly. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nJefferies analyst Mark Lipacis also raised his price target to $500, citing Nvidia's stack of AI hardware and software solutions, calling the company \"the compute leader by far today in the early innings of AI.\"\u00a0\nAnalyst Dan Ives was among the most bullish, saying AI represents the \"fourth industrial revolution,\" with Nvidia as one of the primary beneficiaries, citing a \"long runway of growth ahead.\"\n\nNow what\nI'd be remiss if I didn't mention Nvidia's valuation, as the stock currently sells for 20 times forward sales and 54 times forward earnings. While that might be off-putting to some investors, it's important to note that \"AI is at an inflection point,\" according to CEO Jensen Huang, \"setting up for broad adoption reaching into every industry.\"\nIf the world is at the beginning of a sea change -- and I, for one,\u00a0believe it is -- this could be just the beginning for Nvidia. Its semiconductors are the gold standard for processing AI systems, and rapid revenue and earnings growth could quickly eclipse the disconnect between its valuation and the corresponding financial metrics.\n\n\n\nDanny Vena has positions in Nvidia.

Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well. FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.  What if you'd invested in Nvidia (NVDA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NVDA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today? Nvidia's Business In-Depth With that in mind, let's take a look at Nvidia's main business drivers. NVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company\u2019s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.NVIDIA\u2019s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores, which are necessary to run deep learning algorithms. The company\u2019s GPU platforms are playing a major role in developing multi-billion-dollar end-markets like robotics and self-driving vehicles.NVIDIA is a dominant name in the Data Center, professional visualization and gaming markets where Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are playing a catch-up role. The company\u2019s partnership with almost all major cloud service providers (CSPs) and server vendors is a key catalyst.NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs are also getting rapid adoption in diverse fields ranging from radiology to precision agriculture. The company\u2019s GPUs power the top two supercomputers in the world, located at Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the United States, as well as the top supercomputers in Europe and Japan. In all, NVIDIA powers 136 of the TOP500 supercomputers.Santa Clara, CA-based, NVIDIA reported revenues of $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023, slightly up from $26.91 billion in fiscal 2022.Beginning first-quarter fiscal 2021, NVIDIA started reporting revenues under two segments \u2013 Graphics and Compute & Networking.Graphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.Compute & Networking comprises Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms. Mellanox revenues included in this segment beginning second-quarter fiscal 2021.Graphics and Compute & Networking accounted for 44% and 56% of fiscal 2023 revenues, respectively.   Story Continues Bottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Nvidia ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in July 2013 would be worth $125,620.22, or a gain of 12,462.02%, as of July 14, 2023, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&P 500 gained 168.42% and the price of gold went up 46.63% over the same time frame.Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for NVDA.NVIDIA is gaining from strong growth of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute & Networking revenues. A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds. Collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect its revenues to grow at a CAGR of 28.3% through fiscal 2023-2025. However, NVDA\u2019s near-term prospects look gloomy due to weakening demand for chips used in gaming and professional visualization end markets. While macroeconomic headwinds are impacting gaming and professional visualization chip demand, higher channel inventory levels are hurting chip prices.Shares have gained 7.79% over the past four weeks and there have been 15 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Nvidia also remains the market leader in discrete GPUs for high-end PC games.\nAnalysts expect those growth engines to boost Nvidia's revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by 59% and 133%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 (which ends next January). Those growth rates suggest its post-pandemic slowdown -- which resulted in nearly flat revenue growth in fiscal 2023 -- is already over. But should investors still chase Nvidia as it hovers near its all-time highs? Let's compare the bear and bull cases to decide.\n\nImage source: Nvidia.\n\nWhat the bears will tell you about Nvidia\nThe bears will warn you that Nvidia isn't the only company which produces chips for processing AI tasks. Microsoft, Alphabet's\u00a0Google, and Meta Platforms have\u00a0all been developing their own AI chips, which could eventually replace Nvidia's GPUs in their data centers.\nThe British chip designer Graphcore also claims its graph-processing chips, which process all of the data points across a single graph at once, can process AI tasks more efficiently than Nvidia's GPUs. Therefore, Nvidia's might have established a first-mover's advantage in the AI market, but its long-term dominance isn't guaranteed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recent hype regarding ChatGPT, DALL-E, Midjourney, and other popular generative AI platforms might have also created an AI bubble which could be popped by concerns about copyright violations, the proliferation of fake information, and the disruptions of entire industries. Governments could also start to strictly regulate the usage of AI tools to mitigate those long-term risks. If that happens, Nvidia's sales of data-center GPUs (60% of its sales last quarter) could slow down.\nThe bears also believe a lot of growth has already been baked into Nvidia's stock at 56 times forward earnings and 24 times this year's sales. By comparison, Advanced Micro Devices\u00a0(NASDAQ: AMD) trades at 39 times forward earnings and 8 times this year's sales. So if Nvidia fails to meet the market's ever-rising expectations for its data-center business, its stock could easily be cut in half. That's probably why Nvidia's insiders sold more than three times as many shares as they bought over the past 12 months.\n\nWhat the bulls will tell you about Nvidia\nThe bulls believe that Nvidia will remain far ahead of its potential challengers in the AI chip market for the foreseeable future. For example, they'll point out that even though Google recently claimed its fourth-generation TPUs (tensor processing units) were 1.2 to 1.7 times faster and up to 1.9 times more power efficient than Nvidia's A100 chips, the tech giant didn't directly compare those TPUs to Nvidia's newest H100 chips.\nAs for Graphcore, it's still an unprofitable start-up that generated a mere $5 million in sales in 2021 and lost its entire AI networking chip team to Meta earlier this year. Therefore, Graphcore's technology might seem promising on paper, but it seems unlikely that it can catch up to Nvidia -- which could generate $43 billion in revenues this year -- anytime soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bulls also don't expect the AI bubble to burst. Instead, they believe it's only the beginning of a new secular trend which will light a long-term fire under Nvidia's data-center business. While new regulations could force companies to adopt a more cautious approach toward adopting new AI tools, the underlying need to crunch more data should remain robust and fuel the market's long-term demand for Nvidia's data-center chips.\nIf Nvidia can grow its top line at a CAGR of 25% over the next five years as it expands its data-center and gaming businesses, its annual revenue would more than triple. Assuming its valuations hold steady, its stock could triple again. That wouldn't be as impressive as Nvidia's gains from the past year, but it could still easily outperform the broader market.\nWhich argument makes more sense?\nI'm bullish on Nvidia's long-term prospects, but the bears are right about its valuations. Nvidia's stock is priced for perfection right now, so it will be punished harshly for even the smallest setbacks or guidance reductions. Rising interest rates could also exacerbate that pain by compressing Nvidia's valuations again. Therefore, investors can certainly nibble on Nvidia at these levels, but they shouldn't accumulate a large position until its valuations cool off to more sustainable levels.\n\n\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nIt seems that gamers still hoping to get into the RTX 40-series bandwagon will have to be content with the RTX 4090 GPU as the halo product of this generation. That's according to the typically thrustworthy leaker Kopite7kimi, who reported via Twitter that internal Nvidia plans to launch a refreshed flagship \u2014 let's call it the RTX 4090 Ti \u2014 have been canceled.\n\nThe rumor comes as the one-year anniversary of the RTX 4090's announcement (originally in September 2022) is fast approaching. Through recent years, Nvidia has been building out its product stack with mid-generation refreshes that not only add the \"Ti\" moniker, but also offer performance step-ups to better round-out the company's lineup against AMD's comparable competition. Nvidia has already launched some Ti models (namely the RTX 4060 Ti and the RTX 4070 Ti), but that strategy doesn't seem to be happening on the upper ladders of Nvidia's product stack anymore.I'm afraid there won't be RTX 4090 Ti anymore. Some low-grade AD103 and AD106 chips will be another versions of RTX 4070 and 4060.July 27, 2023There may be a few reasons for this. The main reason likely has to do with competition (or the lack thereof). Once again, AMD decided not to go after the performance crown; the RX 7900 XTX, while a great card that's frequently at the top of our list of the best graphics cards, is more of a direct competitor to the RTX 4080. Nvidia still has the halo product and the brownie points that brings, so why spend more money in bringing yet another SKU to market?\n\nOf course, there's an argument that NVIDIA must be sitting on at least some number of fully-functioning AD-102 chips, but those bring less of a profit than a comparable professional accelerator (such as the Nvidia L40 or others). There's also the question of power consumption, and with the 16-pin meltdown controversy still not fully put to bed, the potential for issues with a 600W RTX 4090 Ti certainly exist.\n\nThere's also the fact that sales of graphics cards and PC components are slumping badly right now. With the previous generation RTX 30-series cards, Nvidia introduced the RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti less than a year after the initial launch, with an RTX 3090 Ti arriving in April 2022. The first two were commercially successful, due to the unprecedented demand. The last? Not so much. If Nvidia doesn't do a mid-cycle refresh for the RTX 40-series, that speaks volumes about how many cards are sitting on shelves.\n\nKopite7kimi added that while plans for Ti versions of Nvidia's top-performing cards are out of the deck, there's still a plan to optimize production silicon by introducing further products onto the stack. According to the leaker, though, these are being geared more toward the Chinese market and should fit in Nvidia's lineup as variations of the RTX 4060 and 4070 based on the AD103 and AD106 chips. If this pans out, it seems both AMD and Nvidia are willing to make specific GPUs to cater to the (admittedly immense) Chinese market.Combined with multiple sources, I confirm the gaming flagship of Ada-next will have a 512-bit memory interface.July 27, 2023As an added bonus, Kopite7kimi also mentioned that multiple industry sources have confirmed that the next-generation Nvidia flagship (let's call it the RTX 5090) will feature a 512-bit memory interface. If true, this marks the first time since the GTX 280 and GTX 285 days \u2014 all the way back in 2008/2009! \u2014 that Nvidia has used a 512-bit bus width.\n\nOf course, that doesn't include dual-GPU cards, like the Titan Z with a 2 x 384-bit bus. \u00a0Or there was also the GTX 295 with a dual 448-bit interface. The last mainstream consumer GPU with a 512-bit bus (not counting HBM/HBM2 solutions) were AMD's R9 390/390X (which were basically tuned variants of the earlier R9 290/290X). Regardless, most graphics cards on the market instead use a simpler, and less expensive, 256-bit bus. Top models may go as wide as a 384-bit interface, which is still enough to offer bandwidth of around 1 TB/s mark when paired with the appropriate VRAM tech (GDDR6X or GDDR6).\n\nCompanies usually prefer to add memory bandwidth by adopting newer (and faster) memory tech rather than by increasing the bus depth, due to the lower developmental and manufacturing costs incurred. And with Nvidia being expected to introduce its RTX 5000 series by 2025, it's theoretically possible that the company might be looking to pair its next product family with GDDR7 memory.\n\nAt a maximum throughput of 32 Gbps, a 512-bit bus width would translate into 2 TB/s throughput \u2014 double that of the RTX 4090. Considering how even $1,500 cards are nowadays insufficient to run the latest games at full settings and native resolution (looking at you, Remnant II), there may be something to that idea. With 2GB memory chips, a 512-bit interface would also translate to 32GB of VRAM total on such a GPU, or potentially even 64GB and 128GB professional versions with 4GB chips.\n\nAgain, everything we're saying here stems from Kopite7kimi's tweets. While they're generally correct, this isn't the same as an official confirmation. Product roadmaps can and will change. Maybe Nvidia will ultimately decide to launch a new Titan RTX based on AD102, maybe it won't.

At most it said, in briefings, that there might be edge cases where it could end up slightly slower. But overall, without DLSS 3, it's typically 10\u201315 percent faster than the 3060 Ti, at resolutions and settings that matter for either GPU. (Meaning, not 4K ultra.)\n\nWhat Nvidia did do was to heavily push the DLSS 3 Frame Generation narrative. Yes, uptake is relatively swift, especially compared to the original DLSS. But right now there are still only 39 released games that use DLSS 3. And yet Nvidia's marketing material for RTX 4060 Ti used 18 games for benchmarks, 11 of which were DLSS 3 enabled.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvalidError\n\n\nhotaru251 said:back to $2000 halo product prolly.When you pass the $1000 mark, you are usually dealing mostly with people who aren't going to care much if their GPU-for-the-0.1% costs $2000 or $3000.\n\nFor the more cost-sensitive people, last I heard, Intel was aiming for roughly twice the performance per dollar with Battlemage. Even if Intel delivers only half of that, it'll still give AMD and Nvidia a serious run for their money at ~$350 for performance generally exceeding the 4070 (by the raw numbers, the A770 should be able to trade blows with the 4070Ti, lots of seemingly untapped potential left) backed by 16GB of VRAM on 256bits. Next year should be interesting unless Battlemage gets delayed into 2025 or poofs out of existence.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndigitalgriffin\n\n\nWith 4090 sales dropping off a cliff I think NVIDIA is reading the tea leaves of what a failure an even higher priced version will be.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJarredWaltonGPU\n\n\nInvalidError said:When you pass the $1000 mark, you are usually dealing mostly with people who aren't going to care much if their GPU-for-the-0.1% costs $2000 or $3000.\n\nFor the more cost-sensitive people, last I heard, Intel was aiming for roughly twice the performance per dollar with Battlemage.

Because the A770 16GB is nowhere near the 4070 Ti in performance right now, and theoretical performance is ~20 teraflops versus ~40 teraflops. But yeah, if Intel can do Battlemage with 2x the A770 performance for $350, that would be a nice option. Right now, the 4070 Ti is about double the performance of the A770, at nearly double the price.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 4090, is proving to be one of the best purchases ever!

Not only has it gone up nearly 200% this year, but it has also been a huge long-term performer in the market. \u00a0Since 2020, Nvidia is up over 600%, turning every $1,000 invested into over $7,000. Those are some explosive returns for a company the size of Nvidia.\nBut are these gains sustainable? And what can current and prospective shareholders expect moving forward? Let's find out.\nGPUs can be utilized for many tasks\nNvidia's business focuses on one piece of crucial computing hardware: the graphics processing unit (GPU). Led by current CEO and founder Jensen Huang, Nvidia invented the GPU in 1999, which made real-time programmable shading possible for gaming graphics. \nHowever, the biggest leap forward was parallel computing, a principle that GPUs run on. This made GPUs the ideal product for anything computation intensive. As a result, GPUs are now utilized in any process where heavy calculations, like engineering simulations, cryptocurrency mining, or training artificial intelligence (AI) models, are required.\n\nThe latter use case has given Nvidia's stock a recent boost as the company's stock has surged nearly 40% since it gave guidance that revenue will rise 64% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 thanks to increased AI chip demand. But Nvidia's performance has come at a steep price as the company may have outrun its business results.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's stock is very expensive\nBecause Nvidia is a tech hardware company, it can be subject to the rise and fall of demand cycles. The latest fall came when the cryptocurrency market fell apart last summer, destroying demand for Nvidia's gaming-centric chips (gaming chips are the variety used to mine cryptocurrency). Revenue from that division is down 38% year over year, but it is up 22% quarter over quarter, showing some recovery. \nBut due to this demand evaporation, Nvidia was over-employed, causing its margins to take a beating over the past year.\n\nNVDA Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts\nHowever, Nvidia has rightsized some divisions and, combined with new demand, has seen its margins significantly improve after a few bad quarters. As a result, using the trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to value the stock would not be useful as it includes a period when Nvidia wasn't optimized for profits. Otherwise, investors would be staring a P/E of 221 in the face, which is way too expensive for nearly any stock. \n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, you can utilize a price-to-sales ratio or a forward price-to-earnings ratio (which uses analyst projections) to understand where Nvidia is trading now in relation to historical points. From a P/S ratio standpoint, Nvidia is still an incredibly expensive stock.\n\nNVDA PS Ratio data by YCharts\nEven if you look at its forward P/S ratio, the stock trades well above its normal valuation ranges. Additionally, few stocks have managed to maintain a P/S ratio of 40 as they either grow revenue to reduce the valuation or their stock price falls off a cliff to reduce the numerator portion of the ratio.\nForward earnings tell a similar story as 54 times earnings isn't a cheap price tag either.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\nWith Nvidia trading at forward levels that would be considered expensive for trailing levels, the stock is priced for utmost perfection. Nvidia must deliver a knockout quarter in Q2 to maintain its ultra-premium price tag. Even if it reports another quarter with blowout earnings, the stock may not see much movement because perfection is expected at this price.\nSo what should shareholders do? Nvidia's best-in-class products are required to build the best AI models and power data centers. This will always keep the demand for Nvidia's products high, but the company has already displayed how it can get wrapped up in hype cycles (like with cryptocurrency) and struggle for a few years.\nBecause of that, I think it's wise for investors to take some gains here as there isn't a ton of upside left. However, outright selling the position may not be the best move either as Nvidia may surprise us all with even greater third-quarter guidance (just like it did with Q2 guidance).\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is a leading company, but its stock is so expensive that it makes a reasonable analysis difficult.\n\n\n\nKeithen Drury has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Brett uses \u201csecond-level thinking\u201d to find dividend stocks to buy.Follow AuthorJul 27, 2023, 10:29am EDTShareSaveCommentGalapagos tortoisegetty\nI\u2019m sure you probably know this\u2014but it is usually a really bad idea to pay 43-times sales for a stock.\n\nNote that I did not say earnings. I said sales. Revenues. The ol\u2019 top line. Before everything.\n\n\nScott McNealy, the co-founder of Sun Microsystems, famously told investors it was insane to pay 10-times sales for Sun\u2019s stock. Ten!\n\n\u201cAt 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends.\n\n That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods\u2026 that assumes I have zero expenses\u2026 that assumes I pay no taxes\u2026 assumes zero R&D.\u201d\nAn amazing explanation by Scott. Don\u2019t ask me why my stock is down\u2026 ask yourselves why it was so high in the first place!\n\nScott made his now-famous comments two years after Sun\u2019s top. I wonder if we\u2019ll be reading a rhyming phrase from Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA\nNVDA\n\nDIA\n Corp (NVDA), two years from now.\nIf Sun\u2019s valuation was on the moon, then NVIDIA\u2019s price is way out there in the Kuiper Belt. NVDA trades for forty three times revenues\u201443!\u2014which means:\n\n\nTo give investors a 43-year payback (which is roughly a measly 2% per year), Jensen must pay 100% of revenues as dividends for 43 years.\nThis assumes he can get it by his shareholders.\nIt assumes zero costs, expenses and future R&D. And no taxes. Ha!\n\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nAnd oh by the way, NVDA pays $0.04 per share per quarter today\u2014so we\u2019re only asking for a $2.50 dividend increase. A cool sixtyfold hike.\nObviously not going to happen.\n\nIt\u2019s ironic that the hottest stock in the solar system doesn\u2019t have a plausible path to this 2% annual return. Now could someone buy it sky high today and sell it even higher next month? Possibly. But buy and hope isn\u2019t our game.\n\n\nWe income investors demand a surer path. And oh, do we ever have one in the utility sector today!\nStop me if you\u2019ve heard this before, but the Federal Reserve is hiking rates until we see a recession. It\u2019s the only way they can get inflation down below their stated 2% target.\nThe recent \u201cdovish\u201d inflation readings have been partially Fool\u2019s gold, thanks to favorable year-over-year comparisons. Remember, oil prices spiked in spring 2022 and then faded. In the months ahead, we\u2019ll be comparing prices with post-drop numbers from this same time last year.\nThe recession will eventually arrive. When it becomes obvious, we\u2019ll hear about \u201cflight to safety\u201d days in which investors ditch their tech and AI darlings and buy safe stocks.\nLike utilities that pay dividends.\nYes, our grandparents\u2019 playbook will be dusted off once again when the recession arrives. Which is why we\u2019re looking ahead so that we can cherry pick the best utility dividends now.\nA popular, but lazy, \u201cgo to\u201d like Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU\nXLU\n) won\u2019t do. At least for us.\nFirst, XLU yields 3.3%. Pile a million dollars into XLU and we have $33,000 a year. Not enough income.\nSecond, XLU holds 30 utility stocks. Why take all 30 when we can cherry pick the best?\nYes, XLU is likely to rally in the months ahead. It trades opposite long rates. Look at these two lines below\u2014the 10-year Treasury rate and XLU\u2019s price. They are often allergic to each other! But let me call your attention to the right side of the chart, where the 10-year is topping as XLU is bottoming:XLU Price vs. 10-year TreasuryYcharts\nThe closer we get to that recession, the more the 10-year rate (orange line) will come down. At the same time, we\u2019ll see utility stocks rise. A flood of vanilla investors will trade in NVDA for Dominion Energy (D), the cheapest blue-chip utility on the board today.\nDominion yields 5%. It rarely pays this much!\nWhy the deal? D\u2019s in the dividend dog house because the company cut its payout in late 2020.\nWhy the chop? Too much debt, of course. Dominion had embarked on an acquisition binge in the name of growth. Which, ironically, backfired.\nThe result was a rare payout slash from a utility\u2014an income investors\u2019 worst nightmare. First-level investors keep Dominion in the doghouse today.\nWhich intrigues us here at Contrarian Outlook. Did we hear doghouse? And a dividend cut in the rear-view mirror?\nYou have our full attention, D!\nChief financial officers (CFOs) are like carpenters. It\u2019s best to measure twice and cut only once.\nAs a result, the safest dividend is often the one that has recently been cut. Unless management is a complete clown show, the last thing they want is to have to cut twice!\nWhich is why the recent dividend raise from Dominion is encouraging. It shows confidence that the current dividend is being paid comfortably.\nFrom a \u201cdividend magnet\u201d standpoint, the stock has more upside from here. Over the past 10 years, even net of the cut, Dominion\u2019s dividend is up 19%. Not great, but the stock has been unfairly punished. From a price-only standpoint, the stock trades below where it did a decade ago!Dominion Energy Dividend MagnetYcharts\nOver the long run, stock prices track their payouts\u2014higher and lower. They can overshoot and undershoot for months, sometimes years at a time. Eventually they find their way home.\nAs we speak today, Dominion\u2019s price is lagging its payout. Which is why we want to lock in its 5% yield here. We\u2019ll enjoy a bit of upside, too, as this stock eventually gets up off the mat.\nFive percent plus upside? Scott McNealy would be proud.\nBrett Owens is chief investment strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Undoubtedly, shares of the massive AI winner are still hot, looking to make even higher highs. Still, the stock\u2019s valuation is getting harder to justify with every sizeable upside move, and I do believe investors would be wise to consider the risks and rivals that look incredibly hungry for a slice of the AI chip pie. \nYes, it\u2019s hard to find hair on the Nvidia growth story. The firm is firing on all cylinders, and its TAM (Total Addressable Market) may seem uncapped at this point! Also, AI has opened so many new doors for Nvidia and other high-tech companies that have invested in the trend. \nArguably, Nvidia has one of the most spectacular growth profiles in recent memory, and while I believe CEO Jensen Huang deserves a huge round of applause for the NVDA stock\u2019s run, I can\u2019t be bullish on shares at these heights. For now, I\u2019m inclined to be neutral on the stock, even as Wall Street analysts rush in to hike their price targets to catch up with the euphoric surge.\n\nNvidia Stock\u2019s Blast Past $1 Trillion Makes It an AI Kingpin\nA market cap north of $1 trillion would have been unfathomable just a year ago when it seemed like Nvidia\u2019s glory days were over, as shares shed around 66% of their value from peak to trough. At this juncture, investors are more than willing to pay up for top-tier exposure to AI plays. Certainly, AI may very well be the biggest trend since the rise of the internet, and though we may have yet to hit dot-com-esque valuations, I don\u2019t think investors should chase if they\u2019re feeling a bit of FOMO (fear of missing out). \nIt\u2019s hard not to feel FOMO, given that nobody wants to miss out on the historic rise of generative AI technologies. AI has serious monetization potential, but so did the internet in the 1990s. That\u2019s why it may be wise to pay a bit more attention on the risks rather than the potential for near-term rewards with a name as hot as Nvidia.\n\t\t\n\n\nNvidia Has Outperformed Its Rivals \u2014 For Now\nNvidia didn\u2019t just find itself in the right place at the right time; it\u2019s been laying down the foundation for the AI boom for many years. When ChatGPT landed, sparking massive interest in all things AI, Nvidia was ready to seize the opportunity. Though Nvidia seems to have had its way with rivals in the early innings of the AI boom, I would not discount Nvidia\u2019s fellow rivals. One has to imagine that everyone wants a piece of what made Nvidia such a profound success.\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is an obvious rival that has AI firepower of its own, with its recently-revealed MI300X chip. Nonetheless, AMD needs to catch up to challenge the top dog in Nvidia, and Citi analyst Christopher Danely isn\u2019t too confident that AMD can get up to speed (Danely noted that a third-party assessment saw AMD hardware at 80% the speed of Nvidia hardware).\nIndeed, Mr. Danely makes a strong case for why it\u2019s better to go with the leader in the AI chip space. It is really tough to catch up when it comes to any sort of semiconductor.\nIs NVDA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\nTurning to Wall Street, NVDA stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 33 analyst ratings, there are 30 Buys, two Holds, and one Sell recommendation.\nThe\u00a0average Nvidia stock price target is $484.30, implying upside potential of 7.4%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $370.00 per share to a high of $600.00 per share.\n\t\t\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line on NVDA Stock\nNvidia stock\u2019s a leader that many analysts think can stay in the lead for a while. The stock boasts a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating for a reason! Still, I think the 231 times trailing price-to-earnings multiple (well above the 35.1 times for the industry average) already reflects Nvidia\u2019s dominance. \nIf a capable rival, most notably AMD, can close the gap, or if AI chip demand falls short of high expectations from here, NVDA stock could be vulnerable to another bust. After such a bust, I\u2019d be more inclined to punch my ticket.\nDisclosure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\n\n\n FACEBOOK\n\n\n\n\n TWITTER\n\n\n\n\n EMAIL\n\n\n\n\n COPY LINK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAMD NewsMORE  \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Micro (AMD) Jumps 4% as Its Gaming GPUs Capture 45% Market Share in JapanTipRanks 16h \n\n\n\nSA Asks: Will Intel be broken up?Seeking Alpha 1d \n\n\n\nHow Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Stayed One Step Ahead in the AI Race\u00a0TipRanks 1d \n\n\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Nvidia and Lambda are said to be close to finalizing the funding round. It\u2019s believed that the deal would see the startup receive up to $300 million at a post-money valuation of $1 billion.\nLambda previously raised about $112 million in funding from investors. Its most recent round, a Series B investment that was disclosed in March, included the participation of Google LLC\u2019s Gradient Ventures fund and more than a half-dozen other backers. The company said at the time that it would use the capital to enhance its cloud platform.\nLambda\u2019s platform provides access to Nvidia graphics cards that customers can use to train artificial intelligence models and perform inference. The startup\u2019s GPU catalog includes, among others, Nvidia\u2019s flagship H100 data center chip. The H100 features 80 billion transistors that allow it to run large language models up to 30 times faster than its predecessor.\nLambda\u2019s public cloud isn\u2019t its sole offering. The startup also provides colocation services that allow companies to keep their servers at its data centers. If a customer-owned system experiences a malfunction, Lambda engineers can help fix it.\nThe startup also has a presence in the on-premises hardware market. It sells a family of AI-optimized appliances, called the Echelon series, that customers can order with the H100 or other Nvidia chips. Echelon systems also include storage and network gear, as well as preinstalled machine learning software.\nRounding out Lambda\u2019s product portfolio is a pair of personal computers for AI developers. The first machine combines four Nvidia graphics cards with up to 61 terabytes of storage, 1 terabyte of memory and a high-end central processing unit from either Intel Corp. or Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Lambda also offers a GPU-powered laptop it designed in collaboration with Razer Inc., a major PC maker.\nThe report that Nvidia could invest in the startup comes a few months after it backed rival CoreWeave Inc., which operates a similar GPU-powered cloud platform. Like Lambda, CoreWeave designed its platform primarily for companies building AI models. The latter startup has raised more than $570 million to date from Nvidia and other investors.\u00a0\nLast week, The Information reported CoreWeave\u2019s annual revenue is on track to reach $600 million. That\u2019s a significant increase from the $25 million in sales the company is believed to have logged last year.\u00a0\nImage: Lambda\n\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content. \u00a0\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\n\n\n\u201cTheCUBE\u00a0is an important partner to the industry.

As the name suggests, that generation is built around the H100 GPU, which has a max thermal design power (TDP) of up to 700W. A DGX H100 can feature up to eight of those GPUs.\u201cOrganizations looking to implement enterprise AI are investing in accelerated computing infrastructure \u2013 including hardware and software purpose-built for AI \u2013 to deploy their models into production quickly,\u201d said Charlie Boyle, VP of DGX systems at Nvidia, said. \u201cWith the certification of Digital Realty\u2019s new KIX13 facility in the DGX-ready data center program, customers have access to a flexible, simple option for deploying the world\u2019s leading AI platform.\u201dThe facility, which opened this February, has a total building size of 250,000 square foot (23,226 sqm), 21MW of utility power capacity, and a design PUE of 1.4.\u201cDigital Realty understands the impact AI will have on the way businesses drive digital transformation in the years to come. However, business breakthroughs made possible with AI can only be realized if enterprises are able to integrate the technology into their operations, and that is where we come in,\u201d said Chris Sharp, Digital Realty's CTO.\u201cWith Digital Realty\u2019s KIX13 DGX-Ready Data Center certification, we remain focused on delivering a meeting place that allows our customers to accelerate innovation and growth.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in IT Hardware & Semiconductors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture-proof your datacenter with DDC S-Series\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26 Nov 2024\n\n\n\n\nUS gov't to award reduced CHIPS Act funding to Intel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nThe drivers of chip design: AI, efficiency and geopolitics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nChris Sharp\n\n\nOsaka\n\n\nDigital Realty\n\n\nJapan\n\n\nH100 GPU\n\n\nCharlie Boyle\n\n\nDGX H100\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\nKIX13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Antony reviews and covers the latest PC hardware and laptop technologyFollow AuthorJul 09, 2023, 11:59am EDTShareSaveCommentGraphics cards are expensive and that's one reason Nvidia's RTX 40-series has received a luke-warm reception over the last few months, but in Europe at least, prices are falling quickly with both the RTX 4060 launched recently and the RTX 4080 too.\nNvidia's RTX 4060Antony Leather\n\nStarting with the RTX 4060, which has 8GB of memory and was retailing for around 329 euros at launch, the card is now regularly spotted below 315 euros and even as low as 309 euros - a six percent drop in a week since the card's launch.\n\nSadly, the US has not seen the same action, with prices stubbornly stuck at $299 despite a tepid reception by reviewers overall. As a result, thee are plenty of older cards from AMD and Nvidia itself that PC enthusiasts continue to flock to, especially of they're not invested in ray tracing or DLSS and mostly play older games or those not compatible with those features.\n\nThe RTX 4060 has been edging closer to the 300 euro mark, but prices are yet to fall as much in the ... [+] USVideocardz.com\nPrices usually fall after launches, but more often in the months after a launch - not within days. However, a particularly stubborn price point has been that of the GeForce RTX 4080, which has not come close to $1,000 since launch. In fact, it hasn't really been seen under $1200.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nAt Newegg recently, though, the MSI Ventus GeForce RTX 4080 was available for $999, retailing for $1,099 and combining that with an available coupon. That's the first time the card has offered any kind of change from $1,000. While the RTX 4080 has also seen price drop in Europe, the 17 percent price drop in the US from $1,199 to $999 is the biggest, albeit a temporary one as the price has since increased again.\nNvidia's RTX 4080Antony Leather\n\n\nOverall, graphics card pricing has reduced significantly over the last few months in the wake of new graphics card launches from AMD and Nvidia. The mid-range has been underserved here, though, with AMD only outing the lower end Radeon RX 7600 and high end Radeon RX 7900 XT and 7900 XTX. It's still expected to launch 7700 and 7800-series products, though, most likely this autumn.\nIn the meantime you should check out this review of the GeForce RTX 4060, this review of the Radeon RX 7600 and this review of the RTX 4060 Ti for the latest gaming benchmarks to see which is the best graphics card so far in 2023. We're also waiting for the launch of Nvidia's RTX 4060 16GB model later this month.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

We tested the feature and declared that using Video Super resolution is like going from VHS to Blu-ray. VSR is particularly useful for older video content that doesn\u2019t look great on modern screens with high resolutions. The technology is also useful if you don\u2019t have enough internet bandwidth for higher resolutions. \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYou need an rtx 30/40-series gpu for vsr\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 4070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nNot Available at Best Buy \n\n\n\n\nSimilar to Nvidia\u2019s well-known DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) and DLAA (Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing) technologies, Nvidia relies on machine learning to improve image quality. To use VSR, you need an Nvidia GeForce graphics card from the RTX 30- or RTX 40-series series, the Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge browsers for online videos, VLC for local videos, and the latest Nvidia Game Ready or Studio drivers. \n\n\nIt is unclear why the RTX 20-series GPUs are excluded, although these graphics chips are also DLSS-capable and presumably have suitable hardware for VSR. It\u2019s possible that Nvidia will also support these graphics cards in the future, however. \n\n\n\n\nIf internet bandwidth is limited or the video is only available in a low resolution, then Nvidia\u2019s VSR helps to render the content in a higher resolution in no time.\nIDG\nTo activate VSR, first open the Nvidia Control Panel by right-clicking on the desktop selecting its entry in the context menu. In the left sidebar of the Nvidia Control Panel, navigate to \u201cVideo\u201d under \u201cCustomize video settings\u201d and activate the \u201cSuper resolution\u201d checkbox under \u201cRTX video enhancement.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\nIn the \u201cQuality\u201d drop-down menu you can select the desired level of upscaling. Note here that a higher level provides better results, but also requires more GPU resources, as we explained in our deep-dive testing of Video Super Resolution. Once you\u2019ve made your changes, click on \u201cApply\u201d and close the control panel. \nThen open your browser (or VLC) and start a video of your choice that has a resolution between 360p and 1440p. VSR comes into play automatically when you play the video in full-screen mode. This way you can save bandwidth or enjoy your favorite videos on YouTube in high resolution that better suits your high-resolution monitor.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s VSR uses machine learning and the GPU\u2019s dedicated AI resources to scale content at a higher resolution and in real time. A maximum of 4K resolution is currently possible.\nIDG\nThis article has been translated from German to English and originally appeared on pcwelt.de.\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Friedrich Stiemer, Contributor, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n Recent stories by Friedrich Stiemer:\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRefresh rate vs. frame rate: Why they matter for gaming performance\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow to fix Link Failure, a frustratingly common DisplayPort problem\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5 quick ways to measure your frame rate in PC games\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tPCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Notice\nEuropean Privacy Settings\nMember Preferences\nEditorial independence\nLicensing & Eprints\nCalifornia: Do not Sell my Personal Info\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nAd Choice\nContact Us\nFoundry Careers\nGamePro\nSmart Answers\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPCWorld Categories \n\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe \n\n\n\n\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 IDG Communications, Inc. \n\n\n\nExplore the Foundry Network +\nTech AdvisorMacworld \n\n\n\n\nTop Of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDo Not Sell My Info\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Settings\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

While the brute force of the hardware gets most of the glory (and is indeed essential), the software side is the magic that pieces it together. Without good software, even the ferocious Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is reduced to a fancy paperweight\u2014especially when running Cyberpunk 2077\u2018s glorious new path traced Overdrive mode.\u00a0\nSoftware can also substantially improve the hardware performance. Enter Nvidia\u2019s DLSS 3.0, or Deep Learning Super Sampling. Including both AI-powered frame generation and Nvidia\u2019s wondrous latency-reducing Reflex technology, DLSS 3.0 makes for a potent recipe.\u00a0And with the release of affordable new GeForce RTX 4060 and 4060 Ti graphics cards this summer, the fantastic technology is now a lot more accessible.\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t the same old DLSS upsampling you\u2019re used to, however. We\u2019re going to go over some basics of what DLSS 3.0 is, and its application to Nvidia\u2019s RTX 40-series GPUs. We\u2019ll let you know how to use this feature, and tell you about optimal settings on some popular supported games. Let\u2019s get cracking.\n\nFurther reading: The best graphics cards for PC gaming\n\nHow does DLSS 3 work?\nDLSS 3 greatly accelerates gaming frame rates using a mixture of AI tasks running on dedicated tensor cores. It has three components that make it tick.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Resolution (a.k.a. DLSS 2)\nAlso known as super sampling, DLSS 3\u2019s core \u201cupscaler\u201d functionality is actually the DLSS 2 technology already integrated into countless games. DLSS renders game imagery at a lower resolution than your monitor runs at to increase raw gaming frame rates, then uses AI tensor cores to reconfigure the image with machine learning so that it looks sharp on your screen. This bypasses the performance penalty that your higher resolution would impose, while keeping graphics fidelity high.\u00a0\n\nFrame generation\nThe novel element to DLSS 3 is in the \u201cOptical Multiframe Generation\u201d AI technology. After analyzing two images from a game back-to-back, DLSS 3 uses this information to insert an extra AI-created frame that does not have to be rendered by the game itself. This result is in even higher frame rates than standard DLSS 2. It can also help dramatically increase the smoothness in CPU bottlenecked games.\u00a0\n\n\nNvidia Reflex low latency\nThe third piece of the puzzle is in Nvidia\u2019s Reflex technology. Frame generation is not free. Those AI-generated frames aren\u2019t controlled by the player, since the game isn\u2019t rendering them, so it can actually add latency (read: reduce responsiveness) in games. To combat this, Nvidia Reflex helps harmonize the GPU and CPU so that latency is reduced. It helps to bypass the traditional bottlenecks presented by both the GPU and CPU by deeper integration into the game engine itself. Reflex was created years ago to improve performance in esports games to amazing effect, but Nvidia now requires it in games that support DLSS 3.\n\nSpeaking of\u2026  \u00a0\nWhat do you need to run DLSS 3?\n\n\n\n\nThiago Trevisan\nAn RTX 40-series graphics card\n\n\nDLSS 3 is exclusive to Nvidia\u2019s \u201cAda Lovelace\u201d RTX 40-series graphics cards. It is available for both desktop and laptop offerings, but not any RTX 30-series or prior GPUs.\u00a0\nNvidia says that\u2019s because the new Lovelace GPU architecture includes more powerful AI tensor cores and, more critically, a new \u201cOptical Flow Accelerator\u201d that provides scene movement info critical to creating those AI frames. Performance on RTX 30 or older GPUs would not provide a good experience, so for now this technology is limited to the more powerful hardware.\u00a0Currently, six RTX 40-series graphics cards are available that meet those requirements, with a seventh coming soon:\n\n\nThe $1,600 RTX 4090\nThe $1,200 RTX 4080\nThe $800 RTX 4070 Ti\nThe $600 RTX 4070\nThe $399 RTX 4060 Ti 8GB or $499 RTX 4060 Ti 16GB (coming July 2023)\nThe $299 RTX 4060\n\nDLSS 3 is not supported on rival AMD Radeon or Intel Arc graphics cards.\nCertain Windows settings need to be active\n\n\nYou\u2019ll also need to turn on \u201cHardware Accelerated GPU\u201d in your Windows display settings. (Settings > System > Display > Related Sections > Graphics > Change Default Graphics Settings > Toggle Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling on)\nCertain in-game settings need to be active\n\nOnly specific games directly support DLSS 3. You\u2019ll have to turn on \u201cFrame Generation\u201d settings after activating DLSS upscaling. This will also necessitate \u201cNvidia Reflex\u201d being turned on, and most (but not all) games will do this by default. You\u2019ll further have the option to set Reflex to additional \u201cBoost.\u201d\u00a0\nSupported DLSS 3 games\n\n\nThere are currently over 25 games that are playable now, with many more coming. High profile titles like Cyberpunk 2077 and Forza Horizon 5 have recently received DLSS 3 updates, along with new releases such as Hogwarts Legacy. Rock Paper Shotgun maintains a helpful guide to all available and upcoming DLSS 3 games (they\u2019re after the ray traced and DLSS games in the list).\n\n\n\n\nHitman 3 menu: DLSS \u00a0on Balanced, with Frame Generation and Reflex set to On.\nThiago Trevisan\nWhat are DLSS 3\u2019s drawbacks?\nDLSS 3 is fantastic for increasing overall visual smoothness, but as it develops during its early days, it also has a few potential issues to be aware of.\u00a0\nLatency\nWhile Nvidia Reflex addresses a lot of DLSS 3\u2019s latency concerns, it\u2019s also not the rapid response some users may expect from esports titles. That\u2019s why DLSS 3 is better suited for single player games such as Cyberpunk 2077, Plague Tale Requiem, Microsoft Flight Simulator, etc.\u00a0Even with Reflex on, DLSS 3 can play a sort of trick on your mind if you\u2019re especially sensitive to how fast frame rates and responsiveness are intertwined, as PCWorld\u2019s Brad Chacos explained during his review of the RTX 4090:\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile the DLSS 3 experience shines, it doesn\u2019t always\u00a0feel\u00a0more responsive in your hands. Running\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077\u00a0at 138fps with every possible bell and whistle active thanks to DLSS 3 looks absolutely stunning, full stop. But one of the perks of faster frame rates is increased responsiveness, and while Reflex greatly helps with that,\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077\u00a0running at 138fps doesn\u2019t\u00a0feel\u00a0substantially more responsive than running it at the 77fps or so it hits in native 4K. Having twice as many frames looks fantastic but those AI frames aren\u2019t responding to your controls in the actual moment, though it\u2019s close.\nThis is not a negative. This is not a drawback. It can\u2019t be after running\u00a0Flight Sim\u00a0at 120fps, and\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077\u00a0with ultra ray tracing at 138fps (the RTX 3090 tops out at 48fps). But it\u2019s worth highlighting.\u201d\n\nVisual artifacts\nMost of the DLSS 3 gaming experience looks fantastic. You won\u2019t notice any visual issues or quirks. That said, there are some games that showcase some onscreen \u201cartifacts\u201d or abnormalities. UI elements can also not be displayed properly in some titles, all areas that are undergoing improvement. The good news is that software updates can remedy these issues as gamers age. The Hardware Unboxed deep dive embedded below does a great job of walking through DLSS 3\u2019s visual quality, including highlighting potential quirks.\n\n\n\nNeeds powerful hardware\nDLSS 3 shows some of its best results on already powerful hardware, like the Nvidia RTX 4080 or 4090. It also seems to do better when it\u2019s boosting an already-okay frame rate to a higher one, such as 60 FPS to 120 FPS. Time will tell if upcoming weaker GPUs such as the RTX 4060 will still have the same impressive results, but it should be promising.\u00a0\n\n\nSettings overload\nConsole gamers have it easy without as much customization sometimes! PC games not only have dozens of graphics settings, but it also has different levels for each one. Add to that DLSS 3, which now has its own hierarchy of graphic settings to learn.\n\n\n\n\nHogwarts: Legacy has a lot of settings to tinker with, including DLSS tiers.\nThiago Trevisan\nDLSS 3 settings explained\u00a0\nDozens more settings variations have entered the fray \u2013 making it confusing for gamers when choosing your graphics settings. After activating DLSS, Frame Generation, and Reflex, you have a few more choices to make.\nDLSS feature options\n\n\n\nDLSS Auto: This will try and keep the frames as best it can to your monitor\u2019s refresh rate\nDLSS Quality: The best visual performance, with modest or not much FPS uplift\u00a0\nDLSS Balanced: A good combination of higher frames and maintaining graphical fidelity.\u00a0\nDLSS Performance: You\u2019ll notice somewhat less impressive visuals, but FPS frames are considerably higher.\u00a0\nDLSS Ultra-performance: Better FPS, but worse visuals \u2013 typically when you really want to overreach existing hardware or to hit a specific FPS at a higher resolution. (8K Gamers, you\u2019ll want to learn this one!)\u00a0\nDLSS Frame Generation: This setting will just be a simple \u201cOn or Off\u201d toggle in your game settings. Remember, you\u2019ll need Ada Lovelace RTX 40 series GPUs to work.\u00a0\n\nNvidia Reflex and Boost\nThese are often found near DLSS options, but may be elsewhere in a video menu as well (as in Cyberpunk 2077). Nvidia Reflex will often be turned on automatically in most games with Frame Generation being active. That\u2019s not always true, however, and many games let you disable Reflex manually even when running DLSS 3 Frame Gen. (We don\u2019t recommend doing that.) You\u2019ll also have the option for a \u201cBoost\u201d feature in many games. Reflex Boost overclocks your GPU so it can help in CPU limited scenarios even more.\u00a0\nEven more options\nTo make matters a bit more complicated, some games even allow you to select only Nvidia\u2019s DLAA along with Frame Generation and Reflex. Plague Tale\u2019s Requiem is one such title. DLAA basically runs DLSS at your native monitor resolution for enhanced visual sharpness and clarity. When given this option, it offers the highest possible graphical setting you can achieve, balanced out by the obvious performance cost. You can usually choose DLSS instead if the DLAA performance is too low.\u00a0\nIn most games, such as Hogwarts Legacy, DLAA will automatically be grayed out when you select DLSS.\u00a0\n\n\nThe best DLSS 3 settings\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe most powerful gpu is a dlss 3 monster\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$3,499.95 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s how we use DLSS 3 settings in our own rigs. For the most powerful hardware, such as the RTX 4080 and 4090, DLSS Quality should keep respectable frames in most games, even at 4K, and doubly so with DLSS Frame Generation enabled.\u00a0 If you prefer a bit more pep in performance, DLSS Balanced would be the next ideal step.\u00a0 You can also always just set DLSS to Auto and see if you\u2019re happy with the results, as they will vary from game-to-game.\u00a0\nIf you have slightly less powerful hardware, such as the RTX 4070 or some mobile RTX 40 GPUs, DLSS Balanced and DLSS Performance become good settings to make sure you\u2019re hitting good frames, with the nod still going to DLSS Balanced as preferred.\u00a0We\u2019d typically recommend avoiding DLSS Ultra Performance, as it upscales from such a low resolution image that it degrades visual fidelity a noticeable amount.\u00a0\nSome games are just more demanding than others, so you\u2019ll be able to judge if changes are needed, especially when adding ray tracing.\u00a0\n\n\nDLSS 3: Let\u2019s play some games!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI Titan GT77 HX 13V\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime to put this theory to practice. We\u2019re going to play some particularly intense games and see how DLSS 3 can help. These games were tested at 4K, generally with Ultra or similar max settings, and ray tracing on. The hardware is an MSI Titan GT77 laptop with a 4090 inside, which is similar to an RTX 3090 Ti desktop GPU in performance.\u00a0\nKeep in mind that this is at 4K, so people playing at lower resolutions such as 1440p or 1080p will always see higher FPS in general. Ray tracing also substantially lowers frame rates when on, so disabling that is another way you can achieve higher numbers. The idea with DLSS 3 is that we can have our cake and eat it too! You can experience ray tracing on Ultra, then flip on DLSS 3 to achieve better performance without compromising on other visual settings.\u00a0\nDLSS 3: Cyberpunk 2077\nCyberpunk 2077 has been around for a few years now, and recently it received DLSS 3 support. This game is notorious for crushing almost any GPU when ray tracing is on Ultra so it\u2019s welcomed news.\n\n\n\n\nRay tracing Ultra, DLSS Off at 4K.\nThiago Trevisan\nLet\u2019s go over how some of the settings affect the overall performance by really pushing the system. On the MSI GT77 Titan, ray tracing on Ultra without any DLSS gives us a measly 27 FPS in this portion. That frame rate is too low to actually play, so let\u2019s see how DLSS 3 can help us without having to reduce any other graphics settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS Set to Balanced, without Frame Generation or Reflex.\nThiago Trevisan\nNext, let\u2019s turn on DLSS to Balanced, but without switching on Frame Generation or Nvidia Reflex. Our frame rate jumps to 61, a much better result. The game still looks great and behaves much smoother with this extra FPS boost.\n\nOur next option will have us once again setting DLSS to Balanced, but this time we\u2019re also going to turn on Frame Generation in the menu. Nvidia Reflex, on the adjacent \u201cVideo\u201d menu, will also be on. The result here is substantially better\u2014a whopping 87 FPS. Remember that we started with just 27 FPS before turning on any DLSS features.\u00a0\nHow does it play with DLSS 3 Frame Gen active? Quite well, actually. It feels superior in every way to native rendering, or with just regular DLSS on. The game play is smooth, and no glaringly obvious artifacts or issues present themselves. (They can still happen, however, such as UI elements being a bit quirky at times.)\u00a0\n\n\nThe only downside here is that you\u2019re increasing latency, which is somewhat by Nvidia Reflex. The latency in this game is acceptable, as it\u2019s mostly a single player game where you\u2019re exploring and occasionally engaging in faster scenes.\u00a0\nA faster paced game, such as an online multiplayer esports title, is not an ideal match for DLSS 3 due to this latency factor.\u00a0 In Cyberpunk 2077, it works beautifully. You can also turn on Frame Generation and Reflex without DLSS, giving you FPS of around 47, but here the greater benefit seems to be pairing it with DLSS so you can achieve maximum frame rates.\n\n\n\n\nFrom Brad Chacos\u2019 RTX 4090 review.\nBrad Chacos\nIn Brad Chacos\u2019 RTX 4090 desktop GPU review, we can see that even this ferocious flagship gets massive help from DLSS 3. Playing it at 4K resolution with ray tracing at Ultra pins the game to 42 FPS, but DLSS performance with Frame Generation brings it to 138 FPS. These are staggering numbers\u2014with ray tracing still on!\nDLSS 3: Hitman 3\n\n\n\n\nHitman 3 without DLSS at 4K, and all settings maxed out to their highest.\nThiago Trevisan\nHitman 3 is a popular game that also taxes systems quite heavily. With ray tracing on and DLSS off, this scene gave us only around 30 FPS at maxed-out 4K settings. This game is much like Cyberpunk 2077, in the sense that it\u2019s a slower paced style game, so DLSS 3 can be a big help here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHitman 3: DLSS Balanced only, no Frame Generation or Reflex.\nThiago Trevisan\nSwitching DLSS on to Balanced, but keeping Frame Generation Off, wielded 64 FPS. That\u2019s surely a significant boost, and makes the game feel tremendously more playable and smooth.\n\n\n\n\nDLSS Balanced, with Frame Generation and Reflex On.\nThiago Trevisan\nFinally, switching DLSS to Balanced, but turning on both Frame Generation and Reflex, give us truly impressive results. We\u2019re now around 91 FPS, a big leap from the original 30 FPS without DLSS 3. The game feels much smoother, and behaves very well. It\u2019s difficult to even notice the DLSS process occurring unless you\u2019re pixel-peeping for it.\nLike with the other games, latency will also be increased, and helped with Nvidia Reflex. This title is one that benefits much more from the higher FPS and better performance, and any additional latency is not very noticeable. You can also select only Frame generation and Reflex without DLSS, giving you around 50 FPS. We\u2019d still recommend going all the way with DLSS Quality or Balanced however, so you get all of the combined DLSS 3 benefits.\u00a0\nDLSS 3: Hogwarts Legacy\n\n\n\n\nHogwarts legacy: No DLSS, Ray Tracing Ultra 4K.\nThiago Trevisan\nContinuing the trend of highly taxing ray traced titles, we arrive at Hogwarts Legacy. Without any DLSS, and when set to Nvidia DLAA, this scene in Hogmeade netted us only 36 FPS at 4K. Ick. Ray tracing and all settings are set to Ultra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n DLSS Balanced, no Frame Generation or Reflex.Thiago Trevisan\nWe see better results with DLSS set to Balanced, with frame rates hitting around 59. The game feels much better already, and even the frame rate time seems more consistent. (You can also turn on just Frame Generation without DLSS, getting around 56 FPS, but your latency will also increase more that way, so better to pair it with DLSS.)\n\n\n\n\nDLSS Balanced, Frame Generation and Reflex On. Thiago Trevisan\nDLSS Balanced alongside Frame Generation and Reflex give us 82 FPS, a huge boost from the 36 FPS we first saw. The game plays considerably better, with much more consistent and smooth performance. Without DLSS 3, we\u2019d have to lower ray tracing or adjust other settings to achieve better results, so this is certainly a much more preferable option.\u00a0Reflex kept the game feeling nice and responsive.\nDLSS 3: Flight Simulator 2020\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator 2020 is a notoriously difficult game to max out thanks to its beautifully expansive open world. It\u2019s a highly CPU bottlenecked game, making a perfect pairing with DLSS 3.\n\n\n\n\nFrom Brad Chacos\u2019 RTX 4090 review.\nBrad Chacos\nThe results here are nothing short of impressive. With the desktop RTX 4090 and a Ryzen 9 5900X processor, 4K native hits a playable 65 FPS\u2014a standard result for this heavily CPU-bottlenecked game. Turning on Frame Generation and bypassing that bottleneck brings us to 122 FPS, almost doubling the visual smoothness by blowing past the bottleneck with AI frames. Nvidia Reflex helps to keep the latency in check, and this is a game generally well suited to DLSS 3 improvements.\u00a0\n\n\nThis title also has numerous detailed UI and in-cabin graphics that have to be generated properly, so it\u2019s a great test of how DLSS 3 can render minute details in sharp clarity. While it\u2019s not always perfect, the boost in FPS and bypassing CPU bottlenecks are more than a win here.\u00a0\nDLSS 3: Final thoughts\u00a0\nNvidia\u2019s DLSS 3 combines the great benefits of DLSS, along with Frame Generation and Nvidia Reflex. While support is still limited to select games and hardware, and there are sometimes niggling artifacting and text issues, it\u2019s extraordinarily promising.\u00a0By allowing GPUs to stretch their legs well beyond traditional hardware limits, we can experience higher and better frontiers in games as developers take advantage of the technology.\u00a0\nSure, you\u2019re getting some more latency, but Nvidia Reflex does a good job at keeping it under control. Often, it makes DLSS 3 games even more responsive than running at native resolution. While you\u2019re not likely to want to play Counter-Strike or the like with it on, DLSS 3 is a huge boost to games such as Cyberpunk 2077.\nWith everything running well, DLSS 3 feels like black magic. Games shouldn\u2019t run this good or look this smooth. If your PC supports it, we highly recommend checking it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe most affordable rtx gpu for dlss 3\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 4070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nNot Available at Best Buy \n\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article first published on April 14, 2023, but was updated to include new RTX 4060 GPUs and explicitly explain where to turn on Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling.\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Thiago Trevisan, Contributor, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\nThiago Trevisan is a Mac and PC enthusiast for over 20 years, and has written for PCWorld and Macworld since 2021.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I write about disruptive companies, technologies and usage models.Follow AuthorJul 27, 2023, 05:29pm EDTShareSaveCommentThe U.S. Government is considering new export controls on semiconductors made by U.S. companies, especially chips from NVIDIA used in training AI models and running data centers. I was recently interviewed on CNBC\u2014not once, but twice\u2014about the potential damaging impacts of these restrictions, if indeed the Biden administration goes through with them.\n\nThis issue is complex and deserves a more complete discussion rather than some knee-jerk reaction. The focus has inevitably turned to NVIDIA, a company that is absolutely killing it on every front right now. There\u2019s also been more heat than light created by China\u2019s recent moves to pressure U.S.\u2013based Micron Technology and restrict the export of germanium and gallium, vital elements for microchips, EVs, military gear and more.\n\n\nTechnology moves so fast that we sometimes have short memories. But it\u2019s important to put these developments into historical context. These tensions go back at least twenty years. I clearly remember when China essentially banned IBM, Cisco and even Microsoft from their critical infrastructure. And on the consumer side, they still block or censor Google, Twitter and Meta (Facebook, Instagram, Threads). To be fair, the U.S. has also enacted bans on telecom equipment from Huawei and ZTE, citing national security reasons. And the TikTok circus is ongoing.\n\nI hope the current flare-up over semiconductors will pass, but we need to be sure we understand its implications for AI, where China\u2019s ambitions are sky-high.\n\nChina will keep developing AI capabilities with or without U.S. chips\n\nLast October, the U.S. government imposed some limits on exports of the hottest AI chips. These limits particularly affected NVIDIA, whose A100 and H100 processors dominate the field for training AI models. Led by Nvidia but also including Intel, AMD, Qualcomm and others, U.S. chip makers produce the best, most energy-efficient and most cost-efficient chips for AI training and data centers, just as they do in many other areas.\nThe October restrictions have led Nvidia to release A800 and H800 models, which throttle down performance in line with the regulations. But restricting chips further won\u2019t stop China from developing AI\u2014and would in fact be counterproductive.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nChina\u2019s chip industry isn\u2019t as advanced as its U.S. counterpart, but Chinese chip makers like Huawei and Biren are capable of producing good designs that get the job done at lower performance levels. Of course, the Chinese companies working in AI would rather use Nvidia\u2019s products, which are the best right now in training in terms of silicon, software and reliability, but if you aggregate enough of the lower-performing chips, you can accomplish the same AI tasks eventually. This approach would impose marginally higher costs for new data centers but hardly cripple them. Also, tighter restrictions wouldn\u2019t impact the large installed base of Nvidia chips already in Chinese data centers, or China\u2019s access to domestic and foreign cloud-based compute options, or China\u2019s homegrown supercomputer capacity.\n\nTo think of it another way, all the foundational work to train models for the generative AI that\u2019s been wowing us this year was done before the H100 even existed. Sure, Nvidia\u2019s chips really are the state of the art for AI, but it\u2019s not like they\u2019re the only chips that can help a company working in that area.\n\n\nIn short, putting export restrictions on Nvidia chips assuming it will choke off the Chinese AI industry doesn\u2019t make sense. It would certainly inconvenience Chinese AI companies, but it would hardly prevent them from developing the AI they want to pursue.\nBeware the unintended consequence of promoting the Chinese chip industry\nThe bigger risk here\u2014one pointed out by Nvidia CFO Colette Kress at a conference a couple of weeks ago\u2014is that draconian export controls might cost the U.S. some of its leadership in the chip industry over the long run. The October restrictions were balanced, allowing the continued export of U.S. chips from Nvidia (and others) but at a moderate performance threshold. Following that course would keep Chinese AI companies dependent on U.S. technology, and it would keep AI data centers in the U.S. ahead of their Chinese counterparts.\nBy contrast, going down the slippery slope of tightening performance thresholds would ultimately result in spurring the growth of China\u2019s domestic chip industry. The Chinese chip makers don\u2019t have a big footprint yet, but there are a lot of them that already have a solid level of competence. When I was an AMD executive 20 years ago, the Chinese chip companies we dealt with weren\u2019t great at design\u2014but it\u2019s not like that anymore. If Chinese AI companies need to turn to them for chips previously sourced from the U.S., it only makes sense that these suppliers will ramp up their design and production capabilities to meet the demand. While these companies are not yet on the level of Nvidia or Intel or Qualcomm, we don\u2019t need to give them any more reasons to accelerate their evolution.\nLimitations in U.S. regulatory thinking\nOne of the underpinnings of U.S. trade policy is the \u201chigh wall around a small garden\u201d approach. This means that when you\u2019re working in a technology niche where the U.S. has leadership, you put a high wall around that technology so other countries can\u2019t easily catch up. It\u2019s an approach that makes perfect sense if you\u2019re talking about, say, the high-end avionics that control stealth fighters. You really don\u2019t want tech like that to leak out. But it doesn\u2019t make sense in commercial AI.\nIn the AI garden, the seeds are the AI software frameworks\u2014which China already has access to. The plants in the garden are the AI models in use, which again are already available to Chinese AI companies. Nvidia provides the best shovels and pruning shears to tend the garden, but not the only means to tend it. So it doesn\u2019t make sense to try to build a high wall around it.\nI believe this is another example where the U.S. Government wants to apply a regulatory philosophy that doesn\u2019t fit the real world. We\u2019ve seen this recently with proposed know-your-customer (KYC) regulations for IaaS providers that won\u2019t actually do anything to stop bad actors. (I went into great detail about that in a recent article.) We\u2019ve seen it in the FTC\u2019s skepticism toward sensible acquisition deals like Adobe-Figma, Broadcom-VMware or Microsoft-Activision (in which a federal judge just rightly ruled against the FTC). I get it that we need responsible regulatory oversight to make sure that companies don\u2019t unfairly suppress competition, don\u2019t gouge consumers and so on. But we also need regulatory oversight that makes logical sense.\nIn this case, it does not follow logically that Nvidia\u2019s success in AI chips makes it absolutely indispensable for pursuing AI at all. And to over-regulate these chips creates the risk that the U.S. could fumble away its technology leadership. Would you rather have Chinese AI customers continue to fuel Nvidia\u2019s growth and success? Or would you rather they spend their yuan to fuel the growth and success of Chinese suppliers?\nI think the proposed tighter export controls speak to generalized anxiety about AI mixed with generalized anxiety about China as the major rival for the U.S. These are weighty topics that deserve well-reasoned consideration. But restricting Nvidia from China isn\u2019t going to make the U.S. safer or more competitive in the long run.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Moor Insights & Strategy provides or has provided paid services to technology companies like all research and tech industry analyst firms.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nDemand for generative artificial intelligence-based services and fears that the U.S. government could restrict sales of GPUs for AI workloads continues to drive up prices in the People's Republic of China. In some cases, the price of Nvidia's H800 compute GPU can reach as high as\u00a0\u00a5500,000, or about $70,000 per unit,\u00a0MyDrivers\u00a0reports. In fact, it's still hard to get a GPU, even at this pricing.Last month the price of Nvidia's A800 GPU, which is used for artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) applications,\u00a0jumped 20%\u00a0to\u00a0\u00a5110,000 ($15,000) practically overnight after rumors that the U.S. government can restrict exports of such products to China emerged. Now, Nvidia's A800 and H800 compute GPUs can reach\u00a0\u00a5120,000 ($16,800, presumably for A800),\u00a0\u00a5250,000 ($34,970),\u00a0\u00a5300,000 ($41,970), and even\u00a0\u00a5500,000 ($69,950, presumably for H800).But even if one has the money to pay for China-oriented A800 and H800 GPUs \u2014 cut-down versions of Nvidia's A100 and H100 compute GPUs with reduced performance and scalability \u2014 it may be impossible to obtain one of these devices. Instead of buying from a distributor or reseller, one may need to talk directly to Nvidia China or even Nvidia corporate headquarters, the report says.\u00a0The ridiculously high prices should not come as a surprise. The vast majority of AI clusters are based on Nvidia's compute GPUs and run software designed for Nvidia's CUDA software layer that exclusively supports processors from the green company. If owners of AI services and clusters cannot get enough compute GPUs to support the growing demand for their products, the quality of their services will degrade, and they risk losing their business over time.Nvidia does not comment on pricing for its data center GPUs, so take the report about prices of the company's compute GPUs with a grain of salt. Meanwhile, an Nvidia H800 compute GPU in an add-in-board form-factor costs\u00a0$30,603\u00a0in the U.S. Meanwhile, CDW, one of the prominent resellers of data center hardware, lists only one of such cards, and it takes 5-7 business days to get it, which may point to relatively short supply of these products.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nCUDA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (1)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

The collaboration aims to expedite drug discovery processes through the implementation of advanced AI algorithms. The announcement resulted in an astounding 80% surge in Recursion's shares, while Nvidia, renowned for its AI computing chips, enjoyed a 2% climb in the stock market.\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, headquartered in Salt Lake City, plans to harness Nvidia's cloud platform, utilizing its massive 23,000-terabyte biological and chemical datasets to train their AI models. Significantly, the datasets continue to grow exponentially, expanding by \"hundreds of terabytes every week,\" as mentioned by Recursion CEO Chris Gibson during CNBC's \"Closing Bell Overtime.\"\nBecome a Subscriber\nPlease purchase a subscription to continue reading this article.\nSubscribe Now\n\nTraining AI models requires substantial amounts of data, and Nvidia's cloud service for generative AI in drug discovery, BioNeMo, provides a fitting platform for Recursion's ambitions. The collaboration may also involve licensing the AI models developed by Recursion on BioNeMo. This opens the door for further drug development by Recursion and its partners.\nNotably, Recursion is already making headway in drug development, with five medications currently under human testing. Among these, a neurovascular disease medication and an ovarian cancer treatment hold particular promise, with potential results expected next year.\nFurthermore, Recursion's CEO, Chris Gibson, emphasized their focus on the long term, believing that technology, automation, and cutting-edge tools in biology and chemistry will substantially hasten drug discovery. Their efforts have already yielded positive proof points, setting the stage for exciting developments in the coming years.\nThe pharmaceutical industry's embrace of AI technologies has accelerated in recent times, with Nvidia's investment marking yet another significant milestone. AI-powered advancements are revolutionizing drug discovery and promising faster delivery of life-saving medications. Moderna, in April, affirmed the potential of AI in enhancing its messenger RNA technology, instrumental in the development of COVID vaccinations. Moreover, Google Cloud has released two AI-powered drug discovery tools, further underscoring the growing prominence of AI in this domain.\nNvidia, a prominent player in the AI chip market, has experienced remarkable success, reaching a trillion-dollar market value in June, largely driven by the soaring demand for AI solutions. Recursion Pharmaceuticals, too, has not been shy in its pursuit of AI-driven innovation. In May, the company acquired two AI-driven drug development startups for $87.5 million, further solidifying its position as a frontrunner in the race to revolutionize drug discovery.\nNvidia's strategic investment in Recursion has not only strengthened the latter's capabilities but has also sparked enthusiasm among other AI-driven drugmakers. Exscientia and AbCellera Biologics experienced substantial stock market gains of 12% and 13%, respectively, in the wake of the announcement.\nThe convergence of AI and pharmaceuticals is proving to be a game-changer, and collaborations like the one between Nvidia and Recursion exemplify the transformative potential of these technologies. As the partnership unfolds and more AI-driven drug discoveries come to fruition, the prospect of accelerated drug development and improved patient outcomes becomes increasingly tangible.\n\n\n\n\njirehl  \n \nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n\n\n\n Consumer Internet \n\nFDA Approves First Human Milk-Based Fortifier for Term Infants \n\n \n\n\n\n Features \n\nembecta recognized as Healthcare Technology Company of the Year \n\n \n\n\n\n Features \n\nEnovis Plans Leadership Change \n\n \n\n\n\n\n Consumer Internet \n\nHims & Hers Acquires US-Based Peptide Facility to Strengthen Supply Chain \n\n \n\n\n\n Medical Devices \n\nMedtronic Receives FDA Approval for Adaptive Deep Brain Stimulation for People with Parkinson \n\n \n\n\n\n Features \n\nOcugen seeks its One Shining Moment \n\n \n\n\n\n\n Medical Devices \n\nThermo Fisher to Acquire Solventum\u2019s Purification and Filtration Business \n\n \n\n\n\n Features \n\nThe Weekly Roundup: March 15, 2025 \n\n \n\n\n\n Software & Data \n\nLumeris Unveils AI-Powered Primary Care Solution \n\n \n\n\n\n\n Software & Data \n\nCleveland Clinic Introduces AI-Powered Documentation Technology \n\n \n\n\n\n Features \n\nHilton Partners with American Express to Aid LA Wildfire Victims \n\n \n\n\n\n Biotech \n\nFraxion and ZAGENO Partner to Streamline Biotechnology Procurement \n\n  \n\n\n\n\nPopular Articles\n\n\n\nThe Top 50 Healthcare Technology CEOs of 2022\n\nFeatures May 11, 2022 0 \n\r\n                    The Healthcare Technology Report is pleased to announce the Top 50 Healthcare Technology CEOs of 2022.

[+] Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America Act, in the South Court Auditorium at the White House on July 25, 2022 in Washington, DC. The meeting was held for President Biden to hear from CEOs and labor leaders on the way funding for production of computer chips would impact them. The meeting was also attended by U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, Brian Deese, Director of the National Economic Council and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Getty Images\nGeopolitical tension between the U.S. and China continues to ensue. With continuous efforts to secure America\u2019s supply chain and increase national security to upend China\u2019s dominance in the manufacturing and technology sectors, the U.S. government is doubling down on its measures to ensure America\u2019s safety and economic prosperity.\n\n\nEarlier this year, we saw TikTok\u2019s CEO Shou Chew appear before Congress to defend the popular social media platform against concerns of national security due to its alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party. With over 150 million American users\u2014half of the U.S. population, lawmakers\u2019 skepticism over TikTok\u2019s ability to protect user data sparked a heated debate on whether TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance\u2014a Chinese-owned company\u2014would be forced to cooperate with China if requested to fork over data of U.S. citizens. During the congressional hearing, House Energy and Commerce Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash) said, \u201cTikTok surveils us all and the Chinese Communist Party is able to use this as a tool to manipulate America as a whole...We do not trust TikTok will ever embrace American values. Your platform should be banned.\u201d\n\nJust months after the viral showdown between TikTok and Congress, the fight over national security concerns has not abated. Refusing to relent on perceived threats of national security, the U.S. government continues to hammer down guardrails to secure the nation\u2014now, with increased restrictions on AI chip exports to China.\n\n\nU.S. Chipmakers\u2014Nvidia, AMD, and Others Caught In National Security Crossfire\nNvidia transitioned some of its operations out of China and Hong Kong following 2022 export controls imposed by the U.S. government. Headquartered in California, 69% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue in FY2023 was generated from sales outside of the U.S. and one its primary liquidity sources comes from cash generated from operations. Furthermore, the company utilizes third parties to manufacture and assemble its products and then holds inventory ahead of anticipated demand. As a result, long manufacturing lead times and inaccurate demand forecasting can either lead to supply shortages or excess inventory which both pose a risk to the company\u2019s financial performance. Layered on top of that, is the government\u2019s latest restrictions on AI chip exports to China.\n\nReports that Nvidia shares fell below $400 on the morning of June 28th after reaching a market capitalization of $1 trillion called into question whether the U.S. government\u2019s new license requirements for exports of the company\u2019s A100 and H100 integrated circuits to China and Russia played a role. In response to new government restrictions, the chipmaker rolled out the A800 and H800 chips, which are the downgraded alternatives to the high-end A100 and H100 chips operating at 70% of the speed of A100 GPUs and made exclusively for Nvidia\u2019s Chinese market.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nNvidia confirmed in news statements that imposing restrictions on AI chips to China is cause for \u201cpermanent loss of opportunities\u201d for the U.S. industry although the company stated that they would not anticipate any material impact in the immediate future due to a surge in demand for their AI chips, despite possible further restrictions on their A800/H800 chips. Likewise, AMD has also notified its Chinese operations that it won\u2019t be able to sell its Instinct MI250 and MI250X chips to Chinese clients. Although their GPU production doesn\u2019t scale in comparison to Nvidia\u2019s, it was reported that AMD\u2019s shares also took a hit as the government curtails AI chip exports to China.\n\nThe Semiconductor Supply ChainWASHINGTON, DC - JULY 09:  U.S. President Joe Biden signs executive order as (L-R) Secretary of ... [+] Transportation Pete Buttigieg, Chairperson of the Federal Trade Commission Lina Khan, Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, Attorney General Merrick Garland, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, and Acting Chairwoman of the Federal Communications Commission Jessica Rosenworcel look on during an event at the State Dining Room of the White House July 9, 2021 in Washington, DC. President Biden signed an executive order on \u201cpromoting competition in the American economy.\u201d  (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)Getty Images\n\n\nSemiconductors are essential to the U.S. economy, toting an abundant magnitude for innovation capable of boosting America\u2019s competitive advantage and powering most of our ability for R&D to enhance a wide range of goods critical to the day-to-day lives of Americans. While the SIA reports that the U.S. Semiconductor Industry has nearly half of the global market share, America\u2019s share of semiconductor manufacturing capacity has dwindled from 37% in 1990 down to about 9% by 2030 while China is moving in the opposite direction.\nWhen President Biden took office, Covid-19 had still been an ongoing pandemic sweeping the world with unprecedented volatility as global supply chains across various industries were severely rattled. The aftermath of U.S.-China tensions on global supply chains inclined the government to place greater emphasis on methods to increase America\u2019s resilience to economic disruption.\nIn relation to the semiconductor supply chain, the White House issued several briefs to address critical chip shortages along with plans to fortify economic and national security by prioritizing efforts to augment domestic manufacturing capacity for semiconductors. Included in this undertaking are the Executive Order on America\u2019s Supply Chains, plans to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to America, and the enactment of the CHIPS and Science Act, among other White House initiatives to reinvigorate the U.S. semiconductor industry.\nU.S. Semiconductor Manufacturing Capacity\nFor many U.S. chipmakers, including Nvidia, their finished goods inventory, components, and supply capacity are housed in Asia, which in turn makes their semiconductor operations vulnerable to geopolitical tension. Notwithstanding, the U.S.-China tech war emphasizes the need to boost U.S. chip manufacturing capacity. In 2021, Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) said that \u201cChina is building 17 foundries as we are thinking about building one, or having one built in Arizona\u201d. Additionally, China has accelerated its output of greenfield foundries by almost 7x while the U.S. has lagged in new developments between 1990 and 2020, according to the State of AI Report 2022.\nIn order to thwart China\u2019s ambition for world dominance in science, technology, and manufacturing, the CHIPS and Science Act will support over 50 new semiconductor ecosystem projects across the U.S., incentivize U.S. chip manufacturing with a $39 billion Manufacturing Incentive Program, fund the National Science Foundation (NSF) with $200 million to strengthen the semiconductor workforce pipeline and rival China\u2019s STEM workforce, leadership, and innovation, as well as create new, high-quality jobs to form a lasting impact on the American workforce, according to the SIA.\nPrivate investments for U.S. semiconductor production have been booming in places like Arizona, Texas, Indiana, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, and Virginia. Geographic clusters like Arizona and Texas have been said to particularly garner such investments due to local government incentives and existing fab ecosystems in place to boost new construction capacity.\nWhat Does This Mean For Generative AI?\nDevelopment of artificial intelligence requires powerful computer chips. AI models are most predominantly trained and run on Nvidia chips with the A100, V100, and RTX 3090 GPUs being the top three chips utilized in open source AI papers as of June 2.\nAccording to industry sources, an AI model like OpenAI's ChatGPT needs over 30,000 Nvidia A100 chips at $10K apiece! Generative AI is not only being used to generate text, write essays, create code, and etc., but can also scale across many industries and has far more advanced capabilities such as applications to drug design, material science, and synthetic data. And that\u2019s just scraping the surface. The U.S. military is also leveraging generative AI in use cases for warfare systems, combat simulation, cybersecurity, target recognition, and more.\nConsequently, the U.S. embargo on AI chips is a double-edged sword. China reportedly accounts for between 20% and 25% of the Nvidia\u2019s data center revenue. Similarly, other U.S. chipmakers like AMD have considerable revenue exposure to China as well. But by cutting China\u2019s access to foreign technology, it can effectively lose at least 20 years of development and productivity gains from militarized AI technologies, thus helping to ensure America\u2019s national security and economic resilience.\nFollow me on\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

After its recent acquisition of Cyclica and Valence, the company announced a partnership with\u2014and $50 million investment from\u2014NVIDIA on Wednesday. Under the agreement, the tech giant is giving Recursion a $50 million private investment in public equity. The two companies are looking to accelerate the development of Recursion\u2019s AI foundation models to help the biopharma industry create improved patient therapies more quickly. \u201cWith our powerful dataset and NVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing capabilities, we intend to create groundbreaking foundation models in biology and chemistry at a scale unlike anything that has ever been released in the biological space,\u201d Recursion CEO Chris Gibson said in a statement. Recursion has built a massive biological and chemical database via its Recursion OS, which exceeds 23 petabytes and has three trillion searchable compound and gene relationships. The company has been training machine-learning algorithms on this dataset to tackle the complex challenges of drug discovery. The partnership will enable Recursion to leverage NVIDIA\u2019s DGX Cloud to accelerate its AI training, which offers AI-as-a-service software. The deal will also give Recursion access to the NVIDIA AI-stack and its software expertise to further enhance the training of its models. These models will also be able to access NVIDIA\u2019s BioNeMo, a cloud service for generative AI in drug discovery, which was released earlier this year. The cloud service offers tools for customization and deployment of biomolecular models through cloud APIs, which Recursion intends to support its internal pipeline with, as well as its current and future partners. Ultimately, those models can then be licensed to other biotech and pharma companies through the cloud service. Wednesday\u2019s news has already paid off for Recursion shareholders. The company\u2019s shares jumped more than 80% after the announcement. Recursion\u2019s market value rose by nearly $1 billion, an all-time high for the company which was publicly listed in 2021. That same year, Roche signed a potentially multi-billion dollar deal with Recursion to access the Recursion OS and Recursion Map to develop as many as 40 new medications for oncology and neuroscience.  Last month, Recursion announced that one of its drug candidates was enrolled for its Phase II SYCAMORE clinical trials ahead of schedule. The company has been testing REC-994, a small molecule superoxide scavenger and therapeutic candidate for treatment of cerebral cavernous malformation, a disease that causes malformation of the brain and spinal cord.

Nvidia, which had to withdraw from the Arm acquisition due to regulatory concerns, is reportedly aiming to make an investment in the low hundreds of millions of dollars.Arm licenses its designs to makers of semiconductors \u2013 chips described as the \u201cbrains\u201d of electronic devices \u2013 including Nvidia. Arm is owned by the Japanese investment company Softbank, which bought it for \u00a324bn in 2016.Anchor investors typically buy shares at an agreed price before an IPO begins, to enhance the stability of an offering and reassure potential investors. The FT reported that the flotation could take place in New York as soon as September.Ben Barringer, an analyst at the wealth management company Quilter Cheviot, said Arm\u2019s status as a \u201ccrucial\u201d player in the technology sector made interest in the IPO from companies such as Nvidia likely.Referring to speculation that the US chipmaker Intel is also being courted as an anchor investor, Barringer said Apple and Microsoft could yet become involved.\u201cHaving [Arm] controlled by one industry player was never going to work and thus having anchor investors helps to alleviate that problem. It is unlikely one company will be a dominant anchor investor,\u201d he said.\u201cFollowing this news, watch the moves from Apple and Microsoft. Apple is Arm\u2019s biggest customer and as such will want influence in order to secure its supply.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This announcement is the product of more than a decade of collaboration between AWS and NVIDIA, delivering the visual computing, AI, and high performance computing (HPC) clusters across the Cluster GPU (cg1) instances (2010), G2 (2013), P2 (2016), P3 (2017), G3 (2017), P3dn (2018), G4 (2019), P4 (2020), G5 (2021), and P4de instances (2022).\nMost notably, ML model sizes are now reaching trillions of parameters. But this complexity has increased customers\u2019 time to train, where the latest LLMs are now trained over the course of multiple months. HPC customers also exhibit similar trends. With the fidelity of HPC customer data collection increasing and data sets reaching exabyte scale, customers are looking for ways to enable faster time to solution across increasingly complex applications.\nIntroducing EC2 P5 Instances Today, we are announcing the general availability of Amazon EC2 P5 instances, the next-generation GPU instances to address those customer needs for high performance and scalability in AI/ML and HPC workloads. P5 instances are powered by the latest NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs and will provide a reduction of up to 6 times in training time (from days to hours) compared to previous generation GPU-based instances. This performance increase will enable customers to see up to 40 percent lower training costs.\nP5 instances provide 8 x NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs with 640 GB of high bandwidth GPU memory, 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processors, 2 TB of system memory, and 30 TB of local NVMe storage. P5 instances also provide 3200 Gbps of aggregate network bandwidth with support for GPUDirect RDMA, enabling lower latency and efficient scale-out performance by bypassing the CPU on internode communication.\nHere is the specs for this instance:\n\n\n\nInstance Size\nvCPUs\nMemory (GiB)\nGPUs (H100)\nNetwork Bandwidth (Gbps)\nEBS Bandwidth (Gbps)\nLocal Storage (TB)\n\n\np5.48xlarge\n192\n2048\n8\n3200\n80\n8 x 3.84\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a quick infographic that shows you how the P5 instances and NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs compare to previous instances and processors:\n\nP5 instances are ideal for training and running inference for increasingly complex LLMs and computer vision models behind the most demanding and compute-intensive generative AI applications, including question answering, code generation, video and image generation, speech recognition, and more. P5 will provide up to 6 times lower time to train compared with previous generation GPU-based instances across those applications. Customers who can use lower precision FP8 data types in their workloads, common in many language models that use a transformer model backbone, will see further benefit at up to 6 times performance increase through support for the NVIDIA Transformer Engine.\nHPC customers using P5 instances can deploy demanding applications at greater scale in pharmaceutical discovery, seismic analysis, weather forecasting, and financial modeling. Customers using dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for applications like genome sequencing or accelerated data analytics will also see further benefit from P5 through support for a new DPX instruction set.\nThis enables customers to explore problem spaces that previously seemed unreachable, iterate on their solutions at a faster clip, and get to market more quickly.\nYou can see the detail of instance specifications along with comparisons of instance types between p4d.24xlarge and new p5.48xlarge below:\n\n\n\nFeature\np4d.24xlarge\np5.48xlarge\nComparison\n\n\nNumber & Type of Accelerators\n8 x NVIDIA A100\n8 x NVIDIA H100\n\u2013\n\n\nFP8 TFLOPS per Server\n\u2013\n16,000\n6.4x vs.A100 FP16\n\n\nFP16 TFLOPS per Server\n2,496\n8,000\n\n\nGPU Memory\n40 GB\n80 GB\n2x\n\n\nGPU Memory Bandwidth\n12.8 TB/s\n26.8 TB/s\n2x\n\n\nCPU Family\nIntel Cascade Lake\nAMD Milan\n\u2013\n\n\nvCPUs\n96\n\u00a0192\n2x\n\n\nTotal System Memory\n1152 GB\n2048 GB\n2x\n\n\nNetworking Throughput\n400 Gbps\n3200 Gbps\n8x\n\n\nEBS Throughput\n19 Gbps\n80 Gbps\n4x\n\n\nLocal Instance Storage\n8 TBs NVMe\n30 TBs NVMe\n3.75x\n\n\nGPU to GPU Interconnect\n600 GB/s\n900 GB/s\n1.5x\n\n\n\nSecond-generation Amazon EC2 UltraClusters and Elastic Fabric Adaptor P5 instances provide market-leading scale-out capability for multi-node distributed training and tightly coupled HPC workloads. They offer up to 3,200 Gbps of networking using the second-generation Elastic Fabric Adaptor (EFA) technology, 8 times compared with P4d instances.\nTo address customer needs for large-scale and low latency, P5 instances are deployed in the second-generation EC2 UltraClusters, which now provide customers with lower latency across up to 20,000+ NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs. Providing the largest scale of ML infrastructure in the cloud, P5 instances in EC2 UltraClusters deliver up to 20 exaflops of aggregate compute capability.\n\nEC2 UltraClusters use Amazon FSx for Lustre, fully managed shared storage built on the most popular high-performance parallel file system. With FSx for Lustre, you can quickly process massive datasets on demand and at scale and deliver sub-millisecond latencies. The low-latency and high-throughput characteristics of FSx for Lustre are optimized for deep learning, generative AI, and HPC workloads on EC2 UltraClusters.\nFSx for Lustre keeps the GPUs and ML accelerators in EC2 UltraClusters fed with data, accelerating the most demanding workloads. These workloads include LLM training, generative AI inferencing, and HPC workloads, such as genomics and financial risk modeling.\nGetting Started with EC2 P5 Instances To get started, you can use P5 instances in the US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon) Region.\n\nWhen launching P5 instances, you will choose AWS Deep Learning AMIs (DLAMIs) to support P5 instances. DLAMI provides ML practitioners and researchers with the infrastructure and tools to quickly build scalable, secure distributed ML applications in preconfigured environments.\nYou will be able to run containerized applications on P5 instances with AWS Deep Learning Containers using libraries for Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service \u00a0(Amazon EKS). \u00a0For a more managed experience, you can also use P5 instances via Amazon SageMaker, which helps developers and data scientists easily scale to tens, hundreds, or thousands of GPUs to train a model quickly at any scale without worrying about setting up clusters and data pipelines. HPC customers can leverage AWS Batch and ParallelCluster with P5 to help orchestrate jobs and clusters efficiently.\nExisting P4 customers will need to update their AMIs to use P5 instances. Specifically, you will need to update your AMIs to include the latest NVIDIA driver with support for NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs. They will also need to install the latest CUDA version (CUDA 12), CuDNN version, framework versions (e.g., PyTorch, Tensorflow), and EFA driver with updated topology files. To make this process easy for you, we will provide new DLAMIs and Deep Learning Containers that come prepackaged with all the needed software and frameworks to use P5 instances out of the box.\nNow Available Amazon EC2 P5 instances are available today in AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon). For more information, see the Amazon EC2 pricing page. To learn more, see EC2 P5 instance page and send feedback to AWS re:Post for EC2 or through your usual AWS Support contacts.\nYou can choose a broad range of AWS services that have generative AI built in, all running on the most cost-effective cloud infrastructure for generative AI.

Rick Wilking/Reuters\n                                 \n\n\n\n\n\nMizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh said Nvidia's share price has another 20% upside to run on the AI boom.\nHe added the chipmaker could generate\u00a0$300 billion in AI-specific revenue by 2027.\nThe stock has already doubled so far this year and is trading around $446 apiece.\nChipmaker Nvidia's having a great year with its stock price doubling amid the artificial intelligence, or AI hype \u2014 and it could get even better.\n\n\nMizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh has given Nvidia's stock price another 20% upside to run \u2014 and even this new target of $530 is \"conservative,\" according to a Sunday client note seen by Insider. Rakesh's previous price target for Nvidia was $400.\nNvidia shares closed 0.7% higher at $446.12 apiece on Monday. The stock has surged 205% so far this year.\n\n\nHe also expects Nvidia to maintain its dominant position in AI chips till at least 2027. The company could generate around $300 billion in AI-specific revenue by 2027 with a 75% market share of AI server units, Rakesh added. That's 10 times his projection of $25 billion to $30 billion in AI revenues this year, he told Dow Jones on Monday.\n\"With demand for generative AI accelerating, we see significant opportunities for hardware suppliers powering the higher compute needs for large-language models, particularly AI powerhouse NVDA,\" Rakesh wrote, referring to the Santa Clara-based chipmaker by its stock symbol.\nRakesh's endorsement of Nvidia followed the company's blockbuster first-quarter results from the generative artificial intelligence boom that was posted in May.\n\n\nNvidia posted first-quarter revenue of $7.2 billion \u2014 beating Wall Street forecasts. The company didn't provide information about how much revenue it generated from AI-specific businesses.\nConsequently,\u00a0Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's wealth has also nearly doubled this year, per Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He is now the 32nd richest person in the world with a net worth of $40 billion \u2014 up 189% so far this year.\nHuang owns 86.9 million Nvidia shares, or about 3.5% of the Santa Clara-based chipmaker, per\u00a0the company's 2023 annual report.\n\n\nMizuho's Rakesh is not the only analyst bullish on Nvidia. In June, Morgan Stanley called Nvidia its \"top pick\" on the back of demand for its AI chips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkets\n\n\nTech\n\n\nNews\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLegal & Privacy\n\nTerms of Service\nTerms of Sale\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility\nCode of Ethics Policy\nReprints & Permissions\nDisclaimer\nAdvertising Policies\nConflict of Interest Policy\nCommerce Policy\nCoupons Privacy Policy\nCoupons Terms\n\nCompany\n\nAbout Us\nCareers\nAdvertise With Us\nContact Us\nCompany News\nMasthead\n\n\nOther\n\nSitemap\nStock quotes by finanzen.net\n\nInternational Editions\n\nAT\nDE\nES\nJP\nNL\nPL\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 \n    Insider Inc.

The acquisition was first reported by The Information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 Sebastian Moss\n\n\n\n\u201cAI is so big today that Edge devices aren\u2019t equipped to handle its computational power,\u201d OmniML co-founder and CEO Di Wu said when the company raised $10 million last year.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t have to be the case. Our ML model compression addresses the gap between AI applications and Edge devices, increasing the devices\u2019 potential and allowing for hardware-aware AI that is faster, more accurate, cost effective, and easy to implement for anyone, on diverse hardware platforms.\u201dThe company announced a partnership with Intel just a month before it was acquired. It is not known if the plans have been scrapped following Nvidia's acquisition, but OmniML was planning to optimize machine learning models for Intel platforms.While Nvidia dominates the AI training market for data centers with its GPUs, the Edge market remains up for grabs - with numerous competitors looking to become the sector's market leader.In addition to industry heavyweights like Intel, Qualcomm, and Nvidia, a plethora of startups have launched Edge AI chip products, including SiMa.ai, Hailo, Mythic, and Roviero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in AI & Analytics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnterprise adoption trends\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27 Sep 2024\n\n\n\n\nAMD Instinct MI300X GPUs now available on OCI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nMENA's next growth frontiers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in Investment / M&A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Center Trends 2025: Power, AI, and Progress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\nLumen Orbit rebrands to Starcloud, raises another $10m for in-orbit data centers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nMENA's next growth frontiers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\nOmniML\n\n\nDi Wu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

We\u2019re also deep diving on new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.\nWe\u2019re gonna need a bigger boat this week In the NVIDIA Studio as Alessandro Mastronardi, senior artist and programmer at BBC Studios, shares heart-stopping shark videos and renders.\nThe shark-themed series was conceived during the artist\u2019s recent impromptu trip to Iceland, where he saw a huge basking shark up close. \u201cI was eager to know all about its anatomy, the way it moves and feeds,\u201d said Mastronardi.\nAfter deep-diving on the sharks \u2014 including great whites, hammerheads and the Elasmobranchii subclass of rays and the like \u2014 he was ready to create. Learn more about his creative journey below \u2014 there\u2019s no-fin to lose.\nHis incredible visuals \u2014 alongside extraordinary shark-themed artwork from creators Maggie Molloy and Hypertaf \u2014 are featured below in the latest Studio Standout video, which spotlights incredible artists and their work.\n\nPlus, the NVIDIA Studio #StartToFinish community challenge runs through the end of August. Use the hashtag to submit a screenshot of a favorite project featuring its beginning and ending stages for a chance to be featured on the @NVIDIAStudio and @NVIDIAOmniverse social channels.\nJaw-some Creativity\nMastronardi, based in Florence, Italy, works to bring the awe-inspiring beauty of mother nature to the masses.\n\u201cThe satisfaction of studying nature in all its forms \u2014 then transforming that information and reference material into art and content used in several productions and scopes \u2014 has been my greatest pride and joy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe starts the process by sketching ideas and concepts on paper. \u201cThis is something I\u2019ve done since my first years, as it helps to have a clear vision of what I want to achieve,\u201d said Mastronardi.\nReference materials for great white sharks help guide Mastronardi\u2019s artistic process.\n\u201cSimply put, GeForce RTX GPUs are the most reliable, highest-performing, advanced graphics cards that any 3D professional can use.\u201d \u2014 Alessandro Mastronardi\nNext, Mastronardi uses ZBrush to model all of his characters. \u201cI like to define a base shape, carefully tune proportions and anatomy, and add detail and resolution until I have a high-polygon, fully detailed, featured character that\u2019s finely sculpted and textured,\u201d he said. \u201cThis stage isn\u2019t complete until I\u2019m fully satisfied with how the character looks from every angle, and it has its own personality, so to speak.\u201d\nTremendous effort goes into the tiniest details.\nThe artist exports characters to Blender to retopologize the high-polygon mesh into low-poly, highly optimized characters. \u201cThe key is to reproject the highest possible level of detail onto the character, so that all the details will be maintained.\u201d\nScary stuff.\nNext, Mastronardi rigs the character and sets up a skeleton, configuring all digital bones and inverse kinematics, which determine the motion of objects in the scene.\nAnimation work in Blender.\n\u201cThe render stage is GPU accelerated and uses OptiX ray-tracing application programming interfaces, which allow fantastic quality and performance.\u201d \u2014 Alessandro Mastronardi\u00a0\n\nHere, Mastronardi\u2019s PC \u2014 equipped with two GeForce RTX 3090 Ti 24GB GPUs \u2014 does the heavy lifting. Blender Cycles RTX-accelerated AI-powered OptiX ray tracing in the viewport ensures interactive, photorealistic rendering for modeling and animation.\nThis rigorous process delivers lifelike animations. \u201cA lot of care has to go into the control-rig stage,\u201d said Mastronardi. \u201cAll controls must allow for plausible and realistic deformations, with proper anatomy limits and characteristics, so that the character\u2019s movement will look and feel realistic.\u201d\nAlso using Blender, the artist sets up shaders and materials, and conducts test renders to evaluate how the characters look in different poses. When satisfied, Mastronardi prepares promotional images \u2014 built in an environment that matches the characters \u2014 and assembles a scene with added effects and props.\nProperly themed environments elevate the characters within them.\nOften, Mastronardi inspects his models with NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for connecting and building custom 3D tools and applications with Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD). \u201cOmniverse is my preferred platform to inspect scenes very quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cI like how agile and effective the interface is, as well as the quality it can deliver.\u201d\nSimply stunning.\nMastronardi exports final files using RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in Blender Cycles for the fastest final frame render. \u201cI love the Cycles render engine, all its features, and the quality and speed that it\u2019s able to deliver,\u201d he added.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/week67-basking-shark-1280w_1.mp4\n\u00a0\nMastronardi plans to use the NVIDIA Broadcast app \u2014 from the NVIDIA Studio suite of AI-powered tools \u2014 for a new series of 3D art lectures on wildlife, coming soon. Check out Mastronardi\u2019s animal-themed portfolio on ArtStation.\n3D artist Alessandro Mastronardi.\nTo other artists, Mastronardi would say, \u201cDiscard and forget about naysayers, those who tell you \u2018No, it can\u2019t be done.\u2019\u201d He added that \u201cgrowing up, this was a lesson I taught myself: to believe in my own skills, and not to let negativity affect my work or vision to become a wildlife 3D artist.\u201d\nThere\u2019s some-fin special about those words.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

Human rights groups assert that Uyghurs are surveilled, incarcerated, required to perform forced labor, re-educated to abandon their beliefs and cultural practices, and may even be subjected to sterilization campaigns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology vendors are thought to know their wares assist in those efforts, and perhaps even to develop capabilities that enable Beijing's human rights abuses.\nHikvision earned itself a spot on the US blacklist in 2019 for allegedly being complicit in Beijing's suppression of the Uyghur population. Hikvision has denied being \"knowingly\" involved in human rights abuses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia was also named in this latest contract, though the accelerator maker says it hasn't sold kit to Hikvision since 2019, and isn't involved in this contract.\n\"We aren't participating in this project and aren't aware of any Nvidia customer supplying it,\" a spokesperson for the silicon slinger told The Register.\n\"Our customers are aware that they aren't allowed to ship products in violation of the law or our policies.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"However, we aren't able to control used GPUs that resurface on the secondary market, sold by parties that aren't our customers or partners,\" the California-based biz added. \"We don't have the ability to prohibit any third party from referencing Nvidia products in their marketing materials or design guides.\"\n\nAustralia gives made-in-China CCTV cams the boot\nUK's Surveillance Camera Commissioner grills Hikvision on China human rights abuses\nAlibaba admits it built facial-recognition-as-a-service to detect oppressed Uyghur minority in China\nUK government to set deadline for removal of Chinese surveillance cams\n\nThe contract seen by IPVM, dated December 2022, is for the installation of 210 Hikvision cameras, drones, routers, and camera poles within three months.\nThe software specified is Hikvision's DS-IF0100-AI full analysis software, which supports facial, video, and human body analysis. The contract also includes analytics services to determine which category of ethnicity an individual falls into: \"unknown,\" \"non-minority,\" or \"Uyghur.\"\nThe contract apparently also requires a server packing at least eight Nvidia T4 GPUs \u2013 a brand IPVM claims that Hikvision prefers. Nvidia pointed out the T4 has been on sale for the past five years, and thus in that time, some of the silicon may have been resold into China outside of Nv's conntrol.\nThe Register requested comment from Hikvision last week, and it had not responded at the time of publication days later.\nBoth Hikvision and Beijing have previously denied any involvement in human rights violations.\nHikvision has also previously claimed that features allowing the identification of Uyghurs was removed from its software in 2018. \u00ae\nUpdated to add\nSoon after we published this piece, a Hikvision spokesperson told The Register:\n\nIt is an undeniable fact that Hikvision offerings do not have a minority recognition function. As reported by The New York Times and Politiken, the company has not developed this capability since 2018. We have clear and longstanding policies in place to prohibit the use of minority recognition technology.\n \nGet our Tech Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                China\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Facial Recognition\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                China\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Facial Recognition\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Surveillance\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                China Mobile\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                China telecom\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                China Unicom\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Cyberspace Administration of China\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Great Firewall\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Hong Kong\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                JD.com\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                NSO Group\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Shenzhen\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Uyghur Muslims\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                APAC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Security\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n                    COMMENTS\n            \n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                China\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Facial Recognition\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                China\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Facial Recognition\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Surveillance\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                China Mobile\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                China telecom\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                China Unicom\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Cyberspace Administration of China\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Great Firewall\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Hong Kong\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                JD.com\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                NSO Group\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Shenzhen\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Uyghur Muslims\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                APAC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Security\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP US OFF\nSend us news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther stories you might like\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNvidia won the AI training race, but inference is still anyone's game\n\nComment\u00a0When it's all abstracted by an API endpoint, do you even care what's behind the curtain?\n\nSystems12 Mar 2025 | 5\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThree charged in Singapore with alleged link to illicit shipments of Nvidia GPUs to China\nAccused face up to 20 years in prison\n\nOn-Prem28 Feb 2025 | 17\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFeds name and charge alleged Silk Typhoon spies behind years of China-on-US attacks\nXi's freelance infosec warriors apparently paid up to $75K to crack a single American inbox\n\nCyber-crime6 Mar 2025 | 4\n\n\n\n\n\n \nData deluge pushes financial services deeper into AI\nHarnessing AI to optimize applications and services is crucial but building the infrastructure is equally important\nSponsored Feature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nChina announces plan to label all AI-generated content with watermarks and metadata\n\nAsia In Brief\u00a0PLUS: Foxconn wants 40 percent AI server market share;

Photo: HandoutIn August last year, the US Department of Commerce imposed a ban on Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) from selling some advanced chips to China. Nvidia was instructed to stop selling its A100 and H100 GPUs, while AMD was prevented from exporting its MI250 chips to the mainland.AdvertisementThat left China\u2019s AI sector scrambling to buy limited supplies of advanced chips from Nvidia, which has a near monopoly on GPUs used to train AI systems.Advertisement"

With P5 instances, machine learning applications can use the Nvidia Collective Communications Library to use up to 20,000 H100 GPUs in a single EC2 UltraCluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 Nvidia\n\n\n\nNvidia and Amazon claim that the P5 instances are up to six times faster at training large-language models than the A100-based EC2 P4 instances, and can cut training costs by 40 percent. \u201cAWS and Nvidia have collaborated for more than 12 years to deliver large-scale, cost-effective GPU-based solutions on demand for various applications such as AI/ML, graphics, gaming, and HPC,\u201d said Adam Selipsky, CEO at AWS. \u201cAWS has unmatched experience delivering GPU-based instances that have pushed the scalability envelope with each successive generation, with many customers scaling machine learning training workloads to more than 10,000 GPUs today. With second-generation EFA, customers will be able to scale their P5 instances to over 20,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, bringing supercomputer capabilities on demand to customers ranging from startups to large enterprises.\u201dAmazon cited a number of customers that are already using P5 instances, including Cohere, Hugging Face, and Pinterest. Notably, AWS also quotes Anthropic, an AI startup that said that it was partnering with Google Cloud after the company invested in it.\u201cWhile the large, general AI systems of today can have significant benefits, they can also be unpredictable, unreliable, and opaque, so our goal is to make progress on these issues and deploy systems that people find useful,\u201d said Tom Brown, co-founder of Anthropic. \u201cWe expect P5 instances to deliver substantial price-performance benefits over P4d instances, and they\u2019ll be available at the massive scale required for building next-generation LLMs and related products.\u201dHyperscalers have struggled to procure Nvidia's latest GPU due to supply shortages. Nvidia, in turn, has offered priority access to smaller cloud companies that aren't building their own AI chips, such as CoreWeave and LamdaLabs. It then invested in them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in The Compute, Storage & Networking Channel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDCD>Connect | Compute MENA - Sponsorship Brochure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14 Oct 2024\n\n\n\n\nTSMC plans new European chip fabs - report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nThe architecture of a supercomputer: A journey into advanced HPC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nTom Brown\n\n\nAWS\n\n\nAmazon Web Services\n\n\nAmazon EC2 P5\n\n\nH100 GPU\n\n\nAnthropic\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

If you've found your way directly here, you might want to start at the beginning: Generative AI: Hype, opportunity, and the future of data centers // Part I - The Models\n\n\nEven with the huge investments made in building out supercomputers in the cloud or in the lab, problems can arise.\u201cRecently, we saw that due to some issue with the GPUs on our cluster, we actually had to underclock them, because they would just blow past 500 watts a GPU at full throttle, and that would basically burn the GPU and your run would die,\u201d EleutherAI\u2019s Shivanshu Purohit said.\u201cEven the cloud provider didn't consider it because they thought it shouldn't happen, because it doesn't usually happen. But then it did.\u201dSimilarly, high energy particles \u201ccan break through all the redundancies and corrupt your GPU,\u201d he said.\u201cThere might be new problems as we scale beyond where we are right now, there's a limit to how many GPUs you can store in a single data center. Currently, the limit is around 32,000, both due to power and challenges on how to actually design the data center.\u201dPerhaps the answer is not to build ever larger data centers, but instead move away from GPUs.Computing\u2019s new waveOver the past half-decade, as Moore\u2019s Law has slowed and other AI applications have proliferated, AI chip companies have sprouted like mushrooms in the rain.Many have failed, or been acquired and asset-stripped, as a promised AI revolution has been slow to occur. Now, as a new wave of compute again seems poised to flood data centers, they are hopeful that their time has come.Each company we spoke to believes that its unique approach will be able to solve the challenge posed by ever-growing AI models.Tenstorrent\u201cWe believe our tech is uniquely good at where we think models are going to go,\u201d said Matt Mattina, head of AI at chip startup Tenstorrent.\u201cIf you buy into this idea that you can't just natively get to 10 trillion parameters, or however many trillions you want, our architecture has scaling built in.\u201cSo generative AI is fundamentally matrix multiplies [a binary operation that produces a matrix from two matrices], and it\u2019s big models,\u201d he continued. \u201cFor that, you need a machine that can do matrix multiply at high throughput and low power, and it needs to be able to scale. You need to be able to connect many, many chips together.\u201cYou need a fundamental building block that's efficient in terms of tops (Tera Operations Per Second) per watt, and can scale in an efficient way, which means that you don't need a rack of switches when you add another node of these things.\u201dThe company\u2019s chips each have integrated Ethernet, \u201cso the way you scale is you just connect the chips together over standard Ethernet, there's not a labyrinth of switching and stuff as you go to bigger sizes,\u201d and the company claims its software makes scaling easy.\u201cIt is a very promising architecture,\u201d SemiAnalysis\u2019 Dylan Patel said. \u201cIt's very interesting from a scaling and memory standpoint and a software programmability standpoint. But none of that is there yet.The hardware exists in some capacity and the software is still being worked on. It's a tough problem for them to crack and be usable, and there's a whole lot that still needs to be done.\u201dCerebrasRival Cerebras has a different approach to scaling: Simply make the chip larger.The Wafer Scale Engine 2 (WSE-2) chip has 2.6 trillion transistors, 850,000 'AI optimized' cores, 40GB of on-chip SRAM memory, 20 petabytes of memory bandwidth, and 220 petabits of aggregate fabric bandwidth. It is packaged in the Cerebras CS-2, a 15U box that also includes an HPE SuperDome Flex server.\u201cWhen these big companies are thinking about training generative AI, they're often thinking of gigaflops of compute,\u201d Cerebras CEO and co-founder, Andrew Feldman, said. \u201cWe're more efficient [than the current GPU approach], for sure, but you're still going to use an absurd amount of compute, because we're training in a sort of brute force manner.\u201dFeldman again believes that there will be a limit to the current approach of giant models, \u201cbecause we can't go bigger and bigger forever, there's some upper bound.\u201d He thinks sparsity approaches will help bring model sizes down.Still, he agrees that whatever the models, they will require huge compute clusters. \u201cBig clusters of GPUs are incredibly difficult to use,\u201d he said. \u201cDistributed compute is very painful, and distributing AI work - where you have to go tensor model parallel, and then you have to go pipeline model parallel, and so on - is an unbelievably complicated process.\u201dThe company hopes to solve some of that challenge by moving what would be handled by hundreds of GPUs onto one multi-million dollar mega-chip.\u201cThere are two reasons you break up work,\u201d he said. \u201cOne is you can't store all the parameters in memory, second reason is that you can't do a calculation that is needed, and that's usually a big matrix multiply in a big layer.\u201dIn the 175bn parameter GPT-3, the largest matrix multiply is about 12,000 by 12,000. \u201cWe can support hundreds of times larger, and because we store our parameters off-chip in our MemoryX technology, we have an arbitrarily large parameter store - 100-200 trillion is no problem,\u201d he claimed. \u201cAnd so we have the ability to store vast numbers of parameters, and we have the ability to do the largest multiplication step.\u201dThe single huge chip is not big enough for what the biggest models require, however. \u201cAnd so we built Andromeda, which is 13.5 million cores. It's one and a half times larger than [Oak Ridge\u2019s exascale system] Frontier in core count, and we were able to stand it up in three days. The first customer put on it was Argonne [another US national computing laboratory], and they were doing things they couldn't do on a 2,000 GPU cluster.\u201dThe Andromeda supercomputer, available over the cloud, combines 16 of Cerebras\u2019 CS-2 systems, but Cerebras has the potential ability to scale to 192 such systems as one cluster. \u201cThe scaling limitation is about 160 million cores,\u201d said Feldman.Cerebras is not the only company to offer its specialized hardware as a cloud product.Graphcore\u201cWe have decided to change our business model from selling hardware to operating an AI cloud,\u201d Simon Knowles, the CTO of British AI chip startup Graphcore, said.\u201cIs it realistic to set up and operate an AI cloud? Clearly, it's sensible because of the enormous margins that Nvidia is able to harvest. The real question is, is there a market for a specialized AI cloud that a generic cloud like AWS doesn't offer? We believe, yes, there is, and that is with IPUs.\u201dThe company\u2019s IPU (Intelligence Processing Unit) is another parallel processor designed from the ground up for AI workloads.\u201cIPUs have been designed from day one with a mandate not to look like GPUs,\u201d Knowles said. \u201cI'm amazed how many of the startups have tried to basically be an alternative GPU. The world doesn't need another Nvidia; Nvidia are quite good.\u201dHe believes that \u201cwhat the world needs is machines of different shapes, which will perform well on things where Nvidia can clearly be beaten.\u201d That\u2019s part of the reason why Graphcore is building its own cloud. While it will still sell some hardware, it found that customers won\u2019t commit to buying hardware, because they want it to be as good as or better than Nvidia GPUs on all workloads.\u201cThey wanted insurance that it would satisfy all their future needs that they didn't know about,\u201d he said. \u201cWhereas, as a cloud service, it's like \u2018for this set of functions, we can do it at half the price of them.\u2019\u201dEqually, he does not want to compete with AWS on every metric. \u201cYou'd have to be quite bold to believe that one cloud based on one technology could do everything well,\u201d he said.\nSambaNovaAnother startup offering specialized hardware on the cloud, on-prem, or as a service, is SambaNova. \u201cAs the models grow, we just believe that [SambaNova\u2019s architecture] Dataflow is what you're going to need,\u201d CEO Rodrigo Liang said. \u201cWe just believe that over time, as these models grow and expand, that the power required, the amount of cost, all those things will just be prohibitive on these legacy architectures.\u201cSo we fundamentally believe that new architecture will allow us to grow with the size of the models in a much more effective and much more efficient way, than the legacy ways of doing it.\u201dBut the incumbent legacy chip designers have also fielded hardware aimed at serving the training and inference needs of the latest AI models.\nIntel\"Habana Gaudi has already been proven to be like 2\u00d7 the performance of the A100 GPU on the MLPerf benchmark,\u201d Dr. Walter Riviera, Intel\u2019s AI technical lead EMEA, claimed of the company\u2019s deep learning training processor.\u201cWhen it comes to the GPU, we have the Flex series. And, again, depending on the workload, it is competitive. My advice for any customers out there is test and evaluate what's going to be best for them.\u201d\nAMDAMD has in recent years clawed CPU market share from Intel. But in the world of GPUs it has the second-best product on the market, SemiAnalysis\u2019 Dylan Patel believes, and has yet to win a significant share.\u201cIf anyone is going to be able to compete, it's the MI300 GPU,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it's missing some things too, it's not there in the software, and there are some aspects of the hardware that are going to be more costly. It's not a home run.\u201dAMD's data center and accelerated processing CVP Brad McCredie pointed to the company\u2019s leadership in HPC as a key advantage. \u201cWe\u2019re in the largest supercomputer on three continents,\u201d he said. \u201cSuch a big piece of this exploding AI mushroom is scale, and we've demonstrated our scale capability.McCredie also believes that AMD\u2019s successes with packing a lot of memory bandwidth onto its chips will prove particularly compelling for generative AI. \u201cWhen you go into the inferencing of these LLMs, memory capacity and bandwidth comes to the fore. We have eight stacks of high-bandwidth memory on our MI250, which is a leadership position.\u201dAnother key area he highlighted is power efficiency. \u201cWhen you start getting to this scale, power efficiency is just so important,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it's going to keep growing.\u201d\nGoogle\u2019s TPUThen there\u2019s the tensor processing unit (TPU), a custom AI chip family developed by Google - the same company that came up with the transformer model that forms the basis of current generative AI approaches.\u201cI think one of the main advantages of TPUs is the interconnect,\u201d researcher Finbarr Timbers said.\u201cThey have really high networking between chips, and that's incredibly useful for machine learning. For transformers generally, memory bandwidth is the bottleneck. It's all about moving the data from the RAM on the machine onto the on-chip memory, that's the huge bottleneck. TPUs are the best way to do this in the industry, because they have all of this dedicated infrastructure for it.\u201dThe other advantage of the chip is that it\u2019s used by Google to make its largest models, so the development of the hardware and models can be done in tandem.\u201cIt really comes down to co-design,\u201d Google\u2019s Amin Vahdat said. \u201cUnderstanding what the model needs from a computational perspective, figuring out how to best specify the model from a language perspective, figuring out how to write the compiler, and then map it to the hardware.\u201dThe company also touts the TPU\u2019s energy efficiency as a major advantage as these models grow. In a research paper, the company said that its TPUv4s used DSAs ~2-6\u00d7 less energy and produced ~20\u00d7 less CO2e than contemporary chip rivals (not including H100) - but the major caveat is that it was comparing its hyperscale data center to an on-premise facility.\nAmazon TrainiumAmazon also has its own Trainium chip family. It has yet to make as much of a splash, although Stability AI recently announced that it would look at training some of its models on the hardware (likely as part of its cloud deal with AWS).\"One capability that I would like to highlight is hardware-accelerated stochastic rounding,\" said AWS\u2019 director of EC2, Chetan Kapoor.\u201cSo stochastic rounding is a capability that we've built in the chip that intelligently says, okay, am I going to round a number down or up?,\u201d he said, with systems normally just rounding down. \u201cIt basically means that with stochastic rounding you can actually get the throughput of FP16 datatype and the accuracy of FP32.\u201d\nNvidia: The king of generative AINvidia has not been napping - and chip rivals that hope to disrupt its fat margins will find the task daunting, like Microsoft's Bing nibbling away at Google's image of search superiority.Rather than seeing this as an end to its dominance and a 'code red' moment akin to what's happening at Google, Nvidia says this is the culmination of decades of preparation for this very moment.\u201cThey've been talking about this for years,\u201d SemiAnalysis\u2019 Patel said. \u201cSure they were caught off guard with how quickly it took off in the last few months, but they were always targeting this. I think they're very well positioned.\u201dOutside of Google\u2019s use of TPUs, virtually all the major generative AI models available today were developed on Nvidia\u2019s A100 GPUs. The models of tomorrow will primarily be built with its newly-lanched H100s.Decades of leading the AI space has meant that an entire sector has been built around its products. \u201cEven as an academic user, if I were to be given infinite compute on those other systems, I would have to do a year of software engineering work before I can even make them useful because the entire deep learning stack is on Nvidia and Nvidia Mellanox [the company\u2019s networking platform],\u201d EleutherAI\u2019s Anthony said. \u201cIt's all really a unified system.\u201dColleague Purohit added: \u201cIt\u2019s the whole ecosystem, not just Mellanox. They optimize it end-to-end so they have the greatest hardware. The generational gap between an A100 and H100 from the preliminary tests that we have done is enough that Nvidia will be the compute king for the foreseeable future.\u201dIn his view, Nvidia has perfected the hardware-improves-software-improves-hardware loop, \u201cand the only one that competes is basically Google. Someone could build a better chip, but the software is optimized for Nvidia.\u201d\n\n\n\nA key example of Nvidia\u2019s efforts to stay ahead was its launch of the tensor core in late 2017, designed for superior deep learning performance over regular cores based on Nvidia\u2019s CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) parallel platform.\u201cIt changed the game,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cA regular user can just change their code to use mixed precision tensor cores for compute and double their performance.\u201dNow, Nvidia hopes to push things further with a transformer engine in the H100, for FP8. \u201cIt\u2019s a hardware-software combination, actually,\u201d Nvidia\u2019s head of data centers and AI, Ian Buck, said. \u201cWe basically added eight-bit floating point capability to our GPU, and did that intelligently while maintaining accuracy.\u201dA software engine essentially monitors the accuracy of the training and inference job along the way, and dynamically lowers things to FP8.\u201cTensor cores killed FP32 training entirely. Before that everything was on FP32,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cI don't know if the move to FP8 will be the same, maybe it is not enough precision. We\u2019re yet to see if deep learning people can still converge their models on that hardware.\u201d\n\n\n\n    As everyone's trying to race ahead in building these models they're going to use [Nvidia\u2019s] GPUs\n    \n\n\nBut just as the Tesla GPUs in Summit are too old for today\u2019s challenges, H100s won\u2019t be up for the models of the future.\u201cThey're evolving together,\u201d Buck said, pointing out that Nvidia\u2019s GTX 580 cards were used to build AlexNet, one of the most influential convolutional neural networks ever made, way back in 2012.\u201cThose GPUs are completely impractical today, a data center could not even be built to make them scale for the models of today, it would just fall over,\u201d Buck said.\u201cSo are current GPUs going to get us to 150 trillion parameters? No. But the evolution of our GPUs, the evolution of what goes into the chips, the architecture itself, the memory interconnect, NVLink, and data center designs, will. And then all the software optimizations that are happening on top is how we beat Moore's Law.\u201dFor now, this market remains Nvidia\u2019s to lose. \u201cAs everyone's trying to race ahead in building these models they're going to use [Nvidia\u2019s] GPUs,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThey're better and easier to use. Generally, actually, they're cheaper too when you don't have to spend as much time and money on optimizing them.\u201dThis may change as models mature. Currently, in a cut-throat space where performance and speed of deployment are at a premium, Nvidia represents the safe and highly capable bet.As time goes on and that pressure eases, companies may look to alternative architectures and optimize deployments on cheaper gear.Compute is just half the story. Let's talk networking.\n\n\n\nOther articles in this series\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13 Jul 2023\n\n\n\n\nGenerative AI & the future of data centers: Part VI - The Network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13 Jul 2023\n\n\n\n\nGenerative AI & the future of data centers: Part VII - The Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13 Jul 2023\n\n\n\n\nGenerative AI & the future of data centers: Part I - The Models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nAMD\n\n\nGPU\n\n\nCerebras\n\n\nAndrew Feldman\n\n\nTenstorrent\n\n\nIntel\n\n\nSambaNova\n\n\nGraphcore\n\n\nTPU\n\n\nEleutherAI\n\n\nRodrigo Liang\n\n\nAmin Vahdat\n\n\nIan Buck\n\n\nChetan Kapoor\n\n\nSemiAnalysis\n\n\nFinbarr Timbers\n\n\nWafer Scale Engine 2\n\n\nSimon Knowles\n\n\nDr. Walter Riviera\n\n\nMatt Mattina\n\n\nmatrix multiply\n\n\nBrad McCredie\n\n\ngenerative AI\n\n\nTrainium\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

Intel made good on its promise of re-entering the discrete graphics card market, Nvidia pushed card sizes and prices through the roof, and AMD brought CPU tech into the graphics arena. The headlines were replete with stories of disappointing performance, melting cables, and faked frames.\nThe fervor around GPUs permeated online forums, leaving PC enthusiasts both awestruck and appalled at the transformation of the graphics card market. Amid this commotion, it's easy to forget that the latest products are housing the most complex and powerful chips that have ever graced a home computer.\nIn this article we'll bring all the vendors to the table and dive deep into their architectures. Let's peel away the layers to see what's new, what they have in common, and what any of this means to the average user.\nThis is a comprehensive and technical read, so we've split it in a few sections as shown in the index below so it's easier to follow and navigate. To get the most out of this discussion, you may want to brush up on RDNA 2 and Ampere architectures before you start here.\nArticle Index\n\nOverall GPU Structure\nShader Core Structure\nRay Tracing Units and Features\nMemory Hierarchy (Cache and DRAM)\nChip Packaging and Process Nodes\nDisplay and Media Engines\nWhat's Next for the GPU?\n\nOverall GPU Structure: Starting From the Top\nLet's start with an important aspect of this article \u2013 this is not a performance comparison. Instead, we're looking at how everything is arranged inside a GPU, checking out the specs and figures to understand the differences in approach that AMD, Intel, and Nvidia have when it comes to designing their graphics processors.\nWe'll begin with a look at the overall GPU compositions for the largest chips available that use the architectures we're examining. It's important to stress that Intel's offering isn't targeted at the same market as AMD's or Nvidia's, as it's very much a mid-range graphics processor.\n\nAll three are quite different in size, not only to each other, but also to similar chips using previous architectures. All of this analysis is purely for understanding what exactly is under the hood in all three processors. We'll examine the overall structures, before breaking apart the fundamental sections of each GPU \u2013 the shader cores, ray tracing abilities, the memory hierarchy, and the display and media engines.\nAMD Navi 31\nTaking things alphabetically, the first on the table is AMD's Navi 31, their largest RDNA 3-powered chip announced so far. Compared to the Navi 21, we can see a clear growth in component count from their previous top-end GPU...\n\nAMD Navi 31 block diagram\nThe Shader Engines (SE) house fewer Compute Units (CUs), 16 versus 200, but there are now 6 SEs in total \u2013 two more than before. This means Navi 31 has up to 96 CUs, fielding a total of 6144 Stream Processors (SP). AMD has done a full upgrade of the SPs for RDNA 3 and we'll tackle that later in the article.\nEach Shader Engine also contains a dedicated unit to handle rasterization, a primitive engine for triangle setup, 32 render output units (ROPs), and two 256kB L1 caches. The last aspect is now double the size but the ROP count per SE is still the same.\nAMD hasn't changed the rasterizer and primitive engines much either \u2013 the stated improvements of 50% are for the full die, as it has 50% more SEs than the Navi 21 chip. However, there are changes to how the SEs handle instructions, such as faster processing of multiple draw commands and better management of pipeline stages, which should reduce how long a CU needs to wait before it can move on to another task.\nThe most obvious change is the one that garnered the most rumors and gossip before the November launch \u2013 the chiplet approach to the GPU package. With several years of experience in this field, it's somewhat logical that AMD chose to do this, but it's entirely for cost/manufacturing reasons, rather than performance.\n\nWe'll take a more detailed look at this later in the article, so for now, let's just concentrate on what parts are where. In the Navi 31, the memory controllers and their associated partitions of the final-tier cache are housed in separate chiplets (called MCDs or Memory Cache Dies) that surround the primary processor (GCD, Graphics Compute Die).\nWith a greater number of SEs to feed, AMD increased the MC count by 50%, too, so the total bus width to the GDDR6 global memory is now 384-bits. There's less Infinity Cache in total this time (96MB vs 128MB), but the greater memory bandwidth offsets this.\nIntel ACM-G10\nOnward to Intel and the ACM-G10 die (formerly called DG2-512). While this isn't the largest GPU that Intel makes, it's their biggest consumer graphics die.\nThe block diagram is a fairly standard arrangement, though looking more akin to Nvidia's than AMD's. With a total of 8 Render Slices, each containing 4 Xe-Cores, for a total count of 512 Vector Engines (Intel's equivalent of AMD's Stream Processors and Nvidia's CUDA cores).\n\nIntel ACM-G10 block diagram\nAlso packed into each Render Slice is a primitive unit, rasterizer, depth buffer processor, 32 texture units, and 16 ROPs. At first glance, this GPU would appear to be pretty large, as 256 TMUs and 128 ROPs are more than that found in a Radeon RX 6800 or GeForce RTX 2080, for example.\nHowever, AMD's RNDA 3 chip houses 96 Compute Units, each with 128 ALUs, whereas the ACM-G10's sports a total of 32 Xe Cores, with 128 ALUs per core. So, in terms of ALU count only, Intel's Alchemist-powered GPU is a third the size of AMD's. But as we'll see later, a significant amount of the ACM-G10's die is given over to a different number-crunching unit.\nCompared to the first Alchemist GPU that Intel released via OEM suppliers, this chip has all the hallmarks of a mature architecture, in terms of component count and structural arrangement.\nNvidia AD102\nWe finish our opening overview of the different layouts with Nvidia's AD102, their first GPU to use the Ada Lovelace architecture. Compared to its predecessor, the Ampere GA102, it doesn't seem all that different, just a lot larger. And to all intents and purposes, it is.\nNvidia uses a component hierarchy of a Graphics Processing Cluster (GPU) that contains 6 Texture Processing Clusters (TPCs), with each of those housing 2 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs). This arrangement hasn't changed with Ada, but the total numbers certainly have...\n\nNvidia AD102 block diagram\nIn the full AD102 die, the GPC count has gone from 7 to 12, so there is now a total of 144 SMs, giving a total of 18432 CUDA cores. This might seem like a ridiculously high number when compared to the 6144 SPs in Navi 31, but AMD and Nvidia count their components differently.\nAlthough this is grossly simplifying matters, one Nvidia SM is equivalent to one AMD CU \u2013 both contain 128 ALUs. So where Navi 31 is twice the size of the Intel ACM-G10 (ALU count only), the AD102 is 3.5 times larger.\nThis is why it's unfair to do any outright performance comparisons of the chips when they're so clearly different in terms of scale. However, once they're inside a graphics card, priced and marketed, then it's a different story.\nBut what we can compare are the smallest repeated parts of the three processors.\nShader Cores: Into the Brains of the GPU\nFrom the overview of the whole processor, let's now dive into the hearts of the chips, and look at the fundamental number-crunching parts of the processors: the shader cores.\nThe three manufacturers use different terms and phrases when it comes to describing their chips, especially when it comes to their overview diagrams. So for this article, we're going to use our own images, with common colors and structures, so that it's easier to see what's the same and what's different.\nAMD RDNA 3\nAMD's smallest unified structure within the shading part of the GPU is called a Double Compute Unit (DCU). In some documents, it's still called a Workgroup Processor (WGP), whereas others refer to it as a Compute Unit Pair.\nPlease note that if something isn't shown in these diagrams (e.g. constants caches, double precision units) that doesn't mean they're not present in the architecture.\n\nIn many ways, the overall layout and structural elements haven't changed much from RDNA 2. Two Compute Units share some caches and memory, and each one comprises two sets of 32 Stream Processors (SP).\nWhat's new for version 3, is that each SP now houses twice as many arithmetic logic units (ALUs) as before. There are now two banks of SIMD64 units per CU and each bank has two dataports \u2013 one for floating point, integer, and matrix operations, with the other for just float and matrix.\nAMD does use separate SPs for different data formats \u2013 the Compute Units in RDNA 3 supports operation using FP16, BF16, FP32, FP64, INT4, INT8, INT16, and INT32 values.\nThe use of SIMD64 means that each thread scheduler can send out a group of 64 threads (called a wavefront), or it can co-issue two wavefronts of 32 threads, per clock cycle. AMD has retained the same instruction rules from previous RDNA architectures, so this is something that's handled by the GPU/drivers.\n\nAnother significant new feature is the appearance of what AMD calls AI Matrix Accelerators.\nUnlike Intel's and Nvidia's architecture, which we'll see shortly, these don't act as separate units \u2013 all matrix operations utilize the SIMD units and any such calculations (called Wave Matrix Multiply Accumulate, WMMA) will use the full bank of 64 ALUs.\nAt the time of writing, the exact nature of the AI Accelerators isn't clear, but it's probably just circuitry associated with handling the instructions and the huge amount of data involved, to ensure maximum throughput. It may well have a similar function to that of Nvidia's Tensor Memory Accelerator, in their Hopper architecture.\nCompared to RDNA 2, the changes are relatively small \u2013 the older architecture could also handle 64 thread wavefronts (aka Wave64), but these were issued over two cycles and used both SIMD32 blocks in each Compute Unit. Now, this can all be done in one cycle and will only use one SIMD block.\n\nIn previous documentation, AMD stated that Wave32 was typically used for compute and vertex shaders (and probably ray shaders, too), whereas Wave 64 was mostly for pixel shaders, with the drivers compiling shaders accordingly. So the move to single cycle Wave64 instruction issue will provide a boost to games that are heavily dependent on pixel shaders.\nHowever, all of this extra power on tap needs to be correctly utilized in order to take full advantage of it. This is something that's true of all GPU architectures and they all need to be heavily loaded with lots of threads, in order to do this (it also helps hide the inherent latency that's associated with DRAM).\nSo with doubling the ALUs, AMD has pushed the need for programmers to use instruction-level parallelism as much as possible. This isn't something new in the world of graphics, but one significant advantage that RDNA had over AMD's old GCN architecture was that it didn't need as many threads in flight to reach full utilization. Given how complex modern rendering has become in games, developers are going to have a little more work on their hands, when it comes to writing their shader code.\n\nIntel Alchemist\nLet's move on to Intel now, and look at the DCU-equivalent in the Alchemist architecture, called an Xe Core (which we'll abbreviate to XEC). At first glance, these look absolutely huge in comparison to AMD's structure.\nWhere a single DCU in RDNA 3 houses four SIMD64 blocks, Intel's XEC contains sixteen SIMD8 units, each one managed by its own thread scheduler and dispatch system. Like AMD's Streaming Processors, the so-called Vector Engines in Alchemist can handle integer and float data formats. There's no support for FP64, but this isn't much of an issue in gaming.\nIntel has always used relatively narrow SIMDs \u2013 those used in likes of Gen11 were only 4-wide (i.e. handle 4 threads simultaneously) and only doubled in width with Gen 12 (as used in their Rocket Lake CPUs, for example).\nBut given that the gaming industry has been used to SIMD32 GPUs for a good number of years, and thus games are coded accordingly, the decision to keep the narrow execution blocks seems counter-productive.\n\nWhere AMD's RDNA 3 and Nvidia's Ada Lovelace have processing blocks that can be issued 64 or 32 threads in a single cycle, Intel's architecture requires 4 cycles to achieve the same result on one VE \u2013 hence why there are sixteen SIMD units per XEC.\nHowever, this means that if games aren't coded in such a way to ensure the VEs are fully occupied, the SIMDs and associated resources (cache, bandwidth, etc.) will be left idle. A common theme in benchmark results with Intel's Arc-series of graphics cards is that they tend to do better at higher resolutions and/or in games with lots of complex, modern shader routines.\nThis is in part due to the high level of unit subdivision and resource sharing that takes place. Micro-benchmarking analysis by website Chips and Cheese shows that for all its wealth of ALUs, the architecture struggles to achieve proper utilization.\nMoving on to other aspects in the XEC, it's not clear how large the Level 0 instruction cache is but where AMD's are 4-way (because it serves four SIMD blocks), Intel's will have to be 16-way, which adds to the complexity of the cache system.\nIntel also chose to provide the processor with dedicated units for matrix operations, one for each Vector Engine. Having this many units means a significant portion of the die is dedicated to handling matrix math.\n\nWhere AMD uses the DCU's SIMD units to do this and Nvidia has four relatively large tensor/matrix units per SM, Intel's approach seems a little excessive, given that they have a separate architecture, called Xe-HP, for compute applications.\nAnother odd design seems to be the load/store (LD/ST) units in the processing block. Not shown in our diagrams, these manage memory instructions from threads, moving data between the register file and the L1 cache. Ada Lovelace is identical to Ampere with four per SM partition, giving 16 in total. RDNA 3 is also the same as its predecessor, with each CU having dedicated LD/ST circuitry as part of the texture unit.\nIntel's Xe-HPG presentation shows just one LD/ST per XEC but in reality, it's probably composed of further discrete units inside. However, in their optimization guide for OneAPI, a diagram suggests that the LD/ST cycles through the individual register files one at a time. If that's the case, then Alchemist will always struggle to achieve maximum cache bandwidth efficiency, because not all files are being served at the same time.\nNvidia Ada Lovelace\nThe last processing block to look at is Nvidia's Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) \u2013 the GeForce version of the DCU/XEC. This structure hasn't changed a great deal from the 2018 Turing architecture. In fact, it's almost identical to Ampere.\nSome of the units have been tweaked to improve their performance or feature set, but for the most part, there's not a great deal that's new to talk about. Actually, there could be, but Nvidia is notoriously shy at revealing much about the inner operations and specifications of their chips. Intel provides a little more detail, but the information is typically buried in other documents.\n\nBut to summarize the structure, the SM is split into four partitions. Each one has its own L0 instruction cache, thread scheduler and dispatch unit, and a 64 kB section of the register file paired to a SIMD32 processor.\nJust as in AMD's RDNA 3, the SM supports dual-issued instructions, where each partition can concurrently process two threads, one with FP32 instructions and the other with FP32 or INT32 instructions.\n\nNvidia's H100 GPU uses their Hopper architecture\nNvidia's Tensor cores are now in their 4th revision but this time, the only notable change was the inclusion of the FP8 Transformer Engine from their Hopper chip \u2013 raw throughput figures remain unaltered.\nThe addition of the low-precision float format means that the GPU should be more suitable for AI training models. The Tensor cores still also offer the sparsity feature from Ampere, which can provide up to double the throughput.\nAnother improvement lies in the Optical Flow Accelerator (OFA) engine (not shown in our diagrams). This circuit generates an optical flow field, which is used as part of the DLSS algorithm. With double the performance of the OFA in Ampere, the extra throughput is utilized in the latest version of their temporal, anti-aliasing upscaler, DLSS 3.\n\nDLSS 3 has already faced a fair amount of criticism, centering around two aspects: the DLSS-generated frames aren't 'real' and the process adds additional latency to the rendering chain. The first isn't entirely invalid, as the system works by first having the GPU render two consecutive frames, storing them in memory, before using a neural network algorithm to determine what an intermediary frame would look like.\nThe present chain then returns to the first rendered frame and displays that one, followed by the DLSS-frame, and then the second frame rendered. Because the game's engine hasn't cycled for the middle frame, the screen is being refreshed without any potential input. And because the two successive frames need to be stalled, rather than presented, any input that has been polled for those frames will also get stalled.\nWhether DLSS 3 ever becomes popular or commonplace remains to be seen.\nAlthough the SM of Ada is very similar to Ampere, there are notable changes to the RT core and we'll address those shortly. For now, let's summarize the computational capabilities of AMD, Intel, and Nvidia's GPU repeated structures.\nProcessing Block Comparison\nWe can compare the SM, XEC, and DCU capabilities by looking at the number of operations, for standard data formats, per clock cycle. Note that these are peak figures and are not necessarily achievable in reality.\n\n\n\nOperations per clock\nAda Lovelace\nAlchemist\nRDNA 3\n\n\nFP32\n128\n128\n256\n\n\nFP16\n128\n256\n512\n\n\nFP64\n2\nn/a\n16\n\n\nINT32\n64\n128\n128\n\n\nFP16 matrix\n512\n2048\n256\n\n\nINT8 matrix\n1024\n4096\n256\n\n\nINT4 matrix\n2048\n8192\n1024\n\n\n\nNvidia's figures haven't changed from Ampere, whereas RDNA 3's numbers have doubled in some areas. Alchemist, though, is on another level when it comes to matrix operations, although the fact that these are peak theoretical values should be emphasized again.\nGiven that Intel's graphics division leans heavily towards data center and compute, just like Nvidia does, it's not surprising to see the architecture dedicate so much die space to matrix operations. The lack of FP64 capability isn't a problem, as that data format isn't really used in gaming, and the functionality is present in their Xe-HP architecture.\nAda Lovelace and Alchemist are, theoretically, stronger than RDNA 3 when it comes to matrix/tensor operations, but since we're looking at GPUs that are primarily used for gaming workloads, the dedicated units mostly just provide acceleration for algorithms involved in DLSS and XeSS \u2013 these use a convolutional auto-encoder neural network (CAENN) that scans an image for artifacts and corrects them.\nAMD's temporal upscaler (FidelityFX Super Resolution, FSR) doesn't use a CAENN, as it's based primarily on a Lanczos resampling method, followed by a number of image correction routines, processed via the DCUs. However, in the RDNA 3 launch, the next version of FSR was briefly introduced, citing a new feature called Fluid Motion Frames. With a performance uplift of up to double that of FSR 2.0, the general consensus is that this is likely to involve frame generation, as in DLSS 3, but whether this involves any matrix operations is yet to be clear.\nRay Tracing for Everybody Now\nWith the launch of their Arc graphics cards series, using the Alchemist architecture, Intel joined AMD and Nvidia in offering GPUs that provided dedicated accelerators for various algorithms involved with the use of ray tracing in graphics. Both Ada and RNDA 3 contain significantly updated RT units, so it makes sense to take a look at what's new and different.\nStarting with AMD, the biggest change to their Ray Accelerators is adding hardware to improve the traversal of the bounding volume hierarchies (BVH). These are data structures that are used to speed up determining what surface a ray of light has hit, in the 3D world.\n\nIn RDNA 2, all of this work was processed via the Compute Units, and to a certain extent, it still is. However, for DXR, Microsoft's ray tracing API, there's hardware support for the management of ray flags.\nThe use of these can greatly reduce the number of times the BVH needs to be traversed, reducing the overall load on cache bandwidth and compute units. In essence, AMD has focused on improving the overall efficiency of the system they introduced in the previous architecture.\n\nAdditionally, the hardware has been updated to improve box sorting (which makes traversal faster) and culling algorithms (to skip testing empty boxes). Coupled with improvements to the cache system, AMD states that there's up to 80% more ray tracing performance, at the same clock speed, compared to RDNA 2.\nHowever, such improvements do not translate into 80% more frames per second in games using ray tracing \u2013 the performance in these situations is governed by many factors and the capabilities of the RT units is just one of them.\nWith Intel being new to the ray tracing game, there are no improvements as such. Instead, we're simply told that their RT units handle BVH traversal and intersection calculations, between rays and triangles. This makes them more akin to Nvidia's system than AMD's, but there's not a great deal of information available about them.\nBut we do know that each RT unit has an unspecified-sized cache for storing BVH data and a separate unit for analyzing and sorting ray shader threads, to improve SIMD utilization.\n\nEach XEC is paired with one RT unit, giving a total of four per Render Slice. Some early testing of the A770 with ray tracing enabled in games shows that whatever structures Intel has in place, Alchemist's overall capability in ray tracing is at least as good as that found with Ampere chips, and a little better than RDNA 2 models.\nBut let us repeat again that ray tracing also places heavy stress on the shading cores, cache system, and memory bandwidth, so it's not possible to extract the RT unit performance from such benchmarks.\nFor the Ada Lovelace architecture, Nvidia made a number of changes, with suitably large claims for the performance uplift, compared to Ampere. The accelerators for ray-triangle intersection calculations are claimed to have double the throughput, and BVH traversal for non-opaque surfaces is now said to be twice as fast. The latter is important for objects that use textures with an alpha channel (transparency), for example, leaves on a tree.\n\nA ray hitting a fully transparent section of such a surface shouldn't result in a hit result \u2013 the ray should pass straight through. However, to accurately determine this in current games with ray tracing, multiple other shaders need to be processed. Nvidia's new Opacity Micromap Engine breaks up these surfaces into further triangles and then determines what exactly is going on, reducing the number of ray shaders required.\nTwo further additions to the ray tracing abilities of Ada are a reduction in build time and memory footprint of the BVHs (with claims of 10x faster and 20x smaller, respectively), and a structure to reorder threads for ray shaders, giving better efficiency. However, where the former requires no changes in software by developers, the latter is currently only accessed by an API from Nvidia, so it's of no benefit to current DirectX 12 games.\n\nWhen we tested the GeForce RTX 4090's ray tracing performance, the average drop in frame rate with ray tracing enabled, was just under 45%. With the Ampere-powered GeForce RTX 3090 Ti, the drop was 56%. However, this improvement cannot be exclusively attributed to the RT core improvements, as the 4090 has substantially more shading throughput and cache than the previous model.\nWe've yet to see how what kind of difference RDNA 3's ray tracing improvements amount to, but it's worth noting that none of the GPU manufacturers expects RT to be used in isolation \u2013 i.e. the use of upscaling is still required to achieve high frame rates.\nFans of ray tracing may be somewhat disappointed that there haven't been any major gains in this area, with the new round of graphics processors, but a lot of progress has been made from when it first appeared, back in 2018 with Nvidia's Turing architecture.\nMemory: Driving Down the Data Highways\nGPUs crunch through data like no other chip and keeping the ALUs fed with numbers is crucial to their performance. In the early days of PC graphics processors, there was barely any cache inside and the global memory (the RAM used by the entire chip) was desperately slow DRAM. Even just 10 years ago, the situation wasn't that much better.\nSo let's dive into what's the current state of affairs, starting with AMD's memory hierarchy in their new architecture. Since its first iteration, RDNA has used a complex, multi-level memory hierarchy. The biggest changes came a year earlier when a huge amount of L3 cache was added to the GPU, up to 128MB in certain models.\nThis is still the case for round three, but with some subtle changes.\n\nThe register files are now 50% larger (which they had to be, to cope with the increase in ALUs) and the first three levels of cache are all now larger. L0 and L1 have doubled in size, and the L2 cache is up to 2MB, to a total of 6MB in the Navi 31 die.\nThe L3 cache has actually shrunk to 96MB, but there's a good reason for this \u2013 it's no longer in the GPU die. We'll talk more about that aspect in a later section of this article.\nWith wider bus widths between the various cache levels, the overall internal bandwidth is a lot higher too. Clock-for-clock, there's 50% more between L0 and L1, and the same increase between L1 and L2. But the biggest improvement is between L2 and the external L3 \u2013 it's now 2.25 times wider, in total.\n\nThe Navi 21, as used in Radeon RX 6900 XT, had an L2-to-L3 total peak bandwidth of 2.3 TB/s; the Navi 31 in the Radeon RX 7900 XT increases that to 5.3 TB/s, due to the use of AMD's Infinity fanout links.\nHaving the L3 cache separate from the main die does increase latency, but this is offset by the use of higher clocks for the Infinity Fabric system \u2013 overall, there's a 10% reduction in L3 latency times compared to RDNA 2.\nRDNA 3 is still designed to use GDDR6, rather than the slightly faster GDDR6X, but the top-end Navi 31 chip houses two more memory controllers to increase the global memory bus width to 384 bits.\nAMD's cache system is certainly more complex than Intel's and Nvidia's, but micro-benchmarking of RDNA 2 by Chips and Cheese shows that it's a very efficient system. The latencies are low all around and it provides the background support required for the CUs to reach high utilization, so we can expect the same of the system used in RDNA 3.\n\nIntel's memory hierarchy is somewhat simpler, being primarily a two-tier system (ignoring smaller caches, such as those for constants). There's no L0 data cache, just a decent amount 192kB of L1 data & shared memory.\nJust as with Nvidia, this cache can be dynamically allocated, with up to 128kB of it being available as shared memory. Additionally, there's a separate 64kB texture cache (not shown in our diagram).\nFor a chip (the DG2-512 as used in the A770) that was designed to be used in graphics cards for the mid-range market, the L2 cache is very large at 16MB in total. The data width is suitably big, too, with a total 2048 bytes per clock, between L1 and L2. This cache comprises eight partitions, with each serving a single 32-bit GDDR6 memory controller.\nHowever, analysis has shown that despite the wealth of cache and bandwidth on tap, the Alchemist architecture isn't particularly good at fully using it all, requiring workloads with high thread counts to mask its relatively poor latency.\n\nNvidia has retained the same memory structure as used in Ampere, with each SM sporting 128kB of cache that acts as an L1 data store, shared memory, and texture cache. The amount available for the different roles is dynamically allocated. Nothing has yet been said about any changes to the L1 bandwidth, but in Ampere it was 128 bytes per clock per SM. Nvidia has never been explicitly clear whether this figure is cumulative, combining read and writes, or for one direction only.\nIf Ada is at least the same as Ampere, then the total L1 bandwidth, for all SMs combined, is an enormous 18 kB per clock \u2013 far larger than RDNA 2 and Alchemist.\nBut it must be stressed again that the chips are not directly comparable, as Intel's was priced and marketed as a mid-range product, and AMD has made it clear that the Navi 31 was never designed to compete against Nvidia's AD102. Its competitor is the AD103 which is substantially smaller than the AD102.\nThe biggest change to the memory hierarchy is that the L2 cache has ballooned to 96MB, in a full AD102 die \u2013 16 times more than its predecessor, the GA102. As with Intel's system, the L2 is partitioned and paired with a 32-bit GDDR6X memory controller, for a DRAM bus width of up to 384 bits.\n\nThe AD102 tops data center GPUs for L2 cache size\nLarger cache sizes typically have longer latencies than smaller ones, but due to increased clock speeds and some improvements with the buses, Ada Lovelace displays better cache performance than Ampere.\nIf we compare all three systems, Intel and Nvidia take the same approach for the L1 cache \u2013 it can be used as a read-only data cache or as a compute shared memory. In the case of the latter, the GPUs need to be explicitly instructed, via software, to use it in this format and the data is only retained for as long as the threads using it are active. This adds to the system's complexity, but it produces a useful boost to compute performance.\nIn RDNA 3, the 'L1' data cache and shared memory are separated into two 32kB L0 vector caches and a 128kB local data share. What AMD calls L1 cache is really a shared stepping stone, for read-only data, between a group of four DCUs and the L2 cache.\nWhile none of the cache bandwidths are as high as Nvidia's, the multi-tiered approach helps to counter this, especially when the DCUs aren't fully utilized.\n\nTop-end cards have lots of DRAM but it's still relatively slow\nEnormous, processor-wide cache systems aren't generally the best for GPUs, which is why we've not seen much more than 4 or 6MB in previous architectures, but the reason why AMD, Intel, and Nvidia all have substantial amounts in the final tier is to counter the relative lack of growth in DRAM speeds.\nAdding lots of memory controllers to a GPU can provide plenty of bandwidth, but at the cost of increased die sizes and manufacturing overheads, and alternatives such as HBM3 are a lot more expensive to use.\nWe've yet to see how well AMD's system ultimately performs but their four-tiered approach in RDNA 2 fared well against Ampere, and it's substantially better than Intel's. However, with Ada packing in considerably more L2, the competition is no longer as straightforward.\nChip Packaging and Process Nodes: Different Ways to Build a Power Plant\nThere's one thing that AMD, Intel, and Nvidia all have in common \u2013 they all use TSMC to fabricate their GPUs.\nAMD uses two different nodes for the GCD and MCDs in Navi 31, with the former made using the N5 node and the latter on N6 (an enhanced version of N7). Intel also uses N6 for all its Alchemist chips. With Ampere, Nvidia used Samsung's old 8nm process, but with Ada they switched back to TSMC and its N4 process, which is a variant of N5.\nN4 has the highest transistor density and the best performance-to-power ratio of all the nodes, but when AMD launched RDNA 3, they highlighted that only logic circuitry has seen any notable increase in density.\n\nSRAM (used for cache) and analog systems (used for memory, system, and other signaling circuits) have shrunk relatively little. Coupled with the rise in price per wafer for the newer process nodes, AMD made the decision to use the slightly older and cheaper N6 to fabricate the MCDs, as these chiplets are mostly SRAM and I/O.\nIn terms of die size, the GCD is 42% smaller than the Navi 21, coming in at 300 mm2. Each MCD is just 37mm2, so the combined die area of the Navi 31 is roughly the same as its predecessor. AMD has only stated a combined transistor count, for all the chiplets, but at 58 billion, this new GPU is their 'largest' consumer graphics processor ever.\nTo connect each MCD to the GCD, AMD is using what they call High Performance Fanouts \u2013 densely packed traces, that take up a very small amount of space. The Infinity Links \u2013 AMD's proprietary interconnect and signaling system \u2013 run at up to 9.2Gb/s and with each MCD having a link width of 384 bits, the MCD-to-GCD bandwidth comes to 883GB/s (bidirectional).\nThat's equivalent to the global memory bandwidth of a high-end graphics card, for just a single MCD. With all six in the Navi 31, the combined L2-to-MCD bandwidth comes to 5.3TB/s.\nThe use of complex fanouts means the cost of die packaging, compared to a traditional monolithic chip, is going to be higher but the process is scalable \u2013 different SKUs can use the same GCD but varying numbers of MCDs. The smaller sizes of the individual chiplet dies should improve wafer yields, but there's no indication as to whether AMD has incorporated any redundancy into the design of the MCDs.\n\nIf there isn't any, it means any chiplet that has flaws in the SRAM, which prevent that part of the memory array from being used, then they will have to be binned for a lower-end model SKU or not used at all.\nAMD has only announced two RDNA 3 graphics cards so far (Radeon RX 7900 XT and XTX), but in both models, the MCDs field 16MB of cache each. If the next round of Radeon cards sports a 256 bit memory bus and, say, 64MB of L3 cache, then they will need to use the 'perfect' 16MB dies, too.\nHowever, since they are so small in area, a single 300mm wafer could potentially yield over 1500 MCDs. Even if 50% of those have to be scrapped, that's still sufficient dies to furnish 125 Navi 31 packages.\nIt will take some time before we can tell just how cost-effective AMD's design actually is, but the company is fully committed to using this approach now and in the future, though only for the larger GPUs. Budget RNDA 3 models, with far smaller amounts of cache, will continue to use a monolithic fabrication method as it's more cost-effective to make them that way.\nIntel's ACM-G10 processor is 406mm2, with a total transistor count of 21.7 billion, sitting somewhere between AMD's Navi 21 and Nvidia's GA104, in terms of component count and die area.\nThis actually makes it quite a large processor, which is why Intel's choice of market sector for the GPU seems somewhat odd. The Arc A770 graphics card, which uses a full ACM-G10 die, was pitched against the likes of Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3060 \u2013 a graphics card that uses a chip half the size and transistor count of Intel's.\n\nSo why is it so large? There are two probable causes: the 16MB of L2 cache and the very large number of matrix units in each XEC. The decision to have the former is logical, as it eases pressure on the global memory bandwidth, but the latter could easily be considered excessive for the sector it's sold in. The RTX 3060 has 112 Tensor cores, whereas the A770 has 512 XMX units.\nAnother odd choice by Intel is the use of TSMC N6 for manufacturing the Alchemist dies, rather than their own facilities. An official statement given on the matter cited factors such as cost, fab capacity, and chip operating frequency.\nThis suggests that Intel's equivalent production facilities (using the renamed Intel 7 node) wouldn't have been able to meet the expected demand, with their Alder and Raptor Lake CPUs taking up most of the capacity.\n\nThey would have compared the relative drop in CPU output, and how that would have impacted revenue, against what they would have gained with Alchemist. In short, it was better to pay TSMC to make its new GPUs.\nWhere AMD used its multi-chip expertise and developed new technologies for the manufacture of large RDNA 3 GPU, Nvidia stuck with a monolithic design for the Ada lineup. The GPU company has considerable experience in creating extremely large processors, though at 608mm2 the AD102 isn't the physically largest chip it has released (that honor goes to the GA100 at 826mm2). However, with 76.3 billion transistors, Nvidia has pushed the component count way ahead of any consumer-grade GPU seen so far.\n\nThe GA102, used in the GeForce RTX 3080 and upwards, seems lightweight in comparison, with just 26.8 billion. This 187% increase went towards the 71% growth in SM count and the 1500% uplift in L2 cache amount.\nSuch a large and complex chip as this will always struggle to achieve perfect wafer yields, which is why previous top-end Nvidia GPUs have spawned a multitude of SKUs. Typically, with a new architecture launch, their professional line of graphics cards (e.g. the A-series, Tesla, etc) are announced first.\nWhen Ampere was announced, the GA102 appeared in two consumer-grade cards at launch and went on to eventually finding a home in 14 different products. So far, Nvidia has so far chosen to use AD102 in just two: the GeForce RTX 4090 and the RTX 6000.\nThe RTX 4090 uses dies that are towards the better end of the binning process, with 16 SMs and 24MB of L2 cache disabled, whereas the RTX 6000 has just two SMs disabled. Which leaves one to ask: where are the rest of the dies?\nWith no other products using the AD102, we're left to assume that Nvidia is stockpiling them, possibly for enterprise customers.\n\nThe GeForce RTX 4080 uses the AD103, which at 379mm2 and 45.9 billion transistors, is nothing like its bigger brother \u2013 the much smaller die (80 SMs, 64MB L2 cache) should result in far better yields.\nThe RTX 4070 is also using the smaller AD104 and while Nvidia had plenty other GPUs planned on the Ada architecture, it was reluctant to ship them early. Instead they've waited months for Ampere-powered graphics cards to clear the shelves.\nGiven the substantial improvement in raw compute capability that both the AD102 and 103 offer, it's somewhat puzzling that there are so few Ada professional cards though \u2013 the sector is always hungry for more processing power.\nSuperstar DJs: Display and Media Engines\nWhen it comes to the media & display engines of GPUs, they often receive a back-of-the-stage marketing approach, compared to aspects such as DirectX 12 features or transistor count. But with the game streaming industry generating billions of dollars in revenue, we're starting to see more effort being made to develop and promote new display features.\nFor RDNA 3, AMD updated a number of components, the most notable being support for DisplayPort 2.1 and HDMI 2.1a. Given that VESA, the organization that oversees the DisplayPort specification, only announced the 2.1 version in late 2022, it was an unusual move for a GPU vendor to adopt the system so quickly.\n\nThe fastest DP transmission mode the new display engine supports is UHBR13.5, giving a maximum 4-lane transmission rate of 54 Gbps. This is good enough for a resolution of 4K, at a refresh rate of 144Hz, without any compression, on standard timings.\nUsing DSC (Display Stream Compression), the DP2.1 connections permit up to 4K@480Hz or 8K@165Hz \u2013 a notable improvement over DP1.4a, as used in RDNA 2.\nIntel's Alchemist architecture features a display engine with DP 2.0 (UHBR10, 40 Gbps) and HDMI 2.1 outputs, although not all Arc-series graphics cards using the chip may utilize the maximum capabilities.\nWhile the ACM-G10 isn't targeted at high-resolution gaming, the use of the latest display connection specifications means that e-sports monitors (e.g. 1080p, 360Hz) can be used without any compression. The chip may not be able to render such high frame rates in those kinds of games, but at least the display engine can.\n\nWith refresh rates climbing, faster display connections are required\nAMD and Intel's support for fast transmission modes in DP and HDMI is the sort of thing you'd expect from brand-new architectures, so it's somewhat incongruous that Nvidia chose not to do so with Ada Lovelace.\nThe AD102, for all its transistors (almost the same as Navi 31 and ACM-G10 added together), only has a display engine with DP1.4a and HDMI 2.1 outputs. With DSC, the former is good enough for, say, 4K@144Hz, but when the competition supports that without compression, it's clearly a missed opportunity.\nMedia engines in GPUs are responsible for the encoding and decoding of video streams, and all three vendors have fulsome feature sets in their latest architectures.\nIn RDNA 3, AMD added full, simultaneous encode/decode for the AV1 format (it was decode only in the previous RDNA 2). There's not a great deal of information about the new media engines, other than it can process two H.264/H.265 streams at the same time, and the maximum rate for AV1 is 8K@60Hz. AMD also briefly mentioned 'AI Enhanced' video decode but provided no further details.\n\nIntel's ACM-G10 has a similar range of capabilities, encode/decoding available for AV1, H.264, and H.265, but just as with RDNA 3, details are very scant. Some early testing of the first Alchemist chips in Arc desktop graphics cards suggests that the media engines are as least as good as those offered by AMD and Nvidia in their previous architectures.\nAda Lovelace follows suit with AV1 encoding and decoding, and Nvidia is claiming that the new system is 40% more efficient in encoding than H.264 \u2013 ostensibly, 40% better video quality is available when using the newer format.\nTop-end GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards will come with GPUs sporting two NVENC encoders, giving you the option of encoding 8K HDR at 60Hz or improved parallelization of video exporting, with each encoder working on half a frame at the same time.\nWith more information about the systems, a better comparison could be made, but with media engines still being seen as the poor relations to the rendering and compute engines, we'll have to wait until every vendor has cards with their latest architectures on shelves, before we can examine matters further.\nWhat's Next for the GPU?\nIt's been a long time since we've had three vendors in the desktop GPU market and it's clear that each one has its own approach to designing graphics processors, though Intel and Nvidia take a similar mindset.\nFor them, Ada and Alchemist are somewhat of a jack-of-all-trades, to be used for all kinds of gaming, scientific, media, and data workloads. The heavy emphasis on matrix and tensor calculations in the ACM-G10 and a reluctance to completely redesign their GPU layout shows that Intel is leaning more towards science and data, rather than gaming, but this is understandable, given the potential growth in these sectors.\nWith the last three architectures, Nvidia has focused on improving upon what was already good, and reducing various bottlenecks within the overall design, such as internal bandwidth and latencies. But while Ada is a natural refinement of Ampere, a theme that Nvidia has followed for a number of years now, the AD102 stands out as being an evolutionary oddity when you look at the sheer scale of the transistor count.\n\nThe difference compared to the GA102 is nothing short of remarkable, but this colossal leap raises a number of questions. The first of which is, would the AD103 have been a better choice for Nvidia to go with, for their highest-end consumer product, instead of the AD102?\nAs used in the RTX 4080, AD103's performance is a respectable improvement over the RTX 3090, and like its bigger brother, the 64MB of L2 cache helps to offset the relatively narrow 256-bit global memory bus width. And at 379mm2, it's smaller than the GA104 used in the GeForce RTX 3070, so would be far more profitable to fabricate than the AD102. It also houses the same number of SMs as the GA102 and that chip eventually found a home in 15 different products.\nAnother question worth asking is, where does Nvidia go from here in terms of architecture and fabrication? Can they achieve a similar level of scaling, while still sticking to a monolithic die?\nAMD's choices with RDNA 3 highlight a potential route for the competition to follow. By shifting the parts of the die that scale the worst (in new process nodes) into separate chiplets, AMD has been able to successfully continue the large fab & design leap made between RDNA and RDNA 2.\n\nWhile it's not as large as Nvidia's AD102, the AMD Navi 31 is still 58 billion transistors worth of silicon \u2013 more than double that in Navi 21, and over 5 times what we had in the original RDNA GPU, the Navi 10 (although that wasn't aimed to be a halo product).\nAMD and Nvidia's achievements were not done in isolation. Such large increases in GPU transistor counts are only possible because of the fierce competition between TSMC and Samsung for being the premier manufacturer of semiconductor devices. Both are working towards improving the transistor density of logic circuits, while continuing to reduce power consumption. TSMC has a clear roadmap for current node refinements and their next major processes.\n\nWhether Nvidia copies a leaf from AMD's book and moves to a chiplet layout in Ada's successor is unclear, but the following year or two will probably be decisive. If RDNA 3 proves to be a financial success, be it in terms of revenue or total units shipped, then there's a distinct possibility that Nvidia follows suit.\nHowever, the first chip to use the Ampere architecture was the GA100 \u2013 a data center GPU, 829mm2 in size and with 54.2 billion transistors. It was fabricated by TSMC, using their N7 node (the same as RDNA and most of the RDNA 2 lineup). The use of N4, to make the AD102, allowed Nvidia to design a GPU with almost double the transistor density of its predecessor.\nGPUs continue to be one of the most remarkable engineering feats seen in a desktop PC.\nWould this be achievable using N2 for the next architecture? Possibly, but the massive growth in cache (which scales very poorly) suggests that even if TSMC achieves some remarkable figures with their future nodes, it will be increasingly harder to keep GPU sizes under control.\nIntel is already using chiplets, but only with its enormous Ponte Vecchio data center GPU. Composed of 47 various tiles, some fabrication by TSMC and others by Intel themselves, its parameters are suitably excessive. For example, with more than 100 billion transistors for the full, dual-GPU configuration, it makes AMD's Navi 31 look svelte. It is, of course, not for any kind of desktop PC nor is it strictly speaking \"just\" a GPU \u2013 this is a data center processor, with a firm emphasis on matrix and tensor workloads.\n\nWith its Xe-HPG architecture targeted for at least two more revisions before moving on to \"Xe Next,\" we may well see the use of tiling in an Intel consumer graphics card.\nFor now, though, we'll have Ada and Alchemist using traditional monolithic dies, while AMD uses a mixture of chiplet systems for the upper-mid and top-end cards, and single dies for their budget SKUs.\nBy the end of the decade, we may see almost all kinds of graphics processors, built from a selection of different tiles and chiplets, all made using various process nodes. GPUs continue to be one of the most remarkable engineering feats seen in a desktop PC \u2013 transistor counts show no sign of tailing off in growth and the computational abilities of an average graphics card today could only be dreamed about 10 years ago.\nWe say, bring on the next 3-way architecture battle!\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 12\n\n\n Got something to say?

There\u2019s time for fun, family and even leaping out of planes if that\u2019s your thing. Free days are fully paid by NVIDIA, not charged to vacation or as personal time-off, and are in addition to existing country-specific holidays and time-away programs.\nBogomjakov often skydives in a wingsuit, which extends his time in freefall as he glides through the air.\nAs passionate about his hobby of skydiving as he is about his work creating computer graphics and rendering, Bogomjakov is always looking for opportunities to hit the skies in his free time. Driven by a lifelong passion for aviation, he describes skydiving not as falling, but the closest thing he\u2019s ever felt to truly flying through the air.\n\u201cI do what I love at work, and I do what I love in my free time. I\u2019m absolutely recharged coming back to work after the extra time off,\u201d he said. \u201cI love my job, and I\u2019m fascinated by NVIDIA and the work we do. I know I\u2019ve accomplished something in my life, and I am a part of something special.\u201d\nAfter touching down with a gentle landing \u2014 grinning with exhaustion, adrenalin and pride \u2014 Bogomjakov often finds himself replaying his dives in his head long after they\u2019re over.\nHere\u2019s how other NVIDIANs around the world chose to jump into their free days and spend their extra time off.\nGayatri Devgan, based in Santa Clara, California, traveled to Antelope Canyon in Page, Arizona, to hike and spend time with family.\nAmit Efraim and Dor Blubel, teammates in Tel Aviv, Israel, climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.\nMonali Karhale, based in Pune, India, spent time painting, drawing and working with clay with her 18-month-old daughter, Eva.\nFangkai Yang, based in Seattle, hiked in Glacier National Park in Canada with his dog, Xuri.\nIgor Soltysik, based in Amsterdam, used Midjourney and DALL-E to generate this image depicting his paddleboarding foray with friends in the Netherlands.\nElfin Tang, based in Shenzhen, China, brightened the days of her parents, both of whom are battling lung cancer.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | NVIDIA Life \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It is based out of Colovore's data center in Santa Clara, California, as well as another facility in Allen, Texas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 Sebastian Moss\n\n\n\nNvidia previously gave the company, as well as competitor CoreWeave, preferential supplies of its hard-to-get H100 GPUs. Unlike Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, the two companies are not trying to develop their own AI chips.The investment would be part of a $300 million raise that could value the company at more than $1 billion. Lambda raised $44 million in March from a number of investors, including OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman.Rival AI cloud startup CoreWeave raised $221 million a month later, with Nvidia among those taking an equity stake.With hyperscalers struggling to acquire enough GPUs to support the current generative AI explosion, Microsoft in June announced that it would send some customer workloads to CoreWeave data centers. The Information reports that it has a similar arrangement with Lambda.\"Lambda is building the best cloud in the world for training AI,\" Lambda Labs co-founder and CEO Stephen Balaban said in March. \"Over the past couple of years, we've seen extreme growth in our cloud product.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in Investment / M&A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Center Trends 2025: Power, AI, and Progress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04 Feb 2025\n\n\n\n\nCrypto firm Bitfarms explores pivot to HPC and AI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nRevisiting the investor perspective of the AI hype cycle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in IT Hardware & Semiconductors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture-proof your datacenter with DDC S-Series\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n07 Feb 2025\n\n\n\n\nLos Alamos National Lab leads project to improve chip manufacturing and efficiency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nThe drivers of chip design: AI, efficiency and geopolitics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nGPU\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\ngenerative AI\n\n\nLambda Labs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

[+] smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\n\nThere is a new battlefront in the cold war between the United States and China, and it is a big problem for technology investors.\n\n\nA filing from Nvidia (NVDA) this month revealed that the Biden Administration has banned sales in China of the company\u2019s high-end computer chips, a business worth billions. Shares plummeted.\n\nThe risk to tech share valuations is real. It is time to protect investments.\n\nThe goal of Washington policymakers is clear.\n\nThe Biden Administration sees China as a growing military threat and officials are determined to do everything possible to undermine that emergence. This strategy now includes weaponizing the dominant position of America-based technology firms like Nvidia. While nationalizing key intellectual property is a short term fix, in the absence of financial offsets, the longer-term impact to American innovators, and their stakeholders will be catastrophic.\nNvidia is a dynamic business. Under the leadership of Jensen Huang, chief executive officer, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company built a completely new microchip business out of the graphics processing units it originally designed for use in Xbox and PlayStation game consoles. Years of research, software development, and billions of dollars allowed GPUs to become the backbone of the artificial intelligence movement. The transformation of Nvidia, and the emergence of AI is a true American success story.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nHuang, rightfully sees broad uses cases for the Nvidia AI platform.\nHealthcare and telecommunication companies are currently using AI to design new drugs, and speed up digital networks. Climate researchers are even using Nvidia gear to tackle climate change.\n\nGPUs and AI systems are being quickly adopted by the world\u2019s largest cloud computing businesses. Their hyperscale data centers have become a key market for Nvidia, especially in Asia. Big Chinese companies such as Alibaba (BABA) have committed to use Nvidia\u2019s A100, and the next-generation H100 AI GPUs. The Asian eCommerce giant is in the process of using GPUs to remake its entire high performance computing platform, according to a report in Agugust from Bloomberg.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the Biden Administration believes the A100 and H100 chips might also be used to build next-generation military devices. A September filing from Nvidia with the Securities and Exchange Commission says the sale of those processors to companies in China and Hong Kong are being specifically targeted. That business would have been worth $400 million alone in the current fiscal quarter.\nLosing that revenue will definitely hurt Nvidia shareholders. However, the bigger concern for tech investors is the White House might nationalize many other geopolitical strategic markets. This could range from biotechnology to materials science, and everything in between.\nThe policy is dangerous.\nTechnologies developed in the United States do not belong to the American people. They are owned by the shareholders of the companies that build them. Moreover, Nvidia is not selling weapons to China. The company is selling microchips to hyperscale data centers, and high-performance computing operators, presumably to process data. When the government unilaterally collapses a market for political leverage the process destroys shareholder value, and the incentive for American companies to invest in cutting-edge technologies.\nIt has been a rough ride in 2022 for Nvidia shareholders. The stock is down 55%, making it among the worst performing issues within the Nasdaq Composite Index. Shares may bounce this week ahead of the GTC developer conference starting on Tuesday, though. Huang is expected to talk about potential new markets for Nvidia\u2019s breakthrough H100 GPUs.\nAt a of $131.98, Nvidia shares trade at 29.4x forward earnings and 10.8x sales. Those ratios are significantly below historical levels marks, yet investors should still exercise caution. This is a different era. The cold war between the U.S. and emergent China means that geopolitics matter more than ever.\nBullish investors should expect substantial selling pressure on any near term rally into the $150 area. The longer-term support level is $126, the 200-week moving average. A decline below that level would put a whole new coloration on this bear market and thus is an absolute no-go zone.\nInvesting can be intimidating, but it doesn't have to be.

Image Credit: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.\n\n\nNVIDIA has announced a $50m private investment in public equity in tech-focused Recursion Pharmaceuticals to create artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted drug discovery models, sending Recursion\u2019s stock to skyrocket.\nThis investment and partnership news was followed by a 116 % rise in Recursion\u2019s stock price when markets opened on 12 July, compared to the previous day. \nGo deeper with GlobalDataReportsNPVM: Eli Lilly and Co's PR-006  ReportsTech in Pharma - Report Bundle (7 Reports)   \n\n\n\n\n                        Data Insights\n                    \n\n                        The gold standard of business intelligence.\n                    \n\n                            Find out more\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe investment is accompanied by plans for collaboration to distribute these using NVIDIA cloud services and follows the strategic acquisition of Cyclica and Valence to enhance Recursion\u2019s machine-learning and AI capabilities.\nThis year, there has been an increased focus on using AI in drug discovery among other applications. Several companies have touted their reliance on AI, with Insilico Medicine\u2019s AI-discovered drug for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis starting its Phase II trial. GlobalData analysts have identified more than 250 unique active drugs using terms such as \u201cAI\u201d or \u201cmachine learning\u201d in their drug description in 2022, but observe that the use of AI in drug discovery is still in its infancy and is expected to mature in the coming years.\nGlobalData is the parent company of Pharmaceutical Technology.\nRecursion plans to capitalise on this increased focus on AI and create and commercialise drug discovery models using BioNeMo, NVIDIA\u2019s generative AI in drug discovery cloud service platform. The models will be trained on Recursion proprietary dataset using NVIDIA\u2019s technology and expertise. These models will be used by Recursion internally and will be marketed on BioNeMo.\nRecursion CEO Chris Gibson said: \u201cWith our powerful dataset and NVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing capabilities, we intend to create groundbreaking foundation models in biology and chemistry at a scale, unlike anything that has ever been released in the biological space.\u201d\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang said: \u201cGenerative AI is a revolutionary tool to discover new medicines and treatment.\u201d\nMultiple partnerships between tech and pharmaceutical companies for using AI in drug development have been announced last year, including a partnership between Novo Nordisk and Microsoft to generate new scientific insights and create forecast models of atherosclerosis development

During the process, CCS scientists must prevent fracturing geological formations where carbon is injected, leaking CO2 into aquifers, or worse back into the atmosphere.\u00a0\nThat can happen if there\u2019s too much pressure buildup due to the process of injecting carbon into the rock formations. This, and more, is what Nvidia\u2019s Ai-powered technology addresses to help improve carbon sequestration.\nNvidia AI: Ramping Up Carbon Capture Modeling 700,000x\u00a0\u00a0\nCCS is one of few methods that industries like oil and gas, cement, and steel can deploy to decarbonize and meet their net zero targets. More than a hundred CCS facilities are under construction worldwide.\nTraditional simulators for carbon sequestration are costly to own and require a lot of time to complete. Machine learning and AI models deliver the same level of accuracy but at reduced cost and time.\u00a0\nNvidia introduces its AI approach to carbon sequestration that CCS scientists can readily use in real-world applications through Nvidia Modulus and Nvidia Omniverse.\nNvidia\u2019s AI-powered technology accelerates CCS modeling 700,000x using Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) architecture.\nNvidia\u2019s Approach to CCS Modeling\nSource: Wen, Gege, et al. \u201cReal-time high-resolution CO 2 geological storage prediction using nested Fourier neural operators.\u201d Energy & Environmental Science 16.4 (2023): 1732-1741.\nFNO architecture provides more accurate predictions of pressure buildup and CO2 saturation. It\u2019s 2x as accurate while needing only a third of the training data compared to other computer models.\u00a0\nAs such, the software helps CCS engineers to choose the best injection sites fast, identify the optimal spacing and depth of wells, as well as determine the best injection pressure and rate for the captured carbon. Moreover, engineers can visualize and optimize the entire inspection process through Nvidia Omniverse.\u00a0\nWith its superior computing abilities, Nvidia software increases the carbon sequestration simulation speed 700,000 times. A robust assessment for CO2 plume and pressure buildup usually takes about 2 years using numerical simulators. But with Nvidia\u2019s FNO, it may take 2.8 seconds only.\u00a0\nTrained Nvidia FNO models are available in a web application to provide real-time simulations for carbon capture and storage projects.\u00a0\nThus, AI technology enables various tasks vital in making CCS decisions.\u00a0\u00a0\nImproving Carbon Sequestration\nScientists use carbon storage simulations or modeling to pick the right CO2 injection sites and rates. Modeling also helps them optimize storage efficiency, control pressure buildup, and make sure that rock formations don\u2019t get fractured.\u00a0\nCCS engineers must also understand how the injected CO2 will spread through the ground, also called a CO2 plume.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNvidia technology was found useful by a study to achieve an AI-powered carbon capture and storage with interactivity at scale. Using it, engineers can interact with the models to guarantee the reliability and safety of a CCS project. A safe and accurate CO2 storage process can help reduce the amount of carbon escaping into the air.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s a video by Nvidia explaining the CCS process and how its AI technology can help accelerate things.\u00a0\n\nFNO allows scientists to simulate how pressure levels build up and where CO2 spreads throughout the 30 years of injection. Acceleration using this AI-powered model speeds up the simulation process from ten minutes to just seconds.\u00a0\nWithout this technology, selecting injection sites for CO2 would seem like a shot in the dark.\nAI for Net Zero\nAchieving net zero emissions by 2050 requires a combination of different scalable technologies such as CCS.\u00a0\nAs per the International Energy Agency (IEA) report, the global planned carbon storage capacity rose by 80% in 2022. For the same year, there\u2019s also a 30% increase in planned carbon capture capacity.\nRecent innovations in AI, with models like Nvidia\u2019s FNO, can help ramp up CCS modeling by orders of magnitude. This is crucial in helping CCS technologies scale up.\nThere are also other AI innovations used in the industry.\nFor instance, Ohio-based analytics company Aperture launched its Carbon Capture Space last year. It is an AI-powered platform that offers industry analysts and investors insights into 1,000+ technologies for CCS.\nNvidia\u2019s Earth-2, which will be the world\u2019s first AI digital twin supercomputer, will leverage the FNO models. This tech will further show how AI can help speed up the process of mitigating climate change.\nThe tech company now tops Tesla as AI revolution pushes its shares to record high, up 200%. ESG investors prefer it to other traditional assets, with over 1,400 ESG funds directly holding Nvidia, according to Bloomberg report.\nNvidia and its AI models will help tackle the climate crisis by contributing to global climate change mitigation efforts. Leveraging the AI revolution would be one way for the world to be on its track to net zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\nAI (Artificial Intelligence)  \n\nWhy Geothermal is the Hot Ticket to Low-Carbon Data Centers?\n\n\nMarch 17, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Credits  \n\nChina Revives Its Carbon Credit Market: Price Swings & Future Outlook\n\n\nMarch 17, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Credits  \n\nUEC Reports Stellar $49.8M Revenue as Net-Zero Uranium Strategy Gains Momentum\n\n\nMarch 14, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI (Artificial Intelligence)  \n\nMeta, Google, and Amazon Join Global Pledge to Triple Nuclear Energy by 2050\n\n\nMarch 14, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimate Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nAI (Artificial Intelligence)  \n\nWhy Geothermal is the Hot Ticket to Low-Carbon Data Centers?\n\n\nMarch 17, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Credits  \n\nChina Revives Its Carbon Credit Market: Price Swings & Future Outlook\n\n\nMarch 17, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Credits  \n\nUEC Reports Stellar $49.8M Revenue as Net-Zero Uranium Strategy Gains Momentum\n\n\nMarch 14, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI (Artificial Intelligence)  \n\nMeta, Google, and Amazon Join Global Pledge to Triple Nuclear Energy by 2050\n\n\nMarch 14, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast\nChange\nYTD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLATEST CARBON NEWS\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Credits\nCarney Scraps Carbon Tax\u2014Can Canada Reduce Emissions Without It?\n\n\nMarch 18, 2025 \n\nOn March 14, 2025, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced the end of Canada\u2019s federal consumer carbon tax, effective April 1.

intelligence workload deployments on PlatformDIGITAL\u00ae, a global meeting place\nAUSTIN, Texas, July 10, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Digital Realty (NYSE: DLR), the largest global provider of cloud and carrier-neutral data center, colocation, and interconnection solutions, announces KIX13, its newest data center in Osaka, Japan, has been certified NVIDIA DGX H100-ready as part of the NVIDIA DGX-Ready Data Center program.\nKIX13 was awarded the accreditation for its ability to provide a dedicated, robust, and resilient environment optimized for intensive computing systems deployments at scale.\nDGX H100, the fourth generation of NVIDIA's purpose-built artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, is the foundation of NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD\u2122 that provides the computational power necessary to train today's state-of-the-art deep learning AI models and fuel innovation well into the future. With it, enterprise customers can devise full-stack solutions that accelerate artificial intelligence (AI) deployments, allowing for data localization while meeting the global coverage, capacity and connectivity needs that come with deploying AI at scale.\nAI is swiftly becoming a driving force behind modern technologies across multiple industries with applications in areas such as optimization, preventive maintenance, virtual assistants, fraud detection, and anomaly detection. Expected to help solve the world's most challenging problems, the success of AI deployments is dependent on data centers that can provide the high-performance cooling, layout and connectivity required for AI to operate highly effectively.\nAs modern enterprises adopt AI, leaders in the technology are increasingly seeking access to real-time data as a core strategy to enable instantaneous changes and decision-making. Digital Realty's highly connected PlatformDIGITAL\u00ae\u00a0community enables customers to access vast data volumes, allowing them to confidently run AI workloads in an NVIDIA-accelerated environment to innovate and solve the world's most challenging computational problems, while overcoming Data Gravity barriers. With ServiceFabric\u2122, Digital Realty's global service orchestration platform, customers can streamline management of their hybrid IT infrastructure while gaining access to a growing, open community of partners to which they can connect and utilize for managed services \u2013 all on a single, centralized platform.\nThanks to the scale and sophistication of its offerings, broad customer base, and significant\u00a0technical resources,\u00a0Digital Realty\u00a0also\u00a0provides\u00a0the precision-engineered power and cooling digital infrastructure that can support the high-power computing needs of AI.\u00a0At higher workload densities, liquid cooling becomes an attractive option for AI deployments for its more efficient heat dissipation. Digital Realty's rich\u00a0pedigree\u00a0in data\u00a0center\u00a0engineering\u00a0allows Digital Realty to provision\u00a0a future-ready data\u00a0center\u00a0environment that can handle the evolution\u00a0from air\u00a0to liquid cooling. This also contributes to Digital Realty's and its customers' progress towards reducing their Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions\u00a0by 68% and Scope 3 emissions by 24%, by 2030.\nThe KIX13 certification marks another milestone in Digital Realty's and NVIDIA's collaboration. Digital Realty was one of the first data center providers\u00a0to be awarded the \"DGX-Ready Data Center\"\u00a0certification at the launch of the program in 2019 and currently operates DGX-Ready data centers in more than 20 markets worldwide, including six sites across Asia Pacific.\n\"Organizations looking to implement enterprise AI are investing in accelerated computing infrastructure \u2013 including hardware and software purpose-built for AI \u2013 to deploy their models into production quickly,\" says Charlie Boyle, Vice President, DGX systems, NVIDIA. \"With the certification of Digital Realty's new KIX13 facility in the DGX-ready data center program, customers have access to a flexible, simple option for deploying the world's leading AI platform.\"\n\"Digital Realty understands the impact AI will have on the way businesses drive digital transformation in the years to come. However, business breakthroughs made possible with AI can only be realized if enterprises are able to integrate the technology into their operations, and that is where we come in,\" says Chris Sharp, Chief Technology Officer, Digital Realty. \"With Digital Realty's KIX13 DGX-Ready Data Center certification, we remain focused on delivering a meeting place that allows our customers to accelerate innovation and growth.\"\nHe added, \"AI is poised to have a dramatic impact on digital transformation initiatives, and it is critical to have a foundation in place to remove the Data Gravity barriers that inhibit innovation. PlatformDIGITAL\u00ae provides an ideal location for the data aggregation, staging, analytics, and management that are critical for optimizing data exchange and maintaining data compliance.\"\nAbout Digital RealtyDigital Realty brings companies and data together by delivering the full spectrum of data center, colocation and interconnection solutions.

The comprehensive offering will let customers collaborate as design partners in architecting custom generative AI large language models (LLMs) and applications to advance their businesses.\u201cThis is a transformational moment for business to revolutionize how work gets done,\u201d said ServiceNow Chairman and CEO Bill McDermott. \u201cIn collaboration with our visionary partners, ServiceNow, NVIDIA, and Accenture are forming the market-leading blueprint for AI-first enterprise innovation. We expect the AI Lighthouse customer program to inspire breakthrough ideas with massive ROI: \u2018return on intelligence.\u2019\u201d\u201cIndustries are racing to add generative AI tools to their operations at a faster pace than in any previous technology shift,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO, NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA, ServiceNow and Accenture are partnering to help customers lead their industries by deploying generative AI tools that harness their own invaluable knowledge to transform the applications they use every day.\u201d\u201cGenerative AI holds enormous potential for enterprises\u2014it can help them reinvent how they work, strengthen their services, differentiate themselves and reach new levels of performance,\u201d said Julie Sweet, chair and CEO, Accenture. \u201cOur expanded partnership with ServiceNow and NVIDIA will apply our combined experience, expertise and insights to helping our clients create powerful, relevant and responsible generative AI use cases and more quickly realize the value of this transformative technology.\u201dThe power of AI Lighthouse program will come to life for enterprise customers by:\n\nReducing tedious manual work for customer service professionals, with overviews and insights to help them solve problems faster.\nDeflecting cases by promoting self-service options, empowering people, and delivering engaging experiences with natural human language.\nGenerating content automatically, including intelligent search results, work notes, and knowledge base articles.\nBoosting developer productivity with intelligent recommendations for code.\n\nSince May, ServiceNow has launched a slate of powerful generative AI capabilities, purpose-built for the Now Platform, and engaged with large pharmaceutical, financial servcies, manufacturing, and health care companies to test them in enterprise environments. The AI Lighthouse program will build on that early progress to collaborate on designing, developing, and implementing new generative AI use cases with a select group of customers across IT service management (ITSM), customer service management (CSM), and employee experience. NVIDIA accelerated computing and software, including NVIDIA DGX\u2122 AI supercomputing and NVIDIA DGX Cloud, as well as NVIDIA NeMo\u2122 LLM software, will provide full-stack computing for model training and tuning; ServiceNow will be the front-end workflow automation and intelligence platform; and Accenture will leverage its deep functional and industry knowledge and generative AI strategy, design and delivery experience to bring use cases to life for customers.The ServiceNow platform automates workflows across the entire enterprise by connecting disparate departments, systems, and silos and automating processes to increase productivity and enable seamless work experiences. Now Assist is ServiceNow\u2019s generative AI experience\u2014purpose-built within the ServiceNow platform\u2014designed to enable intelligent automation and accelerate productivity by simplifying repetitive tasks, increasing agility, and transforming the user experience.NVIDIA AI software and accelerated computing provide the platform for generative AI deployments across industries. Enterprises can use NeMo and NVIDIA frameworks, optimized inference engines, and APIs to add intelligence to generative AI applications such as drug discovery, intelligent chatbots, search, and summarization.Building on Accenture\u2019s recently announced $3 billion investment in AI, this collaboration will tap into the Accenture Center for Advanced AI, with its deep focus on generative AI and large language models. Accenture will accelerate the design and engineering of domain-specific LLMs and generative AI capabilities within the ServiceNow platform to make functional and industry workflows more intelligent \u2013 from elevating agent productivity and impact with summarization of service history and recommended actions, to improving self-service quality and speed with AI-powered virtual agents. Accenture will use its infrastructure and IT service operations experience across the cloud continuum, coupled with its vast experience in helping clients across industries leverage generative AI, to accelerate value across the enterprise.For more information about the AI Lighthouse program as well as additional generative AI solutions ServiceNow strategic partners are offering, visit https://www.servicenow.com/now-platform/generative-ai.html.About AccentureAccenture is a leading global professional services company that helps the world\u2019s leading businesses, governments and other organizations build their digital core, optimize their operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance citizen services\u2014creating tangible value at speed and scale.

Learn more in our Portal Prelude RTX launch article.\nAdditionally, we\u2019re Game Ready for Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, launching July 26th with DLSS 3, advanced ray tracing, Reflex, and RTX IO. And Game Ready for Remnant II, available July 25th with DLSS 2.\nThere\u2019s also support for 3 new G-SYNC Compatible gaming monitors, and another 7 GeForce Experience Optimal Settings.\nTo download and install, head to the Drivers tab of GeForce Experience or GeForce.com, and read on for further details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Portal: Prelude RTX With DLSS 3 & RTX IO - Download Today\nPortal remains a timeless classic; in December we released Portal with RTX, a fully ray-traced reimagining of Valve\u2019s award winning game, which used the performance multiplication of NVIDIA DLSS 3 to power the most realistic path-traced lighting ever seen in a real-time game. Now, there\u2019s Portal: Prelude RTX, a free mod remastered with the same technology, featuring fully ray traced (path-traced) graphics, DLSS 3, and our new NVIDIA RTX IO GPU-accelerated storage tech.\nPortal: Prelude is the highest rated Portal mod, the 2008 Portal ModDB winner, and #3 overall Player\u2019s Choice mod of 2008. Created by Nicolas \u201cNykO18\u201d Grevet and others, Portal: Prelude is an unofficial Portal prequel, set before the time of GLaDOS, featuring a new extremely challenging 8-10 hour campaign composed of 19 new test chambers, new advanced gameplay mechanics, a fully voiced story with NPCs, and a whole lot more.\nPortal: Prelude RTX is available today, for free for owners of Portal. Install our new Game Ready Driver for the definitive experience, then download and play Portal: Prelude RTX from Steam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor much more information, as well as RTX ON-OFF screenshots, head over to our Portal Prelude RTX launch article, and we have an RTX IO article, too, for those interested in this new game-changing GPU-accelerated storage technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart\nThe Ratchet & Clank franchise recently celebrated its 20th anniversary, and on July 26th PC gamers can experience the action and humor of the franchise for the first time with the PC release of the critically acclaimed Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart. Help the duo take on an evil emperor from another reality as you jump between action-packed worlds and beyond in this spectacular action-adventure-platformer, developed by acclaimed studio Insomniac Games, and brought to PC by Nixxes Software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards and laptops can multiply performance using NVIDIA DLSS 3, while GeForce RTX 20 and 30 Series users can accelerate frame rates with NVIDIA DLSS 2. All GeForce RTX gamers can maximize image quality with NVIDIA DLAA, for the highest possible picture quality. And GeForce GTX 900 Series and newer gamers can make Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart gameplay even more responsive with NVIDIA Reflex.\nThrough a process detailed in full in our DLSS 3 article, DLSS 3 combines DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Frame Generation to reconstruct 7/8ths of the displayed pixels, accelerating performance significantly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn GPU-limited games, DLSS 2 Super Resolution technology can increase your frame rates by up to 2X. With DLSS 3, we can boost them by up to 4X (compared to brute-force rendering) in fully ray-traced worlds.\nCertain games make extensive use of the CPU which can limit performance. DLSS 3 operates on the GPU, bypassing CPU bottlenecks and boosting frame rates.\nDLSS 3 games are backwards compatible with DLSS 2 technology - developers simply integrate DLSS 3, and DLSS 2, also known as DLSS Super Resolution, is supported by default. Additionally, integrations of DLSS 3 also include NVIDIA Reflex, reducing system latency for all GeForce RTX users, making games more responsive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatchet & Clank: Rift Apart also features ray-traced reflections with a variety of quality levels to choose from, as well as newly added ray-traced shadows, for natural light in outdoor areas. Gamers with GeForce RTX GPUs can enjoy these at the highest frame rates thanks to their dedicated ray tracing cores that greatly accelerate ray tracing performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart supports NVIDIA RTX IO, which leverages the DirectStorage runtime and GPU decompression to enable faster loading speeds and seamless in-game transitions.\nAnd there\u2019s support for 21:9, 32:9 and 48:9 resolutions, triple-monitor Surround gaming, the usual assortment of options to ensure you can play the way that best suits your style, and when using a DualSense controller on a wired connection you can feel in-game actions coming to life in your hands with haptic feedback and adaptive trigger effects.\nRatchet & Clank: Rift Apart launches July 26th on PC - wishlist or pre-order now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Remnant II\nRemnant II from Gunfire Games is the sequel to the best-selling game Remnant: From the Ashes that pits survivors of humanity against new deadly creatures and god-like bosses across terrifying worlds. Play solo or co-op with two other friends to explore the depths of the unknown to stop an evil from destroying reality itself. To succeed, players will need to rely on their own skills and those of their team to overcome the toughest challenges and to stave off humanity\u2019s extinction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt launch on July 25th, Remnant II will boast support for DLSS 2, enabling you to crank up the visuals of its high fidelity world, for the fastest, most impressive gameplay possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport For Newly Validated G-SYNC Compatible Displays\nOur newest Game Ready Driver adds support for 3 new G-SYNC Compatible displays that deliver a baseline Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) experience that makes your gaming smoother and more enjoyable.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManufacturer\nModel\nHDR\nSize\nPanel Type\nResolution\nVRR Range\n\n\nLG\n27PG95R\nYes\n27\u201d\nNano IPS\n3840x2160 (4K)\n48-144Hz\n\n\nPanasonic\n48MZ1800\nYes\n48\u201d\nOLED\n3840x2160 (4K)\n48-120Hz\n\n\nDell\nAW2724DM\nYes\n27\u201d\nIPS\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n48-165Hz \\ \n   \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThese newly-validated monitors give gamers even more choice when searching for a great gaming display.

The service lets users scale generative AI, high performance computing (HPC) and other applications with a click from a browser.\nThe news comes in the wake of AI\u2019s iPhone moment. Developers and researchers are using large language models (LLMs) to uncover new applications for AI almost daily. Bringing these new use cases to market requires the efficiency of accelerated computing.\nThe NVIDIA H100 GPU delivers supercomputing-class performance through architectural innovations including fourth-generation Tensor Cores, a new Transformer Engine for accelerating LLMs and the latest NVLink technology that lets GPUs talk to each other at 900GB/sec.\nScaling With P5 Instances\nAmazon EC2 P5 instances are ideal for training and running inference for increasingly complex LLMs and computer vision models. These neural networks drive the most demanding and compute-intensive generative AI applications, including question answering, code generation, video and image generation, speech recognition and more.\nP5 instances can be deployed in hyperscale clusters, called EC2 UltraClusters, made up of high-performance compute, networking and storage in the cloud. Each EC2 UltraCluster is a powerful supercomputer, enabling customers to run their most complex AI training and distributed HPC workloads across multiple systems.\nSo customers can run at scale applications that require high levels of communications between compute nodes, the P5 instance sports petabit-scale non-blocking networks, powered by AWS EFA, a 3,200 Gbps network interface for Amazon EC2 instances.\nWith P5 instances, machine learning applications can use the NVIDIA Collective Communications Library to employ as many as 20,000 H100 GPUs.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise helps users make the most of P5 instances with a full-stack suite of software that includes more than 100 frameworks, pretrained models, AI workflows and tools to tune AI infrastructure.\u00a0\nDesigned to streamline the development and deployment of AI applications, NVIDIA AI Enterprise addresses the complexities of building and maintaining a high-performance, secure, cloud-native AI software platform. Available in the AWS Marketplace, it offers continuous security monitoring, regular and timely patching of common vulnerabilities and exposures, API stability, and enterprise support as well as access to NVIDIA AI experts.\nWhat Customers Are Saying\nNVIDIA and AWS have collaborated for more than a dozen years to bring GPU acceleration to the cloud. The new P5 instances, the latest example of that collaboration, represents a major step forward to deliver the cutting-edge performance that enables developers to invent the next generation of AI.\nHere are some examples of what customers are already saying:\nAnthropic builds reliable, interpretable and steerable AI systems that will have many opportunities to create value commercially and for public benefit.\n\u201cWhile the large, general AI systems of today can have significant benefits, they can also be unpredictable, unreliable and opaque, so our goal is to make progress on these issues and deploy systems that people find useful,\u201d said Tom Brown, co-founder of Anthropic. \u201cWe expect P5 instances to deliver substantial price-performance benefits over P4d instances, and they\u2019ll be available at the massive scale required for building next-generation LLMs and related products.\u201d\nCohere, a leading pioneer in language AI, empowers every developer and enterprise to build products with world-leading natural language processing (NLP) technology while keeping their data private and secure.\n\u201cCohere leads the charge in helping every enterprise harness the power of language AI to explore, generate, search for and act upon information in a natural and intuitive manner, deploying across multiple cloud platforms in the data environment that works best for each customer,\u201d said Aidan Gomez, CEO of Cohere. \u201cNVIDIA H100-powered Amazon EC2 P5 instances will unleash the ability of businesses to create, grow and scale faster with its computing power combined with Cohere\u2019s state-of-the-art LLM and generative AI capabilities.\u201d\nFor its part, Hugging Face is on a mission to democratize good machine learning.\n\u201cAs the fastest growing open-source community for machine learning, we now provide over 150,000 pretrained models and 25,000 datasets on our platform for NLP, computer vision, biology, reinforcement learning and more,\u201d said Julien Chaumond, chief technology officer and co-founder of Hugging Face. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to using Amazon EC2 P5 instances via Amazon SageMaker at scale in UltraClusters with EFA to accelerate the delivery of new foundation AI models for everyone.\u201d\nToday, more than 450 million people around the world use Pinterest as a visual inspiration platform to shop for products personalized to their taste, find ideas and discover inspiring creators.\n\u201cWe use deep learning extensively across our platform for use cases such as labeling and categorizing billions of photos that are uploaded to our platform, and visual search that provides our users the ability to go from inspiration to action,\u201d said David Chaiken, chief architect at Pinterest. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to using Amazon EC2 P5 instances featuring NVIDIA H100 GPUs, AWS EFA and UltraClusters to accelerate our product development and bring new empathetic AI-based experiences to our customers.\u201d\nLearn more about new AWS P5 instances powered by NVIDIA H100.\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Data Center | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Cloud Services | Customer Stories | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA -

Created by Nicolas \u201cNykO18\u201d Grevet and others, Portal: Prelude is an unofficial Portal prequel, set before the time of GLaDOS, featuring a new extremely challenging 8-10 hour campaign composed of 19 new test chambers, new advanced gameplay mechanics, a fully voiced story with NPCs, and a whole lot more.\nPortal: Prelude RTX is available today to download from Steam, for free!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortal: Prelude RTX is remastered with full ray tracing (also known as path tracing), DLSS 3, Reflex and the newly-launched NVIDIA RTX IO to deliver an even more immersive experience for gamers. It also features hundreds of new, fully upgraded materials and assets from David \u201cKralich\u201d Driver-Gomm and Valerios \u201cFearell_Val\u201d Tsoumpas, new voice acting by Jack \u201cAmicus\u201d McDade and Colin \u201cSordidSpectacle\u201d Zachariasen, and gameplay improvements from Nicolas. Portal: Prelude RTX is the definitive way to play the award winning mod.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing Portal: Prelude RTX\nIf you\u2019ve played Portal with RTX, you already know about the game\u2019s immersive fully ray-traced (path traced) lighting, its remade materials and models, and its incredible visuals that offer a preview of how all games will look in the future. If you need a refresher or are new to RTX, check out all the details here.\nPortal: Prelude RTX is even more spectacular. And its technology even more advanced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the course of Portal: Prelude\u2019s story, players will encounter extremely challenging, advanced test chambers with more varied sights that with the power of RTX could well drop your jaw. Multiple layers of glass refract light, players move from complete darkness to bright locations, and dangerous hazards like particle disintegrators illuminate the world in deadly light, leveraging RTX to create memorable moments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n200 new materials and textures, and 100 new models mesh perfectly with Portal with RTX\u2019s remade assets, adding extra variety to test chambers and challenges. And more advanced geometry -that pushed the boundaries of the Source engine in 2008- enables more varied and aesthetically interesting uses of light and shadow. For Portal: Prelude RTX, geometry was updated and upgraded in standard Half-Life Engine tools (Valve Hammer Editor), before being imported and automatically supported by RTX Remix, enabling fast iteration and development. Ultimately, this gorgeous remaster was created by a team of five in eight short months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortal: Prelude\u2019s inclusion of NPC characters posed new challenges, requiring the development of an exciting feature for RTX Remix: full support for skinned characters. Now, in any game with GPU skinning, Remix enables modders to add more than 100 times the polygonal detail to characters, in addition to high fidelity PBR textures, with minimal performance costs. Essentially, characters and animated/skinned props can be enhanced in the same way as any object in RTX Remix, benefiting all future RTX mods. Or in other words, RTX Remix is revolutionizing character replacements and upgrades in the same way it revolutionized asset replacement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Portal: Prelude RTX and future NVIDIA RTX Remix mods, the NVIDIA RTX Path Tracing SDK has been enhanced, improving denoiser performance and quality, which is particularly beneficial at lower resolutions, enabling gamers with older GeForce RTX GPUs to have a better experience.\nShader Execution Reordering (SER) dynamically\u00a0reorganizes inefficient ray tracing workloads into considerably more efficient ones, further accelerating GeForce RTX 40 Series performance.\nOpacity Micro Meshes (OMM) increase real-time performance and memory compression for complex geometry, further accelerating GeForce RTX 40 Series ray tracing performance, and with new CPU optimizations debuting in Portal: Prelude RTX, players receive even faster performance.\nAnd of course, NVIDIA DLSS 3 and NVIDIA Reflex have both been upgraded to their newest versions for improved performance, even better image quality, and more responsive gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of the enhancements, additions and improvements created for Portal: Prelude RTX will be incorporated into NVIDIA RTX Remix, benefitting all modders, and enabling superior updates to classic games. In the near future, NVIDIA will begin sharing early access versions of RTX Remix with select modders to further refine the creator toolkit and runtime ahead of its official release later this year. Stay tuned for updates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more, go behind the scenes in the making of Portal: Prelude RTX using RTX Remix this week In the NVIDIA Studio.\nNVIDIA RTX IO Makes Its Debut, Accelerating Texture Loading Times & Reducing File Sizes\nRapid loading and smooth navigation through endless open worlds has long been a goal of gamers and developers alike.

It\u2019s powered by the cutting-edge NVIDIA DRIVE Orin compute and XPENG\u2019s full-stack software developed in-house.\nThe XNGP system first made its debut in the EV maker\u2019s flagship G9 SUV, touting a safe, reliable, advanced driving experience behind the wheel.\nNext-Level Driving Experience for All\nThe G6 comes in five trim levels, ranging in price from $29,021-$38,285 (RMB 209,900-276,900), making it accessible for the mainstream market.\nFeaturing a high-voltage 800V silicon-carbide platform and 3C battery, the G6 is built to go up to 469 miles on one charge and can reach speeds up to 125 miles per hour (202 kph). With XPENG\u2019s DC fast charger, drivers can get up to 186 miles of charge in just 10 minutes.\nThe G6 model comes with two NVIDIA DRIVE Orin systems-on-a-chip (SOCs), which deliver 508 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of high-performance compute for real-time processing of data streaming in from the vehicle\u2019s 31 driving sensors.\nThe XPENG G6 Coupe SUV.\nUpping the Ante\nThe XNGP driving system makes the G6 a standout among today\u2019s EV landscape as automakers jockey for position in the highly competitive China market. In fact, XPENG predicts this latest model will become the top-selling electric SUV in the country.\nWith the XNGP\u2019s point-to-point automated cruise assistance, drivers need only set the destination and monitor the traffic conditions with hands resting on the steering wheel, while the vehicle takes the wheel, performing a host of scenario-based actions. These include cruising on main urban roads, autonomously changing lanes, congestion avoidance, emergency braking, on- and off-ramp driving, highway driving, parking, and more.\nThe G6\u2019s ability to safely navigate all these driving scenarios is enabled by its comprehensive sensor suite, which includes multiple lidars, cameras, mmWave and ultrasonic radars for a 360-degree surround view of the car\u2019s environment. As a result, this redundant and diverse multi-sensor fusion set helps enable safe, intelligent driving decisions under a variety of urban driving conditions.\nWith plans for the G6 to roll out to key European markets by next year, XPENG designed this state-of-the-art coupe SUV to meet both C-NCAP and E-NCAP safety standards.\nBased on the more than 35,000 preorders reported for the G6 after its reveal at Auto Shanghai earlier this year, drivers are eager to get moving in this latest offering from XPENG\u2019s software-defined fleet.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Its data streams are processed on NVIDIA Jetson modules for AI at the edge and are being optimized in prototypes with the NVIDIA DeepStream software development kit for intelligent video analytics.\nSaildrone is seeking to make ocean intelligence collection cost-effective, offering data-gathering systems for science, fisheries, weather forecasting, ocean mapping and maritime security.\nIt has three different USVs, and its Mission Portal control center service is used for monitoring customized missions and visualizing data in near real time. Also, some of Saildrone\u2019s historical data is freely available to the public.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve sailed into three major hurricanes, and right through the eye of Hurricane Sam, and all the vehicles came out the other side \u2014 they are pretty robust platforms,\u201d said Blythe Towal, vice president of software engineering at Saildrone, referring to a powerful cyclone that threatened Bermuda in 2021 .\nSaildrone, founded in 2012, has raised $190 million in funding. The startup is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a program that provides companies with technology support and AI platforms guidance.\nKeeping an AI on Earth\u2019s Waters\nSaildrone is riding a wave of interest for use of its crewless data collection missions in environmental studies of oceans and lakes.\nThe University of Hawaii at Manoa has enlisted the help of three 23-foot Saildrone Explorer USVs to study the impact of ocean acidification on climate change. The six-month mission around the islands of Hawaii, Maui, Oahu and Kaui will be used to help evaluate the ocean\u2019s health around the state.\n\nOcean acidification is a reduction in its pH, and contributing factors include the burning of fossil fuels and farming. These can have an impact on coral, oysters, clams, sea urchins and calcareous plankton, which can threaten marine ecosystems.\nSaildrone recently partnered with Seabed 2030 to completely map the world\u2019s oceans. Seabed 2030 is a collaboration between the Nippon Foundation and the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans, or GEBCO, to map ocean floors worldwide by 2030.\n\u201cSaildrone\u2019s vision is of a healthy ocean and a sustainable planet,\u201d said Saildrone founder and CEO Richard Jenkins. \u201cA complete map of the ocean floor is fundamental to achieving that vision.\u201d\nThe scientific community worldwide is embracing NVIDIA AI for climate studies, including for hyper-local climate modeling, AI to improve sequestering carbon, renewable energy research and many other areas. Dedicating its own expertise, NVIDIA is developing the world\u2019s most powerful AI supercomputer for predicting climate change, named Earth-2, which will be used to create a digital twin of Earth in Omniverse.\nEnergy-Efficient Data Processing\u00a0\nSaildrone USVs enable researchers to collect more data using fewer resources than traditional boats and crews, conserving energy and keeping crews out of danger.\nThe USVs are built for harsh weather and long missions. One of its USVs recently completed a 370-day voyage monitoring carbon dioxide, sailing from Rhode Island across the North Atlantic to Cabo Verde, down to the equator off the west coast of Africa, and back to Florida.\nRunning mostly on solar and wind power requires energy-efficient computing to handle so much data processing.\n\u201cWith solar power, being able to keep our compute load power efficiency lower than a typical computing platform running GPUs by implementing NVIDIA Jetson is important for enabling us to do these kinds of missions,\u201d said Towal.\nOceanic Surveying Meets Edge AI\nSaildrone relies on the NVIDIA JetPack SDK for access to a full development environment for hardware-accelerated edge AI on the Jetson platform. It runs machine learning on the module for image-based vessel detection to aid navigation.\nSaildrone pilots set waypoints and optimize the routes using metocean data \u2014 which includes meteorological and oceanographic information \u2014 returned from the vehicle. All of the USVs are monitored around the clock, and operators can change course remotely via the cloud if needed.\nMachine learning is mostly run locally on the Jetson module\u2014 but can run on the cloud as well with a satellite connection \u2014 because bandwidth can be limited and costly to shuttle from its robust suite of sensors producing high-resolution imagery.\nThe USVs have oceanographic sensors for measurement of wind, temperature, salinity and dissolved carbon. The company also enables research of ocean and lake floors with bathymetric sensors, including deep sonar mapping with single- or multi-beam for going deeper or wider. And its perceptual sensor suite includes radar and visual underwater acoustic sensors.\nDeepStream Goes Deep Sea\nSaildrone taps into the NVIDIA DeepStream SDK for its vision AI applications and services. Developers can build seamless streaming pipelines for AI-based video, audio and image analytics using the kit.\nOffering a 10x throughput improvement, DeepStream can be applied from edge to cloud to develop optimized intelligent video applications that handle multiple video, image and audio streams.\nSaildrone will rely on DeepStream for image preprocessing and model inference, which enables machine learning at the edge, even at sea while powered by sun and wind.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Jetson modules and the DeepStream SDK.\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: DeepStream | Inception | Jetson \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He shared details of NVIDIA\u2019s Earth-2 initiative and how accelerated computing, AI-augmented simulation and interactive digital twins drive climate science research.\nBefore sitting down for a fireside chat with the founders of the three startups, Huang introduced some \u201cspecial guests\u201d to the audience \u2014 four of the world\u2019s leading climate modeling scientists, who he called the \u201cunsung heroes\u201d of saving the planet.\n\u201cThese scientists have dedicated their careers to advancing climate science,\u201d said Huang. \u201cWith the vision of EVE, they are the architects of the new era of climate science.\u201d\nTaking on Formidable Forces\n\u201cThere is an enormous amount of AI startups in Germany, and I\u2019m delighted to see it,\u201d Huang said. \u201cYou\u2019re in a brand-new computing era, and when that happens, everybody\u2019s on square one.\u201d\nHuang welcomed to the stage the founders from Blackshark.ai, Magic and DeepL. Planetary management, artificial general intelligence, or AGI, and language translation are some ways the startups use generative AI.\n\nBlackshark.ai uses AI and hyperscaling distributed spatial computing to turn 2D images into data-rich 3D worlds.\nMagic is building an AGI software engineer, enabling small teams to write code significantly faster and more cheaply.\nDeepL aims to help everything communicate with everybody else with its AI-powered translation tool.\n\nAll three companies make solutions that could be seen as going up against products from established companies.\nAn audience of more than 500 attended the fireside chat.\n\u201cWhy did you take on such formidable forces?\u201d Huang asked the founders.\nBlackshark co-founder and CEO Michael Putz shared that the startup\u2019s product is similar to what you might see in Google Earth.\nBut Blackshark claimed its coverage of the planet is 100%, compared to Google Earth\u2019s 20%. And while Google might take a few months to update parts of its map, Blackshark only needs three days, Putz said.\nMagic co-founder, CEO and AI lead Eric Steinberger explained how his company is trying to build an AGI AI software engineer that will work as though it were a team of humans.\nHe said it\u2019ll remember conversations from months ago and can be messaged via an app like any other engineer. Rather than creating an alternative to existing solutions, Magic sees itself as trying to build something categorically different.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to build, but if we can get it right, we\u2019re in an even playing field, even up against the giants,\u201d said Steinberger.\nDeepL founder and CEO Jaroslaw Kutylowski said his company\u2019s work was initially an intellectual challenge. \u201cCould they do better than Google?\u201d the team asked themselves. To Kutylowski, that sounded like fun.\nIntuition, Efficiency and Resilience\nSteinberger got a chuckle from the audience as he asked Huang about his decision-making process in driving NVIDIA forward. \u201cYou\u2019re right, either always or almost always. How do you make those decisions before it\u2019s obvious?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a hard question,\u201d Huang responded.\nHuang talked about the intuition that comes from decision-making, saying, in his case, it comes from life and industrial experience. In NVIDIA\u2019s case, he said it comes from having a lot of ideas \u201ccooking\u201d simultaneously.\nHe explained that with the invention of the GPU, the intention was never to replace the CPU but to make the GPU part of the next great computer by taking a full-stack approach.\nWith data centers and the cloud, Putz asked for advice on the best approach for startups when it comes to computing.\nNVIDIA joined the \u201cfabless semiconductor\u201d industry, where there was very little capital required for a factory to funnel resources into R&D teams of 30-50 engineers instead of 500 like a more traditional semiconductor company.\nToday, Huang explained, with the software 2.0 generation, startups can\u2019t spend all their money on engineers \u2014 they need to save some to prototype and refine their software.\nAnd it\u2019s important to use the right tools to do the work for cost-efficient workloads. A CPU might be cheaper than a GPU per instance, but running a workload on a GPU will take \u201c10x less time,\u201d he said.\nKutylowski asked about the most significant challenges NVIDIA and Huang have faced along the company\u2019s 30-year journey.\n\u201cI go into things with the attitude of, \u2018How hard can it be? Well, it turns out it\u2019s super hard,\u201d Huang answered. \u201cBut if somebody else can do it, why can\u2019t I?\u201d\nThe answer includes the right attitude, self-confidence, the willingness to learn, and not setting an expectation of perfection from day one, he said. \u201cBeing resilient as you fail to the point where you eventually succeed \u2014 that\u2019s when you learn,\u201d Huang said.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Deep Learning | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Events | NVIDIA in Europe \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This set off demand for generative AI applications that help businesses become more efficient, from providing consumers with answers to their questions to accelerating the work of researchers as they seek scientific breakthroughs, and much, much more.\nBusinesses that previously dabbled in AI are now rushing to adopt and deploy the latest applications. Generative AI \u2014 the ability of algorithms to create new text, images, sounds, animations, 3D models and even computer code \u2014 is moving at warp speed, transforming the way people work and play.\nBy employing large language models (LLMs) to handle queries, the technology can dramatically reduce the time people devote to manual tasks like searching for and compiling information.\nThe stakes are high. AI could contribute more than $15 trillion to the global economy by 2030, according to PwC. And the impact of AI adoption could be greater than the inventions of the internet, mobile broadband and the smartphone \u2014 combined.\nThe engine driving generative AI is accelerated computing. It uses GPUs, DPUs and networking along with CPUs to accelerate applications across science, analytics, engineering, as well as consumer and enterprise use cases.\nEarly adopters across industries \u2014 from drug discovery, financial services, retail\u00a0and telecommunications to energy, higher education and the public sector \u2014 are combining accelerated computing with generative AI to transform business operations, service offerings and productivity.\nClick to view the infographic: Generating the Next Wave of AI Transformation\nGenerative AI for Drug Discovery\nToday, radiologists use AI to detect abnormalities in medical images, doctors use it to scan electronic health records to uncover patient insights, and researchers use it to accelerate the discovery of novel drugs.\nTraditional drug discovery is a resource-intensive process that can require the synthesis of over 5,000 chemical compounds and yields an average success rate of just 10%. And it takes more than a decade for most new drug candidates to reach the market.\nResearchers are now using generative AI models to read a protein\u2019s amino acid sequence and accurately predict the structure of target proteins in seconds, rather than weeks or months.\nUsing NVIDIA BioNeMo models, Amgen, a global leader in biotechnology, has slashed the time it takes to customize models for molecule screening and optimization from three months to just a few weeks. This type of trainable foundation model enables scientists to create variants for research into specific diseases, allowing them to develop target treatments for rare conditions.\nWhether predicting protein structures or securely training algorithms on large real-world and synthetic datasets, generative AI and accelerated computing are opening new areas of research that can help mitigate the spread of disease, enable personalized medical treatments and boost patient survival rates.\nGenerative AI for Financial Services\nAccording to a recent NVIDIA survey, the top AI use cases in the financial services industry are customer services and deep analytics, where natural language processing and LLMs are used to better respond to customer inquiries and uncover investment insights. Another common application is in recommender systems that power personalized banking experiences, marketing optimization and investment guidance.\nAdvanced AI applications have the potential to help the industry better prevent fraud and transform every aspect of banking, from portfolio planning and risk management to compliance and automation.\nEighty percent of business-relevant information is in an unstructured format \u2014 primarily text \u2014 which makes it a prime candidate for generative AI. Bloomberg News produces 5,000 stories a day related to the financial and investment community. These stories represent a vast trove of unstructured market data that can be used to make timely investment decisions.\nNVIDIA, Deutsche Bank, Bloomberg and others are creating LLMs trained on domain-specific and proprietary data to power finance applications.\nFinancial Transformers, or \u201cFinFormers,\u201d can learn context and understand the meaning of unstructured financial data. They can power Q&A chatbots, summarize and translate financial texts, provide early warning signs of counterparty risk, quickly retrieve data and identify data-quality issues.\nThese generative AI tools rely on frameworks that can integrate proprietary data into model training and fine-tuning, integrate data curation to prevent bias and use guardrails to keep conversations finance-specific.\nExpect fintech startups and large international banks to expand their use of LLMs and generative AI to develop sophisticated virtual assistants to serve internal and external stakeholders, create hyper-personalized customer content, automate document summarization to reduce manual work, and analyze terabytes of public and private data to generate investment insights.\nGenerative AI for Retail\nWith 60% of all shopping journeys starting online and consumers more connected and knowledgeable than ever, AI has become a vital tool to help retailers match shifting expectations and differentiate from a rising tide of competition.\nRetailers are using AI to improve customer experiences, power dynamic pricing, create customer segmentation, design personalized recommendations and perform visual search.\nGenerative AI can support customers and employees at every step through the buyer journey.\nWith AI models trained on specific brand and product data, they can generate robust product descriptions that improve search engine optimization rankings and help shoppers find the exact product they\u2019re looking for. For example, generative AI can use metatags containing product attributes to generate more comprehensive product descriptions that include various terms like \u201clow sugar\u201d or \u201cgluten free.\u201d\nAI virtual assistants can check enterprise resource planning systems and generate customer service messages to inform shoppers about which items are available and when orders will ship, and even assist customers with order change requests.\nFashable, a member of NVIDIA Inception\u2019s global network of technology startups, is using generative AI to create virtual clothing designs, eliminating the need for physical fabric during product development. With the models trained on both proprietary and market data, this reduces the environmental impact of fashion design and helps retailers design clothes according to current market trends and tastes.\nExpect retailers to use AI to capture and retain customer attention, deliver superior shopping experiences, and drive revenue by matching shoppers with the right products at the right time.\nGenerative AI for Telecommunications\nIn an NVIDIA survey covering the telecommunications industry, 95% of respondents reported that they were engaged with AI, while two-thirds believed that AI would be important to their company\u2019s future success.\nWhether improving customer service, streamlining network operations and design, supporting field technicians or creating new monetization opportunities, generative AI has the potential to reinvent the telecom industry.\nTelcos can train diagnostic AI models with proprietary data on network equipment and services, performance, ticket issues, site surveys and more. These models can accelerate troubleshooting of technical performance issues, recommend network designs, check network configurations for compliance, predict equipment failures, and identify and respond to security threats.\nGenerative AI applications on handheld devices can support field technicians by scanning equipment and generating virtual tutorials to guide them through repairs. Virtual guides can then be enhanced with augmented reality, enabling technicians to analyze equipment in a 3D immersive environment or call on a remote expert for support.\nNew revenue opportunities will also open for telcos. With large edge infrastructure and access to vast datasets, telcos around the world are now offering generative AI as a service to enterprise and government customers.\nAs generative AI advances, expect telecommunications providers to use the technology to optimize network performance, improve customer support, detect security intrusions and enhance maintenance operations.\nGenerative AI for Energy\nIn the energy industry, AI is powering predictive maintenance and asset optimization, smart grid management, renewable energy forecasting, grid security and more.\nTo meet growing data needs across aging infrastructure and new government compliance regulations, energy operators are looking to generative AI.\nIn the U.S., electric utility companies spend billions of dollars every year to inspect, maintain and upgrade power generation and transmission infrastructure.\nUntil recently, using vision AI to support inspection required algorithms to be trained on thousands of manually collected and tagged photos of grid assets, with training data constantly updated for new components. Now, generative AI can do the heavy lifting.\nWith a small set of image training data, algorithms can generate thousands of physically accurate images to train computer vision models that help field technicians identify grid equipment corrosion, breakage, obstructions and even detect wildfires. This type of proactive maintenance enhances grid reliability and resiliency by reducing downtime, while diminishing the need to dispatch teams to the field.\nGenerative AI can also reduce the need for manual research and analysis. According to McKinsey, employees spend up to 1.8 hours per day searching for information \u2014 nearly 20% of the work week. To increase productivity, energy companies can train LLMs on proprietary data, including meeting notes, SAP records, emails, field best practices and public data such as standard material data sheets.\nWith this type of knowledge repository connected to an AI chatbot, engineers and data scientists can get instant answers to highly technical questions. For example, a maintenance engineer troubleshooting pitch control issues on a turbine\u2019s hydraulic system could ask a bot: \u201cHow should I adjust the hydraulic pressure or flow to rectify pitch control issues on a model turbine from company X?\u201d A properly trained model would deliver specific instructions to the user, who wouldn\u2019t have to look through a bulky manual to find answers.\nWith AI applications for new system design, customer service and automation, expect generative AI to enhance safety and energy efficiency, as well as reduce operational expenses in the energy industry.\nGenerative AI for Higher Education and Research\nFrom intelligent tutoring systems to automated essay grading, AI has been employed in education for decades. As universities use AI to improve teacher and student experiences, they\u2019re increasingly dedicating resources to build AI-focused research initiatives.\nFor example, researchers at the University of Florida have access to one of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers in academia. They\u2019ve used it to develop GatorTron \u2014 a natural language processing model that enables computers to read and interpret medical language in clinical notes that are stored in electronic health records. With a model that understands medical context, AI developers can create numerous medical applications, such as speech-to-text apps that support doctors with automated medical charting.\nIn Europe, an industry-university collaboration involving the Technical University of Munich is demonstrating that LLMs trained on genomics data can generalize across a plethora of genomic tasks, unlike previous approaches that required specialized models. The genomics LLM is expected to help scientists understand the dynamics of how DNA is translated into RNA and proteins, unlocking new clinical applications that will benefit drug discovery and health.\nTo conduct this type of groundbreaking research and attract the most motivated students and qualified academic professionals, higher education institutes should consider a whole-university approach to pool budget, plan AI initiatives, and distribute AI resources and benefits across disciplines.\nGenerative AI for the Public Sector\nToday, the biggest opportunity for AI in the public sector is helping public servants to perform their jobs more efficiently and save resources.\nThe U.S. federal government employs over 2 million civilian employees \u2014 two-thirds of whom work in professional and administrative jobs.\nThese administrative roles often involve time-consuming manual tasks, including drafting, editing and summarizing documents, updating databases, recording expenditures for auditing and compliance, and responding to citizen inquiries.\nTo control costs and bring greater efficiency to routine job functions, government agencies can use generative AI.\nGenerative AI\u2019s ability to summarize documents has great potential to boost the productivity of policymakers and staffers, civil servants, procurement officers and contractors. Consider a 756-page report recently released by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence. With reports and legislation often spanning hundreds of pages of dense academic or legal text, AI-powered summaries generated in seconds can quickly break down complex content into plain language, saving the human resources otherwise needed to complete the task.\nAI virtual assistants and chatbots powered by LLMs can instantly deliver relevant information to people online, taking the burden off of overstretched staff who work phone banks at agencies like the Treasury Department, IRS and DMV.\nWith simple text inputs, AI content generation can help public servants create and distribute publications, email correspondence, reports, press releases and public service announcements.\nThe analytical capabilities of AI can also help process documents to speed the delivery of vital services provided by organizations like Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Affairs, USPS and the State Department.\nGenerative AI could be a pivotal tool to help government bodies work within budget constraints, deliver government services more quickly and achieve positive public sentiment.\nGenerative AI for Media and Entertainment\nA typical film must generate more than 2x its production budget in box office revenues to be profitable. And with lofty production costs, even major movies like Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, The Flash and Shazam! Fury of the Gods struggled to turn a profit.\nMedia and entertainment companies must optimize and accelerate production pipelines to stay competitive. Deloitte research showed that 72% of M&E leaders believe AI will be crucial over the next five years.\nIn media and entertainment, AI can assist artists, developers and business decision-makers.\nFor content creation, generative AI can help artists and developers reduce the time needed for concept art, previsualization, and creating environments with 3D content placement, crowds, and set dressing. This will free up artists\u2019 time to achieve the most ideal shots and sequences.\nBy using LLMs to power voice generation and audio- or text-generated animation, studios and broadcasters can create personalized, immersive experiences with existing characters and sports heroes. Sports legends can interact with fans, superheros can talk about their comic series and droids can become augmented reality assistants. These experiences can create greater customer engagement and new revenue streams.\nTo reduce distribution costs, streaming services and live broadcasters can use generative AI and data analytics to monitor and visualize quality of service, predict when and where to preload content, mitigate piracy, recommend content and more. Ad content or product placement can also be inserted dynamically into content at the point of consumption, improving relevance for both consumers and advertisers.\nWhether reducing content costs, creating new revenue streams or optimizing user experiences, generative AI has emerged as a key tool to help the media and entertainment industry reinvent itself while delighting audiences with new forms of entertainment.\nGenerative AI \u2013 A Key Ingredient for Business Success\u00a0\nAcross every field, organizations are transforming employee productivity, improving products and delivering higher-quality services with generative AI.\nTo put generative AI into practice, businesses need expansive amounts of data, deep AI expertise and sufficient compute power to deploy and maintain models quickly. Enterprises can fast-track adoption with the NeMo generative AI framework, part of NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, running on DGX Cloud. NVIDIA\u2019s pretrained foundation models offer a simplified approach to building and running customized generative AI solutions for unique business use cases.\nLearn more about powerful generative AI tools to help your business increase productivity, automate tasks, and unlock new opportunities for employees and customers.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | DGX Cloud | Education | Energy | Financial Services | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Industrial and Manufacturing | Media and Entertainment | NVIDIA NeMo | Public Sector | Retail | Telecommunications \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  AI is improving ways to power the world by tapping the sun and the wind, along with cutting-edge technologies.\nThe latest episode in the I AM AI video series showcases how artificial intelligence can help optimize solar and wind farms, simulate climate and weather, enhance power grid reliability and resilience, advance carbon capture and power fusion breakthroughs.\nIt\u2019s all enabled by NVIDIA and its energy-conscious partners, as they use and develop technology breakthroughs for a cleaner, safer, more sustainable future.\n\nHomes and businesses need access to reliable, affordable fuel and electricity to power day-to-day activities.\nRenewable energy sources \u2014 such as sunlight, wind and water \u2014 are scaling in deployments and available capacity. But they also burden legacy power grids built for traditional one-way power flow: from generation plants through transmission and distribution lines to end customers.\nThe latest advancements in AI and accelerated computing enable energy companies and utilities to balance power supply and demand in real time and manage distributed energy resources, all while lowering monthly bills to consumers.\nThe enterprises and startups featured in the new I AM AI video, and below, are using such innovations for a variety of clean energy use cases.\nPower-Generation Site Optimization\nCompanies are turning to AI to improve maintenance of renewable power-generation sites.\nFor example, reality capture platform DroneDeploy is using AI to evaluate solar farm layouts, maximize energy generated per site and automatically monitor the health of solar panels and other equipment in the field.\nRenewable energy company Siemens Gamesa is working with NVIDIA to apply AI surrogate models to optimize its offshore wind farms to output maximum power at minimal cost. Together, the companies are exploring neural super resolution powered by the NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA Modulus platforms to accelerate high-resolution wake simulation by 4,000x compared with traditional methods\u2013from 40 days to just 15 minutes.\nItaly-based THE EDGE COMPANY, a member of the NVIDIA Metropolis vision AI partner ecosystem, is tracking endangered birds near offshore wind farms to provide operators with real-time suggestions that can help prevent collisions and protect the at-risk species.\nGrid Infrastructure Maintenance\nEnergy grids also benefit from AI, which can help keep their infrastructure safe and efficient.\nNVIDIA Metropolis partner Noteworthy AI deployed smart cameras powered by the NVIDIA Jetson platform for edge AI and robotics on Ohio-based utility FirstEnergy\u2019s field trucks. Along with AI-enhanced computer vision, the cameras automate manual inspections of millions of power lines, poles and mounted devices.\nOrbital Sidekick, a member of the NVIDIA Inception program for cutting-edge startups, has used hyperspectral imagery and edge AI to detect hundreds of suspected gas and hydrocarbon leaks across the globe. This protects worker health and safety while preventing costly accidents.\nAnd Sweden-based startup Eneryield is using AI to detect signal anomalies in undersea cables, predict equipment failures to avoid costly repairs and enhance reliability of generated power.\nClimate and Weather Simulation\nAI and digital twins are unleashing a new wave of climate research, offering accurate, physics-informed weather modeling, high-resolution simulations of Earth and more.\nNVIDIA Inception member Open Climate Fix built transformer-based AI models trained on terabytes of satellite data. Through granular, near-term forecasts of sunny and cloudy conditions over the U.K.\u2019s solar panels, the nonprofit product lab has improved predictions of solar-energy generation by 3x. This reduces electricity produced using fossil fuels and helps decarbonize the country\u2019s grid.\nPlus, a team of researchers from the California Institute of Technology, Stanford University, and NVIDIA developed a neural operator architecture called Nested FNO to simulate pressure levels during carbon storage in a fraction of a second while doubling accuracy on certain tasks. This can help industries decarbonize and achieve emission-reduction goals.\nAnd Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory demonstrated the first successful application of nuclear fusion \u2014 considered the holy grail of clean energy \u2014 and used AI to simulate experimental results.\nLearn more about AI for autonomous operations and grid modernization in energy.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Energy | Metropolis | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

AI and accelerated computing are poised to help.\nMore than 180 weather modeling centers employ robust high performance computing (HPC)\u00a0infrastructure to crunch traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. These include the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), which operates on 983,040 CPU cores, and the U.K. Met Office\u2019s supercomputer, which uses more than 1.5 million CPU cores and consumes 2.7 megawatts of power.\nRethinking HPC Design\nThe global push toward energy efficiency is urging a rethink of HPC system design. Accelerated computing, harnessing the power of GPUs, offers a promising, energy-efficient alternative that speeds up computations.\nOn the left, results based on ECMWF Integrated Forecast System 51-member ensembles on Intel Broadwell CPUs, FourCastNet 1,000-member ensembles on 4x NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs; assuming 10 modeling centers running the same forecast workload. On the right,\u00a0 results based on measured performance of the ICON model. CPU: 2x AMD Milan. GPU: 4x NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core PCIe.\nNVIDIA GPUs have made a significant impact on globally adopted weather models, including those from ECMWF, the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, the German Meteorological Service and the National Center for Atmospheric Research.\nGPUs enhance performance up to 24x, improve energy efficiency, and reduce costs and space requirements.\n\u201cTo make reliable weather predictions and climate projections a reality within power budget limits, we rely on algorithmic improvements and hardware where NVIDIA GPUs are an alternative to CPUs,\u201d said Oliver Fuhrer, head of numerical prediction at MeteoSwiss, the Swiss national office of meteorology and climatology.\nAI Model Boosts Speed, Efficiency\nNVIDIA\u2019s AI-based weather-prediction model FourCastNet offers competitive accuracy with orders of magnitude greater speed and energy efficiency compared with traditional NWP methods. The latest version of FourCastNet, based on the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator, rapidly produces months-long forecasts and allows for the generation of large ensembles \u2014 or groups of simulations with slight variations in starting conditions \u2014 for high-confidence, extreme weather risk predictions weeks in advance.\nFor example, based on historical weather and climate data from ECMWF, FourCastNet ensembles accurately predicted increased risk of extreme temperatures during Africa\u2019s hottest recorded heatwave, in July 2018.\nA visualization of the ground-truth weather across Africa in July 2018 (center), surrounded by globes displaying heat domes that represent accurate predictions produced by FourCastNet (ensemble members).\nUsing NVIDIA GPUs, FourCastNet quickly and accurately generated 1,000 ensemble members. It enables 20x larger ensemble size and 1,000x faster run-times compared with traditional NWP models. A dozen of the FourCastNet members accurately predicted the high temperatures in Algeria three weeks before it occurred. In contrast, smaller 50-member NWP ensembles altogether missed the heatwave.\nThis marked the first time the FourCastNet team predicted a high-impact event weeks in advance, demonstrating AI\u2019s potential for reliable weather forecasting with lower energy consumption than traditional weather models.\nFourCastNet uses the latest AI advances to bridge AI and physics for groundbreaking results. It\u2019s about 45,000x faster than traditional NWP models. And when trained, FourCastNet consumes 12,000x less energy to produce a forecast than the Europe-based Integrated Forecast System, a gold-standard NWP model.\n\u201cNVIDIA FourCastNet opens the door to the use of AI for a wide variety of applications that will change the shape of the NWP enterprise,\u201d said Bjorn Stevens, director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology.\nExpanding What\u2019s Possible\nIn an NVIDIA GTC session, Stevens described what\u2019s possible now with the ICON climate research tool. The Levante supercomputer, using 3,200 CPUs, can simulate 10 days of weather in 24 hours, Stevens said. In contrast, the JUWELS Booster supercomputer, using 1,200 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, can run 50 simulated days in the same amount of time.\nScientists are looking to study climate effects 300 years into the future, which means systems need to be 20x faster, Stevens added. Embracing faster technology like NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs and simpler code could get us there, he said.\nResearchers now face the challenge of striking the optimal balance between physical modeling and machine learning to produce faster, more accurate climate forecasts. A ECMWF blog published last month describes this hybrid approach, which relies on machine learning for initial predictions and physical models for data generation, verification and system refinement.\nSuch an integration \u2014 delivered with accelerated computing \u2014 could lead to significant advancements in weather forecasting and climate science, ushering in a new era of efficient, reliable and energy-conscious predictions.\nLearn more about how accelerated computing and AI boost climate science through these resources:\n\nNVIDIA one-pager: Predicting the Weather With AI\nNVIDIA one-pager: Faster Weather Predictions\nNVIDIA resource page: Sustainable Computing\nNVIDIA technical blog: AI for a Scientific Computing Revolution\n\nDiscover how AI is powering the future of clean energy.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Climate | GPU Computing | Hardware | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA A100 | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | NVIDIA in Europe | NVIDIA Research | Science | Scientific Visualization | Simulation and Design | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Even with the incredible performance of NVMe SSDs, this goal has remained out of reach. Modern game engines have exceeded the capability of traditional storage APIs; a new generation of Input/Output (IO) architecture is needed.\nEnter NVIDIA RTX IO, enabling fast GPU-based loading and game asset decompression, massively accelerating IO performance compared to hard drives and traditional storage APIs. NVIDIA RTX IO leverages GPU decompression for smaller data packages, enabling faster load times and lower CPU utilization, allowing developers to create a new generation of games with massive, highly detailed worlds. \u00a0\nNVIDIA RTX IO makes its debut alongside the free Portal: Prelude RTX mod today, and will also feature in Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, launching July 26th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Does RTX IO Work? \nNVIDIA RTX IO leverages the advanced architectures of GeForce GPUs to offload dozens of CPU cores\u2019 worth of work to your GPU, enabling faster game loading, and opening the door to a new era of large, incredibly detailed open world games. RTX IO is based on GDeflate, an open GPU compression standard contributed by NVIDIA, which is utilized by both Microsoft\u2019s DirectStorage and new Vulkan Extensions.\u00a0 \u00a0\nTraditionally, data is sent from your disk drive to the CPU, decompressed through system memory, and sent to the GPU. This system is not designed with the capabilities of today\u2019s Gen4 and Gen5 PCIe NVME SSDs in mind, using only a fraction of their capabilities. Bottlenecks from the CPU and System Memory, combined with bigger assets, limit the gains from newer SSDs, resulting in slower loading of assets, which can cause in-game texture pop-in, or longer loading times.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional Input/Output processes cause bottlenecks in today\u2019s content-rich games\nNVIDIA RTX IO dramatically increases IO bandwidth by letting compressed data be delivered to GPU memory with minimal staging in the CPU system memory. The GPU is utilized for decompression using GDeflate at high throughput, allowing the CPU to perform other tasks. As a result, object pop-in and stutter can be reduced, and high-quality textures can be streamed at incredible rates, so even if you\u2019re speeding through a world, everything runs and looks great. In addition, with lossless compression, game download and install sizes can be reduced, allowing gamers to store more games on their SSD while also improving their performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX IO leverages GPU accelerated decompression for faster IO throughput\nWhile RTX IO is supported on all modern DirectX 12 GPUs, it is designed to run on as many parallel cores in the GPU as possible, so in cases where the IO throughput is not the bottleneck, the more compute cores available, the more performant it is. Essentially, load times are fastest on more powerful GPUs and SSDs; specific speed ups will vary based on the game, scene, and your particular combination of GPU and disk drive.\nIn Portal: Prelude RTX, NVIDIA RTX IO is always on (you don\u2019t need to toggle it in a menu), and it enables much faster texture load time, minimizing asset pop-in:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortal: Prelude RTX - Faster texture load times with RTX IO at 4K max settings, on a GeForce RTX 4090 and Samsung 980 Pro NVMe \u00a0\nNVIDIA RTX Remix was used to bring Portal: Prelude RTX to life, and thanks to RTX IO and the use of Vulkan extensions, GPU decompression with GDeflate shrank Portal: Prelude RTX\u2019s install size by 44%, enabling gorgeous 4K textures to be experienced losslessly with a minimal footprint. When the RTX Remix creator toolkit is released, every modder will be able to count on RTX IO to enable them to stay true to their artistic vision, while keeping within the file size restrictions of popular modding sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, launching July 26th, NVIDIA RTX IO is used to quickly load high-quality textures and environments with a high level of detail when jumping between dimensions. With DirectStorage accelerated by RTX IO, and the use of a fast NVMe SSD, the integration results in very responsive texture streaming even at the highest settings.\nRichard van der Laan, Senior Lead Programmer at Nixxes Software, explains: \u201cTo enable quick loading and instant transition between dimensions, the game needs to be able to load assets quickly. DirectStorage ensures quick loading times and GPU decompression is used at high graphics settings to stream assets in the background while playing.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX IO Supports DirectStorage & Vulkan \nRTX IO is built on GDeflate, an open GPU compression standard contributed by NVIDIA to maximize adoption and compatibility, enabling each Independent Hardware Vendor (IHV) to add support in their drivers, and allowing developers to easily incorporate its technology across multiple platforms. RTX IO supports DirectX through DirectStorage, and Vulkan through Vulkan extensions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX IO leverages open standard GPU compression standard supporting both DirectX & Vulkan \u00a0\nOn GeForce GTX and RTX PCs and laptops with Maxwell or newer architectures, the technology\u2019s performance is further improved thanks to our Game Ready Drivers, and in titles with RTX IO integrations, the full capabilities of your GeForce RTX GPU are leveraged, giving you the definitive experience.\nDevelopers can learn more about how to add RTX IO for their DirectX and Vulkan applications here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortal: Prelude RTX Launches Today With NVIDIA RTX IO\nPortal: Prelude RTX is a full ray-traced remaster of the highest-rated Portal mod of all time, Portal: Prelude. Available for download today, its creators used NVIDIA RTX Remix to reimagine their classic, with inspiration from Portal with RTX. Portal: Prelude RTX features hundreds of additional remastered materials and assets, a new fully voice acted story, and updated level design for improved gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis incredible remaster launches for free today, and can be downloaded by all Portal owners on Steam. By leveraging RTX IO, its download size is greatly reduced, and its loading times accelerated. For a Portal: Prelude RTX deep dive, head to our dedicated Portal: Prelude RTX launch article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatchet & Clank: Rift Apart Launches July 26th With RTX IO\nOn July 26th, the critically acclaimed Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart comes to PC, courtesy of Insomniac Games and Nixxes Software. Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart supports RTX IO, leveraging the DirectStorage runtime and our RTX IO-enabled Game Ready Drivers, ensuring the dimension-hopping gameplay is fluid and exciting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload The July 18th GeForce Game Ready Driver For The Best Day One Experience\nToday, we\u2019ve released our latest GeForce Game Ready Driver. It\u2019s optimized for Portal: Prelude RTX, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, and other games, and gives you the highest levels of performance when using NVIDIA RTX IO and DirectStorage for Windows in the two titles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo download and install, head to the Drivers tab of GeForce Experience or GeForce.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming Evolves With The Launch of NVIDIA RTX IO\nDevelopers are always pushing the boundaries of technology, and with the latest advancements and engine upgrades they can create near-photorealistic environments in massive traversable worlds, with faster loading than ever before thanks to NVIDIA RTX IO, GDeflate, and Microsoft DirectStorage for Windows. With these technologies, gamers will experience far fewer visible level of detail transitions, barely noticeable asset pop-in, and rapid texture loading.\nWith a GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU you\u2019ll receive the fastest possible performance, and all other modern GeForce GPU users will benefit greatly from Game Ready Driver and RTX IO game optimizations, as in Portal: Prelude RTX.\nTo learn which games are adding NVIDIA RTX IO next, stay tuned to GeForce.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He also described NVIDIA\u2019s efforts in this direction through Earth-2, a highly collaborative effort with the climate science community to create Earth digital twins.\nThe first miracle required will be to simulate the climate fast enough and with a high enough resolution\u2013 at kilometer-scale\u2013 to predict impacts at local granularity.\nThe second miracle required will be to emulate the physics of climate at high enough fidelity using AI. Generative AI breakthroughs promise new ways of predicting Earth\u2019s climate and enabling real-time interactivity with petabytes of climate data. More importantly, AI is the technology that will help create actionable climate information from raw climate data in myriad ways, unlocking the potential of vast quantities of data to inform decision-making.\nThe third miracle needed is the ability to virtualize massive data interactively with NVIDIA Omniverse to \u201cput it in the hands of policymakers, businesses, companies, and scientists.\u201d\nThe Next Wave of Climate and Weather Innovation\nEVE is an international collaboration that brings together digital infrastructure focused on climate science, HPC and AI aiming to provide, for the first time, easily accessible kilometer-scale climate information to manage the planet sustainably.\n\u201cThe reason why Earth-2 and EVE found each other at the perfect time is because the premise of Earth-2 is also based on these three miracles\u201d, Huang said.\nThe EVE initiative promises to accelerate the pace of advances, advocating coordinated climate projections at kilometer-scale resolution. It\u2019s an enormous challenge, but it builds on a huge base of advancements over the past 25 years.\nA sprawling suite of applications already benefits from accelerated computing\u2013 including ICON, IFS, NEMO, MPAS, WRF-G\u2013 and much more computing power for such applications is coming.\nThe NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip is a breakthrough accelerated CPU designed from the ground up for giant-scale AI and high-performance computing applications.\u00a0 It delivers up to 10x higher performance for applications running terabytes of data.\nIt\u2019s built to scale, and by connecting large numbers of these chips together, NVIDIA can offer systems with the power efficiency to accelerate climate research. \u201cTo the software, it looks like one giant processor,\u201d Huang said.\nTo help researchers put vast quantities of data to work quickly to unlock understanding, Huang spoke about NVIDIA Modulus, an open-source framework for designing, training and fine-tuning physics-informed machine learning models, and FourCastNet, an Earth system emulator and predictor that can learn physics from real-world data.\nUsing data alone, Huang showed how FourCastNet can learn the physical principles governing complex weather patterns and accurately predict the thermodynamic structure of storms.\n\nA novel application of AI emulators is to tether them to principled physics-based simulations to achieve two goals: rapid exploration and massive compression. FourCastNet can generate many possible weather trajectories when tethered to \u201ccheckpoints\u201d created by a climate simulation in seconds to minutes.\nThis enables rapid interactive exploration of massive ensembles of possible trajectories at high fidelity and provides massive data compression. The longer the distance between checkpoints, the larger the compression achieved.\nFourCastNet today can tether between checkpoints spaced a month apart, achieving 700x data compression. Huang demonstrated FourCastNet tethering for cities across the globe, including Berlin, Tokyo and Buenos Aires.\nHuang then demonstrated how FourCastNet-generated large ensembles anticipated an unprecedented North African heatwave from 2018. By running FourCastNet in Modulus, the Earth-2 team could generate a thousand different 21-day weather trajectories in one-tenth the time it previously took to do a single trajectory \u2014 and with 1,000x less energy consumption. Such massive ensembles are required to quantify the risk of rare, high-impact extreme weather events.\nLastly, NVIDIA technologies promise to help all this data and knowledge become more accessible, interactive, and useful with digital twins of increasingly complex systems \u2013 from Amazon warehouses to the way 5G signals propagate in dense urban environments.\nHuang then showed a stunning, high-resolution interactive visualization of global-scale climate data in the cloud, zooming in from a view of the globe to a street-level detailed view of Berlin. This approach can enable interactive exploration of climate information across the globe, Huang said.\n\nEarth: The Final Frontier\nTo make the three miracles outlined above a reality, Huang showed how NVIDIA is building more powerful computing systems for simulating physical systems at ultra-high resolution, training large-scale AI models, and interactive visualization of petabytes of data.\n\u201cThese new types of supercomputers are just coming online,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThis is as fresh a computing technology as you can imagine.\u201d\n\nHuang ended his talk by thanking the world-leading scientists who congregated at the Berlin Summit and playfully suggesting a mission statement for EVE.\n\u201cEarth, the final frontier, these are the voyages of EVE,\u201d Huang said. \u201cIts mission is to push the limits of computing in service of climate modeling, to seek out new methods and technologies to study the global-to-local state of the climate to inform today the impact of mitigation and adaptation to Earth\u2019s tomorrow, to boldly go where no one has gone before.\u201d\n\nLearn more about Earth-2.\nDiscover how AI is powering the future of clean energy.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Digital Twin | Events | High-Performance Computing | NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo | Omniverse | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDave James, cynic(Image credit: Future)This week I have been mostly playing Jagged Alliance 3.\nIt actually made me put down Dredge (which I have been loving on the little AOKZOE handheld) and got me back into the classic turn-based shooter. I've long had a soft spot for Jagged Alliance's silliness, and with the addition of some XCOM elements it's a good ol' time.\nThis month I have been testing AMD laptops.\nSpeaking of that handheld, I've had a couple of AMD-powered laptops with the same integrated 780M graphics... but it's not playing ball in laptop form, performing around half the level of either the ROG Ally or AOKZOE A1 Pro. Testing tech can be frustrating.To me, the 16GB Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti feels like a truly cynical graphics card, an almost petulant one, even. The green team never wanted to make it, don't want people to review it, and have already gone to great lengths to tell journalists that it performs exactly the same as the $100 cheaper RTX 4060 Ti 8GB.\u00a0Yet this unwanted graphics card is reportedly launching today\u2026 with precisely zero fanfare. As of right now, the expected day of launch, there are but a handful listed on Best Buy and Newegg, but none actually available. Not even Nvidia's own store lists any to buy.\u00a0Unlike every other GPU in the RTX 40-series family, Nvidia isn't sending cards out to reviewers, or even helping seed manufacturers' cards. For their part manufacturers themselves don't seem to want to sample cards, either. Nvidia has likened the situation to the 12GB update to the RTX 3080, where it similarly had little interest in having the cards actually tested.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5070 Founders Edition review\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5080 Founders Edition review\n\n\n\nIn the end Nvidia doesn't seem hugely bothered whether you buy its new card or not. It was never supposed to be on the Ada agenda, but if you want to spend another $100 on an extra 8GB of GDDR6 for your mid-range card it's more than happy to facilitate.The 16GB RTX 4060 Ti then feels purely like a reaction to a PC gaming community railing against Nvidia's initial decision to launch the RTX 4060 Ti with 8GB, a community contending that such a spec will restrict the longevity of the mid-range GPU in the near future. Hell, even AMD joined in.The specific contention is that launching a $400 graphics card with 8GB of VRAM in 2023 will see the GPU's performance limited by near future games that swallow up more than that amount of graphics memory. We've already seen some examples launching with horrible performance on existing 8GB cards, such as The Last of Us, Jedi: Survivor, and Hogwarts Legacy\u2014even at 1080p\u2014so the expectation is that is a situation that will only increase as time and system requirements move on.Whether it's as inevitable as some folk expect I'm not sure. Especially given the parameters on the consoles regarding VRAM capacities aren't going to change, and developers still need to code for their install bases, not fantasy system specs.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Nvidia itself suggests the problem is one born of poor game optimisation on PC, and that later patches have ironed out these particular performance issues in the past. It's also claiming the work it's done to boost the L3 cache on its GPUs reduces the number of times it has to dip into the VRAM, which is why it doesn't need as large memory buses as previous generations.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)That's not necessarily going to help out when you hit on game data that exceeds 8GB in scale\u2014and the GPU then has to dip into super slow system memory, dragging performance way down\u2014but at least it addresses one of the memory issues people have had with the recent RTX 40-series cards.Nvidia also has the magic of upscaling and Frame Generation to salve potential performance woes. Nvidia might also have a point on the optimisation front, and about subsequent updates. During a 1:1 briefing with Nvidia around the launch of the 8GB RTX 4060 Ti I was taken through a bunch of benchmarks the green team ran the new Ada card through; pretty much all high settings and modern games.\u00a0The Last of Us was a title my attention was explicitly drawn to given that it was, to that point, the poster child for the argument against 8GB VRAM in a modern card.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)And it performed fine on the RTX 4060 Ti 8GB with the latest game patches installed. Admittedly, it was not far ahead of the RTX 3060 Ti with DLSS and ray tracing enabled, but that's more about the GPU itself than the memory capacity. Still, it was shown batting above 100 fps at 1080p. With the 16GB card, however, the performance in The Last of Us was shown as identical.And this is Nvidia highlighting that parity. After it's already pointed to the fact it's charging another $100 for the higher capacity card because it now has to stick GDDR6 on both sides of the PCB.Nvidia is confident the extra VRAM does nothing for gaming performance and seemingly also confident that releasing a 16GB version via its manufacturing partners\u2014it's not wasting a Founders Edition on this li'l stepchild\u2014will only highlight it was right to go with just 8GB all along.(Image credit: Future)The card is like the embodiment of an exasperated 'FINE, here you go!'History, however, will be the judge of that, because we just don't know how this is all going to play out over this generation. What we can be pretty confident of is that, however the game optimisation argument shakes out, there will be more games that launch in a state where your 8GB card struggles at higher settings and how long you have to wait for them to be fixed will be different each time.But Nvidia never had plans to go for a 16GB card at this level, yet the complaints have been listened to, and the response is kinda 'well, screw you. If you want it, you pay for it.'Sure, it sucks for the board partners spending money on making a 16GB GPU that's far too close to the excellent RTX 4070 in price and too far off in terms of performance, but there's a part of me that can't help but admire the sheer cynical bloodymindedness of this approach. The card is like the embodiment of an exasperated 'FINE, here you go!'It sure feels like a lot of effort to go to in order to prove a point, but I'm not a multi billion dollar (temporarily trillion dollar) company with AI money to burn. Maybe if I was I wouldn't be beyond sticking a silicon middle finger up to the naysayers, either.\n\n\nDave JamesSocial Links NavigationEditor-in-Chief, HardwareDave has been gaming since the days of Zaxxon and Lady Bug on the Colecovision, and code books for the Commodore Vic 20 (Death Race 2000!).

However, some GPU models have now caught up with more demanding 3D workflows, and offer a more rounded solution for AEC professionals.\nRevit, Archicad, Vectorworks and SketchUp are a given, but some low-profile cards can now put in a good shift with companion viz tools like Enscape, Twinmotion, Lumion, Chaos Vantage, Chaos V-Ray and Nvidia Omniverse.\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nRead our other recent Nvidia RTX workstation GPU reviews\nNvidia RTX A1000\nNvidia RTX 2000 Ada Generation\nNvidia RTX 4000 Ada Generation\nNvidia RTX 6000 Ada Generation\n\nThe new contender\nThe Nvidia RTX 4000 SFF Ada Generation (20 GB) is only the second workstation GPU to be based on Nvidia\u2019s Ada Lovelace architecture. It follows the phenomenally powerful, but phenomenally expensive (\u00a36,750 + VAT), Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada Generation (48 GB), which we reviewed in our recent summer 2023 Workstation Special Report.\nThe Nvidia RTX 4000 SFF Ada picks up where the Ampere-based Nvidia RTX A2000 left off. It has the same dual slot, low profile form factor, radial fan, four mini DisplayPort 1.4a connectors and 70W max board power, so it doesn\u2019t need an external 6-pin connector. It comes with both a half-height and full-height ATX bracket, so it can be used in full sized towers as well.\nNvidia\u2019s new Ada Lovelace architecture gives it a significant boost in performance over the Nvidia RTX A2000, which we will explore in more detail later. It also has significantly more memory (20 GB vs 12 GB), which makes it capable of handling some rather substantial viz datasets, now and well into the future.\nIn some ways the Nvidia RTX 4000 SFF Ada Generation marks a true coming of age for the compact workstation\nIf the Nvidia RTX 4000 SFF Ada Generation is the natural successor to the Nvidia RTX A2000 why not call it the Nvidia RTX 2000 SFF Ada Generation?\nA cynic might suggest it\u2019s to elevate the GPU\u2019s standing so Nvidia can charge more money. At \u00a31,249 + VAT, the Nvidia RTX 4000 SFF Ada certainly isn\u2019t cheap and costs considerably more than the Nvidia RTX A2000 (12 GB) \u2014 currently available for \u00a3470 (Ex VAT), although this price is a little cheaper than it has been over the last 12 months.\nAlternatively, it could be that Nvidia intends to use the exact same silicon, but clocked higher, in the as-yet released full height, single slot 140W Nvidia RTX 4000 Ada GPU. Or, simply to differentiate it more from the Nvidia RTX A2000, which will continue to sit in Nvidia\u2019s low-profile product stack, alongside the CAD-focused Nvidia T1000 and T400.\nWhatever the reason, the Nvidia RTX 4000 SFF Ada will bring a substantial price increase to SFFs and ultra-compact s, which have traditionally been entry-level workstations. So, what exactly do you get for your money?\n\nFind this article plus many more in the July / August 2023 Edition of AEC Magazine\n\ud83d\udc49 Subscribe FREE here \ud83d\udc48\n\ufeff\ufeff\n\nNvidia RTX 4000 SFF Ada on test\nFor testing, we compared the Nvidia RTX 4000 SFF Ada generation (20 GB) with the Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada (48 GB) and two Ampere generation GPUs \u2014 the low-profile, dual slot Nvidia RTX A2000 (12 GB) (read our review) and full height, single slot Nvidia RTX A4000 (16 GB) (read our review).\nHere, it\u2019s important to state that our benchmark comparisons aren\u2019t perfect, as not all GPUs were tested in the same machine. For the Nvidia RTX 4000 SFF Ada generation and Nvidia RTX A4000 we used the latest 536.25 driver inside an AMD Ryzen 7950X3D-based workstation from Armari. For the other two GPUs data was taken from previous articles. The Nvidia RTX A2000 with 527.27 driver was tested inside an overclocked Intel Core i9-13900K-based BOXX Apexx S4 workstation. The Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada with 528.24 driver was tested inside an AMD Threadripper Pro 5995WX-based workstation.\nWe would expect Nvidia RTX A2000 benchmark scores to be elevated a little in 3D CAD, as the Intel Core i9-13900K is faster than the AMD Ryzen 7950X3D in single threaded and lightly threaded workflows and CAD is typically very CPU limited with 3D graphics. However, in graphics intensive real-time viz tools processors shouldn\u2019t make much difference and, in GPU rendering, virtually none at all.\nNow we\u2019ve got the disclaimers out of the way, let\u2019s dive into the results.\nFor CAD, the RTX 4000 Ada more than delivered. In the SPECapc for Solidworks 2022 benchmark, it maintained high performance at all resolutions, while the Nvidia RTX A2000 dropped off a little at 4K. Of course, benchmark figures only tell one part of the story, and the Nvidia RTX A2000 should still give you everything you need and more in most 3D CAD workflows.\nThe RTX 4000 SFF Ada brings real benefits to real-time viz. Whereas the RTX A2000 falters a little in some 4K workflows, the RTX 4000 SFF Ada just keeps going. It\u2019s only when anti-aliasing is set to ultra-high in VRED Professional 2023, or real time ray tracing is enabled in Unreal Engine 4.26, that it starts to struggle, staying well below the desirable 20+ Frames Per Second (FPS).\nFor ray trace rendering, it\u2019s a significant step up from the RTX A2000. Compared to the RTX A4000, it was 1.26 times faster in KeyShot, 1.1\u00a0 times faster in V-Ray, but was a touch slower in Solidworks Visualize 2022.\nIn summary, you can expect around twice the performance of an Nvidia RTX A2000 and similar performance to a full height, single slot Nvidia RTX A4000, although the RTX 4000 SFF Ada uses half the power (70W vs 140W).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe verdict\nTypically, when Nvidia launches a new GPU architecture it starts at the high-end with a 6000 Series model, then works its way down the stack, adding a dual slot 5000 and single-slot 4000. With Ada Lovelace, it has taken a different approach and prioritised the low-profile form factor, so it has a premium offering in both full-size tower and compact workstation market segments. And considering how well small workstations continue to sell, this is hardly surprising.\nThe Nvidia RTX 4000 SFF Ada Generation is a very impressive GPU. It packs an incredible amount of processing power into a small 70W package, delivering excellent performance for many different AEC workflows, even at 4K resolution where it overcomes some of the limitations of the Nvidia RTX A2000. In some ways it marks a true coming of age for the compact workstation.\nBut, at \u00a31,249 it certainly isn\u2019t cheap. It represents a big step up in price from the Nvidia RTX A2000 and will significantly increase the cost of a top-end compact workstation. It feels like Nvidia is placing a premium on the space saving design.\nTo provide some context, and putting form factors to one side, the RTX 4000 SFF Ada offers similar performance to the older RTX A4000, which currently sells for under \u00a3900. Indeed, for those who use full-size towers, the RTX A4000 looks better value for money in many workflows \u2013 something you wouldn\u2019t expect from an older technology. However, you do get slightly less memory and the RTX A4000 doesn\u2019t support the latest Nvidia technologies including Deep Learning Super Sampling 3 (DLSS) and Shader Execution Reordering (SER).\nOf course, it\u2019s still early days for the Nvidia RTX 4000 SFF Ada and the Ada Lovelace architecture in general, and prices may well come down.\nIt will be interesting to see the specs and cost of the forthcoming full height, single slot 140W Nvidia RTX 4000 Ada. It should tell us more about how Nvidia is addressing the burgeoning compact desktop workstation market.\n\nThe Nvidia Ada Lovelace architecture\nThe Nvidia Ada Lovelace GPU architecture, named after the English Mathematician credited with being the first computer programmer, launched last year.\nThe Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada Generation was the first workstation GPU, which has how been joined by the Nvidia RTX 4000 SFF Ada Generation.\nAll Ada generation GPUs can call on three different types of processing cores, as and when required, and depending on software compatibility.\nThere are CUDA cores for general purpose graphics, RT Cores for ray tracing, and Tensor Cores for AI operations.\nTensor cores can be applied in many different ways. In viz they are primarily used to decrease render times or boost real-time performance. This can done through \u2018denoising\u2019, the removal of grainy spots and discoloration from renders, \u2018upscaling\u2019, a process that turns lower resolution frames into higher resolution frames (DLSS 2), or for creating brand-new frames without having to process the graphics pipeline (DLSS 3).\nDLSS 3 is unique to the Ada Lovelace architecture and so far we\u2019ve only seen it implemented in Nvidia Omniverse, but we expect others to follow. Enscape and Autodesk VRED, for example, both support DLSS 2.\nRelated articles:Dell launches 12th Gen Intel Core \u2018Alder Lake\u2019 workstationsChaos releases V-Ray 6 for 3ds Max, update 1Review: Boston Venom Epyc (pre-production unit)Intel Core Ultra 200HX and 200H processors launchReview: Scan 3XS WA6000 Viz [3rd Gen Threadripper]Review: AMD Radeon Pro WX 5100 GPUWinter 2024 Workstation Special ReportReimagining the desktop workstation\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPrevious Post \n\nNext Post \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nStay informed\nJoin the AEC community\nNewsletter \u2022 FREE digital magazine \u2022 print magazine\nGo\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLatest content \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAI and the future of arch viz\n\nFebruary 21, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWorkstation Special Report \u2013 Winter 2025\n\nFebruary 9, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMotif to take on Revit: exclusive interview\n\nFebruary 7, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAllplan acquires Manufacton to boost offsite\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nD5 Render 2.10 introduces real-time path tracing\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \u00a9 2008 - 2024 X3DMedia\r\n19 Leyden Street, London, E1 7LE, UK\r\nTel: +44(0)20 3355 7310                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManage Cookie Consent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use technologies like cookies to store and/or access device information.

Trek Bicycle is using GPUs to bring design concepts to life.\nThe Wisconsin-based company, one of the largest bicycle manufacturers in the world, aims to create bikes with the highest-quality craftsmanship. With its new partner Lidl, an international retailer chain, Trek Bicycle also owns a cycling team, now called Lidl-Trek. The team is competing in the annual Tour de France stage race on Trek Bicycle\u2019s flagship lineup, which includes the Emonda, Madone and Speed Concept. Many of the team\u2019s accessories and equipment, such as the wheels and road race helmets, were also designed at Trek.\n\nBicycle design involves complex physics \u2014 and a key challenge is balancing aerodynamic efficiency with comfort and ride quality. To address this, the team at Trek is using NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs to run high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, setting new benchmarks for aerodynamics in a bicycle that\u2019s also comfortable to ride and handles smoothly.\nThe designers and engineers are further enhancing their workflows using NVIDIA RTX technology in Dell Precision workstations, including the NVIDIA RTX A5500 GPU, as well as a Dell Precision 7920 running dual RTX A6000 GPUs.\nVisualizing Bicycle Designs in Real Time\nTo kick off the product design process, the team starts with user research to generate early design concepts and develop a range of ideas. Then, they build prototypes and iterate the design as needed.\nTo improve performance, the bikes need to feel a certain way, whether riders are taking it on the road or the trail. So Trek spends a lot of time with athletes to figure out where to make critical changes, including tweaks to geometry and the flexibility of the frame and taking the edge off of bumps.\n\nThe designers use graphics-intensive applications tools for their computer-aided design workflows, including Adobe Substance 3D, Cinema 4D, KeyShot, Redshift and SOLIDWORKS. For CFD simulations, the Trek Performance Research team uses Simcenter STAR-CCM+ from Siemens Digital Industries Software to take advantage of the GPU processing capabilities.\nNVIDIA RTX GPUs provided Trek with a giant leap forward for design and engineering. The visualization team can easily tap into RTX technology to iterate quicker and show more options in designs. They can also use Cinema 4D and Redshift with RTX to produce high-quality renderings and even to visualize different designs in near real time.\nMichael Hammond, the lead for digital visual communications at Trek Bicycle, explains the importance of having time for iterations. \u201cThe faster we can render an image or animation, the faster we can improve it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, we don\u2019t want to lose details or spend time recreating models.\u201d\nWith the help of the RTX A5500, Trek\u2019s digital visual team can push past creative limits and reach the final design much faster. \u201cOn average, the RTX GPU performs 12x faster than our network rendering, which is on CPU cores,\u201d said Hammond. \u201cFor a render that takes about two hours to complete on our network, it only takes around 10-12 minutes on the RTX A5500 \u2014 that means I can do 12x the iterations, which leads to better quality rendering and animation in less time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nAccelerating CFD Simulations\nOver the past decade, adoption of CFD has grown as a critical tool for engineers and equipment designers because it allows them to gain better insights into the behavior of their designs. But CFD is more than an analysis tool \u2014 it\u2019s used to make improvements without having to resort to time-consuming and expensive physical testing for every design. This is why Trek has integrated CFD into its product development workflows.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Madone.mp4\n\u00a0\nThe aerodynamics team at Trek relies on Simcenter STAR-CCM+ to optimize the performance of each bike. To provide a comfortable ride and smooth handling while achieving the best aerodynamic performance, the Trek engineers designed the latest generation Madone to use IsoFlow, a unique feature designed to increase rider comfort while reducing drag.\nThe Simcenter STAR-CCM+ simulations benefit from the speed of accelerated GPU computing,\u00a0 and it enabled the engineers to cut down simulation runtimes by 85 days, as they could run CFD simulations 4-5x faster on NVIDIA A100 GPUs compared to their 128-core CPU-based HPC server.\nThe team can also analyze more complex physics in CFD to better understand how the air is moving in real-world unsteady conditions.\n\u201cNow that we can run higher fidelity and more accurate simulations and still meet deadlines, we are able to reduce wind tunnel testing time for significant cost savings,\u201d said John Davis, the aerodynamics lead at Trek Bicycle. \u201cWithin the first two months of running CFD on our GPUs, we were able to cancel a planned wind tunnel test due to the increased confidence we had in simulation results.\u201d\n\nLearn more about Trek Bicycle and GPU-accelerated Simcenter STAR-CCM+.\nAnd join us at SIGGRAPH, which runs from Aug. 6-10, to see the latest technologies shaping the future of design and simulation.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | Industrial and Manufacturing | NVIDIA RTX | Rendering | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

While some market observers are concerned about the stock\u2019s valuation, Goldman Sachs raised its target price and sees more upside for the chipmaker.\nGoldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari maintained his buy rating on Nvidia while raising his price target from $440 to $495 and called it a \u201ckey enabler of traditional AI.\u201d\nNotably, the AI euphoria triggered a rally in Nvidia stock and it became a trillion-dollar market cap company.\nNvidia posted better-than-expected earnings in the fiscal first quarter\nNvidia reported revenues of $7.19 billion in the fiscal first quarter of 2024\u2013 well ahead of the $6.52 billion that analysts were expecting. The adjusted EPS of $1.09 was also higher than the 99 cents that analysts were expecting.\nImportantly, it guided for revenues of $11 billion in the current quarter which smashed the consensus estimate of $7.15 billion.\nNVDA is benefiting from the AI boom\nThe AI segment helped Nvidia post better-than-expected earnings. The company\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang said \u201cThe computer industry is going through two simultaneous transitions \u2014 accelerated computing and generative AI.\u201d\nHe is bullish on the company\u2019s AI business and said, \u201cA trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure will transition from general purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service and business process.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s CFO Colette Kress also echoed similar views and said, \u201cGenerative AI is driving exponential growth in compute requirements and a fast transition to NVIDIA accelerated computing, which is the most versatile, most energy-efficient, and the lowest TCO approach to train and deploy AI.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cGenerative AI drove significant upside in demand for our products, creating opportunities and broad-based global growth across our markets.\u201d\nNotably, the demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips has skyrocketed as an increasing number of companies are building AI models.\n\nGoldman Sachs expects Nvidia stock to rally further\nGoldman Sachs expects the rally in NVDA stock to continue. In his note, Hari said, \u201cSupported by its competitive moat founded on consistent investments in hardware and software, Nvidia has been a key enabler and beneficiary of traditional AI for nearly a decade.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cThe recent step-function increase in the company\u2019s Data Center revenue outlook, however, suggests that the company has entered a new phase of growth driven by the emergence and proliferation of Generative AI.\u201d\nNotably, after Nvidia\u2019s earnings call in May, several analysts raised the stock\u2019s target price.\nGoldman Sachs believes that training large language models could be a $13 billion revenue opportunity for Nvidia in a base case \u2013 but its estimates rise as high as $316 billion in the bull case.\nChina export restrictions are a risk for US chipmakers\nLast year, the US imposed restrictions on exports of several chips to China including Nvidia\u2019s A100. The company however managed to circumvent the ban by selling A800 chips to China whose performance was below the limits that the Commerce Department had set.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the US Commerce Department is considering imposing restrictions on chip sales to China and the rules might be announced in July.\nNvidia has tried to downplay the impact of any further export restrictions and Kress said, \u201cWe are aware of reports that the U.S. Department of Commerce is considering further controls that may restrict exports of A800 and our H800 products to China.\u201d\nShe however added, \u201cHowever, given the strength of our demand for our products worldwide, we do not anticipate that such additional restrictions, if adopted, would have an immediate material impact on our financial results.\u201d\nKress meanwhile warned that in the long term, such restrictions would mean a permanent revenue loss for the US chip industry.\nUS-China Tech War\nThere is an apparent AI war going on between the US and China as tech giants of the world\u2019s two biggest economies are competing against each other in the emerging technology.\nRising US-China tensions are a risk for chipmakers that count China as a major market. Nvidia for instance gets about a fifth of its revenues from China. Notably, chip stocks crashed in 2018 amid the escalation in the US-China trade war.\nFormer President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on most Chinese imports and also blamed China for the spread of the coronavirus.\nUS-China tensions have not come down in Biden\u2019s tenure and if anything, they might have only increased.\nAnalysts are getting bullish on Nvidia\nLast month, Daiwa upgraded Nvidia stock from hold to outperform and said, \u201cPost our recent tech tour and checks, we have a higher level of confidence that Nvidia\u2019s commanding position for AI, and Generative AI, will be difficult to replicate near term by the competitors such as AMD, Intel and others. Why? AI benefits most from a full scale solution.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Cathie Wood of ARK Invest missed the rally in NVDA stock as the growth-oriented fund manager sold the stock before its humongous rally. She has tried to defend her move by saying the stock was \u201cpriced ahead of the curve\u201d but most Wall Street analysts believe that Nvidia stock is reasonably valued given its strong growth prospects amid the AI pivot.\nTrusted & Regulated Stock & CFD Brokers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            eToro                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRating\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we like\n\n\n\n0% Fees on Stocks\n\n\n\n5000+ Stocks, ETFs and other Markets\n\n\n\nAccepts Paypal Deposits\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMin Deposit\n$200\n\n\nCharge per Trade\nZero Commission on real stocks\n\n\n\n\n\nRating\n\n\n\n\n\n                64 traders signed up today            \nVisit Now\n67% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider.

With the exception of Nvidia, those top tech stocks are largely focused on the cloud (MSFT and AMZN), the internet (GOOG and AMZN), software (MSFT), or hardware (Apple). While the cloud and the internet will, of course, continue to be hugely important parts of tech going forward, I believe that they will become somewhat less of a focal point for investors over the long term, while software and hardware will not be major forces in the stock market at all. Instead, in the upcoming age of artificial intelligence, automation and the chips that enable it will get the most attention from the Street. With that said, here are my candidates for the seven top tech stocks of the future.\n\nServiceNow (NOW)\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) appears to be the \u201ctop dog\u201d at this point when it comes to the huge field of automating IT functions. As AI evolves, this field will only get bigger and more lucrative as more functions can be automated, causing NOW\u2019s total addressable market and financial results to climb parabolically.\nEncouragingly. NOW is working hard to incorporate AI into its operations by, for example, recently launching an AI-powered system that will allow developers to more easily launch apps on its platform. Further, it\u2019s using AI to enable its customers to ship products faster and make programming easier for them.\nImpressively, fintel.io gives NOW stock a high Fund Sentiment Scire of 82.39 out of 100, indicating that the \u201cBig Money\u201d remains quite enamored with the name. I expect their fondness for NOW to increase rapidly as the months and years go by.\n\nWorkday (WDAY)\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\nWorkday\u2019s (NASDAQ:WDAY) cloud applications enable companies to easily manage their finances and human resources functions. It also has apps that allow companies to efficiently analyze their operations and plan initiatives using AI.\nTop mutual funds bought $27.6 million of WDAY stock, indicating that some of the best-performing mutual funds are very bullish on WDAY, according to Investor\u2019s Business Daily.\nAnd in a note to investors on June 28, RBC Capital, a prominent Canadian bank, started coverage of WDAY stock with an \u201coutperform\u201d rating. According to the bank, WDAY \u2018s subscription revenue will probably surge at least 20% annually for many years, as many businesses are increasingly adopting both its financial and HR offerings. Additionally, its planning app \u201cis gaining meaningful traction against the competition,\u201d RBC reported. The bank also believes that the company tends to make very good acquisitions.\nAnalysts, on average, expect workday\u2019s earnings per share to surge to $6.41 next year from $3.64 last year.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI)\nSource: Shutterstock\nSuper Micro Computer\u00a0(NASDAQ:SMCI) is a rare hardware company that looks poised to become explosively successful in the AI-dominated world of the future. That\u2019s because,\u00a0as I pointed out in a\u00a0previous column, the company markets servers that are very well-suited for creating AI. One of its servers, for example, \u201csupports up to 10 next-gen accelerators.\u201d AI is produced using accelerators.\nIndeed investment bank Rosenblatt Securities\u00a0has maintained that\u00a0Super Micro Computer \u201c\u2026is perfectly positioned to profit from the AI-driven spending trend,\u201d\u00a0Investor\u2019s Business Daily\u00a0reported. The bank is also upbeat on the company\u2019s \u201d liquid cooling at scale\u201d solution, which effectively combats overheating, allowing more power to be deployed to its servers. Also noteworthy is that SMCI has partnerships with two of the world\u2019s largest chipmakers: Nvidia and\u00a0AMD\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMD).\nSMCI\u00a0has a nearly perfect 98\u00a0out of 99 Composite Rating from\u00a0Investor\u2019s Business Daily, and\u00a0IBD\u00a0gives it an Acc/Dis rating of A+, showing that large investors have been buying plenty of its shares in the past 13 weeks.\n\nIntel (INTC)\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\nIntel\u00a0(NASDAQ:INTC) also looks poised to get a big boost from the proliferation of AI, as its Gaudi 2 chips can be used to produce the technology. The Gaudi chips\u00a0are reportedly only\u00a0about one-third as fast as Nvidia\u2019s AI-producing chips. But Intel indicated that its chips are significantly cheaper than Nvidia\u2019s, and companies reportedly have to wait many weeks to obtain Nvidia\u2019s chips. Moreover, multiple commentators have said that Intel\u2019s next Gaudi chip could meaningfully close the gap with Nvidia\u2019s offerings. And a\u00a0Seeking Alpha\u00a0columnist\u00a0reported in late March that its\u00a0Gaudi chips are already competitive when it comes to facilitating AI inference.\nAfter Nvidia\u2019s CEO said in May\u00a0that he was pleased with\u00a0the result of a test of Intel\u2019s manufacturing capabilities, it looks probable that Intel will manufacture chips for Nvidia, the world\u2019s largest maker of AI semiconductors. That, in turn, should convince other chip makers to let Intel manufacture their chips, turning Intel into a semiconductor manufacturing powerhouse.\n\nOn Semiconductor (ON)\nSource: Shutterstock\nAs I noted in a previous column, \u201cOn Semiconductor\u00a0(NASDAQ:ON) is a chipmaker that\u2019s highly leveraged to the automotive and industrial end markets, both of which are growing rapidly.\u201d\nElectrification of transportation and increased use of chips in vehicles, partly to enable semi-autonomous driving, are boosting On\u2019s revenue from autos, while the company\u2019s industrial business has also grown very rapidly in recent quarters.\nIn the first quarter, the company\u2019s automotive sales jumped 38% versus the same quarter a year earlier to a \u201crecord 50% of total revenue,\u201d while its \u201cAutomotive and industrial end-markets together represented record 79% of revenue.\u201d The results bode very well for the company\u2019s longer-term outlook.\nInvestor\u2019s Business Daily gives ON a very high Composite Rating of 92, including a Relative Strength rating of 96, indicating that investors have been very upbeat about the name in the last year.\n\nAurora Innovations (AUR)\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\nAurora Innovations (NASDAQ:AUR) appears to be the best-positioned American company when it comes to autonomous driving, as the firm\u2019s platform has been used by multiple trucking companies for many months to transport products in Texas. Moreover, the firm has said that all of the necessary features have already been added to its platform.\nAurora anticipates that it will begin generating meaningful revenue from its platform by the conclusion of its next fiscal year.\nAccording to Investor\u2019s Business Daily, the name has an Accumulation/Distribution rating of A+, indicating that large investors have been buying a great deal of the stock in the last 13 weeks.\n\nStem (STEM)\nSource: shutterstock.com/cono0430\nStem\u2019s\u00a0(NYSE:STEM) utilization of AI to make electricity use and the utilization of renewable energy more efficient will transform it into one of the most successful companies of the future.\nAmong its customers are several huge firms, including Apple,\u00a0Home Depot\u00a0(NYSE:HD), and\u00a0Walmart\u00a0(NYSE:WMT). The fact that such heavyweights\u00a0utilize its technology\u00a0largely validates STEM and its technology.\nAlso noteworthy is that investment bank Janney Montgomery started the name with a \u201cbuy\u201d rating and $12 price target last month, citing the company\u2019s outlook for positive adjusted EBITDA in the second half of this year. The firm\u2019s forecast of adjusted positive EBITDA in the second half bodes well for its longer-term performance.\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer was long INTC, SMCI, STEM and AUR, while his wife was long NOW.

True, if the human lifespan expanded into centuries, going after agriculture plays might work. Instead, with limited time, market participants are better off investing in tech sector ideas.\nFundamentally, the narrative for high potential tech stocks centers on the future of technology industry applications. For example, the rise of artificial intelligence helped dramatically drive the case of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), even though the enterprise is a mature one, having been founded in the early 1990s. Still, the potential of AI-related endeavors bolstered interest in the processors that make such protocols possible.\nNow, with such an ambitious goal like a 200-bagger, investors will need both patience and multiple servings of luck. If you can handle the risks associated with growth-oriented enterprises, these are the top tech stocks to consider.\n\nGigaCloud Technology (GCT)\nSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.com\nBilled as a leading global trade service provider, GigaCloud Technology (NASDAQ:GCT) specializes in heavy and large merchandise, specifically being optimized for the furniture sector. So far, investors love what they see so far this year, sending GCT up nearly 51% since the Jan. opener. Keep in mind, though, that GigaCloud ranks among the riskiest of top tech stocks geared for speculation. In the trailing year, it\u2019s down more than 47%.\nFinancially, though, GigaCloud brings an attractive profile to the table. According to investment data aggregator Gurufocus, the company posts a three-year revenue growth rate on a per-share basis of 87.6%, above 97% of its peers. In the first quarter of 2023, the company posted sales of $490.1 million, blowing past the year-ago quarter\u2019s result of only $122.3 million.\nTo further justify inclusion as one of the high potential tech stocks, Roth MKM\u2019s Matt Koranda pegged GCT a buy with a $13 price target, implying almost 58% upside potential. What\u2019s more, 10 months ago, Aegis Capital\u2019s Rommel Dionisio forecasted shares hitting $26. If so, we\u2019re talking over 215% returns.\n\nOndas (ONDS)\nSource: PX Media / Shutterstock\nOnly appropriate for those investing in tech sector \u201copportunities\u201d that are geared specifically for extreme speculators, Ondas (NASDAQ:ONDS) might seem like a bargain because of its chart performance (or underperformance). Down 22% for the year but also gaining over 22% in the trailing month, traders might be on the cusp of a turnaround effort. Surely, we\u2019ve seen stranger events materialize.\nFor those not familiar with the narrative, Ondas is a developer of private licensed wireless data networks for mission-critical industrial markets. With its acumen in Internet of Things (IoT)-related applications, Ondas serves industries such as hydrocarbon energy, transportation and government agencies.\nFinancially, Ondas right now wades in troubled waters, particularly with its distressed balance sheet. At the same time, Ondas prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 40.6%, outpacing almost 96% of the competition.\nPresently, Wall Street analysts peg ONDS a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $2, implying nearly 67% upside potential. Thus, it\u2019s worth consideration for top tech stocks for gamblers.\n\nAudioEye (AEYE)\nSource: Epic Cure / Shutterstock\nAnother terrifyingly risky but compelling name among high potential tech stocks, AudioEye (NASDAQ:AEYE) is an industry-leading digital accessibility platform delivering trusted Americans with Disabilities Act and web content accessibility guidelines (WCAG) accessibility compliance at scale. Through patented technology, per its corporate profile, subject matter expertise and proprietary processes, AudioEye is eradicating all barriers to digital access, helping creators get accessible and supporting them with ongoing advisory and automated upkeep.\nFinancially, traditional investors will likely be turned off by its trailing-year operating and net margins, which presently sit in negative territory. As well, metrics such as return on equity (ROE) and return on asset (ROA) sit in red-splattered ink too. Still, we\u2019re talking about the future of technology industry applications and with that, AudioEye delivers a three-year revenue growth rate of 25.2%, above 80.93% of its peers.\nFinally, analysts peg AEYE as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes in at $10, implying over 81% upside potential.\n\nAkoustis Technologies (AKTS)\nSource: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.com\nAn overlooked idea among top tech stocks for speculators, Akoustis Technologies (NASDAQ:AKTS) is a high-tech bulk acoustic wave (BAW) radio frequency\u00a0\u00a0filter solutions company that is pioneering next-generation materials science-related applications. Specifically, the company utilizes its proprietary manufacturing process to produce bulk acoustic wave RF filters for mobile and other wireless markets. Since the January opener, AKTS slipped more than 7%.\nTo be fair, investing in tech sector ideas geared for extreme gamblers will yield interesting financial results. For Akoustis, conservative investors will not necessarily appreciate the desperately negative profit margins. As well, stability in the balance sheet appears questionable, to be polite about it.\nNevertheless, Akoustis is a growth machine, posting a three-year revenue expansion rate of 76.1%. This stat beats out over 98% of sector rivals.\nLastly, analysts peg AKTS a unanimous strong buy. Their average price target clocks in at $5.50, implying over 112% upside potential. Therefore, it\u2019s a worthy wager if you\u2019re interested in the future of technology industry opportunities.\n\nKULR Technology (KULR)\nSource: shutterstock.com/CC7\nAnother overlooked enterprise among top tech stocks, KULR Technology (NYSEAMERICAN:KULR) develops, manufactures and licenses next-generation carbon fiber thermal management technologies for batteries and electronic systems. Per its public profile, KULR developed its acumen through breakthrough cooling solutions for NASA space missions. It presently focuses on relevant sectors like energy storage and 5G infrastructure. Despite the pertinence, however, KULR slipped nearly 24% since the beginning of this year.\nIn the past 365 days, the security gave up more than 36% of equity value. As with other high potential tech stocks, investors must exercise considerable faith in the business. For example, at the moment, KULR trades at a tangible book multiple of 15.33 times, well above the sector median stat of 2.11X.\nAt the same time, market participants of enterprises like KULR focus on growth and that\u2019s where it shines. Currently, the company posts three-year revenue growth rate of 56%, above 97.53% of its competitors.\u00a0To close out, Alliance Global Partners analyst Jake Sekelsky pegs KULR a buy with a $2.50 price target. That implies nearly 172% upside potential.\n\nZeroFox (ZFOX)\nSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.com\nTrading at just a bit over a buck a pop, ZeroFox (NASDAQ:ZFOX) easily ranks among the riskiest of tech stocks for speculation. Still, it\u2019s also incredibly relevant. Per its public profile, ZeroFox is an external cybersecurity firm providing cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) for organizations to expose and disrupt phishing and fraud campaigns. As well, it targets botnet exposures, credential theft, impersonations, data breaches and physical threats that target brands, domains, people and assets.\nAs you might imagine, ZeroFox doesn\u2019t exactly offer the stoutest of financial profiles. For example, both its operating and net margins have fallen into the abyss of negative territory. As well, its ROE and ROA are stuck there with the previously mentioned stats. And I\u2019m not a big fan of the Altman Z-Score of 4.15 below zero, indicating higher-than-average bankruptcy risk.\nStill, it\u2019s a growth machine. Over the past three years, ZeroFox posted a sales expansion rate of 92.3%, beating out 97.68% of its peers.\u00a0Lastly, analysts peg ZFOX as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes in at $3.50, implying almost 237% upside potential.\n\nTingo Group (TIO)\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\nOn the July 18 session, shares of Tingo Group (NASDAQ:TIO) fell nearly 11%. I just mention that so you understand what kind of enterprise you\u2019re dealing with. Still, Tingo will likely attract some speculators because of its versatile proprietary trading technology platform. Given the dramatic interest in the capital markets following the disruption of Covid-19, Tingo might still be relevant.\nTo be sure, those who acquire TIO shares mostly do so because of short-term gambling prospects. Since the Jan. opener, TIO gained 84%. However, it was a multi-bagger in May when retail trader interest skyrocketed. Still, despite the daily rumblings, Tingo offers surprisingly stout stats.\u00a0For example, the company\u2019s cash-to-debt ratio clocks in at 3.75x better than 68.12% of its peers. Also, it features double-digit operating and net margins. Of course, it\u2019s geared for growth, with Tingo boasting a three-year revenue growth rate of nearly 193%.\nThere\u2019s zero doubt in the world that for those investing in tech sector ideas, TIO ranks among the most treacherous. However, Taglich Brothers\u2019 Howard Halpern believes TIO will hit $11.75 per share. If so, we\u2019re talking growth of almost 689%.

It is possible the stock or fund may retest the level as resistance again, creating a triple top or even quadruple top pattern.\n\nThe formation is always identified after a security has reached a price and is at the top of an uptrend, whereas a bullish double bottom pattern is always found in a downtrend. A spike in volume confirms the double top pattern was recognized and subsequent increasing volume may indicate the stock will retrace into a downtrend.\nThe stock market also appears to be attempting to price in a hawkish tone from the Fed and that, paired with big tech earnings season, could cause volatility to increase.\n\n\n\n\nTraders wishing to trade the volatility in the stock market can use\u00a0MIAX\u2019s SPIKES Volatility products. The products, which are traded on\u00a0SPIKES Volatility Index\u00a0(XMIO: SPIKE), track expected volatility in the\u00a0SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust\u00a0\n(NYSE:\u00a0SPY) over the next 30 days.\nTraders wishing to trade the volatility in the stock market can use\u00a0MIAX\u2019s SPIKES Volatility products. The products, which are traded on\u00a0SPIKES Volatility Index\u00a0(XMIO: SPIKE), track expected volatility in the\u00a0SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. \u00a0GETTY IMAGES\u00a0\nThe Nvidia Chart: Nvidia formed its triple top pattern on July 14, July 18 and July 19, and on Thursday and Friday, the stock was reacting to the bearish pattern and falling lower. If the stock continues to descend, it may find support at its previous all-time high of $439.90, which was printed on June 20.\n\nThe retracement from all-time highs was likely because Nvidia\u2019s relative strength index (RSI) was trending above 70%, which put the stock into overbought territory. The retracement has been helping to lower that indicator, which is healthy.\nIf Nvidia closes the trading session near its low-of-day, the stock will form a bearish Marubozu candlestick, which could indicate lower prices will come again on Monday. Bullish traders want to see the stock eventually form a bullish reversal candlestick, such as a doji or hammer candlestick, to indicate the potential local bottom has occurred and a rebound is on the horizon.\nNvidia has resistance above at the all-time high and at the psychologically important $500 mark and support below at $429.90 and at $419.38.\n\nProduced in association with Benzinga\n\n\n\n\nEdited by Saba Fatima and Maham Javaid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the latest with Florida Man?\u201dGet news, handpicked just for you, in your box.Check out our free email newsletters \n\n\n\nWhat to read next...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tAI Skills Top Priority In Israel\u2019s High-Tech Sector Amid Conflict\n\u200c\t\t\n \n\nSeptember 23, 2024 - 2:17 PM \n\nJohn Jeffay \n\n\t\tManagers seek AI proficiency as critical thinking and problem-solving rise in importance, highlighting workforce resilience and adaptability.\u200c \u200c    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tNovel Antibody May Be Key To Better Lung Cancer Treatment\t\t\n \n\nSeptember 23, 2024 - 9:37 AM \n\nAbigail Klein Leichman \n\n\t\tResearchers develop synthetic antibody that, combined with Osimertinib, can prevent relapse of adenocarcinoma tumors in mouse models.    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n                    RECENT UPDATES            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimals \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tDuck!

Thanks to the growing enterprise applications of generative AI and investors\u2019 positive outlook, AMD stock has risen nearly 74% year-to-date. While the stock has appreciated quite a lot, the consensus price target from analysts suggests that AMD stock could extend gains in the coming days.\u00a0\n\nAI Opportunity Could Push AMD Stock Higher\u00a0\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), with its flagship Hopper and Ampere architecture GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), continues to dominate the AI space. However, AMD, with its innovative products, including the recently announced MI300X GPU for AI, could meet the growing demand for AI applications.\nOn June 16,\u00a0Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore\u00a0raised AMD\u2019s price target to $138 from $97 and reiterated the Buy recommendation on the stock. While Moore places Nvidia as the \u201cTop Pick\u201d in the\u00a0semiconductor sector, the analyst sees significant AI-led growth opportunities for AMD in 2024.\u00a0\nSpeaking about AMD\u2019s new dedicated generative AI product,\u00a0Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari\u00a0said that he is waiting for \u201ctangible evidence of customer design wins with MI300A and/or MI300X.\u201d The analyst added that \u201cAMD\u2019s efforts in providing a GPU-only solution that is comparable to that of Nvidia provides a minimum, some optionality for customers.\u201d\nIn a note dated June 14, Hari maintained his Buy recommendation on AMD stock and increased the price target to $137 from $97.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\n\nWhat is AMD\u2019s Price Target?\nAMD is expected to benefit from meaningful AI revenue starting in the fourth quarter of this year. Also, it is likely to benefit from its Zen 4 EPYC CPU portfolio. However, near-term macro uncertainty keeps analysts cautiously optimistic about its prospects.\nAMD stock\u00a0has received 21 Buy and eight Hold recommendations for a Moderate Buy consensus rating.

Megafirms like Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) led the way, partnering with tech giants such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), to develop AI-powered solutions to medical problems.\u00a0 While these mainstays take advantage of artificial intelligence and machine learning, they aren\u2019t the only opportunities for savvy investors. A slew of quality biotech firms are flying under the radar, advancing by leaps and bounds toward changing healthcare forever.\u00a0  These game-changing firms use AI to analyze mountains of data, develop new drugs, predict disease progression, and provide personalized care. And they\u2019re doing it all at unprecedented speed and accuracy. The result? Life-saving medicines delivered faster. Personalized treatments. And, ultimately, a giant leap toward a future where disease could become a thing of the past. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Recursion Pharma (RXRX)   Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) website displayed on a modern smartphone   Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com Recursion Pharma (NASDAQ:RXRX) made waves this week. On Wednesday, the firm reported a hefty $50 million cash infusion from Nvidia to support efforts in developing AI models that speed up drug discovery. The firm\u2019s core function centers around its Recursion Operating System. This technology turns AI loose on massive chemical and biological datasets to help other biotech companies accelerate their pipeline processes.\u00a0 Drug pipelines, a lengthy process from drug discovery to FDA approval, represent the functional lifeblood of most biotech companies. A snag, slowdown, or regulatory hurdle anywhere in the process can push cash-strapped companies underwater permanently.  Nvidia recognized the potential opportunity in Recursion\u2019s methods and invested accordingly. Recursion CEO Chris Gibson summed up the partnership in a press release: \u201cOur collaboration with NVIDIA represents two best-in-class companies coming together to help solve one of the world\u2019s most difficult challenges, drug discovery. With our powerful dataset and NVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing capabilities, we intend to create groundbreaking foundation models in biology and chemistry at a scale unlike anything that has ever been released in the biological space.\u201d Blueprint Medicines (BPMC)   Image of a child cancer patient holding a stuffed bear.   Source: Photographee.eu / Shutterstock.com In some ways, Blueprint Medicines (NASDAQ:BPMC) was ahead of its time regarding AI-integrated healthcare solutions. Blueprint, a therapeutic biotech firm focused on cancer and blood disorder treatment, partnered with Proteovant Therapeutics in 2022 to leverage the private company\u2019s AI-enhanced platform. As cancer rates continually increase each year, innovative approaches to oncology research won\u2019t just benefit investors. Instead, they\u2019ll serve the global community\u2019s vital and growing needs.\u00a0\u00a0   Story Continues Avoiding much of the complex science talk, the partnership lets Blueprint use Proteovant\u2019s novel approach to protein degradation research to support its cancer treatment goals. This technique uses the body\u2019s \u201ccellular machinery\u201d to identify and mark faulty or cancerous cells for clinical targeting. A relatively new tool in the oncology kit, the partnership opens new vistas for cancer research and puts Blueprint at the forefront of biotech firms leveraging AI in clinical research.\u00a0Exscientia (EXAI)  Brown glass pill bottle on its side showing white pills inside, with other pill bottles behind it representing MACK stock.  Source: shutterstock.com/ChampheiLike Recursion, Exscientia (NYSE:EXAI) uses AI in its approach to drug discovery. Unlike Recusion, Exscientia aims to develop bespoke drug solutions for patients. Exscientia was the first to bring an AI-designed molecule to clinical testing and recently began evaluating another AI-enhanced therapeutic. In essence, the firm\u2019s approach lets researchers dive into specific molecules that will benefit individual patients most. When therapeutic research is a complex game of identifying which compounds do as intended and what outcomes are merely byproducts, understanding single-cell outcomes is critical to drug discovery.\u00a0The company\u2019s extensive pipeline offers many AI-assisted opportunities for biotech investors. More appealing to investors, though, is the relatively low stock price compared to peers in AI-enabled biotech spaces. Although costly research caused more significant cash outflows in recent periods, the firm has sufficient runway to continue operations and ride the AI wave as they engineer healthcare\u2019s future.\u00a0On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

Shares are now up almost 150% since July 11.The move was sparked after a $50 million investment from Nvidia (NVDA), which was revealed on July 12.Investors are now wondering if RXRX has the potential for a short squeeze, as it\u2019s now part of the AI cohort. \n\n\n\n \n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\n\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) trade has been blistering higher, but Wednesday featured an interesting surge. That\u2019s as shares of Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RXRX) are exploding higher on the day. In fact, RXRX stock is currently up about 17% so far in the session.\nSo what does a $3 billion biotech company have to do with artificial intelligence? And what does Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) have to do with it?\nFirst, let\u2019s back up.\nNVDA shares were rocked during the 2022 bear market, losing about two-thirds of their value. While the rebound was a bit rocky at first, the stock really found its stride in 2023. For the year, shares have more than tripled, rallying 221%.\nDriving those gains have been Nvidia\u2019s advances in AI technology. Despite sporting huge gains going into its earnings report in late May, the firm delivered robust guidance well in excess of what analysts were expecting.\nThis has led to many other AI stocks \u2014 like C3.ai (NYSE:AI), Upstart (NASDAQ:UPST) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), among many others \u2014 to explode higher too. And now, we can put Recursion on that list too.\n\n\nRXRX Stock Rips on Nvidia Investment\nShares of RXRX rallied more than 75% on Wednesday, July 12. At one point, the stock traded as high as $14.99, up 121% on the day. Now trading above that level \u2014 and up in five of the last six sessions \u2014 the bulls have been in control of Recursion shares.\nAll of this stems from a $50 million investment made by Nvidia, \u201cwhich was implemented as a private investment in public equity.\u201d\n\u201cRecursion will utilize NVDA\u2019s cloud platform to train its AI models using its over 23 petabytes of biological and chemical dataset\u2026\nRXRX said it could potentially use its BioNeMo platform to commercially license or release its AI models.\u201d\nThe move on July 12 triggered more than 80 million shares of RXRX stock to trade that day. In fact, four of the last six sessions have resulted in a volume that would have exceeded the previous one-day record.\nDepending on investors\u2019 data source, the short interest in RXRX is anywhere from 12.5% to 16.3%. Further, the stock did trade a fair amount of short volume on July 12.\nLuckily for the bears, this stock doesn\u2019t have a huge short interest \u2014 although it is notable \u2014 which would have likely triggered a massive upside move. However, bulls are wondering if there\u2019s enough fuel left in the tank to continue to squeeze this one higher.\nThe longer it stays above $15 \u2014 and thus, the July 12 high of $14.99 \u2014 then the more potential it has to run. Lastly, if the AI trade catches another wave of momentum, then Recursion stock seems likely to participate.\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The company recently hit an astonishing milestone of trillion dollar valuation; by the looks of it, things won't end here. Analysts have reported that NVIDIA could earn enormous revenue through AI-based sales in upcoming years.\nThe AI Hype Has Uplifted NVIDIA to The Trillion Dollar Club, And This Is Only The Beginning\nVijay Rakesh, an analyst from Mizuho Financial Group, has predicted a 20% increase in NVIDIA's stock target price, reaching $530. It is important to note that the previous target price was $400; hence this huge uplift is mainly due to the surge in demand for NVIDIA's AI products. Moreover, the analyst notes that NVIDIA will dominate the AI industry in upcoming years and that the company's revenue could reach $300 billion only from AI-orientated sales.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM MemoryEven AMD is excited about this opportunity and mentioned that AI has 5-10 years of gas in it and will be a major portion of revenue for the tech industry in the following years.\n\nNVIDIA is undoubtedly ahead of its competitors regarding its market share in the AI industry. The company expects to hold a 75% market share of AI server units by 2027. Here is what the analyst Vijay Rakesh adds to the discussion:\nWith demand for generative AI accelerating, we see significant opportunities for hardware suppliers powering the higher compute needs for large-language models, particularly AI powerhouse NVDA.\nvia Insider\nNVIDIA's GPU business has skyrocketed to new heights after the company had fully betted on the AI hype. With generative AI models taking the tech industry by storm, NVIDIA is getting orders from all corners to get hands-on with its brand-new GPUs, including the A100 and the H100. The extent of the demand is so huge that the company is currently unable to fulfill the vast orders, which is why partners, such as TSMC, are working on expanding their production capacities.\n\nIt was recently said that the green team is exploring adopting a \"dual-sourcing\" strategy, with Samsung in the lead as a potential partner. Samsung was reportedly planning to supply\u00a0HBM3 memory and packaging facilities to NVIDIA to handle the influx of orders. However, this seems impossible for now since NVIDIA won't compromise its relationship with TSMC.\nFor now, one thing is evident. NVIDIA has been rescued from the PC industry slump many times, whether it is through crypto mining or the AI boom. The vast demand and new advancements in the AI industry will undoubtedly lead to revenue rise for several companies, including NVIDIA, in the coming years.\nNews Source: BusinessInsider\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Has Sold Over Three Million Blackwell AI GPUs This Year, Expects to Hit A Whopping $1 Trillion in Revenue by 2027\n\nMuhammad Zuhair\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang Gets Spotted At Denny\u2019s Mobile Station, Flipping Burgers Ahead of The GTC 2025 Keynote\n\nMuhammad Zuhair\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n156\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n73\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n66\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n65\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n46\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

When reflecting on past events, it is worth noting that its competitor, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), has seen its stock more than triple in value since I emphasized its plans for new chip production in November 2022. This begs the question: can Intel stock potentially yield similar high returns for investors? In my opinion, Intel is poised to benefit from the AI boom in the long run. While the benefits may take some time to materialize, they are expected to deliver significant value to investors over a long-term investment horizon.\nImportantly, the stock is currently trading at much lower levels compared to its all-time high of $69.29 seen in early 2020. Further, I believe the current stock price offers an attractive entry point for long-term investors.\n\nAI Opportunity and Related CapEx to Act as Long-Term Tailwinds\nThe global artificial intelligence chip market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 29% between 2023 and 2030, according to Next Move Strategy Consulting. Digging deeper, the market size is expected to grow by over 10 times to around $300 billion by 2030 versus $29 billion in 2022. This presents a huge growth opportunity for all the AI chip makers like Intel.\nIntel intends to position itself for future growth and maintain its competitive edge by changing its business model and investing in fields like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and advanced manufacturing. As the AI landscape continues to expand and evolve, Intel is making increased capital expenditures (CapEx) to support strategic growth toward AI development and implementation.\nNVDA, one of Intel\u2019s top competitors, has gained almost 200% year-to-date, riding high on the AI growth prospects. However, Intel has gained only 26% year-to-date. While NVDA is undoubtedly the dominant player in the AI chip-making industry, competitors like Intel are also bracing up and can get a share of the AI growth in the coming years.\n\t\t\n\n\nInterestingly, while NVDA chips have a huge competitive edge when it comes to performance, Intel chips will offer cheaper alternatives to clients. The better value proposition may help Intel win newer clients as the AI industry continues to grow globally. Further, NVDA\u2019s chips alone will not be able to fulfill the upsurge in demand for AI chips in the coming years. Consequently, peers like Intel will fill in the supply gap and should remain one of the important players in the AI chip-making industry.\nIntel is Undergoing a Paradigm Shift\nTo gain an edge over its peers, Intel is undergoing multiple restructuring initiatives like increased spending to support strategic growth, disciplined expense management, and PC inventory correction, among others. Intel recently held an investor webinar where it laid out the details of creating a new internal foundry model. This fundamental shift is expected to enhance production efficiency and also lead to cost savings. Moreover, it will also open its products to external customers and chip designers, thereby further driving revenue growth.\nUnder the new operating model, Intel\u2019s internal product business units will have a foundry-style relationship with the company\u2019s manufacturing group working in an \u201carm\u2019s-length fashion.\u201d Starting Q1 2024, the company will also provide standalone profit and loss statements for its Manufacturing groups that will include Manufacturing, Technology Development, and Intel Foundry Services.\nImportantly, Intel reiterated its long-term goal of becoming the second-largest external foundry by 2030. The new model is clearly an accelerated step in that direction. With the expected ramp-up of releasing five nodes over the next four years, revenues from the internal foundry are expected to reach $20 billion by 2024.\nThe company said that the transition to the foundry model will play a significant role in achieving its targeted cost savings of over $8 billion to $10 billion by 2025. With the resulting optimization of its cost structure, the company will be likely able to achieve its long-term target non-GAAP gross margin of 60% and operating margin of 40%.\n\t\t\n\n\nFor reference, Intel achieved a non-GAAP gross margin of 38.4% and a negative operating margin of 2.4% in the most recently reported first-quarter results. Therefore, Intel has a long path to tread to reach its margin goals.\nIf the shift to the foundry model is successfully executed, it could be a game changer for Intel and help it meet its lofty goals. However, it should be noted that the volume ramp-up is not expected anytime soon and could be visible after Fiscal Year 2025. Investors will likely get more clarity after the upcoming second-quarter earnings report scheduled to be released on July 27.\nIs Intel Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\nAs per TipRanks, analysts are cautious about Intel stock and have a Hold consensus rating, which is based on four Buys, 17 Holds, and six Sells assigned in the past three months. Intel stock\u2019s average price forecast of $32.26 implies 6.4% downside potential.\n\nConclusion: Consider Buying Intel for Long-Term\nThe AI boom is here to stay, and Intel is diligently taking every necessary step to capitalize on its robust growth potential. The company is currently undergoing a substantial business transformation, implementing an integrated device manufacturer (IDM) 2.0 strategy and adopting a new internal foundry model. These strategic moves are paving the way for a noteworthy expansion of Intel\u2019s manufacturing capabilities.\nAlthough the results of this scale expansion may not be immediately apparent, Intel is poised to reap the benefits of its multiple initiatives and the long-term potential of AI. Consequently, I maintain a bullish stance on the stock, viewing it through a long-term lens.\n\t\t\n\n\nDisclosure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\n\n\n FACEBOOK\n\n\n\n\n TWITTER\n\n\n\n\n EMAIL\n\n\n\n\n COPY LINK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIntel NewsMORE  \n\n\n\n\n\nNotable open interest changes for March 18thTipRanks 7h \n\n\n\nVOO ETF News, 3/18/2025TipRanks 10h \n\n\n\nDow, S&P, and Nasdaq closed in the green as the latest FOMC rate decision loomsSeeking Alpha 1d \n\n\n\nA Closer Look at Intel\u2019s (NASDAQ:INTC) New CEO\u2019s PlansTipRanks 1d \n\n\n\nAI Daily: New Intel CEO plots overhaul of manufacturing, AI operationsTipRanks 1d \n\n\n\nDow, S&P, and Nasdaq trade higher ahead of FOMC rate decisionSeeking Alpha 1d \n\n\n\nIntel\u2019s new CEO plots overhaul of manufacturing, AI operations, Reuters saysTipRanks 1d \n\n\n\nSA Asks: Will Intel be broken up?Seeking Alpha 1d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tStart Trading Futures\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n\n\n\n\nINTC\n\n\n\n26.02\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t0.33 (1.27%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t03:19:26 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time INTC charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA\n\n\n\n116.79\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-2.74 (-2.29%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t03:19:30 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time NVDA charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMORE \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFind News\n\t\t\t\tNews\n\n\n\n\n\nGO\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n            See also:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                - Explore more categories\n            \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

However, to briefly summarize our experience, these new products have been extremely underwhelming.\nThe RTX 4060 Ti arrived with a price tag of $400, the standard 4060 at $300, and the Radeon RX 7600 was originally advertised at $300, only for AMD to revise the price to $270 at the last minute.\nA striking commonality among these is their 8GB frame buffer and their overall underwhelming performance at their respective prices. This is particularly true for the RTX 4060 Ti, with a 16GB version coming at an even higher price \u2013 a development we are not particularly enthusiastic about.\n\nThe disappointment with the RTX 4060 Ti stems from several factors. Ignoring the 8GB VRAM buffer on a $400 graphics card in mid-2023, there are two other notable issues. First, the generation uplift presented here is laughable; our previous 50 game benchmark showed that the 4060 Ti is a mere 8% faster than the 3060 Ti at 1080p and 5% faster at 1440p.\nThus, it's fair to conclude that it falls short of expectations. But it manages to get even more disheartening considering that as of last September \u2013 less than a year ago \u2013 the Radeon 6700 XT has been available for less than $400. By November, the price had dropped to $350 and has more recently dipped to around $320.\n\nBased on our day-one review, the Radeon 6700 XT is on average just ~5% slower than the RTX 4060 Ti. Additionally, the Radeon GPU doesn't falter in VRAM demanding games as it comes with a larger 12GB buffer, making it much better suited for 1440p gaming.\nGranted, you lose out on DLSS support and ray tracing performance isn't nearly as competent \u2013 provided you don't exceed the 8GB buffer. However, given the current 20% discount along with the bonus of extra VRAM, it's challenging to dismiss the appeal of the 6700 XT. It's regrettable that newly released current-generation parts are not outperforming nearly three-year-old products as expected.\n\nFor today's big benchmark, we aim to compare the Radeon 6700 XT and GeForce RTX 4060 Ti across a wider array of games and ray tracing configurations than we have in the past. It will be interesting to see how they stack up.\nFor our tests, we used the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, paired with the Gigabyte X670E Aorus Master and 32GB of DDR5-6000 CL30 memory. We tested 50 games at both 1080p and 1440p. We will cover the more interesting results one by one, before examining the overall margins observed across all the tested games in a single graph as usual. Let's get into it\u2026\nBenchmarks\nIn Star Wars Jedi Survivor, the 6700 XT and 3060 Ti are neck and neck at both tested resolutions, rendering the 4060 Ti only 12% faster at 1080p and 8% faster at 1440p. That's somewhat underwhelming, considering the 4060 Ti costs 25% more and was released 2.5 years later.\n\n\nIn A Plague Tale: Requiem, the performance among the 6700 XT, 3060 Ti, and 4060 Ti are even closer, with the 4060 Ti outpacing the Radeon GPU by a mere 3% at 1080p, while maintaining identical performance at 1440p.\n\nAn issue we've previously detailed with the RTX 4060 Ti is its 8GB VRAM buffer, considering the GPU itself is not only quite pricey but also reasonably powerful. The Last of Us Part 1 performs well on the high preset, but those aiming to maximize the game's settings will need more than 8GB of VRAM, even at 1080p, to avoid any stuttering.\nThe real issue surfaces at 1440p, where 8GB graphics cards like the 4060 Ti become completely unusable, whereas the 6700 XT performs smoothly despite its sub-60 fps performance. Results like these don't bode well for the future of Nvidia's new $400 GPU.\n\nDoom Eternal presents another concern, highlighting another weakness of the RTX 4060 Ti: its restricted 128-bit wide memory bus, which results in less memory bandwidth than previous products. As Doom is a memory-sensitive game, the 6700 XT was 29% faster than the 4060 Ti at 1080p and an impressive 44% faster at 1440p. Although the 4060 Ti still delivers a playable performance, it's clear that it may struggle with future memory-demanding titles.\n\nIn Hogwarts Legacy, the 6700 XT and 3060 Ti are again neck and neck, and in this instance, both outperform the 4060 Ti, though the margin is only 5% at 1080p.\n\nEnabling ray tracing gives the 4060 Ti an advantage, but even so, the 4060 Ti is only 14% faster than the 6700 XT in this cutting-edge new title, a rather disappointing result.\n\nNext, we tested Resident Evil 4 using the second-highest quality preset, where the 6700 XT and 3060 Ti matched closely, although the Radeon GPU did pull ahead at 1440p. Compared to the 4060 Ti, the 6700 XT was 13% slower at 1080p and 7% slower at 1440p, so the margins aren't substantial. Something quite unexpected occurs when we enable ray tracing.\n\nThe max quality RT preset requires 12GB of VRAM, an issue for the new RTX 4060 Ti due to its 8GB limit. While the game plays reasonably well after a few updates, overall performance is weak, with the 6700 XT offering 36% more frames at 1080p and 33% more at 1440p.\n\nIn Cyberpunk 2077, the 3060 Ti and 6700 XT are closely matched without RT effects enabled. This means the Radeon GPU is only 11% slower than the 4060 Ti at 1080p and 8% slower at 1440p. While these are reasonable margins, particularly at 1080p, given the difference in price, the margin is actually more favourable for AMD.\n\nEnabling ray tracing in Cyberpunk 2077 significantly hampers the 6700 XT, though, to be fair, it similarly impacts the GeForce GPUs without the aid of upscaling. In any case, the 4060 Ti was 80% faster at 1080p, an incredible difference, though remember that the 3060 Ti was already 60% faster than the 6700 XT, suggesting this configuration is not favourable for the Radeon GPU.\n\nIn Far Cry 6, the 6700 XT, despite using the 'Ultra' quality preset, delivers 146 fps at 1080p, making it 2% faster than the 4060 Ti, another disappointing result for the new GeForce GPU.\n\nWith ray tracing enabled, the 6700 XT manages to keep pace with the 4060 Ti at 1080p, trailing by a mere 7% margin. Furthermore, at 1440p, it actually performs faster, albeit by a slight 5% margin.\n\nLastly, in F1 23, the 3060 Ti and 6700 XT again match closely. The 4060 Ti is faster in this example, though only by a 7% margin at 1080p and 4% at 1440p, indicating very similar performance among all three GPUs.\n\nWhen enabling ray tracing with the 'Ultra High' preset, the 6700 XT faces similar troubles as we saw in Cyberpunk 2077. Although still playable at 1080p, the 6700 XT was 32% slower than the 4060 Ti, a significant margin, suggesting that ray tracing should be disabled when using the previous generation Radeon GPU.\nPerformance Summary\nDepending on the game, the 6700 XT and RTX 4060 Ti can be quite evenly matched, and enabling ray tracing doesn't always hand the win to Nvidia. These intriguing results prompt us to take a look at a 50 game comparison to obtain a clear picture of their standings...\n\nAt 1080p, the Radeon 6700 XT is on average only 9% slower than the 4060 Ti, an excellent result for the AMD GPU considering it's currently 20% cheaper. There are a few instances where the 6700 XT even outperformed the GeForce, such as in Resident Evil 4 using ray tracing, The Last of Us Part 1, Doom Eternal, and Death Stranding, to name a few examples.\nHowever, there are numerous instances where the 6700 XT falls significantly behind the 4060 Ti, with 9 games where it was slower by 20% or more.\n\nAt 1440p, the gap narrows further meaning the Radeon 6700 XT is on average only 7% slower than the 4060 Ti at the higher resolution. Although the Radeon GPU was more often slower than the 4060 Ti, the margin was typically less than 10% either way, with 56% of all tested configurations only seeing single-digit margins.\n\nFor those not interested in ray tracing performance, we've excluded any configurations with RT effects enabled. As a result, the margin at 1080p is reduced to just 6%, and now there's only 3 games where the 6700 XT was slower by a margin of 20% or more.\n\nSimilarly, for those gaming at 1440p but no ray tracing enabled, the difference becomes even smaller. Here, the Radeon 6700 XT is 4% slower on average, which closely aligns with the 5% margin observed in our day-one review. So, depending on what you're after and the games you play, the difference between these two GPUs could be quite small.\nAnd the Winner is...\nIf you're seeking an affordable GPU for 1440p gaming in mid-2023, your options are very limited unless you're willing to spend $600, as there's no current-generation GPU available at a lower price point. So, our best advice for those in need of an affordable GPU for 1440p gaming is to snatch up a low-priced Radeon RX 6700 XT before stock runs out.\nThe next best option we know of is the 16GB version of the RTX 4060 Ti. However, at a $500 price tag, it will basically deliver what we've observed from the 8GB model here, with some improvements for games such as Doom Eternal, Resident Evil 4, and The Last of Us Part 1. These enhancements could boost the overall performance by a few percent, while costing almost 60% more than the existing Radeon 6700 XT stock.\n\nApart from that, your choices are to either spend $600 on the GeForce RTX 4070 to get a 12GB buffer, or to downgrade to an RTX 3060 12GB for $290. However, that's ~25% slower than the Radeon 6700 XT for a meager 10% saving, so it's not truly worthwhile.\nIn reality, the better choices are either a Radeon 6700 XT for $320 - $350, or a GeForce RTX 4070 for $600.\nThis makes choosing an affordable 1440p GPU quite straightforward: opt for the 6700 XT and hope to secure one before the stock dries up. Those ~$300 listings for the 6700 XT are becoming less frequent, suggesting that the stock may deplete soon, however as of writing, the Sapphire Pulse version was available for $320.\n\nEven after the last sub-$350 Radeon 6700 XT is sold, it doesn't mean that the RTX 4060 Ti instantly becomes a superior product. At $400, it's consistently going to be a poor offering that you should try to avoid if possible. Its performance barely marks an improvement compared to the 2.5-year-old GeForce product it's replacing, the 3060 Ti. In fact, it manages to be slower in several games.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nAMD Radeon RX 6700 XT on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 7600 on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 7900 XT on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4090 on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D on Amazon\n\nFurther Testing\nSince we posted this review, we have written new comparisons and run relevant benchmarks you may be interested in:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 vs. RTX 4060 Ti 16GB\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4060 vs. RTX 4060 Ti: $300 or $400 GPU Upgrade?\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB Reviewed, Benchmarked\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 42\n\n\n Got something to say?

It is essential to highlight that neither Mozilla Foundation nor NVIDIA has released an official statement on the addition of VSR, which could mean that the feature is at its initial stages. However, if you are keen to try out the new feature, you could follow the steps below:\nRelated Story Game Ready Driver Supports RTX 4070 Ti SUPER, Various New PC Games, and Adds RTX Video HDR Feature\nOpen your Mozilla Firefox browser and navigate to \"Settings.\" Type \"about:config\" on the search bar.\nSearch the \"gfx.webrender.super-resolution.nvidia\" on the \"Preferences\" tab and set it to \"True\"\n\nThere you have it, VSR is now enabled on your Mozilla browser, and you can enjoy the power of NVIDIA's upscaling technology. For those unaware, VSR combines software (AI algorithms) and hardware (RTX Tensor Cores) to enhance the clarity and sharpness of videos watched through Chromium-based browsers. However, since RTX Video Super Resolution leverages the Tensor Cores available in NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs, it is only available on 40 and 30 Series graphics cards. You can view extensive testing of the feature below:\n\nVSR is currently limited to certain applications although NVIDIA is working on expanding the feature to other platforms. The feature has also been added to VLC Media Player and we could expect it to have extensive support in the future. Additionally, the technology is also widely available within the full range of Chromium browsers and can easily be accessed by enabling it through NVIDIA Control Panel.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX Video Super Resolution 1.5 Now Available: Improved Visual Quality, Supported Across All RTX 20 GPUs\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVLC Media Player Adds Support For NVIDIA RTX Video Super Resolution, Available Now\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Razer Blade 16 Laptop Spec Sheet With Upcoming GeForce RTX 5060 Leaked, Reportedly Costs $1999\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFallout 76 Ghoul Q&A \u2013 \u2018The Game Is Thriving and We Have No Plans to Stop\u2019\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n97\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n51\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n34\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n32\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Although the AI model hasn't yet reached the level of ChatGPT or Google's LaMDA models, reports suggest that Inflection-1 performs well on \"common sense\" tasks, making it much more suitable for applications such as personal assistance.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Makes a Whopping 1000% Profit On its H100 AI GPUs\n\nComing back, Inflection announced that it is building one of the world's largest AI-based supercomputers, and it looks like we finally have a glimpse of what it would be. It is reported that the Inflection supercomputer is equipped with 22,000 H100 GPUs, and based on analysis, it would contain almost 700 four-node racks of Intel Xeon CPUs. The supercomputer will utilize an astounding 31 Mega-Watts of power.\nThe surprising fact about the supercomputer is the acquisition of 22,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs. We all are well aware that, in recent times, it has been challenging to acquire even a single unit of the H100s since they are in immense demand, and NVIDIA cannot cope with the influx of orders. In the case of Inflection AI, NVIDIA is considering being an investor in the company, which is why in their case, it is easier to get their hands on such a massive number of GPUs.\nAccording to TechCrunch, Inflection AI has raised around $1.5 billion in investments, and currently, the company is valued at $4 billion. Through this supercomputer, the AI model \"Inflection 1\" is expected to improve significantly, especially in coding tasks, since the company lacks behind in it.\nNews Source: HardwareLuxx\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Hopper H100 With 4th Gen Tensor Core Is Twice As Fast Clock-For-Clock, Frequency Delivers 30% Performance Gain\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Reference Design For RX 9070 XT Spotted; User Lists The Card For Sale With One Year Warranty\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGalaxy S26 Ultra Rumored To Arrive With A Camera Feature That Samsung First Introduced When It Unveiled The Galaxy S9 And Galaxy S9 Plus\n\nOmar Sohail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX 5060 Rumored To Feature A 12GB Variant; Prices For RTX 5060 Ti And RTX 5060 Leaked\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nM4 MacBook Air Utilizes All Six Efficiency Cores Instead Of The Performance Ones In Heavy Workloads To Improve Battery Life, Showing Major Constrast With Earlier M3 Version\n\n\n\n49\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nM3 Ultra Runs DeepSeek R1 With 671 Billion Parameters Using 448GB Of Unified Memory, Delivering High Bandwidth Performance At Under 200W Power Consumption, With No Need For A Multi-GPU Setup\n\n\n\n46\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n42\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s M5 iPad Pro To Reportedly Have No Discerning Features That Will Differentiate It From The Current Lineup, OLED Technology To Remain The Same, Claims Research Firm\n\n\n\n33\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX 5060 Rumored To Feature A 12GB Variant; Prices For RTX 5060 Ti And RTX 5060 Leaked\n\n\n\n30\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\n12V-2\u00d76 Power Connector Cooks At Over 150\u00b0C With A \u201cWater-Cooled\u201d NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090\n\n\n\n2317\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor Retailer Reports Selling Over 5,000 Units of AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs on Launch Day, Working Quickly to Restore Inventory\n\n\n\n2093\nComments\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1540\nComments\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Releases Another Hotfix Driver to Resolve Black Screen Issues, Marking the Firm\u2019s Fifth Attempt to Address The Problem\n\n\n\n1300\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Its 1080p gaming performance is the best you're going to find under $300, and its 1440p performance is pretty solid, especially when you turn on DLSS. If you're playing a game with DLSS 3 and frame generation, even better.Unfortunately, the card's 4K performance suffers due to the limited video memory it's working with, which is a 50% decrease from the initial RTX 3060 run's 12GB VRAM pool (though at least it doesn't go below the 8GB of the later RTX 3060s).\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti review: nearly perfect, but with one major flaw\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5080 review: nearly RTX 4090 performance for a whole lot less\n\n\n\nYou also get more sophisticated ray tracing and tensor cores than those found in the Ampere generation, and this maturity shows up in the card's much-improved ray tracing and DLSS performance.There are also some added bonuses for streamers as well like AV1 support, but this is going to be a lower-midrange gamer's card, not a streamer's, and for what you're getting for the price, it's a great card.The real problem for this card though is the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti. For more than a year after the RTX 3060 Ti hit the scene, it topped our best graphics card list for its spectacular balance of price and performance, punching well above its weight and even outshining the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070.Ever since the crypto bubble popped and Nvidia Lovelace cards started hitting the shelves, the last-gen Nvidia Ampere cards have absolutely plummeted in price, including the RTX 3060 Ti. You can now get the RTX 3060 Ti for well below MSRP, and even though the RTX 4060 outperforms the RTX 3060 by roughly 20%, it still falls short of the RTX 3060 Ti, so if you are able to get an RTX 3060 Ti for near or at the same price as the RTX 4060, it might be a better bet. I haven't seen the RTX 3060 Ti drop that low yet, but it's definitely possible.The reason why the RTX 3060 Ti is competitive here is especially because many of the best features of the RTX 4060 depend on other people implementing Nvidia's DLSS 3 technology in their products. DLSS 3 with Frame Generation is incredible for most games (though there are some latency issues to work out), but the number of games that implement it is rather small at the moment.Many newer games will have it, but as we've seen with the recent controversy over Starfield partnering with AMD, one of the biggest PC games of the year might not have DLSS implemented at all at launch. It's a hard thing to hold against the RTX 4060 as a solid negative, since when the technology is implemented, it works incredibly well. But it's also unavoidable that Nvidia's biggest selling point of this generation of graphics cards is explicitly tied to the cooperation of third-party game developers.With something like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070, DLSS 3 is a nice feature to have, but it doesn't make or break the card. With the RTX 4060, its appeal is deeply tied to whether or not you have this tech available in your games, and it seriously undercuts the card when it isn't. Its non-DLSS performance is only better than the RTX 3060 by a standard gen-on-gen uplift at 1080p, and without DLSS, 1440p gaming is possible, but will be severely hampered by the limited VRAM. 4K gaming, meanwhile, would be out of the question entirely.All that said, the Nvidia RTX 4060 is still going to be one hell of an upgrade for anyone coming from a GTX 1060 or RTX 2060, which is really where this card is trying to find its market. RTX 3060 gamers will honestly be better off just saving up some more money for the RTX 4070 than worrying about the RTX 4060 (and you can probably skip the Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti, honestly).If you're looking for the best cheap graphics card from Nvidia, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 is probably as good as it's going to get for a while, since there have been few - if any - rumblings about an Nvidia RTX 4050 or Nvidia RTX 4050 Ti coming to the budget segment any time soon. Whether it's worth upgrading from an RTX 3060 is debatable, but if money is tight and looking for an upgrade from the Pascal- or Turing-era 60-series cards, you'll absolutely love this card.Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060: Price & availability(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)How much is it? US MSRP $299 (about \u00a3240/AU$450)When is it out? June 29, 2023Where can you get it? Available globallyThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 is available on June 29, 2023, for an MSRP of $299 (about \u00a3240/AU$450), which is about 10% less than the RTX 3060 was when it launched in 2021.There is a caveat to this pricing in that there is no Nvidia Founders Edition of the RTX 4060, so it is only available from third-party partners like Asus, PNY, and others. These manufacturers can charge whatever they want for the card, so you can expect to see many of the cards priced higher than Nvidia's MSRP, but there will be those like the Asus RTX 4060 Dual that I tested for this review that will sell at MSRP.While this card is cheaper than most, it's not the cheapest of the current generation. That would be the AMD Radeon RX 7600, which has an MSRP of $269.99 (about \u00a3215/AU$405), which still offers the best performance-to-price value of any of the current-gen cards. Still, given the actual level of performance you get from the RTX 4060, it definitely offers a compelling value over its rival cards, even if they are cheaper in the end.Today's best Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 deals $334.99View $369.99View $413.59ViewLow StockShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesNvidia GeForce RTX 4060: Features and chipset(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)3rd-gen ray tracing and 4th-gen tensor coresOnly 8GB VRAMDLSS 3 with Frame Generation under $300Swipe to scroll horizontally Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Reference SpecsAsus Dual GeForce RTX 4060 OC Edition SpecsProcess NodeTSMC 5nmTSMC 5nmTransistor Count18.9 billion18.9 billionBoost Clock2,460MHz2,505MHz (default) / 2,535MHz (performance mode)VRAM8GB GDDR68GB GDDR6Memory Bus128-bit128-bitL2 Cache24MB24MBMemory Speed17 Gbps17 GbpsMemory Bandwidth272 GB/s272 GB/sCUDA Cores3,0723,072Ray Tracing Cores2424Tensor Cores9696TGP115115Connector8-pin8-pinOutputs3 x DisplayPort 1.4a, 1 x HDMI 2.1a3 x DisplayPort 1.4a, 1 x HDMI 2.1aIn terms of specs, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 is a marked improvement over the Nvidia RTX 3060 thanks to a smaller TSMC 5nm process node compared to the RTX 3060's 8nm Samsung node. It also features much faster clock speeds, with a roughly 39% faster base and boost clock speed.You also have a faster memory speed, but a smaller VRAM pool and smaller memory bus, so you end up with a roughly 25% smaller memory bandwidth, which really puts a ceiling on higher resolution performance.Still, with faster clock speeds, more mature ray tracing and tensor cores, and a lower TGP than its predecessor, this is one of the most powerful and energy-efficient graphics cards in its class.\u00a0Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060: design(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)There is no reference design for the Nvidia RTX 4060, since there is no Founders Edition, so the design of the card is going to depend entirely on which version you get from which manufacturer.\u00a0In my case, I received the Asus GeForce RTX 4060 Dual OC edition, which features a dual fan design and a much smaller footprint befitting a midrange card. Thankfully, the card uses an 8-pin power connector, so there's no need to fuss with any 12VHPWR adapter cables.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)It comes with the now-standard three DisplayPort 1.4 and one HDMI 2.1 video outputs on this generation of Nvidia cards, so those with one of the best USB-C monitors will once again be out of luck here.The card is a dual-slot width, so you shouldn't have any issues getting it into a case, and it's light enough that you really should be able to get away without having to use a support bracket.Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060: Performance(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)Best-in-class 1080p gaming performanceHuge improvement if coming from RTX 2060 or olderTest system specsThis is the system we used to test the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060:CPU:\u00a0Intel Core i9-13900K\nCPU Cooler:\u00a0Cougar Poseidon GT 360 AIO\nRAM:\u00a064GB Corsair Dominator Platinum RGB DDR5-6600MHz\nMotherboard:\u00a0MSI MAG Z790 Tomahawk Wifi\nSSD:\u00a0Samsung 990 Pro 2TB NVMe M.2 SSD\nPower Supply:\u00a0Corsair AX1000\nCase:\u00a0Praxis WetbenchWhen it comes to 1080p, the Nvidia RTX 4060 offers the best gaming performance under $300.The AMD RX 7600 gives it a run for its money in pure rasterization performance, and even manages to beat out the RTX 4060 on occasion, but once you start cranking up ray tracing the RTX 4060 absolutely pulls away from its rivals.This is especially true when you flip the switch on DLSS, which makes 1440p gaming a very feasible option with this card. While this definitely isn't going to be one of the best 1440p graphics cards, on certain titles with certain settings, you'll be surprised what you can get away with.Synthetic BenchmarksSwipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 Nvidia RTX 4060AMD RX 7600Nvidia RTX 3060Firestrike28,12031,83722,732Nightraid130,102125,313108,208Speedway2,5341,9632,182Port Royal6,0335,5095,156Time Spy10,56310,8198,777Firestrike Extreme13,14214,78010,609Time Spy Extreme4,9495,1474,100Firestrike Ultra5,7097,2515,094Wildlife Extreme20,47418,92817,410Wildlife Extreme Unlimited20,34019,11917,330PassMark 3D23,95622,00820,786Average 1080p Performance79,11178,57565,470Average 1440p Performance8,0688,2686,681Average 4K performance12,86812,61110,983Average Performance24,17423,87920,216When it comes to synthetic benchmarks, you get the typical blow-for-blow between Nvidia and AMD cards that we've seen in the past, with AMD outperforming on pure rasterization tests like 3DMark Time Spy and Firestrike, while Nvidia pulls ahead on ray tracing workloads like Port Royal and Speedway.The RTX 4060 and RX 7600 are close enough in terms of raw performance that it might as well be a wash on average, but it's worth noting that the RTX 4060 is about 20% better on average than the RTX 3060. I point that out mostly to contrast it with the RTX 4060 Ti, which was only about 10-12% better than the RTX 3060 Ti on average.\u00a0A 20% improvement gen-on-gen, on the other hand, is much more respectable and justifies considering the RTX 4060 as an upgrade even with an RTX 3060 in your rig. You might not actually make that jump for an extra 20% performance with this class of GPU, but it's at least worth considering, unlike with the RTX 4060 Ti.Gaming BenchmarksSwipe to scroll horizontallyMax 1080pHeader Cell - Column 0 Nvidia RTX 4060AMD RX 7600Nvidia RTX 3060Metro: Exodus454337F1 2022190168147Total War: Warhammer III848272Cyberpunk 2077798770Returnal858170Where the RTX 4060 really takes off though is in gaming performance. Compared to the RX 7600, it's more or less even when just playing at 1080p with max settings without ray tracing or upscaling. Notably, the RTX 4060 actually underperforms the RX 7600 by about 9% in Cyberpunk 2077 when you're not using ray tracing or upscaling.Swipe to scroll horizontallyMax 1080p, Max Ray TracingHeader Cell - Column 0 Nvidia RTX 4060AMD RX 7600Nvidia RTX 3060Metro: Exodus332727F1 2022767165Cyberpunk 207732830Returnal685355Crank ray tracing up to Psycho in Cyberpunk 2077 though, and the value of the RTX 4060 really starts to show through. The RX 7600 absolutely tanks when RT is maxed, but that's not universal across the board. In other games, the RX 7600 is competitive, but Cyberpunk 2077 really is AMD's Achilles' Heel. Meanwhile, the RTX 3060 holds up fairly well on some titles, while the RTX 4060 pulls ahead by a substantial amount on others.Swipe to scroll horizontallyMax 1080p, Max Ray Tracing, UpscalingHeader Cell - Column 0 Nvidia RTX 4060Nvidia RTX 4060 (DLSS 3 with Frame Generation)AMD Radeon RX 7600Nvidia RTX 3060Cyberpunk 2077 (Quality)59921948Cyberpunk 2077 (Ultra Performance)1131614990Returnal (Quality)64837673Returnal (Ultra Performance)831269895With upscaling turned on, the RTX 4060 manages to substantially outperform both the RTX 3060 and the RX 7600. If you leave the base DLSS settings and don't mess with frame generation, the RTX 4060 pulls off a clean win on Cyberpunk 2077, while it has a slightly lower average framerate than the RTX 3060, but a higher minimum framerate, it's a much more stable experience across the board.Once you turn on frame generation though, things swing dramatically in the RTX 4060's favor. You can even increase the resolution in Cyberpunk 2077 to 1440p with Frame Generation on and you'll get more fps on average and at a minimum than you would with the RTX 3060 at 1080p, while the RX 7600 simply can't keep up at this level.Unfortunately, a lot of this is dependent on developers implementing Nvidia's new technology. Without DLSS 3 with Frame Generation, you still get respectably better performance than the RTX 3060, but nothing that absolutely blows you away.\u00a0Meanwhile, the RX 7600 offers a compelling alternative if you're looking to save some money and don't care about 1440p or ray tracing.Still, if you can toggle a setting and give yourself an extra 50 fps on a demanding game, there really is no comparison, and on this alone, the RTX 4060 wins out by default.Should you buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060?(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)Swipe to scroll horizontallyValueFor a sub-$300 graphics card, the RTX 4060 offers an incredible value.4.5 / 5Features & chipsetThe 8GB VRAM on this card is disappointing, but DLSS 3 at this price and the dramatically lower TGP saves it in a huge way.4.5 / 5DesignThe RTX 4060 gets docked a half point for not having a reference card, but the low TGP means no one needs to use Nvidia's stupid 12VHPWR cable.4.5 / 5PerformanceIn terms of 1080p gaming performance, this card is the best it gets at this price point.5 / 5TotalThe RTX 4060 goes toe-to-toe with the AMD RX 7600, but at a higher price point, the selling point on this card is its best-in-class 1080p performance.

This is separate from the NVK Vulkan driver effort and again ultimately not too useful until the GSP and re-clocking support are sorted out kernel-side.\r Herbst commented in the Mesa MR providing this initial NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 series support:\r\"Seems to just work. The 3D subchannel appears to be identical to Ampere. Nvidia didn't publish the compute class headers yet, so maybe something is up there.\r CTS run looks good enough\r Note: this contains a Cc stable tag, so we get that enablement shipped to users a bit faster.\" A step in the right direction but it will be a while before the Nouveau DRM kernel driver is ready to provide good support for modern NVIDIA GPUs with this open-source driver and most Linux gamers/enthusiasts will also be waiting on the NVK Vulkan driver to get into good shape. For now the Intel and AMD Radeon Linux graphics driver stacks provide the much better open-source experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 Comments \n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\nRelated News\nNVIDIA RTX Remix 1.0 Released With DXVK DLSS4 & Neural Radiance CacheThe New Rust-Written NVIDIA \"NOVA\" Driver Submitted Ahead Of Linux 6.15NVIDIA Is Finding Great Success With Vulkan Machine Learning - Competitive With CUDANVIDIA Vulkan Beta Driver Updated For Blackwell & New ExtensionsNVIDIA 570.124.04 Linux Driver Brings Additional FixesNVIDIA Publishes RTX Neural Texture Compression \"RTXNTC\" Beta\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

As you may recall, the PCI-SIG has been working on a tweaked version of the connection called 12V-6\u00d76 (just rolls off the tongue, don\u2019t it?) that addresses some of the apparent issues with incomplete and potentially unsafe connections. Though the spec is a long, long away from being finalized, some users think they\u2019ve spotted the updated connectors on Nvidia RTX 4070 cards in the wild, and now you can add the RTX 4090 to the list. \nA Reddit user going by \u201cprackprackprack\u201d closely inspecting their new RTX 4090 Founder\u2019s Edition (the first-party version of the GPU made and sold directly from Nvidia) thinks they\u2019re seeing the shortened connector pins first revealed by Igor\u2019s Lab. The post (spotted by Tom\u2019s Hardware) isn\u2019t exactly scientific, but upon casual examination, it sure does look like the pins are shorter than the ones on the standard 12VHPWR connections we\u2019ve seen over the last year. That small tweak in physical design means the connection must be more fully and securely inserted to assure a safe connection, and the card will (presumably) fail to power up if it\u2019s only partially inserted. The connection has the same 600-watt maximum as the older design. \n\n\nActual cases of GPU or power supply damage from overheating or melting 12VHPWR have been relatively few, but they\u2019re frequent and consistent enough to be concerning, especially when owners are spending $1,000 or more on the latest and greatest graphics card. So far Nvidia hasn\u2019t said anything about trying out the updated 12V-6\u00d76 design or implementing the software changes that go along with the tweaked hardware. No third-party cards from manufacturers like Gigabyte or MSI have been spotted with the adjusted connection. \nAs a member of the PCI-SIG, it\u2019s not surprising that Nvidia would work on the 12V-6\u00d76 connector long before it\u2019s finalized. But the company must be very confident in its efficacy \u2014 or extremely concerned about the issues with the 12VHPWR \u2014 if it\u2019s already installing them in cards sold to retail customers. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Michael Crider, Staff Writer, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael is a 10-year veteran of technology journalism, covering everything from Apple to ZTE.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nInflection AI, a new startup found by the former head of deep mind and backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, last week raised $1.3 billion from industry heavyweights in cash and cloud credit. It appears the company will use the money to build a supercomputer cluster powered by as many as 22,000 of Nvidia's H100 compute GPUs, which will have peak theoretical compute power performance that is comparable to that of the Frontier supercomputer.\n\n\"We will be building a cluster of around 22,000 H100s,\" said\u00a0Mustafa Suleyman, the founder of DeepMind and a co-founder of Inflection AI, reports\u00a0Reuters. \"This is approximately three times more compute than what was used to train all of GPT-4. Speed and scale are what's going to really enable us to build a differentiated product.\"\n\nA cluster powered by 22,000 Nvidia H100 compute GPUs is theoretically capable of 1.474 exaflops of FP64 performance \u2014 that's using the Tensor cores. With general FP64 code running on the CUDA cores, the peak throughput is only half as high: 0.737 FP64 exaflops. Meanwhile, the world's fastest supercomputer,\u00a0Frontier, has peak compute performance of 1.813 FP64 exaflops (double that to 3.626 exaflops for matrix operations). That puts the planned new computer at second place for now, though it may drop to fourth after El Capitan and Aurora come fully online.\n\nWhile FP64 performance is important for many scientific workloads, this system will likely be much faster for AI-oriented tasks. The peak FP16/BF16 throughput is 43.5 exaflops, and double that to 87.1 exaflops for FP8 throughput. The Frontier supercomputer powered by 37,888 of AMD's Instinct MI250X has peak BF16/FP16 throughput of 14.5 exaflops.The cost of the cluster is unknown, but keeping in mind that Nvidia's H100 compute GPUs retail for over $30,000 per unit, we expect the GPUs for the cluster to cost hundreds of millions of dollars.\u00a0Add in all the rack servers and other hardware and that would account for most of the $1.3 billion in funding.\n\nInflection AI is currently valuated at around $4 billion, about one year after its foundation. Its only current product is a generational AI chatbot called Pi, short for personal intelligence.\u00a0Pi is designed to serve as an AI-powered\u00a0personal assistant\u00a0with\u00a0generative AI technology\u00a0akin to ChatGPT\u00a0that will support\u00a0planning, scheduling, and\u00a0information gathering.\u00a0This allows Pi to communicate with users via dialogue, making it possible for people to ask queries and offer feedback.\u00a0Among other things, Inflection AI\u00a0has outlined specific user experience objectives for Pi, such as offering emotional support.\n\nAt present, Inflection AI operates a cluster based on\u00a03,584\u00a0Nvidia H100 compute GPUs in Microsoft Azure cloud. The proposed supercomputing cluster would offer roughly six times the performance of the current cloud-based solution.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nMicrosoft\nScience\nCUDA\nCloud Computing\nDeepMind\nChatGPT\nBuild Your Own\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (4)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nFollowing rumors that the U.S. government may ban sales of on high-end compute GPUs to China, the price of of Nvidia's A800 chips on the Chinese market has surged in a big way. The price jumped by a whopping 20% in just two weeks, according to a report from\u00a0DigiTimes.The standard price of Nvidia's\u00a0A800\u00a0compute GPU in the PCIecard form-factor was around CNY90,000 (US$12,400) per unit just two weeks ago. Right now, the price is approaching CNY110,000 (US$15,000) per unit, which is a 20% increase.The issue of inflated chip prices, alongside a pressing shortage of computational power in China, have drawn attention at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference 2023. Acquiring high-end AI chips via official routes in China has become increasingly difficult. And as a result, Chinese technology firms that need computing power have resorted to utilizing cloud computing services provided by companies like Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure. These services are typically used for large language model training tasks, with data centers situated in Singapore or China.Chen Pei, vice president of Vibranium Consulting, stated that leasing cloud GPU computational power is notably costlier than constructing own GPU computing clusters, with prices for large cloud providers hovering around $2 to $3 per hour per GPU. Echoing this, Sun Jin from CloudWalk Technology, a Chinese AI and computer vision firm, disclosed that Chinese companies are often left with no option but to bear the high costs of leasing cloud computing power. This comes despite these costs being 50-100% higher than establishing their own datacenters.However, the ability of Chinese vendors to continue using U.S.-based cloud computing services such as AWS and Azure in the future is uncertain, as this will depend on the regulatory steps taken by the U.S. government, which could involve the necessity for licenses or even a complete ban.\u00a0China's computing industry faces multiple significant challenges, including the time-consuming process of building AI computing clusters, difficulties in procuring high-end AI chips from abroad, and a shortage of domestically produced AI chips, such as Biren's BR104 and BR100. In light of the potential limitations on accessing European and U.S. cloud computing power, there is a rising expectation for Chinese semiconductor manufacturers to focus solely on refining their chip manufacturing processes and to make progressive strides in software innovation.Swipe to scroll horizontallyRow 0 - Cell 0 Biren BR104Nvidia A800Nvidia A100Nvidia H100Form-FactorFHFL CardFHFL Card (?)SXM4SXM5Transistor Count?54.2 billion54.2 billion80 billionNodeN7N7N74NPower300W?400W700WFP32 TFLOPS12813.7 (?)19.560TF32+ TFLOPS256???TF32 TFLOPS?109/218* (?)156/312*500/1000*FP16 TFLOPS?56 (?)78120FP16 TFLOPS Tensor?218/437*312/624*1000/2000*BF16 TFLOPS5122739120BF16 TFLOPS Tensor?218/437*312/624*1000/2000*INT81024???INT8 TFLOPS Tensor?437/874*624/1248*2000/4000*Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nMicrosoft\nScience\nCloud Computing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (0)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock, AMD, Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nUpscaling technology has become the new battleground for GPU makers, with both AMD and Nvidia (oh, and Intel) offering their own options for improving your framerates when playing PC games.For the uninitiated, upscaling technology works by making your graphics card render a game at a lower resolution (1080p, in most cases) before scaling it up - hence the name - to a higher target resolution with no loss of framerate. This lets you get a smoother gameplay experience at 1440p, 4K, and even 8K.Nvidia's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), as the name implies, uses deep-learning AI functionality to provide a highly effective upscaling solution. Over on the red side, AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) notably doesn't use AI, but produces ultimately the same service.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nSure, Nvidia DLSS 4 is incredibly impressive - but AMD's improved upscaling tech could be a real game-changer\n\n\n\n\nI saw Nvidia's new DLSS 4 in action on the RTX 5090 and it's a true game changer \u2013 here's why\n\n\n\nBut which is better? That's what you're here to find out. I should probably mention Intel's upscaling software briefly here too, called XeSS - but that tech is still in its first iteration and only available on a small number of Intel Arc GPUs, so it's not a key competitor in this space just yet. So with the rules of engagement laid out, it's time for DLSS versus FSR!DLSS vs FSR: PerformanceLet's start by talking about the performance boosts offered by Nvidia and AMD's upscaling modes, since that's the main appeal of the technology: better performance in your favorite PC games.Comparing the first two iterations of DLSS and FSR paints a fairly balanced picture: they offer a comparable level of performance boost in games at 1440p and 4K against running the same resolutions without upscaling turned on. Notably, Nvidia tended to lead slightly in ray-traced workloads, so games like Cyberpunk 2077 will run a bit smoother at maximum graphical settings using DLSS.However, Nvidia recently released DLSS 3 for its RTX 4000 GPUs, led by the flagship RTX 4090. The third generation of DLSS is currently only available on Nvidia's latest cards, but it offers a unique new feature: full frame generation.Screenshots hardly do it justice, but it would be remiss of us not to include one of Nvidia's classic 'DLSS ON' comparison shots. (Image credit: Nvidia)This allows your GPU to produce entire frames of gameplay using machine learning and insert them between existing rendered frames, further increasing the framerate. This has an even more marked impact on performance, with some games seeing more than double the framerate at 4K compared to not using DLSS at all.AMD's FSR is currently still only in its second incarnation, and the fact is that FSR 2.0 just can't keep up with DLSS 3. However, Team Red is working on FSR 3.0, and has confirmed that it will feature frame-gen capabilities - but since FSR uses spatial upscaling algorithms instead of AI, there are some concerns.Frame interpolation - the process of producing and inserting these additional frames of gameplay - without AI-powered hardware acceleration poses a risk of added latency. As anyone who plays twitchy shooters like Valorant will tell you, latency is a killer in PC gaming; if AMD can't solve that issue before FSR 3.0 gets a wider release, it could be a serious problem.Winner: DLSSDLSS vs FSR: CompatibilityWithout wanting to beat about the bush, Nvidia loses this round instantly. Not only does DLSS require AI cores (Nvidia calls them Tensor cores) to operate, which means it's only functional on RTX 2000 and newer GPUs, but it's also locked to Nvidia GeForce GPUs specifically, whereas AMD's upscaling option instead uses open-source tech that can run on any graphics card.Every version of FSR - including the upcoming FSR 3.0 - should be able to run on any graphics card, including Nvidia's. There are limits to this, of course. Don't expect to be using FSR on anything older than an RX 570 or GTX 1070, but at least you can run it on hardware more than a couple of years old.The third iteration of AMD's upscaling tech is fast approaching, with FSR 3.0 expected to deliver full frame-gen for any graphics card. (Image credit: Future)DLSS also suffers from generational limits; as I mentioned above, DLSS 3 and its fancy frame-generation tech is currently only available on RTX 4000 cards at present. There has been discussion of DLSS 3 functionality being back-ported to RTX 3000 GPUs, but only the standard upscaling capabilities, not frame-gen. As such, it's an easy win for FSR here.Winner: FSRDLSS vs FSR: Game SupportWith both DLSS and FSR, actual support for using upscaling in games needs to be implemented on the developer's end. In other words, if the people making a game don't take the time to support upscaling, it just won't be an option.Fortunately, both Nvidia and AMD have been throwing money at major game studios to ensure that more new games do come with upscaling support. This sometimes leads to contentious situations, like the reveal that Bethesda's upcoming epic RPG Starfield would not support DLSS 3 due to a partnership with AMD.For the most part, though, both companies are making decent progress with getting upscaling implemented - at least in triple-A games, where the need for DLSS or FSR is more prominent due to typically more demanding hardware requirements compared to indie titles.\u00a0Nvidia routinely blasts out updates for new games that feature DLSS support, like those above. (Image credit: NVIDIA)DLSS is available for just shy of 300 games at the time of writing, while AMD lags behind around the 150 mark - though Nvidia's tech has been on the block for more than two years longer than AMD's competitor, so it's hardly surprising Team Green has the lead. At this point, both companies are adding new compatible games at a similar rate.It's worth noting, however, that since FSR is open-source, it's a little easier for developers to implement. On top of this, DLSS support is broken down generationally; DLSS 3 with frame generation is only supported by around 50 games at the time of writing.If you're willing to mess about with third-party software, a project called Magpie (available on GitHub) lets you run an injector that makes FSR compatible with virtually any game, but even that has its drawbacks. Overall, it's hard to pick a clear winner here; Nvidia has the flat numbers advantage, but until we reach true widespread compatibility with upscaling tech, it's still all to play for.Winner: Tie\u00a0Which one is the best overall?As you might have worked out by now, I'm not going to declare an outright victor here. DLSS is the more widespread option, with better performance and more games supported, but it necessitates an Nvidia GPU and isn't an option for anyone gaming on older hardware.Conversely, AMD was late to the upscaling party with FSR, but has been putting in the work to improve its competing software. I'm hopeful that FSR 3.0 will ensure that Team Red remains competitive against Nvidia in this particular battleground, but until it arrives that's anyone's guess.As for which one you should use - well, it depends on what GPU you've got and what games you want to play! If you're rocking a brand new RTX 4060, you should obviously be taking advantage of DLSS 3 in all the games supporting it, but if you're using an older GPU or any of AMD's best graphics cards, then FSR is probably the way to go.Winner: Tie\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nAMD\nNvidia\n\n\nChristian GuytonSocial Links NavigationEditor, ComputingChristian is TechRadar\u2019s UK-based Computing Editor.

It seems that this is indeed the case, as you all can't stop talking about your feelings towards the 4060 Ti, and we can't stop benchmarking it, so we must all love it.\nDespite our fondness for the RTX 4060 Ti, even we admit that just 8GB of VRAM is not quite enough for a $400 graphics card in mid-2023 [sarcasm is over]; ideally we'd want a minimum of 12GB, with 16GB being the ideal amount of memory for a mid-range GPU. Fortunately, Nvidia has considered this and agrees. They have now released a 16GB model of this GPU, charging a steep $100 premium for an extra 8GB of VRAM that the card should have always had.\n\nBut why did the RTX 4060 Ti initially only come with 8GB of VRAM, and how has Nvidia managed to double that for a total of 16GB? The problem, as it often is, lies in the relatively small 128-bit wide memory bus. GDDR6 memory chips require a 32-bit memory controller, and with a 128-bit bus, that means only four of these chips can be used.\nFor 8GB, Nvidia had to use four double-density 2GB chips. However, to achieve a 16GB capacity, they can't simply use 4GB GDDR6 chips as they don't exist. Instead, they have to use Micron's clamshell configuration, which requires a complete PCB redesign.\n\nThe clamshell configuration allows for the use of two memory modules on a single 32-bit memory controller. However, this configuration doesn't allow all the memory chips to be placed on the front side of the PCB; half the chips must be positioned on the backside, directly adjacent to the chips on the front side, hence the term \"clamshell.\"\nWhen asked why the 16GB version of the 4060 Ti costs $100 more than the standard 8GB model, Nvidia told us that the clamshell method of expanding memory is quite complicated and therefore costly. So, that, coupled with the cost of four additional 2GB chips, is how they arrived at the $100 increase. It seems a little far-fetched to us, but Nvidia is charging $500 for the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB, and that's likely going to be a major problem for this product.\n\nBesides the extra VRAM, there's no other difference between the 8GB and 16GB versions of the RTX 4060 Ti. This is both good and bad. It's good in the sense that they share the same product name, so they should be the same. However, it's bad in the sense that for most of today's games, performance will be the same.\nIdeally, an $400 product like the 8GB RTX 4060 Ti should come with a larger VRAM buffer than what we got 5 years ago on the $380 GTX 1070, for several reasons. Ample VRAM ensures the latest and greatest games run as they should. Many of this year's newly released games, such as The Last of Us Part 1, ran well on 16GB graphics cards like the Radeon RX 6800, while they struggled on 8GB cards.\nThe game has received about a dozen patches now and is in a much better condition. However, the release of unoptimized games is nothing new. It's been happening for decades now and will continue to happen.\n\nThe Last of Us Part 1 1440p Ultra [8GB comparison, patched game]\nIt's also clear that games are moving beyond 8GB of VRAM, as game developers have publicly stated they're tired of optimizing for 8GB cards at the high-end. Future games will view 8GB graphics cards as low-quality 1080p solutions.\nConsequently, buying an expensive graphics card today with just 8GB is almost certainly going to lead to disappointment. We also don't want future games to be held back or limited by 8GB graphics cards. Yes, we want them to work and scale well on 8GB cards, but we also want to see high and ultra settings offering a next-level visual experience with textures that take advantage of 16GB and larger memory buffers.\nTherefore, a 16GB version of the RTX 4060 Ti is a good thing, but pricing remains a big issue. As it stands, Nvidia's most affordable current-generation GPU offering more than 8GB of VRAM costs $500. That's an absurd situation to find ourselves in, in mid-2023.\n\nThe Callisto Protocol 1080p Ultra [8GB vs 16GB]\nInterestingly, Nvidia seems to recognize the shortcomings of the RTX 4060 Ti. They know the 8GB version is a weak offering at $400 \u2013 and they know you know, because you haven't bought it. They also know the 16GB version is a complete joke and likely regret even making it, evidenced by the fact that there was no review program for the 16GB model, official or otherwise.\nThere's no Founders Edition version either, and apart from the official announcement a few months back, Nvidia has made no mention of the 16GB version. It's not just Nvidia who recognizes the product's limitations; their partners are all painfully aware, with some yet to release a 16GB version, and none of them were willing to send us a sample.\n\nResident Evil 4 1080p Max [8GB vs 16GB]\nWe were among the few who ordered one when they went on sale a few days ago. We picked it up on release day and got to testing. Given these circumstances, we've only had a few days to test this thing out, so think of this as more of a preview, though, to be fair, we think we've learned all we needed to with the testing done so far.\nSomething we want to address in this review is the concern that a 128-bit wide memory bus isn't enough to utilize 16GB of VRAM. We've seen this comment a lot over the past few months. We're not sure where it originates or what the exact theory is, but the belief seems to be that there simply isn't enough memory bandwidth to effectively use a 16GB memory buffer.\nSo, let's start by looking at that. All testing in this article has been conducted on our Ryzen 7 7800X3D test system with 32GB of DDR5-6000 memory, using the latest display drivers.\n\nBenchmarks\nHere's a look at The Last of Us Part 1. Using the ultra-quality settings at 1080p, we found the 16GB model to be 16% faster on average, while the 1% lows were boosted by as much as 25%. This resulted in a substantial performance jump, achieving performance similar to the 6700 XT.\n\nThe story is similar at 1440p. Here, the 16GB model was 24% faster on average with a 32% boost to 1% lows, allowing it to closely match the 6700 XT.\n\n\n\nWe examined A Plague Tale: Requiem using the ultra-quality settings but without ray tracing enabled, which doesn't exceed an 8GB VRAM buffer. The outcome was identical performance between the 8 and 16GB models at 1080p. At 1440p, the performance was nearly the same with only a minor frame difference.\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077 was tested using the high-quality preset. Here, the 16GB model provided a modest performance enhancement. Although 1% lows improved by 9%, the average frame rate remained largely consistent.\nThe difference was even smaller at 1440p, where the 16GB model was only 1-2 fps faster.\n\n\nForza Horizon 5 demonstrated identical performance for both models at 1080p and 1440p. Clearly, this title didn't benefit from the extra VRAM. Currently, most games don't demand more than 8GB of VRAM.\n\n\nIn our Resident Evil 4 tests using the second-highest preset, which significantly reduces VRAM usage, both the 8 and 16GB versions of the RTX 4060 Ti delivered comparable performance at both tested resolutions.\n\n\nSpider-Man Remastered showed a slight performance increase with the extra VRAM, enhancing the average frame rate by 5%. However, this difference isn't significant. We observed similar margins at 1440p. While the 16GB model is faster, it isn't by a considerable margin.\nPower Consumption\nThe 16GB RTX 4060 Ti remains power-efficient, as doubling the capacity only increases the TDP by 5 watts. In certain situations, with the extra VRAM, the GPU can work a bit harder, as we noticed in Spider-Man, causing the total system usage to rise by 7%.\n\n\nIn Hitman 3, the extra VRAM didn't lead to any improvement, resulting in a precise 5-watt increase in power usage.\nPerformance Summary\nWe can quickly examine our 15-game average data. The 16GB model is only 4% faster on average. This is expected since most of the games we tested showed no performance alteration.\n\n\nWe observed just a 3% improvement at 1440p. Again, most of the games tested didn't exhibit a significant performance change. Many of the more demanding games were tested with reduced quality settings, ensuring satisfactory performance on more mainstream models.\nWrap Up\nThere you have it, the 16GB buffer certainly works and it does make the RTX 4060 Ti a much better product. We're confident that in the years to come, this version will hold up reasonably well, offering RTX 3070-like performance without the VRAM limitations. Yes, it still has a 128-bit memory bus, but as we saw in the memory-hungry examples, that doesn't prevent the GPU from utilizing the 16GB buffer to evade performance-related issues.\n\nHowever, the real issue with the RTX 4060 Ti is pricing, which applies to both variants. The 8GB model should ideally cost $300 and, ideally, $350 for the 16GB version, or maybe $400 at most \u2013 but that's currently the price of the 8GB version.\nIn other words, paying $500 for what should be the base configuration RTX 4060 Ti is insane.\nIt's also unreasonable that gamers wanting more than 8GB of VRAM from a current generation GeForce GPU must spend $500. Unfortunately, AMD doesn't seem to be coming to the rescue either. The current rumor suggests that the Radeon 7700 XT will offer 12GB and the 7800 XT 16GB, and that both will arrive in September. But pricing won't be great there either, and we don't expect the 7700 XT to be a sub-$500 product, so the current VRAM issue will continue.\n\nAs for the 16GB RTX 4060 Ti, obviously you shouldn't buy it at the current price \u2013 for $400 maybe, but we don't expect it to hit that price any time soon. In the meantime, this 16GB version of the RTX 4060 Ti will provide us with numerous great content opportunities over the next few years. It will be very interesting to monitor how the 8GB and 16GB versions track with future games.\nFor now, though, it's a terribly priced graphics card that you can ignore.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 6700 XT on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 7600 on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 7900 XT on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4090 on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D on Amazon\n\nFurther Testing\nSince we posted this review, we have written new comparisons and run relevant benchmarks you may be interested in:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4060 vs. RTX 4060 Ti: $300 or $400 GPU Upgrade?\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 vs. RTX 4060 Ti 16GB\nGeForce RTX 4060 vs. Radeon RX 7600: $300 GPU Upgrade\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 57\n\n\n Got something to say?

These two brands have retained a firm grip on almost the entire graphics card market for a long while now, and certainly the past few generations \u2013 despite Intel trying to muscle in recently.The highlights of the AMD vs Nvidia battle, if you will, are usually centered around the cards that are the most powerful, and most highly specced \u2013 and, thus, often the most expensive. But the choice and comparisons do continue right down the spectrum into the budget graphics card zone. This was particularly present in the last generation of cards \u2013 which are still available, to a point, and should continue in this gen too. Though we may have to look to the rest of 2023 for those lower-end cards to catch up and be released.The way the best graphics cards on both sides of the divide are now pitched and the particulars about what they offer means that the choice you face is probably less about the two brands than ever before. It\u2019s more about laser-focusing your personal needs and desires, as well as having what you need a GPU for at the forefront of your search too.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nThe best graphics cards for video editing: the best choice for all budgets\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 FE review: the perfect balance between power and price?\n\n\n\nAnd although Steam surveys and data suggest that Nvidia cards are regularly the most popular among gamers, how does the choice between the brands for a creator, like the best graphics card for video editing, fare? We\u2019ll discuss the broad overview of the face-off in this article, beginning with a quickfire comparison.\u00a0AMD vs Nvidia - quick fire pointsIf you\u2019re looking for a quickfire breakdown of the Nvidia vs AMD matchup then these are some broad brush stroke, and salient points.AMD graphics cards:Offer better value for moneyGenerally use less powerAre better for LinuxOften offer more VRAM for your moneyNvidia graphics cards:Get the Creative Bloq NewsletterDaily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Offer the most power and higher levels of performanceAre way better for ray tracingLead the way on 4K gaming and workHave awesome features like DLSS and Framerate GenerationThese are broad points, and everything is a little more nuanced than just a list of headline differences. As you\u2019ll see throughout this comparison, keeping in mind your own specific setup and needs is key to finding who the best is for you.ADM vs Nvidia: Performance(Image credit: Gigabyte)In terms of pure power, getting the highest number of frames per second, and working in the highest resolutions, both Team Green and Team Red present good solutions. The 4K capable cards from Nvidia of the RTX 4080 and 4090 will set you back a whole wodge of cash but are seriously awesome cards, while the RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT from AMD are also excellent for Ultra HD gaming and work. However, what we will add here is that Nvidia does have the edge in ray-tracing demands - more on that below \u2013 so if this is anywhere near the top of your priority list then you may already be leaning towards Team Green.If you\u2019re working and playing in the traditional \u2018sweetspot\u2019 of PC gaming, let\u2019s say, and in a 144op resolution then the mid-range options from both brands are solid. You could get great performance here out of AMD\u2019s RX 6700 series, and this generation\u2019s Nvidia RTX 4070 (and 4070 Ti to an extent) is a brilliant mid-range card. We\u2019d have liked it to be a bit cheaper, offers decent bang for buck value.For those cards specifically aimed at 1080p, and being budget options, then AMD probably has the edge \u2013 it traditionally does at this end of the spectrum. The last generation\u2019s RX 6600 or 6700 series are great here, though Team Green\u2019s RTX 3050 is a fine card too. It\u2019s also worth remembering that Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3060 Ti was probably pound-for-pound the best GPU of the last generation, so if the imminent RTX 4060 Ti \u2013 and the 4060 and expected 4050 - can imitate something like the same success, then Nvidia will have a beautiful option, or options, for both 1080p and 1440p.Both brands also have terrific, specialised cards for creators too. The likes of Nvidia\u2019s Quadro lineup and AMD\u2019s PRO cards are some of the best in the business for those looking to get something without a consumer, gaming focus, but still offering flat-out great power and performance.AMD vs Nvidia: Features(Image credit: NVIDIA)Cards from both brands continue to offer their own features or particular techs that aim to elevate their GPUs above just offering technical prowess. However, Nvidia, in recent generations, has developed more, and has several very attractive proprietary features.The headline one is ray-tracing, of course. This is the real-time lighting and shadow effects that Nvidia cards can offer in games and adds a further level of ultra-realism to worlds and footage. Throw in the likes of DLSS and Frame Generation and gamers and creators are incredibly well catered for as those features deploy AI to increase image quality, and frame count, and even alleviate the pressure on CPUs which might be bottleneck games. Other features like Nvidia Broadcast, the Nvenc video encoder, and the GeForce Experience suite mean that Nvidia graphics cards offer far more than just a component with a certain amount of power.Conversely, AMD\u2019s feature set is \u2018smaller\u2019 but still has benefits. Taking on ray tracing, Team Red\u2019s Ray Accelerators and FSR 2.0 (FidelityFX Super Resolution) are geared toward, well, ray tracing, but also improving things at the 4K-end. It offers a solution whereby focusing on lower resolutions but then deploying upscaling to help you get consistent framerates and visual fidelity. AMD cards also offer great video encoding support as well as Noise Suppression features which are good bonuses.\u00a0AMD vs Nvidia: Price(Image credit: GettyImages)Now, this factor has long been viewed as the defining way to look at the AMD vs Nvidia matchup. Generally speaking, AMD has always priced its graphics card lower than the direct Nvidia competitors, so it could be said that AMD is the \u2018winner\u2019 here; you simply don\u2019t pay as much for AMD\u2019s graphics cards.Especially with two great generations to pick cards from nowadays, you can get superb budget AMD offerings for as little as $200-$250. The cards here will be perfect for working and gaming at 1080p and offer reliable performance, and a bunch of modern features too. Nvidia cards generally don\u2019t get to that price category and come more into their own once you go up the spectrum to those in the mid-range - and the cards that are great for 1440p resolutions and decent at 4K. The new \u2018lower-level\u2019 40-series cards like the 4070 are good offerings here, but AMD fills out the choice you have there too with the likes of the RX 6800.Beyond this, we go into 4K territory and wallet-busting prices. It\u2019s here that the prices of graphics cards, on both sides, can start becoming as much as new PCs or laptops. Nvidia\u2019s RTX 4090 is the most expensive card out there with a price tag north of $1,500, and the RTX 4080 (which is still plenty powerful enough for 4K) is slightly \u2018better value\u2019 but still well into the four-figure zone at more than $1,100. AMDs top-end offering means that Team Red wins on affordability overall again - the Radeon RX 7900 XTX has a retail price of just over $1,000.\u00a0In terms of value for money, this will again return the decision to what you and your setup or work require. It may well be that Nvidia\u2019s exclusive features and ray-tracing offerings mean that those cards are worth the higher price tags; but it might also be that if you\u2019re after just pure graphical, technical performance on a budget, that AMDs Radeon cards are the ones to go for just to maximize the power-to-price ratio.\u00a0AMD vs Nvidia: Which is best?(Image credit: Mike Griggs)As you can see, there really is no one clear 'winner' when it comes to AMD vs Nvidia. It\u2019ll be up to you to decide which card manufacturer offers the best solution for your specific needs.\u00a0However, in the interest of providing you with some firm, take away advice, our broad sentiments are that if you\u2019re on a budget and looking at something in the middle of the spectrum, AMD is likely to offer the better bet; but if you\u2019re looking at the higher-end cards, for gaming, creative work or anything else then Nvidia is\u00a0Returning to a bird\u2019s eye perspective, though: one thing is for sure. As the brands continue to battle it out, this is only good news for us, and the advancements that their cards offer. And with overall levels of performance likely to continue to be as close as ever, then looking to other factors, and crucially your own budget, will help you make the right decision.Why is Nvidia so expensive compared to AMD?This is a common question for consumers when looking at the AMD vs Nvidia battle. There are a few working theories on this but nothing hard and fast, or \u2018confirmed\u2019. It could be because Nvidia deems its graphics cards superior so warrant a higher price, of course, or that the popularity of its cards helps them demand a higher price tag. AMD also has frontline CPUs that bring in lots of revenue, so perhaps this means the brand can squeeze the profit margins and demands of their GPUs. And it\u2019s also no secret that Nvidia has got a couple of recent prices a little wrong by pitching them higher than consumers and experts thought. It\u2019s pertinent to remember, though, more money doesn\u2019t always mean objectively better - and AMDs ability to offer great value is good news for the graphics card market - and us.Is Nvidia better than AMD?This depends on a whole bunch of factors as our article discusses here as there are pros and cons on both sides of the AMD vs Nvidia debate. While the technical gap is closer than ever between the two, other factors like exclusive features (ray tracing, FSR et al), and, ultimately, value play a big part in determining which is \u2018better\u2019. And this will almost always be a subjective \u2018better\u2019 too; your needs and budget will determine which brand\u2019s cards are best for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for reading 5 articles this month* Join now for unlimited accessEnjoy your first month for just \u00a31 / $1 / \u20ac1\n\n\nJoin now\nAlready have an account ?
