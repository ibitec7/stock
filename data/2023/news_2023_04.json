This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.09% gain on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.2%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 4.87%. Prior to today's trading, shares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence had gained 1.27% over the past month. This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 0.98% and lagged the S&P 500's gain of 3.31% in that time.  Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Nvidia as it approaches its next earnings report date. On that day, Nvidia is projected to report earnings of $0.92 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 32.35%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $6.5 billion, down 21.59% from the year-ago period. NVDA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.50 per share and revenue of $29.68 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +34.73% and +10.03%, respectively. It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Nvidia. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook. Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.  Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.83% higher. Nvidia currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). In terms of valuation, Nvidia is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 60.23. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 17.84, which means Nvidia is trading at a premium to the group. Meanwhile, NVDA's PEG ratio is currently 3.44. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Semiconductor - General industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.98 as of yesterday's close. The Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 167, which puts it in the bottom 34% of all 250+ industries.   Story continues The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.To follow NVDA in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nvidia researches and designs semiconductors that accelerate computing time -- most notably GPUs (graphics processing units), originally used for high-end video game graphics and now being applied to train large-language models (LLMs) that ChatGPT runs on.\u00a0\nBut a new breed of computing accelerator is being developed: quantum computing. Nvidia has announced software geared toward quantum computing researchers over the last few years. But does its latest hardware announcement, the DGX Quantum, propel the company into the world of designing quantum computing systems, too?\u00a0\n\nNvidia: the quantum computing company?\nNvidia's DGX Quantum is actually a collaboration with Israeli start-up Quantum Machines, which makes some hardware components for a quantum computing system. Specifically, DGX Quantum features a new Nvidia Grace Hopper GPU paired with an OPX+ from Quantum Machines, a \"quantum control\" unit that orchestrates the operations of a quantum computer. \n\nThe DGX Quantum, an Nvidia Grace Hopper GPU system paired with a Quantum Machines OPX+. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nWhat does that mean? DGX Quantum isn't itself a quantum computer. Rather, it's a component in a quantum computing system, albeit an important one at this early stage of research and development for practical use of quantum computing.\nAccording to Nvidia, a complete quantum computer requires a QPU (quantum computing processor, akin to a CPU or GPU), a system to perform operations on the QPU, a way to measure and record the resulting data, and a way to create and connect multiple QPUs that can operate with each other. \n\n\n\n\n\nQuantum DGX is thus a means to govern the operation of this quantum computer system. And Quantum DGX will also make use of Nvidia's CUDA Quantum software stack, a hybrid platform of classical computing (CPUs and GPUs) and quantum computing (QPUs) that unifies an entire system to make it useful for researchers.\nA growing number of quantum computer operators (like the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Japan), quantum hardware makers IonQ, and start-up software developers (Agnostiq and QMware) have adopted CUDA Quantum in their operations. \u00a0\nThe first deployment of the Quantum DGX hardware, the Israel Quantum Computing Center, is expected by the end of 2023. \u00a0\nA bet on an unknown future\nAt its most basic level, quantum computing is simply a means to further speed up computing times, enabling researchers to experiment with big problems that classical computers can't solve. Accelerated computing is Nvidia's specialty, so dabbling in quantum computing research is a natural fit for the semiconductor company.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as its management told me in a recent conversation, widespread commercialization of quantum computing is still likely many years off. And when it does start to take root, quantum computing will supplement classical computing, not replace it -- much like Nvidia GPUs have accelerated the work traditionally handled by CPUs, not replaced them. Think of quantum computing and the QPUs that power them as another (future) extension of the classical computing work already done up to this point.\u00a0\nAnd given their industry-leading performance, Nvidia GPUs are helping propel this virtuous cycle of using the most advanced technology of today to develop the cutting edge technology of tomorrow.\u00a0\nGiven that quantum computing is in its nascent stage, most investors who want to bet on it would be best suited by sticking to long-term ownership of stocks like Nvidia at this juncture.\n\n\n\nNicholas Rossolillo and his clients have positions in Nvidia.

The tech-focused sell-off was most unkind to the many semiconductor leaders last year. I guess you could say the tech wreck of 2022 really \u201cchipped\u201d away at chip stock valuations!\nIn any case, the ensuing relief rally proved fast and furious for many top chip plays such that nervous dip buyers may not have been able to load up the truck as much as they would have liked.\nTherefore, in this piece, we\u2019ll look at three semiconductor stocks that still boast Strong Buys from Wall Street analysts. As they also have the potential to receive analyst upgrades, the following three names \u2014 NVDA, TSM, and AVGO \u2014 may not be too late to nibble away at.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)\nNvidia is one of the hottest stocks in the market right now. Not even the gravitational force of higher interest rates has been able to keep Nvidia suppressed for too long a duration. As the company continues showcasing its latest and greatest artificial intelligence (AI) innovations, I think it\u2019s tough to bet against the firm, even as its valuation swells to the moon again. Though I wish the stock was much cheaper, it\u2019s hard to be anything but bullish. \nThe company has exposure to plenty of emerging tech fields (think AI and the Metaverse) and will help power new trends that may yet be on our radars. When it comes to such companies that find ways to expand their circle of competencies, a premium multiple can be expected. Just how much of a premium Nvidia deserves right here is the main question on the minds of many forward-focused investors.\n\t\t\n\n\nCurrently, many believe Nvidia can keep delivering as it rides the latest wave of AI innovation. With the generative AI platform Picasso and the cutting-edge hardware featured in advanced supercomputers, there\u2019s a strong appeal in owning a part of NVDA\u2019s generational growth story.\nAs more firms pull the curtain on their AI offerings, it\u2019s conceivable that a significant portion of the market will invest in the latest AI-focused chips. Even at a lofty 159 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, accurately predicting the extent of demand over the next decade remains uncertain. Given this, I do believe Nvidia is one of the \u201cexpensive\u201d stocks that\u2019s worth averaging into over time.\nAlso, HSBC recently rewarded Nvidia stock with a double upgrade, helping power shares to a 2.5% gain on Tuesday. While I\u2019m not a fan of chasing, I do think bullish analysts have no choice but to chase or be left out in the cold.\nWhat is the Price Target for NVDA Stock?\nNvidia stock\u2019s still a Strong Buy, with 29 Buys, seven Holds, and one Sell. The average NVDA stock price target of $286.94 implies 2.7% upside potential.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM)\nFor those feeling woozy by Nvidia\u2019s sky-high multiple, Taiwan Semiconductor stands out as a more palatable value play at this juncture. Shares of TSM trade at just 13.7 times trailing price/earnings, well below the semiconductor industry average of 61.4 times. Though Warren Buffett recently noted that he sees \u201cbetter places\u201d to invest than Taiwan Semi after selling off most of his stake many months ago, I still see many reasons to stay bullish.\n\t\t\n\n\nFirst, Taiwan Semi stock already seems to have ripped the band-aid off amid the chaos hitting the chip space. The stock\u2019s sitting down more than 37% off its all-time high of around $140 and change per share. Though shares have recovered modestly, they\u2019re still in a bit of a rut, with macro headwinds and geopolitical risks weighing heavily. \nSusquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini thinks a sluggish (or L-shaped) semiconductor recovery is \u201cdialed into TSM\u2019s share price.\u201d I think Mr. Hosseini is right.\nSecond, Taiwan Semi still boasts a pretty sizeable moat. The company plans to expand rapidly over time, even in the face of macro headwinds. As the firm continues investing heavily in capacity, it\u2019ll be hard for up-and-coming rivals to catch up. If anything, TSM may be in a spot to pull further ahead on the other side of a potential recession.\nMr. Hosseini thinks top rivals are \u201cyears away\u201d from catching up to the likes of Taiwan Semi. At this rate, I\u2019d argue such rivals may struggle to catch up even in a few years. \nWhat is the Price Target for TSM Stock?\nTaiwan Semi boasts a Strong Buy rating from analysts based on four unanimous Buys. The average TSM stock price target is $118.67, suggesting 36% upside potential from here.\n\t\t\n\n\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nBroadcom is a yield-heavy semiconductor play that\u2019s less than 7% off all-time highs. Indeed, Broadcom stock could be the first of the trio to break through to new heights as investors continue gaining confidence. With a dividend yield that\u2019s still bountiful (near 3%) and intriguing AI offerings of its own, I remain bullish.\nShares of Broadcom are up more than 50% from their May 2022 lows. Looking back, macro fears got a tad out of hand. Though shares aren\u2019t the same bargain as they were several months ago, shares are still attractively valued at 21.3 times trailing price-to-earnings, well below their five-year historical average P/E of 35.4.\nMore recently, Broadcom stock\u2019s been riding high on news of a new chip called Jerich3-AI to help bring together AI networks. Looking ahead, I\u2019d look for Broadcom to add to its AI arsenal as it looks to continue taking advantage of M&A opportunities. Combined with Broadcom\u2019s software push, I view the stock as worthy of further multiple expansion.\nWhat is the Price Target for AVGO Stock?\nEven after the hot run, analysts remain very upbeat about the stock. AVGO has a Strong Buy rating comprised of 14 Buys and three Holds. The average AVGO stock price target of $702.50 implies 10.7% upside potential.\n\nConclusion\nIt may not be too late to buy the chip dip, according to analysts. Currently, TSM stock boasts the most upside potential, with nearly 36% gains expected over the year ahead.\n\t\t\n\n\nDisclosure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\n\n\n FACEBOOK\n\n\n\n\n TWITTER\n\n\n\n\n EMAIL\n\n\n\n\n COPY LINK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNVIDIA NewsMORE  \n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX PRO Comes to Workstations and Servers for Designers, Developers, Data Scientists and Creatives to Build and Collaborate With Agentic AIGlobeNewswire 16m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces DGX Spark and DGX Station Personal AI ComputersGlobeNewswire 18m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces Spectrum-X Photonics, Co-Packaged Optics Networking Switches to Scale AI Factories to Millions of GPUsGlobeNewswire 33m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell Ultra AI Factory Platform Paves Way for Age of AI ReasoningGlobeNewswire 43m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Dynamo Open-Source Library Accelerates and Scales AI Reasoning ModelsGlobeNewswire 1h \n\n\n\nNvidia GTC 2025: Rubin, reasoning, robotics and moreSeeking Alpha 1h \n\n\n\nGeneral Motors and NVIDIA Collaborate on AI for Next-Generation Vehicle Experience and ManufacturingGlobeNewswire 1h \n\n\n\nNVIDIA and Telecom Industry Leaders to Develop AI-Native Wireless Networks for 6GGlobeNewswire 1h \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tStart Trading Futures\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n\n\n\n\nAVGO\n\n\n\n188.96\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-5.54 (-2.85%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t03:17:26 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time AVGO charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA\n\n\n\n116.53\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-3.00 (-2.51%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t03:17:29 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time NVDA charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTSM\n\n\n\n173.56\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-2.68 (-1.52%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t03:17:16 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time TSM charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMORE \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFind News\n\t\t\t\tNews\n\n\n\n\n\nGO\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n            See also:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                - Explore more categories\n            \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

According to Christine Sun, Senior Vice President of Research and Analytics at OrangeTee & Tie, the transaction marks a new record for an HDB resale flat, smashing the previous record of S$1.36 million for a DBSS flat in Bishan.   A large number of million-dollar flats come from Pinnacle@Duxton.   Brokered by Bernice Kang and Dion Kow from ERA, the price psf for the 1,152 sq ft flat is around S$1,205. According to our Researcher database, the flat also holds the record for being the highest price psf for an HDB flat (so far). The record breaking deal comes after last October\u2019s announcement about the Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) model and last December\u2019s cooling measures announcement.  Under the PLH model, new flats launched in prime locations are subjected to various restrictions such as a 10-year Minimum Occupation Period (MOP), a subsidy clawback and an income ceiling for resale buyers, to curb the lottery effect. As for the new cooling measures pertaining to public housing, the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio was lowered to 85% for those taking HDB loans. Sun noted that 82 flats were sold for at least a million dollars last quarter. This was almost on par with the 85 transactions recorded in Q4 2021. \u201cOf the million-dollar transactions, more flats breached the S$1.3 million mark and could soon be breaking the S$1.4 million level.\u201d HDB flats for sale in Pinnacle @ Duxton See all listings   1G Cantonment Road Photo   1G Cantonment Road Singapore 085701 \u00b7 D2 3 2 1,130 sqft $1,400,000 View this listing   1B Cantonment Road Photo   1B Cantonment Road Singapore 085201 \u00b7 D2 3 2 1,033 sqft $1,200,000 View this listing   1B Cantonment Road Photo   1B Cantonment Road Singapore 085201 \u00b7 D2 3 2 1,012 sqft $1,500,000 View this listing   1C Cantonment Road Photo   1C Cantonment Road Singapore 085301 \u00b7 D2 3 2 1,001 sqft $1,328,000 View this listing   1F Cantonment Road Photo   1F Cantonment Road Singapore 085601 \u00b7 D2 3 2 1,033 sqft $1,250,000 View this listing   1E Cantonment Road Photo   1E Cantonment Road Singapore 085501 \u00b7 D2 3 2 1,012 sqft $1,288,000 View this listing   1F Cantonment Road Photo   1F Cantonment Road Singapore 085601 \u00b7 D2 3 3 1,033 sqft $1,250,000 View this listing   1G Cantonment Road Photo   1G Cantonment Road Singapore 085701 \u00b7 D2 3 2 1,000 sqft $1,180,000 View this listing   1C Cantonment Road Photo   1C Cantonment Road Singapore 085301 \u00b7 D2 3 2 1,000 sqft $1,230,000 View this listing   1A Cantonment Road Photo   1A Cantonment Road Singapore 085101 \u00b7 D2  bedroom   3  bathroom   2 1,011 sqft $1,380,000 View this listing Slower price increase in HDB resale flats Despite the record-breaking sale, according to HDB\u2019s flash estimate for Q1 2022, resale prices increased at a slower pace of 2.3% in the last quarter, compared to the 3.4% increase in Q4 2021. Slower price increase in private properties Likewise, given the new round of cooling measures, there has been a slower price increase for private properties. According to URA\u2019s flash estimate for the last quarter, prices increased by 0.4% in Q1 2022, as opposed to 5.0% in Q4 2021.   Story continues While a 4.0% increase was registered for landed properties, there was a decrease of 0.6% for non-landed properties.Breaking down by market segments, the largest decrease was seen for non-landed properties in the RCR at 3.0% (compared to an increase of 6.7% in the previous quarter). Likewise, there was a price drop of 0.5% in the CCR, compared to an increase of 2.7% in the previous quarter. However, a price increase was seen for condos in the OCR, albeit at a slower rate of 1.9%, compared to the previous quarter at 5.7%.Sun attributed the price increase in the OCR to the high demand and lack of new homes in the suburbs, given that there have been very few mega launches in the OCR this year. The number of unsold stock has also been decreasing.\u201cSimilarly for landed properties, prices registered gains of 4 per cent due to a lack of landed housing stock and strong demand.\u201dIn general, property analysts attributed the slowdown to possible reasons such as the cooling measures, Chinese New Year lull period, a cap on the number of household visitors, the Russian-Ukraine conflict, and lack of new launches.Outlook on the property marketNevertheless, they expect sales volume will pick up as social distancing restrictions are relaxed. More launches are lined up in the coming months as well.  The group size has since been increased to 10 people, meaning more house viewings can now be conducted.  \u201cAlthough the market uncertainties caused by the war in Ukraine could persist for some time, any significant price weakness could signal buying opportunities for buyers waiting on the sideline. Hence, any property price weakness may only last for a short period of time,\u201d said Nicholas Mak, Head of Research and Consultancy at ERA.\u201cThe resale and rental markets will also benefit from the easing of restrictions since employment will be expanding across many industries, and more workers will return in the coming months,\u201d added Sun.What do you think of the record-breaking HDB flat sale?

Both offer advanced new features driven by NVIDIA\u2019s global AI revolution a decade ago. Either can power glorious high-def gaming experiences.\nBut the RTX 40 Series takes everything RTX GPUs deliver and turns it up to 11.\n\u201cThink of any current PC gaming workload that includes \u2018future-proofed\u2019 overkill settings, then imagine the RTX 4090 making like Grave Digger and crushing those tests like abandoned cars at a monster truck rally,\u201d writes Ars Technica.\n\nCommon Ground: RTX 30 and 40 Series Features\nThat said, the RTX 30 Series and 40 Series GPUs have a lot in common.\nBoth offer hardware-accelerated ray tracing thanks to specialized RT Cores. They also have AI-enabling Tensor Cores that supercharge graphics. And both come loaded with support for next-generation AI and rendering technologies.\nBut NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 40 Series delivers all this in a simply unmatched way.\nUnveiling the GeForce RTX 40 Series\nUnveiled in September 2022, the RTX 40 Series GPUs consist of four variations: the RTX 4090, RTX 4080, RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 4070.\nAll four are built on NVIDIA\u2019s Ada Lovelace architecture, a significant upgrade over the NVIDIA Ampere architecture used in the RTX 30 Series GPUs.\nTensor and RT Cores Evolution\nWhile both 30 Series and 40 Series GPUs utilize Tensor Cores, Ada\u2019s new fourth-generation Tensor Cores are unbelievably fast, increasing throughput by up to 5x, to 1.4 Tensor-petaflops using the new FP8 Transformer Engine, first introduced in NVIDIA\u2019s Hopper architecture H100 data center GPU.\nNVIDIA made real-time ray tracing a reality with the invention of RT Cores, dedicated processing cores on the GPU designed to tackle performance-intensive ray-tracing workloads.\nStay updated on the latest news, features, and tips for gaming, creating, and streaming with NVIDIA GeForce; check out GeForce News \u2013 the ultimate destination for GeForce enthusiasts.\nAdvanced ray tracing requires computing the impact of many rays striking numerous different material types throughout a scene, creating a sequence of divergent, inefficient workloads for the shaders to calculate the appropriate levels of light, darkness and color while rendering a 3D scene.\nAda\u2019s third-generation RT Cores have up to twice the ray-triangle intersection throughput, increasing RT-TFLOP performance by over 2x vs. Ampere\u2019s best.\nShader Execution Reordering and In-Game Performance\nAnd Ada\u2019s new Shader Execution Reordering technology dynamically reorganizes these previously inefficient workloads into considerably more efficient ones. SER can improve shader performance for ray-tracing operations by up to 3x and in-game frame rates by up to 25%.\nAs a result, 40 Series GPUs excel at real-time ray tracing, delivering unmatched gameplay on the most demanding titles, such as Cyberpunk 2077 that support the technology.\nDLSS 3 and Optical Flow Accelerator\nAda also advances NVIDIA DLSS, which brings advanced deep learning techniques to graphics, massively boosting performance.\nPowered by the new fourth-gen Tensor Cores and Optical Flow Accelerator on GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, DLSS 3 uses AI to create additional high-quality frames.\nAs a result, RTX 40 Series GPUs deliver buttery-smooth gameplay in the latest and greatest PC games.\nEighth-Generation NVIDIA Encoders\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards also feature new eighth-generation NVENC (NVIDIA Encoders) with AV1 encoding, enabling new possibilities for streamers, broadcasters, video callers and creators.\nAV1 is 40% more efficient than H.264. This allows users streaming at 1080p to increase their stream resolution to 1440p while running at the same bitrate and quality.\nRemote workers will be able to communicate more smoothly with colleagues and clients. For creators, the ability to stream high-quality video with reduced bandwidth requirements can enable smoother collaboration and content delivery, allowing for a more efficient creative process.\nCutting-Edge Manufacturing and Efficiency\nRTX 40 Series GPUs are also built at the absolute cutting edge, with a custom TSMC 4N process.

Applying AI to Biodiversity Conservation, Sustainable Agriculture\nTo protect endangered species, camera-enabled edge AI devices embedded in the environment or on drones can help scientists observe animals in the wild, monitoring their populations and detecting threats from predators and poachers.\nConservation AI, a U.K.-based nonprofit, has deployed 70+ cameras around the world powered by NVIDIA Jetson modules for edge AI. Together with the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, the Conservation AI platform can identify species of interest from footage in just four seconds \u2014 and help conservationists detect poachers and rapidly intervene. Another research team developed an NVIDIA Jetson-based solution to monitor endangered black rhinos in Namibia using drone-based AI.\nAn aerial view of a rhino, observed via drone. IMAGE CREDIT: WildTrack.\nAnd artist Sofia Crespo raised awareness for critically endangered plants and animals through a generative AI art display at Times Square, using generative adversarial networks trained on NVIDIA GPUs to create high-resolution visuals representing relatively unknown species.\nIn the field of agriculture, Bay Area startup Verdant and smart tractor company Monarch Tractor are developing AI to support sustainable farming practices, including precision spraying to reduce the use of herbicides.\n2. Powering Renewable Energy Research\nNVIDIA AI and high performance computing are advancing nearly every field of renewable energy research.\nOpen Climate Fix, a nonprofit product lab and member of the NVIDIA Inception program for startups, is developing AI models that can help predict cloud cover over solar panels \u2014 helping electric grid operators determine how much solar energy can be generated that day to help meet customers\u2019 power needs. Startups Utilidata and Anuranet are developing AI-enabled electric meters using NVIDIA Jetson to enable a more energy efficient, resilient grid.\nSiemens Gamesa Renewable Energy is working with NVIDIA to create physics-informed digital twins of wind farms using NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA Modulus. U.K. company Zenotech used cloud-based GPUs to accurately simulate the likely energy output of a wind farm\u2019s 140 turbines. And Gigastack, a consortium-led project, is using Omniverse to build a proof of concept for a wind farm that will turn water into hydrogen fuel.\n\nResearchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory achieved a breakthrough in fusion energy using HPC simulations running on Sierra, the world\u2019s sixth-fastest HPC system, which has 17,280 NVIDIA GPUs. And the U.K.\u2019s Atomic Energy Authority is testing the NVIDIA Omniverse simulation platform to design a fusion energy power plant.\n3. Accelerating Climate Models, Weather Visualizations\nAccurately modeling the atmosphere is critical to predicting climate change in the coming decades.\nTo better predict extreme weather events, NVIDIA created FourCastNet, a physics-ML model that can forecast the precise path of catastrophic atmospheric rivers a full week in advance.\n\nUsing Omniverse, NVIDIA and Lockheed Martin are building an AI-powered digital twin for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that could significantly reduce the amount of time necessary to generate complex weather visualizations.\nAn initiative from Northwestern University and Argonne National Laboratory researchers is instead taking a hyper-local approach, using NVIDIA Jetson-powered devices to better understand wildfires, urban heat islands and the effect of climate on crops.\n4. Managing Environmental Disasters With Satellite Data\nWhen it\u2019s difficult to gauge a situation from the ground, satellite data provides a powerful vantage point to monitor and manage climate disasters.\nNVIDIA is working with the United Nations Satellite Centre to apply AI to the organization\u2019s satellite imagery technology infrastructure, an initiative that will provide humanitarian teams with near-real-time insights about floods, wildfires and other climate-related disasters.\nA methane leak detected by Orbital Sidekick technology.\nNVIDIA Inception member Masterful AI has developed machine learning tools that can detect climate risks from satellite and drone feeds. The model has been used to identify rusted transformers that could spark a wildfire and improve damage assessments after hurricanes.\nSan Francisco-based Inception startup Orbital Sidekick operates satellites that collect hyperspectral intelligence \u2014 information from across the electromagnetic spectrum. Its NVIDIA Jetson-powered AI solution can detect hydrocarbon or gas leaks from this data, helping reduce the risk of leaks becoming serious crises.\n5. Advancing Energy-Efficient Computing\u00a0\nOn its own, adopting NVIDIA tech is already a green choice: If every CPU-only server running AI and HPC worldwide switched to a GPU-accelerated system, the world could save around 20 trillion watt-hours of energy a year, equivalent to the electricity requirements of nearly 2 million U.S. homes.\nNVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip\nSemiconductor leaders are integrating the NVIDIA cuLitho software library to accelerate the time to market and boost the energy efficiency of computational lithography, the process of designing and manufacturing next-generation chips. And the NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip \u2014 which scored 2x performance gains over comparable x86 processors in tests \u2014 can help data centers slash their power bills by up to half.\nIn the most recent MLPerf inference benchmark for AI performance, the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin system-on-module achieved gains of up to 63% in energy efficiency, supplying AI inference at low power levels, including on battery-powered systems.\nNVIDIA last year introduced a liquid-cooled NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU, which Equinix evaluated for use in its data centers. Both companies found that a data center using liquid cooling could run the same workloads as an air-cooled facility while using around 30% less energy.\nBonus: Robot-Assisted Recycling on the AI Podcast\nStartup EverestLabs developed RecycleOS, an AI software and robotics solution that helps recycling facilities around the world recover an average of 25-40% more waste, ensuring fewer recyclable materials end up in landfills. The company\u2019s founder and CEO talked about its tech on the NVIDIA AI Podcast:\n\nThe AI Podcast \u00b7 Doing the Best They Can: EverestLabs Ensures Fewer Recyclables Go to Landfills \u2013 Ep. 184\nLearn more about green computing, and about NVIDIA-accelerated applications in climate and energy. Discover how AI is powering the future of clean energy.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Robotics | SupercomputingTags: Agriculture and Food | Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Digital Twin | Energy | Inception | Omniverse | Science | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\n\n\n\nIf you own an Nvidia graphics card, whether it's one of the best graphics cards today or an older model, you'll want to make sure you keep it up to date. To do that, you'll need to check for new drivers periodically and update to the latest.\n\nNvidia frequently issues new drivers, which can introduce new functionality, optimize for existing and newly released games and keep the GPU running as smoothly as possible. Having the latest Nvidia driver can make the difference between your favorite game running very well and running its best.\n\nThere are two main ways to update your Nvidia drivers: using Nvidia's GeForce Experience software, or going to Nvidia's driver download page. We'll go over both in this how-to. Those who like to decide when to update solely on their own and don't care about Nvidia's overlays, Ansel photo features or optimized game settings may want to update on their own.\n\nIf you're installing Nvidia's drivers for the first time, you should first uninstall old GPU drivers from AMD or Intel. You can use software like Display Driver Uninstaller to make sure you get rid of anything leftover from previous builds.\n\nHere's how to update your Nvidia GPU drivers:Updating Nvidia Drivers with GeForce ExperienceThis is the method I typically use. Nvidia's GeForce Experience is the easiest way to keep your Nvidia GPU drivers up to date.\n\n1. Download and Install Nvidia GeForce Experience\n\nTo do this, you'll need to install the GeForce Experience software, which you can get directly from Nvidia here. Follow the prompts and install the software. You'll also need to create an account, which is one of the biggest downsides to GeForce Experience \u2014 AMD doesn't require this in its Radeon software.\n\nSometimes, GeForce Experience may give you a notification that new drivers are ready, which will bring you straight to the download page. It looks like this:(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)But if you want to check manually, continue on.2. Go to the Drivers tab in the top right corner of the app.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)3. Click \"Check for Updates.\" If an update is already queued up, skip this step.4. Click \"Download\" next to the update.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)5. Choose your installation type. For most people, \"Express Installation\" is the way to go. Custom installation will let you choose to remove certain components, like the audio driver, USB-C driver or PhysX System Software, as well as clean install.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The driver will install. Just wait out. This only takes a few minutes.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)When you're done, you'll get a confirmation. You can safely click close. You should restart your PC.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Updating Nvidia GPU Drivers ManuallyIf you don't want the other features that come with GeForce Experience, or perhaps you just don't want to make a login, you can still update your Nvidia GPU's drivers. The other primary way to do this is by going straight to Nvidia's Download Drivers site.\n\n1. Go to Nvidia's driver download page here.2. Fill out the dropdowns to match your graphics card.

Flagship GeForce RTX 4090 is a monster GPU that speaks to the carnal cravings of every PCMR member, yet when reality kicks in, few among us can consider splashing out \u00a32k, even on the best graphics card. There needs to be a more viable choice for us regular folk, and now there is; it\u2019s called GeForce RTX 4070.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Founders Edition\n\u00a3589 / $599\n\n\n\nPros\n\nExcellent efficiency\nSmall and beautifully built\nKeeps cool and quiet\nGreat for 1440p gaming\nDLSS 3 works wonders\n\n\n\nCons\n\nOnly 12GB memory\nLacks raster firepower\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy at Amazon\n\n\n\nClub386 may earn an affiliate commission when you purchase products through links on our site.How we test and review products.\n\n\nArriving as the latest instalment to the growing RTX 40 Series range, RTX 4070 represents, above all else, a sense that things are returning to normal. For starters, a \u00a3589 / $599 price tag, taking into account soaring inflation, is about what we\u2019d expect to pay for an x70 solution in 2023. Stock is intended to be readily available at launch, and in contrast to the chaotic consumer experience of recent years, RTX 4070 feels simple, safe and sedate. And that\u2019s a good thing.\nThe mining boom is over, overpriced cards are sat on store shelves as opposed to being met by feverish demand, and with PC sales appearing relatively weak following unprecedented pandemic-fuelled highs, you can now casually walk into a store (they do still exist, keyboard warriors) and buy a graphics card without queueing, searching for stock, or paying vastly over the odds. Good times ahead.\n\n\nMany will also appreciate the fact that RTX 4070 has the profile of a regular graphics card. Measuring 245mm x 112mm x 41mm in size and tipping the scales at 1,022g, it harks back to a time before gargantuan cards became the norm. Compared to recent monstrosities, 4070 is an itty-bitty thing; it is 22mm shorter than ageing RTX 3070 Ti, suitably rigid throughout, and petite enough not to overhang a regular ATX motherboard.\nThe reference Founders Edition, as you would expect, is beautifully constructed from die-cast aluminium, with fewer seams and larger axial fans said to offer a 20 per cent increase in airflow over previous generations. A single 12VHPWR connector supplies the juice \u2013 GPU and memory power delivery is managed by a 6+2-phase configuration \u2013 and if you\u2019ve not yet upgraded your PSU, a two-way splitter is included in the box.\nPutting RTX 4080 alongside RTX 4070 invokes memories of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito in Twins; they may belong to the same family, but you wouldn\u2019t know it going purely by bulk or physical form. Strictly a dual-slot solution, RTX 4070 bodes well for small-form-factor enthusiasts who have patiently awaited a card that will fit.\n\nSizing is right and pricing is admissible, however such slimming down does introduce significant curtailment of the underlying GPU. In an effort to keep good distance between the newcomer and RTX 4070 Ti, Nvidia has cleaved specifications dramatically. While the underlying AD104 die may sound familiar, it is re-engineered to serve as a mid-range proposition, and to the frustration of performance purists, the cuts run deep.\nRTX 40 Series: from $1,599 to $599\nWielding the axe with venom, Nvidia slashes AD104\u2019s streaming multiprocessor (SM) count from a maximum of 60 to just 46, and that near-25 per cent reduction translates to relatively lightweight numbers across the board. 5,888 CUDA cores are far removed from the 16,384 availed to RTX 4090, and remember, the head honcho isn\u2019t even a full implementation. Let\u2019s break out the Club386 Table of DoomTM to see how RTX 40 Series has taken shape.\nGeForce RTX409040804070 TI40703090 Ti3080 Ti308012GB3070 TiLaunch dateOct 2022Nov 2022Jan 2023Apr 2023Mar 2022Jun 2021Jan 2022Jun 2021CodenameAD102AD103AD104AD104GA102GA102GA102GA104ArchitectureAdaAdaAdaAdaAmpereAmpereAmpereAmpereProcess (nm)44448888Transistors (bn)76.345.935.835.828.328.328.317.4Die size (mm2)608.5378.6294.5294.5628.4628.4628.4392.5SMs128 of 14476 of 8060 of 6046 of 6084 of 8480 of 8470 of 8448 of 48CUDA cores16,3849,7287,6805,88810,75210,2408,9606,144Boost clock (MHz)2,5202,5052,6102,4751,8601,6651,7101,770Peak FP32 TFLOPS82.648.740.129.140.034.130.621.7RT cores12876604684807048RT TFLOPS191.0112.792.767.478.166.659.942.4Tensor cores512304240184336320280192ROPs17611280641121129696Texture units512304240184336320280192Memory size (GB)241612122412128Memory typeGDDR6XGDDR6XGDDR6XGDDR6XGDDR6XGDDR6XGDDR6XGDDR6XMemory bus (bits)384256192192384384384256Memory clock (Gbps)2122.4212121191919Bandwidth (GB/s)1,0087175045041,008912912608L1 cache (MB)169.57.55.810.5108.86L2 cache (MB)726448366664Power (watts)450320285200450350350290Launch MSRP ($)1,5991,1997995991,9991,199799599\nNvidia\u2019s desire to maintain explicit differentiation between the two RTX 4070 models is reflected in boost clock. Not only does the non-Ti part carry fewer cores, they are also downclocked to 2,475MHz, eliminating any risk of encroaching on Ti territory. Had this part been branded as RTX 4060 Ti, we doubt many eyebrows would be raised.\nDespite hefty cutbacks, superior scaling afforded by a 4nm manufacturing process allows RTX 4070 to effectively match RTX 3080 12GB in terms of peak teraflops, and with the added smarts of a newer, leaner and more capable architecture, we imagine even RTX 3080 Ti will be in the firing line. 184 fourth-generation Tensor cores and 46 third-generation RT cores are marketed as key upgrades, as is AV1 hardware encoding, and DLSS frame generation will play a key part in realising Nvidia\u2019s promise of over 100fps at 1440p in modern games.\n\nAD104 repositioned with the odd nip and tuck\n504GB/s memory bandwidth is retained through 12GB of GDDR6X at 21Gbps via a 192-bit bus, which while to be expected, does raise question marks over long-term viability. Nvidia will argue a significant uptick in L2 cache \u2013 36MB for RTX 4070 vs. 4MB for RTX 3070 Ti \u2013 reduces the need to spool out to memory on a frequent basis, yet given how poorly optimised PC games can be, greater headroom would afford extra peace of mind. It didn\u2019t take long for 8GB on RTX 3070 Ti or even 10GB on the original RTX 3080 to feel insufficient, and we\u2019d much prefer 16GB as the minimum for this generation of RTX x70 Series card.\nPerusing overall specifications suggests RTX 4070 is unlikely to dazzle in terms of pure rasterisation. Rather, it is in the efficiency stakes the GPU is destined to shine. Nvidia attaches a TGP (total graphics power) of 200W, but a 30 per cent decrease over RTX 3070 Ti tells only part of the story. In instances where the CPU becomes a bottleneck, or GPU workload is light, average gaming power draw is said to drop to 186W. Ada\u2019s efficiency has already proven to be class-leading, and as we\u2019ll demonstrate in our testing, RTX 4070\u2019s real-world effectiveness is rather impressive indeed.\nThere isn\u2019t a great deal else to dissect \u2013 specifications are in line with our expectations of what is a pared-back RTX 4070 Ti \u2013 yet the \u00a3589 / $599 price tag will be debated until the cows come home. Nvidia will make the case for RTX 3080-like performance for less. Enthusiasts will look to a 294.5mm2 die and argue this is an x60-class product masquerading as a premium part. There\u2019s merit to both arguments, but Nvidia\u2019s extraordinary valuation is testament to the company\u2019s ability to convince the market.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether we like it or not, the correct price is the one consumers are deemed willing to pay. The nickname Team Green has multiple connotations, and though there are occasional missteps \u2013 ill-fated RTX 4080 12GB at $899 remains fresh in our memories \u2013 $599 is the figure at which Nvidia expects RTX 4070 to sell in good numbers. Do remember MSRP merely represents a starting point. While the Founders Edition hogs the limelight today, dearer partner cards will arrive tomorrow alongside less attractive fees. You just know there\u2019ll be a Dog Tricks RGB Extreme Edition that\u2019s no faster, much larger, and priced irrationally at $699+.\nWe\u2019re just about ready to share all-important benchmarks, but before we do, a recap on all that\u2019s new with Ada Lovelace architecture.\nAda Optimisations\nWhile a shift to a smaller node affords more transistor firepower, such a move typically precludes sweeping changes to architecture. Optimisations and resourcefulness are order of the day, and the huge computational demands of raytracing are such that raw horsepower derived from a 3x increase in transistor budget isn\u2019t enough; something else is needed, and Ada Lovelace brings a few neat tricks to the table.\nNvidia often refers to raytracing as a relatively new technology, stressing that good ol\u2019 fashioned rasterisation has been through wave after wave of optimisation, and such refinement is actively being engineered for RT and Tensor cores. There\u2019s plenty of opportunity where low-hanging fruit is yet to be picked.\nShader Execution Reordering\nShaders have been running efficiently for years, whereby one instruction is executed in parallel across multiple threads. You may know it as SIMT.\nRaytracing, however, throws a spanner in those smooth works, as while pixels in a rasterised triangle lend themselves to running concurrently, keeping all lanes occupied, secondary rays are divergent by nature and the scattergun approach of hitting different areas of a scene leads to massive inefficiency through idle lanes.\n\nAda\u2019s fix, dubbed Shader Execution Reordering (SER), is a new stage in the raytracing pipeline tasked with scanning individual rays on the fly and grouping them together. The result, going by Nvidia\u2019s internal numbers, is a 2x improvement in raytracing performance in scenes with high levels of divergence.\nNvidia portentously claims SER is \u201cas big an innovation as out-of-order execution was for CPUs.\u201d A bold statement and there is a proviso in that Shader Execution Reordering is an extension of Microsoft\u2019s DXR APIs, meaning it us up to developers to implement and optimise SER in games.\nThere\u2019s no harm in having the tools, mind, and Nvidia is quickly discovering that what works for rasterisation can evidently be made to work for RT.\nUpgraded RT Cores\nIn the rasterisation world, geometry bottlenecks are alleviated through mesh shaders. In a similar vein, displaced micro-meshes aim to echo such improvements in raytracing.\n\n\u201cThe era of brute-force graphics rendering is over\u201d\nBryan Catanzaro, Nvidia VP of applied deep learning research\nWith Ampere, the Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) was forced to contain every single triangle in the scene, ready for the RT core to sample. Ada, in contrast, can evaluate meshes within the RT core, identifying a base triangle prior to tessellation in an effort to drastically reduce storage requirements.\nA smaller, compressed BVH has the potential to enable greater detail in raytraced scenes with less impact on memory. Having to insert only the base triangles, BVH build times are improved by an order of magnitude and data sizes shrink significantly, helping reduce CPU overhead.\nThe sheer complexity of raytracing is such that eliminating unnecessary shader work has never been more important. To that end, an Opacity Micromap Engine has also been added to Ada\u2019s RT core to reduce the amount of information going back and forth to shaders.\n\nIn the common leaf example, developers place the texture of foliage within a rectangle and use opaque polygons to determine the leaf\u2019s position. A way to construct entire trees efficiently, yet with Ampere the RT core lacked this basic ability, with all rays passed back to the shader to determine which areas are opaque, transparent, or unknown. Ada\u2019s Opacity Micromap Engine can identify all the opaque and transparent polygons without invoking any shader code, resulting in 2x faster alpha traversal performance in certain applications.\nThese two new hardware units make the third-generation RT core more capable than ever before \u2013 TFLOPS per RT core has risen by ~65 per cent between generations \u2013 yet all this isn\u2019t enough to back up Nvidia\u2019s claims of Ada Lovelace delivering up to 4x the performance of the previous generation. For that, Team Green continues to rely on AI.\nDLSS 3\nSince 2019, Deep Learning Super Sampling has played a vital role in GeForce GPU development. Nvidia\u2019s commitment to the tech is best expressed by Bryan Catanzaro, VP of applied deep learning research, who states with no uncertainty that \u201cthe era of brute-force graphics rendering is over.\u201d\nThird-generation DLSS, deemed a \u201ctotal revolution in neural graphics,\u201d expands upon DLSS Super Resolution\u2019s AI-trained upscaling by employing optical flow estimation to generate entire frames. Through a combination of DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Frame Generation, Nvidia reckons DLSS 3 can now reconstruct seven-eighths of a game\u2019s total displayed pixels, to dramatically increase performance and smoothness.\nGenerating so much on-screen content without invoking the shader pipeline would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. It is a remarkable change of direction, but those magic extra frames aren\u2019t conjured from thin air. DLSS 3 takes four inputs \u2013 two sequential in-game frames, an optical flow field and engine data such as motion vectors and depth buffers \u2013 to create and insert synthesised frames between working frames.\nIn order to capture the required information, Ada\u2019s Optical Flow Accelerator is capable of up to 300 TeraOPS (TOPS) of optical-flow work, and that 2x speed increase over Ampere is viewed as vital in generating accurate frames without artifacts.\n\nThe real-world benefit of AI-generated frames is most keenly felt in games that are CPU bound, where DLSS Super Resolution can typically do little to help. Nvidia\u2019s preferred example is Microsoft Flight Simulator, whose vast draw distances inevitably force a CPU bottleneck. Internal data suggests DLSS 3 Frame Generation can boost Flight Sim performance by as much as 2x.\nDo note, also, that Frame Generation and Super Resolution can be implemented independently by developers. In an ideal world, gamers will have the choice of turning the former on/off, while being able to adjust the latter via a choice of quality settings.\nMore demanding AI workloads naturally warrant faster Tensor Cores, and Ada obliges by imbuing the FP8 Transformer Engine from HPC-optimised Hopper. Peak FP16 Tensor teraflops performance is already doubled from 320 on Ampere to 661 on Ada, but with added support for FP8, RTX 4090 can deliver a theoretical 1.3 petaflops of Tensor processing.\nPlenty of bombast, yet won\u2019t such processing result in an unwanted hike in latency? Such concerns are genuine; Nvidia has taken the decision to make Reflex a mandatory requirement for DLSS 3 implementation.\nDesigned to bypass the traditional render queue, Reflex synchronises CPU and GPU workloads for optimal responsiveness and up to a 2x reduction in latency. Ada optimisations and in particular Reflex are key in keeping DLSS 3 latency down to DLSS 2 levels, but as with so much that is DLSS related, success is predicated on the assumption developers will jump through the relevant hoops. In this case, Reflex markers must be added to code, allowing the game engine to feed back the data required to coordinate both CPU and GPU.\nGiven the often-sketchy state of PC game development, gamers are right to be cautious when the onus is placed in the hands of devs, and there is another caveat in that DLSS tech is becoming increasingly fragmented between generations. \nDLSS 3 now represents a superset of three core technologies: Frame Generation (exclusive to RTX 40 Series), Super Resolution (RTX 20/30/40 Series), and Reflex (any GeForce GPU since the 900 Series). Nvidia has no immediate plans to backport Frame Generation to slower Ampere cards.\n8th Generation NVENC\nLast but not least, Ada Lovelace is wise not to overlook the soaring popularity of game streaming, both during and after the pandemic.\nBuilding upon Ampere\u2019s support for AV1 decoding, Ada adds hardware encoding, improving H.264 efficiency to the tune of 40 per cent. This, says Nvidia, allows streamers to bump their stream resolution to 1440p while maintaining the same bitrate.\nAV1 support also bodes well for professional apps \u2013 DaVinci Resolve is among the first to announce compatibility \u2013 and Nvidia extends this potential on high-end RTX 40 Series GPUs by including up to two 8th Gen NVENC encoders (enabling 8K60 capture and 2x quicker exports) as well as a 5th Gen NVDEC decoder as standard.\nPerformance\n\nOur 5950X Test PCs\nClub386 carefully chooses each component in a test bench to best suit the review at hand. When you view our benchmarks, you\u2019re not just getting an opinion, but the results of rigorous testing carried out using hardware we trust.\nShop Club386 test platform components:\nCPU:\u00a0AMD Ryzen 9 5950XMotherboard:\u00a0Asus ROG X570 Crosshair VIII FormulaCooler:\u00a0Corsair Hydro Series H150i Pro RGBMemory:\u00a032GB G.Skill Trident Z Neo DDR4Storage:\u00a02TB Corsair MP600 SSDPSU:\u00a0be quiet!

RTX 4070 is nearly 20 per cent slower than RTX 4070 Ti in the synthetic 3DMark tests.\nThe numbers represent a modest upgrade over RTX 3070 Ti, yet the GeForce falls short of Radeon RX 6800 XT, a GPU that dates right the way back to 2020.\n\nEvery current-gen card surpasses the 97 per cent pass mark in 3DMark\u2019s Stress Test with consummate ease. The trim RTX 4070 Founders Edition has no issue maintaining stable frequencies during lengthy gaming sessions.\n\n\n\nModern graphics cards are rarely measured through pure rasterisation alone. GeForce RTX 4070 delivers more than double the performance of Radeon RX 6800 XT in raytracing, and is snapping at the heels of RTX 3080 Ti.\nExcuse the low scores for RDNA 3 in the Mesh Shader test; this appears to have been fixed with a driver update and we\u2019ll re-test said cards asap.\nAssassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla\n\n\n\nIn excess of 100fps at 1440p is Nvidia\u2019s target. GeForce RTX 4070 manages to deliver exactly that in Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, but then so too does Radeon RX 6800 XT. Hardly riveting stuff.\nCyberpunk 2077\n\n\n\nAdd raytracing to the mix and it becomes clear RTX 4070 and RX 6800 XT are cut from different cloths. Heck, even RX 7900 XT slips behind the GeForce at a QHD resolution.\nFar Cry 6\n\n\n\nFar Cry 6 with RT and high-res textures remains a useful test insofar as it helps weed out GPUs with inferior memory configurations. 8GB GeForce RTX 3070 Ti is left hanging its head in shame. One has to wonder when/if 12GB cards will suffer a similar fate.\nFinal Fantasy XIV: Endwalker\n\n\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, a game relying heavily on rasterisation, shows RTX 4070 to be practically identical to RX 6800 XT. Given the GeForce is better equipped with regards to raytracing and just as quick everywhere else, last-gen equivalents at this price point are rendered moot.\nForza Horizon 5\n\n\n\nWe see RTX 3080 Ti-like performance in Forza Horizon 5. Nothing groundbreaking, but decent enough for a $599 GPU. Gamers looking to bag a bargain should also make note of Radeon RX 6950 XT. The older part may lack modern niceties, and is particularly thirsty on power, yet delivers a significant performance punch and is often available on sale for under $700 while stocks last. Food for thought.\nTom Clancy\u2019s Rainbow Six Extraction\n\n\n\nLook at it another way, if your budget extends to 600 bucks and not a penny more, it\u2019s a choice of Radeon RX 6800 XT, GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, or GeForce RTX 4070. Only one winner in that contest.\nPower, Temps and Noise\n\nRTX 4070 can be deemed a sideward step with regards to in-game performance, yet make no mistake, it excels in efficiency. System-wide power consumption of 336 watts, with 16-core Ryzen processor in tow, is astonishing. Nvidia officially recommends a minimum 650W PSU, but even that seems overkill. Excellent news for the \u2018leccy bill.\n\nModest power naturally translates to low temps. Our sample breezes past the official 2,475MHz boost clock, averaging 2,805MHz while gaming, and core temperature never exceeds 62\u00b0C.\n\nBetter still, fan speed tops out a mere 30 per cent (~1,400RPM) inside our real-world test system. The card is quiet at all times, and though it\u2019s hard to judge from a sample of one, coil whine appears much improved over last-gen equivalents.\nRelative Performance, Efficiency and Value\n\nEvaluating relative performance across all benchmarked games reveals Nvidia is doing a fine job of segmentation. RTX 4080 offers 83 per cent of blistering RTX 4090 performance, RTX 4070 Ti lowers the bar to 71 per cent, and now RTX 4070 regular brings up the rear at 64 per cent. It would be logical to assume the first RTX 4060 part will deliver roughly half the top dog\u2019s performance.\n\nWe alluded to energy efficiency being a strong point, and here\u2019s the proof. Dividing average framerate by system-wide power consumption confirms our rig runs optimally with GeForce RTX 4070 at the helm. Note the chart-topping score only takes into account \u2018real\u2019 frames; Nvidia\u2019s lead would extend further with AI-generated frames added to the equation.\n\nDividing average framerate by each GPU\u2019s MSRP helps shed light on how much RTX 4070 ought to cost. In a market muddled by the events of recent years, Nvidia easily tops the chart at $599. Dropping that figure to $499 would return a score of 1.46, eclipsing everything else out there; Team Green evidently doesn\u2019t feel the need to go that low just yet.\nOverclocking\n\nSeeing as RTX 4070 is effectively a diminished and downclocked RTX 4070 Ti, there\u2019s likely to be a decent amount of headroom to play with. Using the automated scanner built into MSI\u2019s Afterburner utility, in-game boost clock climbs to 2.9GHz with ease. Extreme tinkerers can approach the 3GHz mark, while memory has no trouble scaling to an effective 23Gbps.\n\n\nThere\u2019s extra mileage in the tank, but pushing such an efficient GPU to the limit somewhat defeats the purpose. In this day and age, there are alternative methods to boost framerate.\nDLSS 3\nRejogging the memory banks after all those benchmarks, remember developers now have the option to enable individual controls for Super Resolution and/or Frame Generation. The former, as you\u2019re no doubt aware, upscales image quality based on setting; Ultra Performance works its magic on a 1280\u00d7720 render, Performance on 1920\u00d71080, Balanced works at 2227\u00d71253, and Quality upscales from 2560\u00d71440.\nOn top of that, Frame Generation inserts a synthesised frame between two rendered, resulting in multiple configuration options. Want the absolute maximum framerate? Switch Super Resolution to Ultra Performance and Frame Generation On, leading to a 720p upscale from which whole frames are also synthesised.\nWant to avoid any upscaling but willing to live with frames generated from full-resolution renders? Then turn Super Resolution off and Frame Generation On. Note that enabling the latter automatically invokes Reflex; the latency-reducing tech is mandatory, once again reaffirming the fact that additional processing risks performance in other areas.\n\n\nDLSS 3\u2019s initial success is reflected in industry adoption. Rival GPU manufacturers are scrambling to introduce their own variants, while triple-A games such as Forza Horizon 5 (pictured above) and Diablo IV are choosing to add full support for AI-powered frame generation. It is quickly becoming a sought-after feature with good reason, as results have been impressive thus far.\n\nForza Horizon 5 is one of the better implementations to date. Enabling frame generation alongside super resolution at maximum quality results in a dramatic 44 per cent increase in framerate. 160fps bodes well for a fast QHD panel, and whatever your feelings on \u2018fake\u2019 frames, during actual gameplay, you\u2019d be hard pushed to notice any meaningful difference in image quality.\n\nThe performance bump is less pronounced at 4K UHD, yet while RTX 4070 is a 1440p solution first and foremost, the addition of DLSS 3 does leave the door ajar for 2160p gaming. It is too soon to label DLSS 3 a must-have feature, however frame generation is without doubt an important feather in the 40 Series\u2019 cap.\nConclusion\nA dearth of competition in mid-range PC graphics has given Nvidia free rein with GeForce RTX 4070. Repurposing an existing GPU to hit new price points, this latest adaptation of AD104 positions the diminutive 294.5mm2 die as a champion of 1440p gaming at high framerates.\nRasterisation performance has in fact taken a sideward step \u2013 RTX 4070 is barely any quicker than RTX 3080 or RX 6800 XT \u2013 yet the overall package and feature set elevates the newest GeForce above its closest competitors. Raytracing performance is best-in-class, DLSS 3 frame generation continues to impress, and no other GPU delivers fluid QHD gameplay while sipping so little power.\nPetite dimensions and beautiful construction make Nvidia\u2019s Founders Edition an attractive upgrade from older generations, but the ease with which spartan RTX 4070 transcends its rivals is indicative of a weak market. It\u2019ll take a competent mid-range Radeon or Arc to ruffle Nvidia\u2019s feathers; until then, GeForce RTX 4070 goes unchallenged as the best GPU available for under 600 bucks.\nVerdict: a safe bet at $599, GeForce RTX 4070 is the go-to graphics card for 1440p gaming.\n\n\nParm MannClub386 founder and editor-in-chief, his journey with hardware pre-dates Google.

In response, employees also coordinated a collection drive for much-needed items like heaters, sleeping bags, baby products and more. They also organized opportunities for NVIDIA engineers to volunteer their time and skills to aid local relief projects.\nHow Employees Give Back\u00a0\nGiving back to our communities has been an integral part of NVIDIA\u2019s culture since its founding 30 years ago.\nProject Inspire, an event formerly hosted once a year for employees to come together to volunteer on one large project, eventually grew into Inspire 365, a global program that empowers NVIDIANs to give back year-round in the ways, and to the causes, that are most meaningful to them.\nThrough matching gifts, flexible time off for volunteering and a variety of activities and tools, Inspire 365 helps every NVIDIAN get involved and make a difference.\nEach employee receives $2,500 per year to match their personal financial and volunteer-time donations to the causes closest to their hearts.\nOver five weeks this past holiday season, NVIDIANs around the world came together to make a difference by using their superpower \u2014 kindness. In their efforts to lift those around them, employees logged 6,800 volunteer hours, contributed more than $4.2 million in donations and company matching, and supported nearly 2,100 charities across 33 countries.\nIn all, NVIDIANs and the company contributed $22.5 million in charitable giving and supported more than 5,800 nonprofits in 55 countries last fiscal year.\nLearn more about the NVIDIA Foundation and how it empowers NVIDIANs to give back and get involved in their communities.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | NVIDIA LifeTags: Corporate Responsibility \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And the new Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada Generation is very much at the top of the stack. With a price tag of \u00a37,150 (Ex VAT), this 48 GB professional GPU is reserved for those that take design visualisation, simulation or AI extremely seriously.\nThe first thing to get out of the way is the name of this new workstation-class GPU. It is built on Nvidia\u2019s Ada Lovelace architecture, named after the English Mathematician credited with being the first computer programmer.\nOver 40 pages of dedicated workstation reviews, features and coverage. (Click image to read)\nRecently, Nvidia has used a single letter prefix for its pro GPUs \u2014 P for Pascal, T for Turing, A for Ampere, and so on.\nAs \u2018A\u2019 was already taken, Nvidia initially referred to the Ada Lovelace GPU as the Nvidia RTX 6000, but soon after tagged \u2018Ada Generation\u2019 on to the end, presumably to avoid confusion with 2018\u2019s Turing-based Nvidia Quadro RTX 6000.\nWe don\u2019t know why Nvidia didn\u2019t use an \u2018L\u2019 prefix as it has done for its \u2018Ada Lovelace\u2019 datacentre GPUs (the Nvidia L4 and L40), but this is where we are at now. The Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada Generation might be a bit of a mouthful, but at least it has a clear identity.\nThe workstation card\nThe Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada Generation is a dual slot, full height, PCIe 4.0 workstation GPU with four DisplayPort 1.4a connectors. It looks virtually identical to its predecessor, the Nvidia RTX A6000, and has a minimal angular black and gold design. The radial type fan blows hot air directly out of the rear of the workstation via the grille on the bracket.\nThe total board power is 300W, which is less than its triple slot \u2018Ada Lovelace\u2019 consumer counterparts \u2014 the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 and GeForce RTX 4080. Power is delivered via a single PCIe CEM5 16-pin connector.\nThe card has a phenomenal amount of processors: 142 third-gen RT Cores for ray tracing (delivering 211 TFLOPs), 568 fourth-gen Tensor Cores for AI compute (delivering 1,457 TFLOPs), and 18,176 next-gen CUDA cores for general purpose operations, boasting 91 TFLOPs of single precision performance. This is a significant jump up from the Nvidia RTX A6000 it replaces, which delivers RT Core performance of 76 TFLOPs, Tensor performance of 310 TFLOPs, and single-precision performance of 39 TFLOPS.\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nThe Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada comes with 48 GB of GDDR6 memory, which should be plenty for most viz-centric workflows. However, unlike its predecessor, the RTX 6000 Ada Generation does not support NVLink, so two GPUs cannot be bridged together with an adapter to create a 96 GB memory pool. While this shouldn\u2019t matter to most users, it could be a barrier for those working with exceptionally high poly count models / high resolution textures. It could also limit its use in engineering simulation, including Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).\n\nRead our other recent Nvidia RTX workstation GPU reviews\nNvidia RTX A1000\nNvidia RTX 2000 Ada Generation\nNvidia RTX 4000 Ada Generation\nNvidia RTX 4000 SFF Ada Generation\n\n48 GB is still double that on offer in the top-end consumer Nvidia GeForce RTX 40-Series. The RTX 6000 Ada also differentiates itself from Nvidia\u2019s consumer cards in several other ways, including pro drivers, pro software certifications, support for Error Correction code (ECC) memory, and some niche features for pro viz, including stereo and Frame Lock for viz clusters.\nIt also supports Nvidia virtual GPU (vGPU) software, which allows a workstation to be repurposed into multiple GPU-accelerated virtual workstation instances. With workstation vendors, especially Lenovo and HP, actively making their new \u2018Sapphire Rapids\u2019 desktop workstations rack friendly, this feature is likely to be more important than ever before.\nFinally, it boasts 3x the video encoding performance of the Nvidia RTX A6000, for streaming multiple simultaneous XR sessions using Nvidia CloudXR.\n\nThe Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada Generation makes light work of expansive real time viz models, such as this Enscape 3.0 building complex\nOptimised for visualisation\nhe Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada offers all the generational improvements you\u2019d expect from a new GPU architecture, but there are also significant changes in the way the GPU carries out calculations to increase performance in viz-centric workflows.\nDeep Learning Super Sampling 3 (DLSS) and Shader Execution Reordering (SER) are the two technologies that stand out.\nNvidia DLSS has been around for several years and with the new Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada, it is now on its third generation. It uses the GPU\u2019s AI Tensor cores to boost performance.\nWith Nvidia\u2019s previous generation \u2018Ampere\u2019 GPUs, DLSS 2 took a low-resolution current frame and the high-resolution previous frame to predict, on a pixel-by-pixel basis, what a high-resolution current frame would look like.\nWith DLSS 3, the Tensor cores generate entirely new frames rather than just pixels. It processes the new frame, and the prior frame, to discover how the scene is changing, then generates entirely new frames without having to process the graphics pipeline.\nSo far, we\u2019ve only seen DLSS 3 implemented in Nvidia Omniverse, but we expect others to follow. Enscape and Autodesk VRED, for example, both support DLSS 2.\nAs a background to Shader Execution Reordering (SER), Nvidia explains that GPUs are most efficient when processing similar work at the same time. However, with ray tracing, rays bounce in different directions and intersect surfaces of various types. This can lead to different threads processing different shaders or accessing memory that is hard to coalesce or cache.\nWith SER, the Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada Generation can dynamically reorganise its workload, so similar shaders are processed together. According to Nvidia, SER can give a two to three times speed up for ray tracing and a frame rate increase of up to 25%. But these are probably extremes. For offline path tracing in Unreal Engine 5.1, for example, Nvidia quotes speed improvements of 40% or more.\n\n\nEngineering simulation\nIn AEC, while visualisation is the primary use case for the Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada, the GPU can also be used for engineering simulation.\nAt launch, Nvidia highlighted the use of Ansys software, including Ansys Discovery and Ansys Fluent for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).\nCompared to the RTX A6000, the RTX 6000 Ada not only has more cores and faster cores, but significantly larger L2 cache (96 MB vs 6 MB) and increased memory bandwidth (960 GB/s vs 768 GB/s). According to Ansys, this results in \u2018impressive performance gains\u2019 for the broad Ansys application portfolio.\nHowever, the Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada is not suited to all simulation tools. Some simulation solvers require double precision and with relatively poor FP64 performance (which at 1,423 GFLOPSs is 1/64 of its FP32 performance), the RTX 6000 Ada is unlikely to perform that well in those that do. In fact, for double precision solvers, even 2016\u2019s Nvidia Quadro GP100 boasts better FP64 performance of 5.17 TFLOPs.\n\nAnsys Discovery running on an Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada Generation\nTesting the Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada Generation\nAEC Magazine put the Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada Generation through a series of real-world application benchmarks, both GPU rendering and real time visualisation.\nThe GPU is simply overkill for current generation CAD and BIM software, so we didn\u2019t do any testing in that regard. However, it\u2019s important to note that it will still be certified for the likes of Revit and Archicad, which is useful if you plan to use those types of core applications alongside more design viz focused tools like Enscape, V-Ray, Twinmotion and Lumion.\nThe full spec of our AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro test machine, the Scan 3XS GWP-ME A1128T can be seen below. Read our full review here.\nScan 3XS GWP-ME A1128T\n\n\nAMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro 5995WX processor (2.7 GHz, 4.5 GHz boost) (64-cores, 128 threads)\n256 GB (8 x 32GB) Samsung ECC Registered DDR4 3200MHz memory\n2TB Samsung 990 Pro NVMe PCIe 4.0 SSD\n8TB RAID array (4 x 2TB Samsung 990 Pro NVMe PCIe 4.0 SSDs)\nAsus Pro WS WRX80E Sage SE WiFi motherboard\nCorsair H150i Elite Cappelix RGB with Noctua fans\n1,500W Corsair HXi, 80PLUS Platinum\nMicrosoft Windows 11 Pro\n\nFor comparison, we also tested the Nvidia RTX A6000 GPU inside the same machine. Nvidia\u2019s 528.24 pro driver was used for both GPUs.\nScan 3XS GWP-ME A1128T with Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada Generation GPU\nReal time 3D\nReal time 3D visualisation with applications that use OpenGL, DirectX or Vulkan graphics APIs continue to be a very important part of architectural visualisation. Key applications include TwinMotion, Lumion, Enscape and Unreal Engine.\nWe recorded frame rates (Frame Per Second) within Enscape, Unreal Engine, Nvidia Omniverse, and Autodesk VRED Professional, a pro viz application commonly used in automotive design.\nWe only tested at 4K (3,840 x 2,160) resolution. At FHD (1,920 x 1,080) , it\u2019s a given that the Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada Generation can deliver more than enough performance.\nIn Enscape, we tested with five different models. Overall, our experience was incredibly smooth, even with the large RTX-enabled Enscape 3.0 building complex which uses 11 GB of GPU memory (see image earlier).\nHowever, our preferred benchmark model, an urban scene from Enscape 3.1, was a little unresponsive, sometimes taking a few seconds to react to mouse or keyboard movements. We don\u2019t know why this was, but it could be because it includes custom assets and textures and there is a conflict of some sort. Once it got going, however, we recorded a phenomenal 124.95 FPS, 63% faster than the Nvidia RTX A6000.\nIn Unreal Engine 4.26, the generation-on-generation gains were smaller. The biggest increase came when ray tracing was enabled on our Audi test model, with the RTX 6000 Ada Generation delivering 1.5 times more FPS than the RTX A6000.\nIn Autodesk VRED Professional 2023, performance increases ranged from 1.63 to 1.89. The biggest came when anti-aliasing was disabled.\nIn Nvidia Omniverse Create 2022.3.3, we tested with the Brownstone building sample model. In RTX \u2013 Real-Time mode with DLSS enabled the RTX 6000 Ada was a whopping 3.62 times faster than the RTX A6000. However, there\u2019s a case of comparing apples with pears here as the RTX 6000 Ada uses DLSS 3 while the RTX A6000 use DLSS 2 (see earlier on). In saying that, we saw no visual difference between the two. In RTX \u2013 interactive (path tracing) mode the RTX 6000 Ada was 2.16 times faster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay trace rendering\nWe tested with a range of GPU-accelerated ray-trace renderers, including V-Ray GPU, KeyShot, Solidworks Visualize, Nvidia Omniverse and blender.\nWith the V-Ray, KeyShot and blender benchmarks, the RTX 6000 Ada Generation shot ahead, outperforming the RTX A6000 by a factor of 1.93, 2.05 and 2.17 respectively. We saw similar gains in Nvidia Omniverse, with the RTX 6000 Ada taking less than half the time of the RTX A6000 to render the brownstone building scene.\nHowever, in some of our real-world application tests, the gains were nowhere near as large. In Solidworks Visualize 2023, rendering the 1969 Camaro test scene with Nvidia Iray and the new 3DS Stellar Physically Correct global illumination engine, showed the RTX 6000 Ada to be between 32% and 40% faster than the RTX A6000.\nIn KeyShot 2023 the RTX 6000 Ada Generation rendered our motorbike model between 33% and 41% quicker in a range of stills and turntable animations. With KeyShot \u2018s sample drone scene it went down to 23%-25%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada Generation is a phenomenally powerful GPU. In several visualisation workflows, it delivered more than double the performance of the previous generation Nvidia RTX A6000. And when Nvidia has full control over both software and hardware, and the GPU\u2019s fourth-gen Tensor cores kick in with DLSS 3, the boost in real-time performance (with seemingly no impact on end user experience) is simply breathtaking.\nBut these are the extremes of what you can expect from this super high-end workstation GPU. In some of our real world tests the performance increases were as low as 23%. But even this can save hours in the working day. When rendering out a 600 frame 4K animation in KeyShot 2023 for example, rendering times dropped from 6 hours 26 mins to 4 hours 50 mins.\nThere are some downsides to the new GPU. First, there is no NVLink, which may come as a disappointment to those really pushing the boundaries of complexity. Second it is quite power hungry, drawing 300W at peak. And finally, of course, there\u2019s the price.\n\u00a37,150 (Ex VAT) is an incredible amount to pay for a single graphics card and considerably more than Nvidia previously charged for its top end workstation GPUs. The Nvidia RTX A6000, for example, only cost \u00a33,730 (Ex VAT) in February 2021.\nWhile some will consider \u00a37,150 to be a price worth paying for the transformative effect it could have on their workflows, others may seek better value elsewhere.\nThe new AMD Radeon Pro W7900 (48 GB) is one such option, although it does not offer the same breadth of software support. More than ever before, perhaps Nvidia is facing its biggest competition from within. The consumer-focused \u2018Ada Generation\u2019 GeForce RTX 4090 is available for around \u00a31,500 + VAT, but you miss out on some pro features, superior build quality and access to 48 GB of memory, double that of the 4090. And for some viz artists that\u2019s a big deal. 48 GB allows you to work with more complex datasets and render them at higher resolutions. In simulation, engineers can increase the fidelity of the solver for more accurate results.\nThe additional memory will not just offer potential benefits for single app workflows. These days many viz artists to use multiple apps at the same time \u2013 render in V-Ray while working on real-time experiences in Unreal Engine, for example. And the RTX 6000 Ada Generation is much more likely to allow them to do this without having to make compromises to their workflow.\n\nThis article is part of AEC Magazine\u2019s Workstation Special report\nScroll down to read and subscribe here\nFeaturing\n\nBattle of the desktop workstation CPUs: Intel \u2018Sapphire Rapids\u2019 vs AMD Threadripper Pro\nCloud workstations for CAD, BIM and viz \u2013 how the major public cloud providers stack up\nLenovo ThinkStation P7 / PX desktop workstation reviews\n\u2018Sapphire Rapids\u2019 workstation round-up \u2013 Dell, HP, BOXX, Scan and Workstation Specialists\nNvidia RTX 6000 Ada Generation professional GPU review\nAMD Radeon Pro W7800 / W7900 professional GPUs preview\nReimagining the desktop workstation as a remote resource\nThe flexible workstation \u2013 supporting the hybrid workforce\nSustainable cloud workstations\n\n\nRelated articles:Inevidesk: flexible virtual workstationsEnscape 2.7 exposes BIM object dataModumate: BIM powered by Unreal EngineBIM by ACCAVideo: NXT BLD 2018 London conference - Mike Leach, Lenovo UKNEWS: Artlantis 7 boosts rendering performance and project sharingReview: Boston Venom Epyc (pre-production unit)Review: Nvidia RTX A2000 (12 GB) workstation GPU\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPrevious Post \n\nNext Post \n\n\n\nLeave a comment Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nStay informed\nJoin the AEC community\nNewsletter \u2022 FREE digital magazine \u2022 print magazine\nGo\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLatest content \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAI and the future of arch viz\n\nFebruary 21, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWorkstation Special Report \u2013 Winter 2025\n\nFebruary 9, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMotif to take on Revit: exclusive interview\n\nFebruary 7, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAllplan acquires Manufacton to boost offsite\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nD5 Render 2.10 introduces real-time path tracing\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \u00a9 2008 - 2024 X3DMedia\r\n19 Leyden Street, London, E1 7LE, UK\r\nTel: +44(0)20 3355 7310                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManage Cookie Consent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use technologies like cookies to store and/or access device information.

They had about four months to deliver code to help more than 60,000 virtual attendees find which of 650 sessions they\u2019d most enjoy.\nAnd they had a magic wand called NVIDIA Merlin, a set of software libraries that helps some of the world\u2019s largest cloud services suggest everything from restaurants to retirement plans their customers would like.\nAn Engine of Online Commerce\nRecommendation systems, aka recsys, are \u201cpretty much everywhere\u201d these days, said Angel Martinez, a Tampa-based machine-learning specialist who built such AI models for banks before joining NVIDIA last year.\nAngel Martinez\n\u201cThey narrow down product choices for users bombarded by a ton of information online,\u201d said Martinez (left).\nUsing Merlin, a kind of recsys LEGO kit, the job wasn\u2019t hard for Martinez. A math whiz in school, he got a degree in economics, but found a career in AI more stimulating.\n\u201cI was going to be an actuary because they use a lot of math, but that work is kind of cut-and-dry, compared to AI where people are still discovering new things,\u201d he said.\nEarly Doubts and Misstarts\nAt first, the cross-functional team of web and AI experts, data scientists and test engineers weren\u2019t sure where to start or if they could finish in time.\nThey considered gathering data from back-end servers, but that wasn\u2019t fast enough to deliver real-time results. Carl Hancock (below), who helps optimize NVIDIA\u2019s websites from a home office outside Salt Lake City, found a faster way, gathering data from browsers at the front end.\nCarl Hancock\nMartinez and others harmonized datasets that had evolved over more than a dozen years of past GTC events. Luckily, they could tap NV-CDP, NVIDIA\u2019s GPU database of user email and web interactions that\u2019s key for serving up personalized content.\nAnother team created an API to link the AI model to web software. Still others tested the various parts as they came together.\nA Global Relay Race\n\u201cIt felt like a giant relay race,\u201d said Hancock, who joined the company from Adobe less than 18 months ago. \u201cYou might wait a week for another team to do its work, then pass it back, then everyone would be waiting on you,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFor me, this was a unique collaboration across orgs and teams,\u201d said Benedikt Schifferer, a Berlin-based member of the Merlin team who helped define the architecture of the GTC model.\nA turning point came one day when Schifferer tested the team\u2019s work. No surprise, he sought recommendations for sessions on recsys.\nLight at the Tunnel\u2019s End\nAs hoped, the code served up sessions under the category of recommenders. But it also served up sessions from other categories that contained significant content on the subject. It worked.\nBy March 7, the team of teams enabled \u201cpowered by Merlin\u201d recommendations on the GTC home page, session pages and a handful of other key landing sites. In the first week alone, they served up more than 20,000 recommendations.\nOne of the team\u2019s first \u201cpowered by Merlin\u201d pages.\nMembers of the team described their work and more in a GTC session (DLIT51219), Building Session-Based Recommendation Models With NVIDIA Merlin.\nIn a sign of how vital the technology is, companies including Alibaba, LinkedIn, Meta, Target and Uber also gave GTC talks on their use of recsys.\nIt\u2019s a skill spreading through NVIDIA, now. For example, the digital marketing group already uses an email system developed for GTC last fall.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be long before they\u2019ll be building more recommenders of their own,\u201d said Even Oldridge, who leads the Merlin team from his office in Vancouver, Canada.\nMore Magic to Come\nThanks to this project, the team has some new ideas for ways it can make Merlin easier for more companies to implement. \u201cWe\u2019d like to provide a ready-to-run kit for specific use cases,\u201d said Schifferer.\nHancock sees the work on Merlin for GTC as just the start of what\u2019s possible for NVIDIA\u2019s website.\n\u201cOne of the objectives of my team is to use the site to showcase our technology, so potential customers can see it in action,\u201d he said.\n\n\nCategories: NVIDIA LifeTags: Artificial Intelligence | Data Science | GTC 2023 | GTC Digital | Machine Learning | Merlin | Recommender Systems \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Through their efforts, they hope to transform how people think about and use computers for complex tasks. In this article, we\u2019ll take a look at Nvidia\u2019s quantum computing efforts and how they are paving the way for an exciting future.\nHow Nvidia Started With Quantum Computing?\nNVIDIA is a leading technology company that specializes in designing and manufacturing high-performance computing hardware, software, and AI solutions. The company was founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem and is widely known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used in a variety of applications, including gaming, data centres, and scientific research. In recent years, NVIDIA has been exploring the field of quantum computing\nNvidia introduced a quantum circuit simulation SDK called cuQuantum in 2021. cuQuantum has been designed to speed up all circuit simulation frameworks and is integrated into Cirq, Qiskit Pennylane, Orquestra and others.\nIt is reported by the company that it is possible to simulate ideal or noisy qubits using cuQuantum with a scale and performance that is not possible with current quantum hardware.\nSome of the world\u2019s largest companies such as Google Quantum AI and IBM and national labs with names like Oak Ridge, Argonne, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory utilize CuQuantum in the quantum ecosystem, as well as academic institutions, quantum startups, and supercomputing centres, too.\nNVIDIA\u2019s Quantum Computing Technology\nAnnounced in March 2023, NVIDIA DGX Quantum is the first GPU-accelerated quantum computing system in the world. Powered by the NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip and the open-source CUDA Quantum programming model, NVIDIA DGX Quantum combines a powerful accelerated computing platform with Quantum Machines\u2019 OPX quantum control platform.\nUsing this combination, researchers can build applications that integrate quantum computing with classical computing, which allows for calibration, control, quantum error correction, and hybrid algorithms.\nIn essence, DGX Quantum features an NVIDIA Grace Hopper GPU connected to a Quantum Machines OPX+ via PCIe, offering sub-microsecond latency between GPUs and QPUs.This technology enables researchers to develop extremely powerful applications that combine quantum computing with classical computing, enabling calibration, control, quantum error correction, and hybrid algorithms.\nA union of a high-performance GPU from NVIDIA and the company\u2019s own Grace CPU enables Grace Hopper to power giant AI and HPC workloads at scale. For applications running terabytes of data, the company states it offers up to 10x greater performance, giving quantum-classical researchers the power to solve their complex problems like never before.\nNVIDIA Quantum Optimized Device Architecture (QODA) Platform (CUDA as of\u00a02023)\nIn 2022 NVIDIA released QODA (now the CUDA platform), designed as a hybrid quantum-classical programming model that makes quantum computing more accessible. In addition to improving scientific productivity and facilitating greater scale in quantum research, QODA is an open and combined environment for some of today\u2019s most powerful computers and quantum processors.\nWith the help of NVIDIA DGX systems and a large installed base of NVIDIA GPUs available in scientific supercomputing centres and public clouds, experts in HPC and AI can integrate quantum computing easily into existing applications, taking advantage of both current quantum processors and simulations of future quantum machines.\nDoes NVIDIA Have Quantum Computing Patents?\nAs you can see from above, NVIDIA DGX Quantum is the first GPU-accelerated quantum computing system in the world, so we should presume the company has registered a patent for this technology.\nNVIDIA\u2019s Quantum Partners & Competitors\nThere is a wide range of groups utilizing CuQuantum in the quantum ecosystem, including supercomputing centres, academic groups, quantum startups, and some of the largest companies in the world.\nIt was announced that NVIDIA has partnered with quantum hardware companies Anyon Systems, Atom Computing, IonQ, ORCA Computing, Oxford Quantum Circuits, and QuEra to integrate CUDA Quantum into their platforms. Quantum software companies include Agnostiq and QMware while there are several supercomputing centres such as the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, the IT Center for Science (CSC) and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) that have partnered with NVIDIA.\nAdditionally, in 2022 at the Q2B conference in Tokyo, NVIDIA announced QODA collaborations with quantum hardware providers IQM Quantum Computers, Pasqal, Quantinuum, Quantum Brilliance and Xanadu, software provider QC Ware and Zapata Computing, as well as supercomputing centres QC Ware and Zapata Computing.\nOn the competitor front, multinationals invested in quantum like Microsoft, IBM, Google etc seem to be NVIDIA\u2019s greatest competitors in the field.\nIn a YouTube video released last year \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s Special Address at Q2B\u201d, Director of HPC & Quantum Product at NVIDIA Tim Costa presented use cases for cuQuantum, which included BMW optimizing robot pathfinding and routing, large consultancy companies Deloitte and SoftServe developing applications in quantum machine learning to solve customer problems in both materials and drug discovery and Fujifilm leveraging quantum to explore tensor network methods for Material Science simulation with 1000s of qubits.\nYou may also like:\n\nNVIDIA Announces New System for Accelerated Quantum-Classical Computing\nNVIDIA Says Unified Computing Platform Will Speed Up Quantum R&D\nNVIDIA Says It\u2019s Building a Onramp to the Hybrid Quantum Future\n\nFuture of NVIDIA\u2019s Quantum Computing\nFrom drug discovery to portfolio optimization, quantum computing has the potential to offer huge leaps in computing power. This, however, will require pushing the boundaries of quantum information science through the development of algorithms, the development of quantum processors, and the creation of systems and tools that integrate quantum-classical components tightly.\nCosta believes many scientists are of the attitude that hybrid solutions combining classical computing with quantum computing will lead to scientific breakthroughs and that collaborating with innovative companies like Quantum Brilliance and dozens of others will allow many more developers to access the best tools for both quantum and classical computing\u200a\u2014\u200atools that NVIDIA currently possess.\nFor more market insights, check out our latest quantum computing news here.\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIANVIDIA cuQuantumNVIDIA QODAquantum computingquantum technologyUS \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Dargan \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Dargan is a writer and researcher at The Quantum Insider.

Just as important, changes need to be navigated in the way people consume maps, from paper charts to GPS navigation and interactive online charts.\nThe way people think about video games is changing, too. Today, 83% of GeForce RTX 40 Series desktop gamers with RTX-capable games enable ray tracing, and 79% turn on DLSS, showcasing the widespread adoption of these revolutionary technologies.1\nThey\u2019re also widely adopted among prior RTX 30 Series and 20 Series owners; 56% and 43% turn on ray tracing, while 71% and 68% turn on DLSS, respectively.\nAt the core of this story: For any media \u2014 from movies and music to maps and magazines \u2014 technologies don\u2019t just define the way people create content, they redefine how it\u2019s consumed, ultimately becoming integral parts of its transformation.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s essential to consider both ray tracing and DLSS when evaluating an RTX 40 Series upgrade \u2014 which is how today\u2019s gamers achieve the best graphics and performance.\nA New Standard in Gaming\nNVIDIA introduced neural rendering with its Turing architecture in the RTX 20 Series five years ago. Neural rendering combines two complementary breakthroughs \u2014 real-time ray tracing and DLSS \u2014 with the shading techniques long a staple of real-time graphics.\nPowered by dedicated Tensor Cores for AI and RT Cores for ray tracing, RTX and DLSS have transformed the gaming industry. The initial implementations were a first critical step. Back in 2018, 37% of RTX 20 Series gamers embraced ray tracing, and 26% turned on DLSS.2\nFast forward to the present, and the GeForce RTX 40 Series \u2014 the third generation of RTX \u2014 has established ray tracing and DLSS as the new standard in gaming.\nRay Tracing Delivers Unparalleled Immersion\nRay tracing performance has significantly improved thanks to advancements like Shader Execution Reordering, cutting-edge Opacity Micromap and Displaced Micro-Mesh engines.\nThis week Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode technology preview showcases the evolution of ray tracing into full ray tracing, offering enhanced real-time lighting, shadows and reflections.\nThese innovations enable even the most demanding games to simultaneously implement multiple ray-tracing effects or even full ray tracing, aka path tracing, for unparalleled realism and immersion.\nDLSS Delivers Significant Performance Boosts\nMeanwhile, DLSS Super Resolution has evolved to deliver significant performance boosts without compromising image quality. Ongoing neural network updates and model training on an NVIDIA supercomputer \u2014 with over an exaflop of AI processing power \u2014 continue to improve image fidelity and motion quality.\nWith DLSS 3, AI-powered Frame Generation creates new high-quality frames for smoother gameplay while maintaining great responsiveness through NVIDIA Reflex. AI can now generate seven out of every eight pixels through a combination of Super Resolution and Frame Generation.\nA Potent Combination\nThis potent combination of third-generation ray tracing and DLSS has resulted in a staggering 16x leap in ray-tracing operations per pixel over the past five years. And where performance goes, PC gamers and game developers follow.\nAdoption rates have soared, with over 400 RTX games and applications available and more on the horizon. DLSS 3, in particular, has seen a 7x faster adoption rate than its predecessor.\nThe popularity of ray tracing and DLSS outpaces other configurations, such as 4K, which is used by 28% of RTX 40 Series desktop gamers, and 144Hz or higher monitors, used by 62%.\nAs a result, judging a great game like Cyberpunk 2077 with DLSS and ray tracing off doesn\u2019t demonstrate how a large and growing number of gamers will experience this game.\nAs DLSS and ray tracing continue to redefine gaming experiences, raster-only numbers no longer paint the picture gamers are seeing. This is only natural because, as PC gamers know, the full picture is looking better than ever.\n1 Data from millions of RTX gamers who played RTX capable games in February 2023 shows 79% of 40 Series gamers, 71% of 30 Series gamers and 68% of 20 Series gamers turn DLSS on. 83% of 40 Series gamers, 56% of 30 Series gamers and 43% of 20 Series gamers turn ray tracing on.\u200b\n2 Data from RTX 20 Series gamers who played RTX-capable games in 2018\u200b.\n\n\nCategories: GamingTags: GeForce \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The RTX Remix creator toolkit Early Access is coming soon.\nThe RTX Remix runtime captures a game scene, and replaces assets at playback while injecting RTX technology, such as path tracing, DLSS 3 and Reflex into the game. Already, mod developers have been using the RTX Remix runtime from Portal With RTX to create experimental ray traced scenes in numerous classic games.\nTo further empower the mod development community to extend Remix\u2019s game compatibility and feature set, NVIDIA is releasing an alpha version of the RTX Remix runtime as open source on GitHub today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RTX Remix runtime is open source with a permissive MIT license, and includes the following components:\n\nUSD capture and replacement modules, which are responsible for capturing a game scene to USD, and replacing original game assets with modded game assets at runtime.\nBridge, which translates the renderer from a x86 to a x64 instruction set. This component uncaps the memory available for rendering.\nScene manager, which uses information coming through the D3D9 fixed function API to create a representation of the original scene, track game objects frame to frame, and set up the scene to be path traced.\nThe core path tracer, which includes the rendering loop, the material handling, and the game specific rendering features (e.g., decals and particles). Please note, the various technologies (DLSS, NRD, RTXDI) that accelerate our path tracer and enable it to render in real time will continue to be available via their existing SDKs and licenses from the\u00a0NVIDIA Developer portal.\nDXVK: NVIDIA created a fork from the influential and open source DXVK project, which translates d3d9 (and other APIs) to Vulkan. We are open sourcing our alterations in our fork.\n\nOpen sourcing unlocks numerous possibilities to extend the feature set of the Remix runtime. A few examples of projects that advanced mod developers might tackle via source code access include:\n\nMaking more of their favorite games compatible with Remix\nModernizing the fluid simulation to render smoke and fire with realistic volumetrics\nInjecting custom post effects shaders in the runtime\nAdding animated lights (e.g., flickering fire, or lights that cycle through colors)\nReplacing animated character meshes\nChanging camera positions in games (e.g., turning a first person game into an isometric one)\nIncorporating virtual reality support into the renderer\nImplementing dynamic conditional replacements (e.g., add fog or change a light in response to a player\u2019s position)\n\nThere is ample opportunity to change how classic titles are played, and open source widens the possibilities beyond our imagination. We look forward to seeing what mod developers will build with source access.\nFor PC gamers, an open source RTX Remix runtime will help broaden the variety of games with RTX mods and the types of mods themselves.\nHow To Get Involved\nThe RTX Remix runtime source code can be found on GitHub, and bugs can be reported here.\nOur main goal is to expand game compatibility and extend the features of Remix in collaboration with the community. In keeping with that aim, NVIDIA will accept pull requests on Github for code submissions from the community, provide feedback, and help advance code until it is mature enough to be merged into the official RTX Remix runtime.\nTo further help the community with Remix, several Remix engineers have joined the community-led RTX Remix Showcase Discord server, are providing guidelines on compatibility, and responding to mod developers\u2019 questions about RTX Remix. If you are looking to get started with your own Remix runtime open source project, head over to the Discord to find subject matter experts to collaborate with. We have also prepared some starter guides and documentation for mod developers as we continue to prepare the RTX Remix application.\nModding is all about community, and providing an open source RTX Remix runtime will help empower mod developers to expand Remix compatibility to even more classic PC games. We look forward to seeing how creators usher in this new era of modding with RTX Remix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

With the Rivermax plug-in for Unreal Engine, users can now deliver synchronized video over IP and improve manageability of hardware resources.\nUnreal Engine with Rivermax delivers two key benefits:\n\nLow-latency, ultra-high-bandwidth, industry-standard interconnection between render nodes and external video devices.\nAn optimized stage architecture to provide the highest visual quality productions while minimizing latency.\n\n\nUnreal Engine 5.1 Adds Experimental Support for SMPTE ST 2110\nMany studios and creatives use virtual production and in-camera visual effects (VFX) to elevate storytelling, while iterating on ideas in real time. As more studios adopt virtual production, it\u2019s important to ensure the stages are optimally configured to deliver the highest-quality content.\nWith the experimental Rivermax integration, Unreal Engine adds support for SMPTE ST 2110, a suite of standards for sending digital content over IP networks. Virtual production video streaming requires a fixed bitrate and scheduled delivery. It also requires packet burst control \u2014 the network card will send as much data, or \u201cpackets,\u201d as it can in the shortest time.\nBut some receivers can\u2019t handle huge amounts of packets, which can result in buffering issues. So teams want to control the number of packets that\u2019s sent over a short time, as this helps maintain a fixed bitrate while avoiding network congestion and buffer overflow.\nNVIDIA BlueField data processing units (DPUs) running the NVIDIA DOCA Firefly Service and Rivermax SDK help address these challenges by providing accurate timing to any operating system. Rivermax is also the only fully virtualized streaming solution that complies with the stringent timing and traffic-flow requirement of SMPTE ST 2110.\nThe nDisplay system for Unreal Engine enables users to combine network configuration data, details about display mechanisms, distribution of rendering, and image displays for large surfaces and screens. The latest release of Unreal Engine features the new Media I/O Mapping System, which sets the stage for nDisplay render nodes to directly stream to LED wall processors that support SMPTE 2110.\nGoing Behind the Screens of Virtual Scenes\nIn an in-camera VFX virtual production workflow, the picture on the main LED wall captured by the camera is called the inner frustum, which moves in sync with the camera. The content displayed on the LED volume outside of the camera\u2019s view is called the outer viewports \u2014 this is commonly used as a dynamic light and reflection source for the physical set.\nThe latest release of Unreal Engine introduces a new hardware configuration option for nDisplay systems. While the existing architecture requires the inner frustum to be rendered by each machine in the cluster to ensure proper synchronization, the new support for SMPTE 2110 offers the potential for the inner frustum to be rendered once by a dedicated machine, and then shared with the other machines rendering the outer viewports. This attempts to maximize the resources available for the inner frustum render to ensure the best possible image quality is captured by the camera.\nUnreal Engine 5.1 is the pivotal first step in what will be a multiple release effort toward the next generation of in-camera VFX stage deployments. The goal is to improve content performance, increase linear scalability of the render nodes and reduce latency. Epic Games and NVIDIA will continue to collaborate on this development and look forward to a future where real-world productions can reap the benefits of SMPTE 2110.\nLearn more about NVIDIA BlueField DPUs, NVIDIA Rivermax and Unreal Engine.\nAnd check out other NVIDIA technologies for enhancing virtual productions at the upcoming NAB Show.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: Graphics | Media and Entertainment \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Now, a new Cyberpunk 2077 update has hit the streets, featuring the technology preview of the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, which enhances the game\u2019s already-amazing visuals with full ray tracing, otherwise known as path tracing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull ray tracing accurately simulates light throughout an entire scene. It is used by visual effects artists to create film and TV graphics that are indistinguishable from reality, but until the arrival of GeForce RTX GPUs with RT Cores, and the AI-powered acceleration of NVIDIA DLSS, real-time video game full ray\u00a0 tracing was impossible because it's extremely GPU intensive.\nPrevious techniques separately addressed ray-traced shadows, reflections and global illumination for a small number of light sources. Full ray tracing models the properties of light from a virtually unlimited number of emissive sources, delivering physically correct shadows, reflections and global illumination on all objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor even more info on the making of the new Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, check out our interview with CD PROJEKT RED\nThe technology preview for Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode is a sneak peek into the future of full ray tracing, and we are working with CD PROJEKT RED on further full ray tracing enhancements, bug fixes, and performance optimizations. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRasterization based lighting pipelines rely on many independent subsystems. It's not uncommon that they can create unbalanced lighting in more complex scenarios. Ray tracing significantly improved overall quality and some of the main pain points of each subsystem. The unified fully ray-traced pipeline builds on these advances and completely removes the need for extensive per-scene tweaking, delivering amazing and predictable results each time, while also improving image quality, immersion, and realism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most impactful additions in the technology preview of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode is NVIDIA RTX Direct Illumination (RTXDI), a free SDK that enables developers to closely replicate the appearance of light in scenes with numerous light sources. With RTXDI, thousands of objects can emit ray-traced light. \nIn Cyberpunk 2077, each neon sign, street lamp, LED billboard, car headlight, and other source of light is now ray-traced, bathing objects, walls, passing cars and pedestrians in accurate lighting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull ray tracing helps with grounding objects within their surroundings, like the car above. Click here to view the comparison in 4K\nWith full ray tracing and RTXDI, now practically all light sources cast physically correct soft shadows, a feat previously unimaginable using previous approaches. Players will experience enhanced shadowing, with better depth, detail and realism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matter how geometrically complex a scene gets, pipes, rails, staircases, and other objects will now get proper shadows from all the shadow casting lights in their vicinity. Click here to view the comparison in 4K\nCyberpunk 2077 features a full day-night cycle. To upgrade indirect lighting from all emissive sources, including the sun and moon, Global Illumination (GI) needed to be path traced, too. Rendering techniques including Screen Space Reflections, Screen Space Ambient Occlusion, and the existing GI solutions were replaced by a single unified algorithm that delivers more accurate lighting of scenes and objects.\nWith the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode enabled, natural colored lighting bounces multiple times throughout Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s world, creating more realistic indirect lighting and occlusion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sunlight bounces off the floor to indirectly light a cardboard stack for more realistic lighting and occlusion. Click here to view the comparison in 4K\nReflections now incorporate bounced detail, too, and are rendered at full resolution, accentuating the cyberpunk aesthetic and further heightening immersion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull ray tracing helps to balance the diffuse and specular response of materials to the light, resulting in even more realistic reflections. Click here to view the comparison in 4K\nCombined, the full ray tracing of direct and global illumination give gamers the most advanced real-time lighting seen to date in gaming, and a preview of how all games will look in the future.\nTo bring these incredible effects to life, at performant frame rates, CD PROJEKT RED and NVIDIA have worked hand in hand to introduce new optimizations for this entirely new fully ray-traced pipeline.\nNVIDIA Shader Execution Reordering (SER) helps GPUs with executing incoherent workloads boosting performance, NVIDIA Real-Time Denoisers (NRD) have been leveraged to further improve performance and image quality, and our drivers have been specially tuned to optimize frame rates. So be sure to update to the Cyberpunk 2077 Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode GeForce Game Ready Driver.\nTogether with NVIDIA DLSS 3, the performance multiplier, these technologies, tweaks and optimizations enable GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers to play Cyberpunk 2077 fully ray-traced with maximum performance.\nWith DLSS 3 activated, 4K performance on a GeForce RTX 4090 will be boosted by 4.6X to 103 FPS, and on a GeForce RTX 4080, performance leaps by 5X to 74 FPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHere at CD PROJEKT RED we are very proud to be technology innovators, and DLSS 3 gives us meaningful performance gains to tackle the addition of even higher levels of ray tracing to deliver a visually rich experience for our gamers.\u201d - Jakub Knapik, VP, Global Art Director, CD PROJEKT RED\u00a0\nAt 1440p, GeForce RTX 4070 Ti performance increases by 3.1X using DLSS 3, to 80 FPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn recently-released GeForce RTX 40 Series laptops, DLSS 3 multiplies performance by 3X, enabling laptop owners to experience the fully ray-traced Night City anywhere in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, full ray tracing is extremely GPU intensive. For\u00a0the technology preview of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, we currently recommend a GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU and NVIDIA DLSS 3.\nThose without a game-ready device can also experience Cyberpunk 2077 with DLSS 3 and full ray tracing in the new Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode by streaming it from the cloud with a GeForce NOW Ultimate membership, which gives you the power of a GeForce RTX 4080-class PC in the cloud.\nFor the very best experience with Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s new fully ray traced mode, download our latest Game Ready Drivers for your PC or laptop from GeForce.com or GeForce Experience.

Battery cell manufacturing is a critical step in the battery value chain, with manufacturers investing billions of dollars in new battery-cell plants to meet this new demand.\nIn the demo, Siemens shows a vision for how teams can harness comprehensive digital twins in the industrial metaverse using models of existing and future plants.\nWithin moments, FREYR can set up a meeting with potential investors or customers to take place within the digital FREYR plant in Norway and explore the facility\u2019s exterior before entering to view current production processes at work.\nThe striking interior flythrough instantly conveys the facility\u2019s size and scale. The real-time, physically accurate simulation shows how machines and robots inside the factory move, and can even simulate complex processes. Sensors capturing machine information allow real-time performance visualization and ergonomic assessments.\nThe demo also demonstrates how the model can be used for production planning, highlighting how a plant manager can rapidly evaluate plant performance using a custom Siemens application, which provides at a glance an overview of the facility\u2019s operation.\nFrom there, the manager initiates a Microsoft Teams meeting with colleagues at a manufacturing \u201ccell\u201d \u2014 which places key people, machines and supplies in one strategic location \u2014 inside the virtual factory.\nThe team can then examine a robotic arm experiencing low-cycle-time issues, access machine performance data, identify specific cycle-time problems and view a live video stream with accompanying sensor data on machine performance.\nThis showcase at Hannover Messe is only the beginning, as more industries embrace and implement the industrial metaverse.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Omniverse and our partnership with Siemens.\nRegister for NVIDIA GTC, a global technology conference taking place March 17-21, to hear how leading companies like Siemens are using the latest innovations in AI and graphics.\u00a0And join us for OpenUSD Day to learn how to build generative AI-enabled 3D pipelines and tools using Universal Scene Description.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Software \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We\u2019re also deep diving on new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.\nThe GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, the latest in the 40 Series lineup, is available today starting at $599.\nIt comes backed by NVIDIA Studio technologies, including hardware acceleration for 3D, video and AI workflows; optimizations for RTX hardware in over 110 popular creative apps; and exclusive NVIDIA Studio apps like Omniverse, Broadcast, Canvas and RTX Remix.\nVLC media player added RTX Video Super Resolution to automatically upscale video to 4K resolution and beyond. GeForce RTX 40 and 30 Series GPU owners will immediately benefit from improved virtual fidelity.\nThe RTX Remix runtime for remastering classic games is now available as open source on GitHub. It empowers the mod development community to extend Remix\u2019s game compatibility and feature set.\n\nCreators can install the new April NVIDIA Studio Driver, supporting these latest updates and more, available for download today.\nPlus, see how NVIDIA\u2019s Hauler piece came to life using the Omniverse USD Composer app, this week In the NVIDIA Studio.\nA Creator\u2019s Dream\nThe GeForce RTX 4070 joins NVIDIA\u2019s lineup of GPUs, featuring 12GB of ultra-fast GDDR6X VRAM with advancements of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture, primed to supercharge all content-creation workflows.\nIntroducing the GeForce RTX 4070.\nLike other GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, the GeForce RTX 4070 is much more efficient than previous-generation products, using 23% less power than the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti. Negligible amounts of power are used when the GPU is idle, or used for web browsing or watching videos, thanks to power-consumption enhancements in the GeForce RTX 40 Series.\u00a0\u00a0\nTested on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 and 3070 Ti GPUs. Omniverse testing measured FPS of 2K viewport average across five different scenes. Livestreaming quality measured as BD-SNR using NVENC 7th Gen with H.264, and NVENC 8th Gen with AV1, both using P7 (max quality) preset. Stable Diffusion testing measured number of images generated within 2 minute time frame for each GPU.\n3D modelers rendering 4K scenes with the AI-powered DLSS 3 technology in NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for creating and operating metaverse applications, can expect 2.8x faster performance than with the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti.\nBroadcasters deploying the eighth-generation NVIDIA video encoder, NVENC, with support for AV1, will\u00a0 enjoy 40% better efficiency. Livestreams will appear as if bitrate was increased by 40% \u2014 a big boost in image quality for popular broadcast apps like OBS Studio.\nPlus, AI enthusiasts using the Stable Diffusion deep learning model can generate detailed images conditioned on text descriptions 1.4x faster with the GeForce RTX 4070.\nRTX Video Super Resolution Comes to VLC Media Player\nVLC media player, a popular, free and open-source multimedia player for Windows PCs, has added RTX Video Super Resolution to intelligently upscale video to 4K resolutions and beyond.\n\nOwners of RTX 40 and 30 Series GPUs can now play local video on VLC with crisper edges and noticeably reduced compression artifacts.\nRTX 30 and 40 Series GPU owners will immediately benefit from improved virtual fidelity in VLC.\nAccess is quick and easy. Begin by downloading the full version of VLC. Once installed, open the NVIDIA Control Panel, navigate to Adjust video image settings and enable Super Resolution under RTX video enhancement.\nReady for RTX Remix Runtime\nRTX Remix, the newest app in the NVIDIA Studio suite, is a revolutionary modding tool used to enhance classic DirectX 8 and 9 games with full ray tracing, AI-enhanced textures and other graphics improvements.\nRemix is composed of two core components: a creator toolkit and a custom, open-source runtime.\nThe Remix creator toolkit, built on Omniverse and used to develop the hit remastered game Portal With RTX, allows modders to assign new assets and lights within their scene and use AI tools to rebuild the look of any asset. The RTX Remix creator toolkit will be available in early access soon.\nRemix runtime captures every element of a game scene, replacing assets at playback and injecting RTX technologies, such as path tracing, DLSS 3 and Reflex, into the game. Mod developers are already using the RTX Remix runtime from Portal With RTX to create experimental remastered scenes in numerous classic games.\nRemix runtime is ready to download on GitHub. Learn more about Remix runtime and its potential to transform game development.\nThe Remarkable Rocket Man\nNVIDIA\u2019s project Hauler launched to test the sheer amount of instancing that could occur in a unified project.\nInstancing, aka referencing, refers to the mass duplication of a model with minor variations, essential for populating massive 3D worlds with many detailed objects while maintaining realism. It\u2019s useful for creating scenes, say, in a forest with hundreds of trees, or in this instance, in outer space with thousands of asteroids.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nvidia-studio-itns-wk52-clip2-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nLead NVIDIA artist Rogelio Olguin, who has over 25 years of experience in the gaming industry, teamed up with colleagues to build a massive scene, rich with asteroids. Olguin loves a good challenge.\n\u201cI feel that one of the trappings of artists at times is that if you lose exploration and learning, you will just get stuck,\u201d said the artist. \u201cIt\u2019s important to explore and work on areas you\u2019re not good at as an artist to improve.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0\nKey concept art for Project \u201cHauler.\u201d\nThe team gathered reference materials from movies, shows and anime before putting it all together in a shared board for the team to add and edit. The collaborative board included thumbnail sketch storyboards made in Adobe Photoshop and preliminary concept art.\nConcept art started in USD Composer and completed in Adobe Photoshop.\nThe vast number of asteroids were procedurally created in SideFX Houdini, taking advantage of the RTX-accelerated Karma XPU renderer, which enables fast rendering of complex 3D models and simulations. It was all made possible by his GeForce RTX GPU.\nIt takes incredible skill and patience to model a single asteroid, much less several hundred.\nNext, Maxon\u2019s ZBrush was used to sculpt the main asteroids. The Drop 3D function was especially helpful in increasing the density of local meshes while maintaining high-resolution details.\n\u201cHauler\u201d concept art features realistic shadows, textures and lighting.\nThen came the animation phase in SideFX Houdini, building animations of the large and tiny cloud-based asteroids alike to ensure constant movement and rotation.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nvidia-studio-itns-wk52-clip1-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nOlguin stressed the importance of his GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU. \u201cVirtually every part of the process relied on RTX GPU technology, including path-traced rendering,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout RTX acceleration, this piece would have been impossible.\u201d\n\u201cHauler\u201d was brought together in Omniverse USD Composer.\nWith all components in place, the team worked in Omniverse USD Composer (formerly known as Create) to assemble complex, physically accurate simulations. They collaboratively edited 3D scenes in real time with ease.\n\u201cHaving a beast of a machine has sped up what I can do. I would dread going back to a slower machine.\u201d \u2014 Rogelio Olguin.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe primary benefit of using Omniverse USD Composer was being able to quickly see what I was doing, and place and compose our shots quickly, which made this so simple to work on,\u201c said Olguin.\nUSD Composer works with the Universal Scene Description (USD) format, enabling artists to choose their 3D app of choice. It supports Autodesk Maya, SideFX Houdini, Trimble SketchUp and more. It also removes pipeline bottlenecks, so there\u2019s no need for artists to constantly download, reformat, upload and download again.\nAfter all, using USD Composer to collaborate in 3D is just comet sense.\nStay tuned for more updates on Hauler.

To download and install, head to the Drivers tab of GeForce Experience or GeForce.com.\nThe new GeForce RTX 4070 is available now worldwide, equipped with 12GB of ultra-fast GDDR6X graphics memory, and all the advancements and benefits of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture, enabling you to max out your favorite games at 1440p.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Plague Tale: Requiem, Dying Light 2 Stay Human, Microsoft Flight Simulator, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, and other demanding games run at over 100 frames per second thanks to DLSS 3. And so do popular DLSS 2 games, such as Battlefield 2042, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, and Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd like other GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, the GeForce RTX 4070 is much more efficient than previous generation products, using 23% less power on average than the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, while running up to 1.7x faster with DLSS 3 when gaming.\nThe GeForce RTX 4070 also includes all the same advancements, enhancements, and innovations as other GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards, granting you access to a massive ecosystem of technologies and features that improve your gaming experiences, productivity, and creativity.\nPress and YouTubers have taken the new GeForce RTX 4070 through their rigorous tests, and here\u2019s a sampling of what they had to say:\n\n\u201cThrow DLSS 3 into the mix, with the black magic of Frame Generation, and you've now got a mighty tasty upgrade to what was a fantastic GPU back in the day.\u201d - PC Gamer\n\u201cNVIDIA hit the sweet spot for performance, size, power, noise, and temperatures, and with that, this could be a great SFF card.\u201d - LanOC\n\u201cNVIDIA\u2019s $599 GeForce RTX 4070 delivers superb 1440p gaming and ray tracing performance backed by excellent features like DLSS 3 Frame Generation and NVIDIA Reflex.\u201d - PCWorld\n\u201cFrom high 1080p gaming to low 4K, as well as for mid range graphics and video production, NVIDIA's RTX 4070 graphics card has got it covered.\u201d - CNET\n\u201cWhen compared to the Ampere cards we tested, the RTX 4070 feels like a good generational leap, especially if you\u2019re upgrading from the RTX 3070 Ti to Lovelace. It not only provides a boost in rasterization applications but provides a generational leap with its ray tracing performance. Throw DLSS on top of that and it begins to make an extremely compelling argument.\u201d - MMORPG\n\nFor a complete rundown of the GeForce RTX 4070\u2019s capabilities and features, be sure to check out our comprehensive announcement article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Games Supported By GeForce Experience\u2019s Optimal Settings\nGeForce Experience\u2019s one-click optimal settings enable you to instantly configure game options for your system\u2019s hardware, giving you smooth, optimized gameplay. Over 1000 titles are supported, and since our last driver release we\u2019ve added support for 4 more:\n\nBig Ambitions\nResident Evil 4\nSmalland: Survive The Wilds\nThe Last of Us Part I\n\nGeForce Experience also enables you to capture and stream your gameplay, take screenshots, upload videos to social networks, and more.

I had spent the last year teaching myself how to code in local cybercaf\u00e9s, and I was ready to do more \u2014 build my own websites, design computer games and share my creations with friends and family.\nI learned to code when I was 11, and one of my goals is to share this passion for learning and technology with as many people as possible. Coding is like learning a very useful language, and I want to help make it accessible for everyone.\nFour years ago, I created an online platform on Instagram and YouTube\u00a0offering tutorial videos to simplify coding concepts through fun, accessible lessons. Since then, I\u2019ve taught more than 100 students through four coding bootcamps I hosted both in person and virtually. It\u2019s a way to show that learning technical skills can be engaging, not intimidating.\n\nPath to NVIDIA\nThe laptop I acquired at age 12 hosted an NVIDIA GeForce graphics card, which I later discovered was responsible for making the characters in my favorite computer games look so fantastic. NVIDIA quickly earned a unique place in my heart for making my childhood gaming experience so enticing.\nI\u2019ve been fascinated with computers for as long as I can remember. Even before I had my own, I would find ways to access them. The cybercaf\u00e9 in my neighborhood was the first place I learned how to code, eliciting curious glances from others when they saw my screen.\nOver the years, my passion for coding grew, so choosing computer science as my college major came naturally. I pursued my bachelor\u2019s degree at Marymount University, in Virginia, under a full scholarship, and applied to NVIDIA for my junior-year internship as an engineer in the department of marketing operations. I was honored to accept a full-time offer after my internship.\n\nWorking as a web developer at NVIDIA has afforded me the opportunity to collaborate with a wide array of engineers, UI/UX designers and project managers, all doing our best work to reflect the company\u2019s excellence on our website. My role involves building front-end applications for the platform in a variety of web frameworks and technologies.\nBeyond teaching code and hosting bootcamps to make coding more accessible to others, I also believe in creating and providing opportunities for Black people, women and specifically Black women to find their space in tech and contribute to the industry.\nI followed my passion, and it\u2019s my hope that a young student who watches one of my videos thinks, \u201cI can do that too.\u201d\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | NVIDIA LifeTags: Education \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This generation of graphics cards has been marked by high performance and even higher prices, but the RTX 4070 gives us the first glimpse of what a truly mid-range graphics card might look like in 2023. And, given that AMD hasn\u2019t released any mid-range graphics cards at all this generation, it seems like Nvidia might be pulling ahead in the value game \u2013 at least if you can call a $599 graphics card \u201cvalue\u201d.Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Founders Edition \u2013 Photos6 ImagesMid-range at Last?The biggest pitfall for the Nvidia RTX 40-series cards has been the high asking price. The Nvidia RTX 4080 launched at $1,199 when its last-gen counterpart launched at $699, and the 4070 Ti launched at $799 when its last-gen counterpart launched at $599. Across the board Nvidia has been raising the price on graphics cards, sometimes even drastically. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 is a little bit guilty of this as well, coming out at $599 to the RTX 3070\u2019s $499 launch price. But when you look at the new graphics card in the context of both Nvidia and AMD\u2019s current lineups, the RTX 4070 looks like a true mid-range graphics card. That price will go up a bit if you go for an aftermarket card design from the likes of Asus, MSI, or one of the myriad companies that make graphics cards, but if you can find an RTX 4070 at around $599 - $699, it\u2019s a great graphics card. As I\u2019ll get into a bit later, the RTX 4070 delivers performance that is on average about half the speed of the $1,599 RTX 4090, but is a full thousand bucks cheaper. For the first time in Nvidia\u2019s Ada Lovelace GPU lineup, Team Green has delivered something that\u2019s genuinely a decent value. It\u2019s something I honestly didn\u2019t think would happen, given the awful price-to-performance ratio of the RTX 4080, but I\u2019m at least happy there\u2019s finally a graphics card I can recommend to friends in good conscience.RTX 4070 \u2013 Design and SpecsThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 is built on the same Ada Lovelace graphics architecture as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090, which means it packs the same fourth-generation Tensor Cores and third-generation RT (ray tracing) cores. The RTX 4070 itself has 46 Streaming Processors, each of which has 1 RT core, 4 Tensor Cores and 32 CUDA cores. That all combines to a total of 5,888 CUDA cores, 46 RT cores and 184 Tensor cores. All told, it\u2019s one powerful graphics card in its own right, even if it does pale in comparison to something like the RTX 4090. Out of the box, the RTX 4070 will boost up to around 2.4GHz in games, but does so with a TBP (total board power) of only 200W. This is great for a graphics card of this caliber. Not only does it mean games go fast, but it allows for the absolutely tiny size of the RTX 4070 Founders Edition board. I can\u2019t think of a single PC case I have ever seen that won\u2019t have space for this baby. The graphics card is 9.5 inches long and just 1.5 inches thick. After the triple-slot monstrosities that were the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080, it\u2019s nice to see Nvidia still has some restraint in its graphics card designs. What kind of cooling do you use in your PC?Air coolerAIO water coolerSoft-line custom water coolingHard-line custom water coolingOther (let us know in the comments!)AnswerSee ResultsBut even with a tiny cooler, the RTX 4070 stays pretty cool, reaching only 72\u00b0C in our benchmark suite. That\u2019s because the RTX 4070 Founders Edition has a similar fan layout to the other RTX 40-series cards, with two fans on opposite sides of each other that suck air through the bottom of the card and then blow it out towards the top of your PC case. To make room for this design, though, Nvidia had to yet again take a different approach to designing the GPU board itself, meaning that even with this modestly-powered card, you\u2019re going to need a power adapter unless you\u2019re one of the three people in the world with a power supply with a PCIe 5 cable. A power adapter does come in the box, but we\u2019re still in this weird transitionary period between cable standards, and it\u2019s not like AMD is going to be following suit any time soon \u2013 ye olde 8-pin PCIe power cables probably aren\u2019t going anywhere, no matter how much Nvidia pushes these new connectors. RTX 4070 \u2013 Performance No matter how pretty a graphics card may be, it lives or dies by its gaming performance, and the RTX 4070 is absolutely incredible for the price. Test system: AMD Ryzen 9 7950X, Asus ROG Crosshair X670E HERO, 32GB G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo DDR5 @ 6000Hz, 1TB PNY CS3140 SSD, EVGA Supernova 1000W P2 PSUTo be clear, it\u2019s not about to take the performance crown from the RTX 4090 or anything \u2013 far from it actually \u2013 but it delivers performance that is quite a bit better than I had expected for a budget graphics card, if you can call it \u201cbudget\u201d. Just looking at synthetic benchmarks, the RTX 4070 is about 20% slower than the RTX 4070 Ti in Port Royal, which is a benchmark that looks at raw ray tracing performance. Then, in the 3DMark Speed Way test, which tests DirectX performance more broadly, the performance gap narrows to just 18%. Mind you, the RTX 4070 is 25% cheaper than the RTX 4070 Ti, so the math is on the weaker card\u2019s side. But it gets even more impressive when you compare the RTX 4070 to the RTX 4090. The RTX 4070 manages about 43% of the performance of the RTX 4090 in Port Royal, despite having dramatically less RT cores. The gap is similar in Speed Way too. But when you look at the cost of the two cards, the RTX 4070 is $599 to the RTX 4090\u2019s $1,599. So you get 43-48% of the performance of the 4090, but you\u2019re only paying around 37% of the cost. When the RTX 4080 came out and was just miles behind the RTX 4090 despite costing nearly as much, it was a slap in the face to gamers that just wanted an affordable graphics card to throw into their PC. From the numbers I\u2019m looking at, it looks like the RTX 4070 is a step in the right direction, though it is still more expensive than the RTX 3070 or 2070 were. Synthetic benchmarks only tell part of the story, though. At 1440p, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 absolutely shines, delivering high-framerate gameplay, even with ray tracing enabled. In the gaming benchmarks, I enabled DLSS for Nvidia cards and FSR for AMD cards, but didn\u2019t test any game that only supported DLSS, as this would skew the results too heavily. DLSS and FSR were enabled in performance mode at 4K and balanced mode at 1440p. My thought process here is that if you\u2019re playing a game that supports one of these modes, you should be enabling it to get a better framerate anyways, so testing in this way provides a realistic look at how these GPUs will perform in real-world gaming. With that little disclaimer out of the way, the RTX 4070 delivers more than 100 fps at 1440p in 3 of the games I tested, and is far above 60 fps in all of them. Even in Cyberpunk 2077, the heaviest game I tested, the RTX 4070 manages 82 fps at 1440p with ray tracing enabled and DLSS on balanced.That\u2019s 62% of the RTX 4090\u2019s performance at the same resolution and settings and 83% of the RTX 4070 Ti\u2019s performance. In fact, the RTX 4070 punches above its weight class in every gaming benchmark I tried, even at 4K. In Cyberpunk 2077 at 4K, the RTX 4070 managed 53 fps to the RTX 4090\u2019s 106 fps, and in Forza Horizon 5, the 4070 managed 100 fps to the 4090\u2019s 166 fps. So while the RTX 4070 is only theoretically 45% as fast as the RTX 4090, in actual games, it\u2019s closer to 50-60%. And when the RTX 4070 is almost a third of the price, it\u2019s hard to justify saving up for months for the more expensive flagship.DLSS is BackAs with any other Nvidia card, the RTX 4070 supports DLSS, but new with this generation is DLSS 3.0. This technology uses machine learning to generate extra frames while waiting for the CPU, essentially raising frame rates even higher, though artificially. In Cyberpunk 2077, DLSS can raise frame rates by up to 40%\u201cThis tech does add a bit of latency to the game, but nothing noticeable. In Cyberpunk 2077, it can raise frame rates by up to 40% in my testing. This new version of DLSS is best used for frame rates above 100 fps, which is going to be music to any esports gamer\u2019s ears. DLSS frame generation is exclusive to Nvidia\u2019s latest 40-series cards, so you won\u2019t be able to use it with your RTX 3000 or 2000 cards. Beyond the new hotness, though, the RTX 4070 naturally supports DLSS 2.0, which is what I used for most of my testing \u2013 alongside FSR for AMD cards. DLSS makes the RTX 4070 into an actual 4K contender, which hasn\u2019t really been the case for any xx70 Nvidia cards in the past. And even if you\u2019re sticking to 1440p, you\u2019re going to make the high frame rates this graphics card naturally manages even higher. The technology really has never been better, and has changed a lot since it debuted in Battlefield V \u2013 remember that grainy mess? I promise, it\u2019s better now.Purchasing GuideThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Founders Edition will be available April 13th for $599. There will be other versions of the RTX 4070 from manufacturers like MSI and Gigabyte, and those prices will start at $599 but could be significantly more expensive. VerdictAt $599, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 is the first graphics card of this generation that actually provides decent performance for the money. The fact that the RTX 4070 is able to provide such stellar performance, hitting around 50-60% of the RTX 4090 at nearly a third of the price, means that anyone who gets the RTX 4070 won\u2019t be losing out on a high-end gaming experience just because they don\u2019t have a fat bank account. With the RTX 4070 being as good as it is, I can\u2019t wait to see what the RTX 4060 and 4050 are going to be able to do \u2013 whenever it is Nvidia will grace us with their presence. In This ArticleNvidia GeForce RTX 4070NVIDIARTX 4070 Review8Review scoringgreatThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 is the first RTX 40-series graphics card that actually delivers solid value for most people. It doesn\u2019t blow away the competition, but at this price it doesn\u2019t really need to.

To enable it, either open the NVIDIA Control Panel and then turn on the \"Image Scaling\" option found in the \"Manage 3D Settings\" tab, or open GeForce Experience, click on the \"Settings\" icon, pick general settings, scroll down to the \"Image Scaling\" tab and turn it on.\n\n\nIf you own an NVIDIA graphics card and want to improve performance in a game that doesn't support DLSS nor FSR, you can take advantage of NVIDIA's Image Scaling feature. But what is NVIDIA Image Scaling anyway, and how do you enable it? \n                        NVIDIA Image Scaling Explained\n               \nImage scaling is NVIDIA's upscaling technology that works in any game. The technology is based on a simple upscaling algorithm aided by a sharpening filter. It takes the output image rendered at a lower resolution and upscales it to the native resolution of your monitor.\nThe final result is an upscaled and sharpened image that doesn't look as good as an image rendered in native resolution, but at least you get a noticeable performance boost. NVIDIA Image Scaling is driver-based, meaning you can enable it in any game, even those that support DLSS, FSR, or Intel's XeSS.\nImage Scaling includes five quality settings, each rendering the image at a lower internal resolution than your monitor's native resolution. These settings are 85%, 77%, 67%, 59%, and 50% of the native resolution of your monitor.\nOn a 3440 x 1440 ultrawide monitor, which we're using, these settings translate to the following display resolutions: 2924 x 1224, 2646 x 1108, 2293 x 960, 2024 x 947, and 1720 x 720, respectively.\nWe recommend sticking to the highest, 85% setting. You can go lower if you really need those extra frames, but the image quality at settings lower than 85% looks too shabby for us to recommend using any setting lower than 85% of the native resolution, at least on a 1440p or 1440p ultrawide panel.\n\n\n\nYou can use NVIDIA Image Scaling in games only in Fullscreen mode. \n\n\n            NVIDIA Image Scaling vs. DLSS vs. FSR\n    \nNVIDIA Image Scaling is quite similar to AMD's FSR in that both use a simple spatial upscaling algorithm and a sharpening filter, and don't require specific hardware, unlike DLSS. The difference is that developers must specifically implement AMD FSR on a per-game basis. On the other hand, you can use Image Scaling in any game by enabling the option in the NVIDIA Control Panel or GeForce Experience.\nRelated: 7 NVIDIA GeForce Experience Features You Should Be Using\nBeing driver-based means that NVIDIA Image Scaling upscales the entire image. In contrast, AMD FSR only upscales the rendered image of the actual game while the HUD and other UI elements, such as menus, are displayed at native resolution. This makes FSR better regarding overall image quality because the HUD and other UI elements look sharper.\nCompared to NVIDIA DLSS, NVIDIA Image Scaling doesn't require special hardware in the form of Tensor cores found in RTX 2000 and newer graphics cards. It also doesn't require training data for every game that supports it because Image Scaling utilizes a simple spatial upscaling algorithm and not a deep learning AI model that combines temporal data with motion vectors to produce the final image.\nDLSS offers much better image quality and noticeably higher performance boost on average, but again, you can only use it in games that support it. NVIDIA Image Scaling doesn't look as good, but you can use it in virtually any PC game.\nBelow you can see a comparison between NVIDIA DLSS, Image Scaling, and AMD FSR 2.0 in Ghostwire Tokyo. As you can see, DLSS is clearly the best choice, with AMD FSR 2.0 being behind but still including more details than NVIDIA Image Scaling. In the middle, you can see NVIDIA Image Scaling set to the highest setting ---85 percent of our 3440 x 1440 ultrawide resolution, which equals 2924 x 1224. It gives the worst image quality of the three, with missing details from the \"El Dorados\" hotel sign, along murky textures on the building below the hotel sign and the tree in front of the yellow building.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, NVIDIA Image Scaling can come in handy when you need extra performance in titles that don't support DLSS nor FSR. As long as you're okay with worse image quality than DLSS or FSR 2.0. \n                        How to Enable NVIDIA Image Scaling\n               \nThere are two ways to enable NVIDIA Image Scaling. The first one is for users who don't have GeForce Experience installed on their computers. \n            Method 1: Enable NVIDIA Image Scaling in NVIDIA Control Panel\n    \nTo turn on NVIDIA Image Scaling in the NVIDIA Control Panel right, click on your desktop and then click the \"NVIDIA Control Panel\" button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce there, click the \"Manage 3D Settings\" tab, then the \"Image Scaling\" option. Turn the option on and close the NVIDIA Control Panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, enter any game, make sure you have full-screen enabled ---NVIDIA Image Scaling only works in full-screen--- and then set the custom resolution you want to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Method 2: Enable NVIDIA Image Scaling in NVIDIA GeForce Experience\n    \nYou can also enable Image Scaling by NVIDIA in the GeForce Experience app if you have it installed on your PC. The procedure is pretty straightforward.\nThe first step is opening GeForce Experience. If the app's running in the background, find its icon on the Taskbar notification area. We have our icons hidden, so we clicked on the \"Show Hidden Icons\" button. Next, double-click the GeForce experience icon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't have icons hidden on your Taskbar just double-click the GeForce Experience icon. And if GeForce Experience isn't working in background, type \"GeForce Experience\" in the Windows Search box and open the app.\nOnce you open the app, click on the \"Settings\" icon in the form of a cog, click the \"General\" tab, scroll down to the \"Image Scaling\" tab, and click on the toggle. In there, you can also select the preset for games GeForce Experience automatically optimizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo enable NVIDIA Image scaling in-game, enter the game and set one of the five resolutions listed on the \"Image Scaling\" tab in GeForce Experience.

Now, a new Cyberpunk 2077 update has hit the streets, featuring the technology preview of the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, which enhances the game\u2019s already-amazing visuals with full ray tracing, otherwise known as path tracing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull ray tracing accurately simulates light throughout an entire scene. It is used by visual effects artists to create film and TV graphics that are indistinguishable from reality, but until the arrival of GeForce RTX GPUs with RT Cores, and the AI-powered acceleration of NVIDIA DLSS, real-time video game full ray\u00a0 tracing was impossible because it's extremely GPU intensive.\nPrevious techniques separately addressed ray-traced shadows, reflections and global illumination for a small number of light sources. Full ray tracing models the properties of light from a virtually unlimited number of emissive sources, delivering physically correct shadows, reflections and global illumination on all objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor even more info on the making of the new Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, check out our interview with CD PROJEKT RED\nThe technology preview for Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode is a sneak peek into the future of full ray tracing, and we are working with CD PROJEKT RED on further full ray tracing enhancements, bug fixes, and performance optimizations. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRasterization based lighting pipelines rely on many independent subsystems. It's not uncommon that they can create unbalanced lighting in more complex scenarios. Ray tracing significantly improved overall quality and some of the main pain points of each subsystem. The unified fully ray-traced pipeline builds on these advances and completely removes the need for extensive per-scene tweaking, delivering amazing and predictable results each time, while also improving image quality, immersion, and realism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most impactful additions in the technology preview of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode is NVIDIA RTX Direct Illumination (RTXDI), a free SDK that enables developers to closely replicate the appearance of light in scenes with numerous light sources. With RTXDI, thousands of objects can emit ray-traced light. \nIn Cyberpunk 2077, each neon sign, street lamp, LED billboard, car headlight, and other source of light is now ray-traced, bathing objects, walls, passing cars and pedestrians in accurate lighting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull ray tracing helps with grounding objects within their surroundings, like the car above. Click here to view the comparison in 4K\nWith full ray tracing and RTXDI, now practically all light sources cast physically correct soft shadows, a feat previously unimaginable using previous approaches. Players will experience enhanced shadowing, with better depth, detail and realism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matter how geometrically complex a scene gets, pipes, rails, staircases, and other objects will now get proper shadows from all the shadow casting lights in their vicinity.

To upgrade indirect lighting from all emissive sources, including the sun and moon, Global Illumination (GI) needed to be path traced, too. Rendering techniques including Screen Space Reflections, Screen Space Ambient Occlusion, and the existing GI solutions were replaced by a single unified algorithm that delivers more accurate lighting of scenes and objects.\nWith the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode enabled, natural colored lighting bounces multiple times throughout Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s world, creating more realistic indirect lighting and occlusion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sunlight bounces off the floor to indirectly light a cardboard stack for more realistic lighting and occlusion. Click here to view the comparison in 4K\nReflections now incorporate bounced detail, too, and are rendered at full resolution, accentuating the cyberpunk aesthetic and further heightening immersion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull ray tracing helps to balance the diffuse and specular response of materials to the light, resulting in even more realistic reflections. Click here to view the comparison in 4K\nCombined, the full ray tracing of direct and global illumination give gamers the most advanced real-time lighting seen to date in gaming, and a preview of how all games will look in the future.\nTo bring these incredible effects to life, at performant frame rates, CD PROJEKT RED and NVIDIA have worked hand in hand to introduce new optimizations for this entirely new fully ray-traced pipeline.\nNVIDIA Shader Execution Reordering (SER) helps GPUs with executing incoherent workloads boosting performance, NVIDIA Real-Time Denoisers (NRD) have been leveraged to further improve performance and image quality, and our drivers have been specially tuned to optimize frame rates. So be sure to update to the Cyberpunk 2077 Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode GeForce Game Ready Driver.\nTogether with NVIDIA DLSS 3, the performance multiplier, these technologies, tweaks and optimizations enable GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers to play Cyberpunk 2077 fully ray-traced with maximum performance.\nWith DLSS 3 activated, 4K performance on a GeForce RTX 4090 will be boosted by 4.6X to 103 FPS, and on a GeForce RTX 4080, performance leaps by 5X to 74 FPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHere at CD PROJEKT RED we are very proud to be technology innovators, and DLSS 3 gives us meaningful performance gains to tackle the addition of even higher levels of ray tracing to deliver a visually rich experience for our gamers.\u201d - Jakub Knapik, VP, Global Art Director, CD PROJEKT RED\u00a0\nAt 1440p, GeForce RTX 4070 Ti performance increases by 3.1X using DLSS 3, to 80 FPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn recently-released GeForce RTX 40 Series laptops, DLSS 3 multiplies performance by 3X, enabling laptop owners to experience the fully ray-traced Night City anywhere in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, full ray tracing is extremely GPU intensive. For\u00a0the technology preview of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, we currently recommend a GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU and NVIDIA DLSS 3.\nThose without a game-ready device can also experience Cyberpunk 2077 with DLSS 3 and full ray tracing in the new Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode by streaming it from the cloud with a GeForce NOW Ultimate membership, which gives you the power of a GeForce RTX 4080-class PC in the cloud.\nFor the very best experience with Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s new fully ray traced mode, download our latest Game Ready Drivers for your PC or laptop from GeForce.com or GeForce Experience.

The software includes all the code, examples and documentation businesses need to add safety to AI apps that generate text.\nToday\u2019s release comes as many industries are adopting LLMs, the powerful engines behind these AI apps. They\u2019re answering customers\u2019 questions, summarizing lengthy documents, even writing software and accelerating drug design.\nNeMo Guardrails is designed to help users keep this new class of AI-powered applications safe.\nPowerful Models, Strong Rails\nSafety in generative AI is an industry-wide concern. NVIDIA designed NeMo Guardrails to work with all LLMs, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\nThe software lets developers align LLM-powered apps so they\u2019re safe and stay within the domains of a company\u2019s expertise.\nNeMo Guardrails enables developers to set up three kinds of boundaries:\n\nTopical guardrails prevent apps from veering off into undesired areas. For example, they keep customer service assistants from answering questions about the weather.\nSafety guardrails ensure apps respond with accurate, appropriate information. They can filter out unwanted language and enforce that references are made only to credible sources.\nSecurity guardrails restrict apps to making connections only to external third-party applications known to be safe.\n\nVirtually every software developer can use NeMo Guardrails \u2014 no need to be a machine learning expert or data scientist. They can create new rules quickly with a few lines of code.\nRiding Familiar Tools\nSince NeMo Guardrails is open source, it can work with all the tools that enterprise app developers use.\nFor example, it can run on top of LangChain, an open-source toolkit that developers are rapidly adopting to plug third-party applications into the power of LLMs.\n\u201cUsers can easily add NeMo Guardrails to LangChain workflows to quickly put safe boundaries around their AI-powered apps,\u201d said Harrison Chase, who created the LangChain toolkit and a startup that bears its name.\nIn addition, NeMo Guardrails is designed to be able to work with a broad range of LLM-enabled applications, such as Zapier. Zapier is an automation platform used by over 2 million businesses, and it\u2019s seen first-hand how users are integrating AI into their work.\n\u201cSafety, security, and trust are the cornerstones of responsible AI development, and we\u2019re excited about NVIDIA\u2019s proactive approach to embed these guardrails into AI systems,\u201d said Reid Robinson, lead product manager of AI at Zapier.\n\u201cWe look forward to the good that will come from making AI a dependable and trusted part of the future.\u201d\nAvailable as Open Source and From NVIDIA\nNVIDIA is incorporating NeMo Guardrails into the NVIDIA NeMo framework, which includes everything users need to train and tune language models using a company\u2019s proprietary data.\nMuch of the NeMo framework is already available as open source code on GitHub.\u00a0 Enterprises also can get it as a complete and supported package, part of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform.\nNeMo is also available as a service. It\u2019s part of NVIDIA AI Foundations, a family of cloud services for businesses that want to create and run custom generative AI models based on their own datasets and domain knowledge.\nUsing NeMo, South Korea\u2019s leading mobile operator built an intelligent assistant that\u2019s had 8 million conversations with its customers. A research team in Sweden employed NeMo to create LLMs that can automate text functions for the country\u2019s hospitals, government and business offices.\nAn Ongoing Community Effort\nBuilding good guardrails for generative AI is a hard problem that will require lots of ongoing research as AI evolves.\nNVIDIA made NeMo Guardrails \u2014 the product of several years\u2019 research \u2014 open source to contribute to the developer community\u2019s tremendous energy and work on AI safety.\nTogether, our efforts on guardrails will help companies keep their smart services aligned with safety, privacy and security requirements so these engines of innovation stay on track.\nFor more details on NeMo Guardrails and to get started, see our technical blog, and watch the video below.\n\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Cybersecurity | Machine Learning | NVIDIA Foundation | NVIDIA NeMo | Open Source | Trustworthy AI \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

With all the advancements and benefits of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture, the GeForce RTX 4070 lets you max out your favorite games at 1440p.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Plague Tale: Requiem, Dying Light 2 Stay Human, Microsoft Flight Simulator, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, and other demanding games run at over 100 frames per second thanks to DLSS 3. And so do popular DLSS 2 games, such as Battlefield 2042, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, and Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike other GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, the GeForce RTX 4070 is much more efficient than previous generation products, using 23% less power than the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, while running up to 1.7x faster with DLSS 3 when gaming. And it uses negligible amounts while idle, web browsing, or watching videos thanks to architectural enhancements of the GeForce RTX 40 Series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nRTX 2070 SUPER\nRTX 3070 Ti\nRTX 4070\n\n\nIdle (W)\n11\n12\n10\n\n\nVideo Playback (W)\n15\n20\n16\n\n\nAverage Gaming (W)\n205\n240\n186\n\n\nTGP (W)\n215\n290\n200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee these benefits in action, in a clip from A Plague Tale: Requiem, where the GeForce RTX 4070 runs the game much faster, while consuming substantially less power than last-generation\u2019s GeForce RTX 3070 Ti.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to the RTX 2070 SUPER, the GeForce RTX 4070 is 2.6x faster with DLSS 3 on average, and the GeForce RTX 4070 is 1.4x faster than the GeForce RTX 3080 with DLSS 3 on average. DLSS 3 provides Ada GPUs with a tremendous performance boost, but the GeForce RTX 4070 also excels in traditional games that don\u2019t include more advanced features such as ray tracing and DLSS. In these rasterized games, the GeForce RTX 4070 is on par with the GeForce RTX 3080 while running at nearly half the power, and offering an additional 2GB of memory.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX ON: GeForce Gamers Embrace Ray Tracing & DLSS\nIn 2018, we began a gaming revolution with the launch of 1st generation GeForce RTX graphics cards. Since the release of the very first games decades ago, lighting had been faked, and various hacks employed to approximate shadows, reflections, and other real-world properties. GeForce RTX made real-time ray tracing a reality, enabling developers to realistically render reflections and lighting, making their games more immersive and enjoyable. And with DLSS 1.0, we invented a game-changing way for players to accelerate frame rates.\nBack in 2018 there were 4 RTX games, 37% of GeForce RTX gamers enabled ray tracing, and 26% activated DLSS 1.0.\nFive years later, we\u2019re at the 3rd generation of RTX, with the release of GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards.\u00a0Now, DLSS 3 multiplies performance with AI-accelerated Frame Generation in 30 games. DLSS 2 accelerates frame rates in over 280 games and apps with image quality that\u2019s as-good, or sometimes even better than native resolution TAA rendering. NVIDIA Reflex reduces system latency for a more responsive and enjoyable experience in over 70 games. And new technologies such as Shader Execution Reordering (SER), Opacity Micromaps (OMM), NVIDIA RTX Direct Illumination (RTXDI), and RTX Global Illumination (RTXGI) enable developers to create incredible ray-traced effects with performant frame rates and far less effort.\nAmong gamers, the massive strides RTX has made are well known, and the latest integrations are used by the majority of RTX owners. Of the millions of GeForce RTX desktop GPU owners, 83% of 40 Series gamers enabled ray tracing, and 79% of 40 Series gamers accelerated performance with DLSS in RTX capable games.\nThe popularity and adoption of ray tracing and DLSS has outpaced other advancements and technologies, such as 4K, which is used by 28% of gamers, and 144Hz+ high refresh rate gaming monitors, which are used by 62% of GeForce RTX 40 Series desktops GPU owners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverwatch 2 Ultimate Battle Pass Bundle Available Until May 8th\nIf you purchase a participating GeForce RTX 4090, 4080, 4070 Ti, or 4070 graphics card or desktop PC before May 8th, 2023, you\u2019ll receive the new Overwatch 2 Ultimate Battle Pass Bundle plus an additional 1,000 OW2 coins.\n\nSeason 4 Ultimate Battle Pass Bundle Includes:\n  \nSeason 4 Premium Battle Pass\n2,000 OW2 Coins\n20 Tier Skips\nInfinite Guard: 76 Legendary Skin\nInfinite Ace D.Va Epic Skin\nInfinite Airwings Weapon Charm\n \n1,000 Additional OW2 Coins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing one of our participating GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, barriers to your success are eliminated, with actions occurring virtually without delay, and performance so high that you\u2019ll see the action at its best with maximum clarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all the details, head to our Overwatch 2 bundle announcement article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounter-Strike 2 Features NVIDIA Reflex\nValve has announced Counter-Strike 2, a graphical and technological update that\u2019ll upgrade Counter-Strike: Global Offensive to the Source 2 engine. The latest edition leverages newer graphics APIs for improved fidelity and responsiveness. NVIDIA is collaborating with Valve to ensure latency is at an absolute minimum with the addition of NVIDIA Reflex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex optimizes the render pipeline to reduce system side latency by up to 35%! This results in improved response times and minimizing peeker's advantage in online gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay locked and loaded for more information on Counter-Strike 2 and NVIDIA Reflex as we get closer to the game\u2019s launch.\nRTX Remix Runtime Open Source Available Now\nRTX Remix is a revolutionary modding tool used to enhance classic DirectX 8 and 9 games with path tracing, NVIDIA DLSS, AI-enhanced textures, and user created assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Remix, part of the NVIDIA Studio suite of apps, is composed of two core components that work together to enable modders to remaster classic PC games: the RTX Remix creator toolkit, and a custom RTX Remix runtime.\nThe RTX Remix creator toolkit, built on NVIDIA Omniverse and used to develop Portal with RTX, allows modders to assign new assets and lights within their remastered scene and use AI tools to rebuild the look of any asset. The RTX Remix creator toolkit Early Access is coming soon.\nThe RTX Remix runtime captures a game scene, and replaces assets at playback while injecting RTX technology, such as path tracing, DLSS 3 and Reflex, into the game. Already, mod developers have been using the RTX Remix runtime from Portal With RTX to create experimental ray traced scenes in numerous classic games.\nTo further empower the mod development community to extend Remix\u2019s game compatibility and feature set, NVIDIA is releasing the RTX Remix runtime as open source on GitHub today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RTX Remix runtime is open source with a permissive MIT license, which unlocks numerous possibilities to extend the feature set of the Remix runtime. A few examples of projects that advanced mod developers might tackle via source code access include making more of their favorite games compatible with Remix, modernizing the fluid simulation to render smoke and fire with realistic volumetrics, or incorporating virtual reality support into the renderer.\nGet all the details about the open source release, and learn how to download and use it in our dedicated NVIDIA RTX Remix Runtime Open Source article.\nBoost Live Streaming Video Quality With AV1\nNVIDIA is partnering with YouTube and OBS to level-up streaming video quality in a big way. For the first time ever, streamers will be able to broadcast their content live with AV1 encoded video. The AV1 codec is up to 40% more efficient in data compression!\nFor broadcasters and viewers, this means watching higher fidelity video streams with a noticeable reduction in blocky compression artifacts commonly seen on live broadcasts. Best of all, with AV1, streamers can now broadcast at full 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, delivering a new level of richness and quality to their eager audience.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, including the new GeForce RTX 4070, support hardware accelerated AV1 encoding. When released, OBS will let streamers and gamers use their GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU to encode their stream to AV1 and live stream directly to YouTube. Every viewer will see huge improvements in visual quality, even if they don\u2019t have AV1 compatible hardware. YouTube will transcode and stream video to deliver the best visual experience.\nNow available in beta, AV1 support in OBS 29.1 and YouTube will be available in full release soon.\nGeForce RTX 4070 Is Perfect For Streamers & Creators\nThe NVIDIA Studio platform enables creators, including livestreamers and video editors, to work faster and smarter with RTX acceleration and AI tools. It\u2019s a platform for content creators that supercharges 110 creative apps with RTX GPUs, provides lasting stability with NVIDIA Studio Drivers, and includes a powerful suite of Studio apps, such as NVIDIA Omniverse, Canvas, Broadcast and RTX Remix.\nAV1 is also enabled in the top video editing apps, including Adobe Premiere Pro (via the Voukoder plugin), DaVinci Resolve, and Jianying (the top video editing app in China). Along with the improved quality that AV1 delivers, the GeForce RTX 4070 features an 8th Generation NVIDIA Encoder, enabling up to 20% faster video export speed.\nNVIDIA Broadcast, part of the NVIDIA Studio suite, also provides livestreamers the ability to transform any room into a home studio. The latest 1.4 update brings two new effects, Eye Contact and Vignette to enhance any livestream for RTX 4070 GPU owners.\n3D creators see up to 40% increase in performance compared to the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti in the most popular apps \u2014 like Blender, Unity, Unreal Engine and Chaos V-Ray. They also unlock creative freedom by unifying 3D assets, libraries, and tools in NVIDIA Omniverse. \nAnd all creators can benefit from the new 4th generation Tensor Cores for AI tools, providing up to 2X increased performance compared to last gen.\nThe GeForce RTX 4070 Supports Our New RTX Video Super Resolution Technology\nLast month saw the launch of RTX Video Super Resolution (RTX VSR), a new feature that combines the power of NVIDIA Tensor cores with state of the art AI image processing techniques to improve the quality of streamed 1080p video on your higher resolution display.

Exceptional responsiveness is maintained through NVIDIA Reflex, which reduces input lag between devices and monitors.\nRay-tracing performance has also significantly improved, thanks to advancements like Shader Execution Reordering (SER), cutting-edge Opacity Micromap, and Displaced Micro-Mesh Engines. These innovations enable even the most demanding games to simultaneously implement multiple ray-tracing effects or even full ray tracing, also known as path tracing, for unparalleled realism and immersion.\nThis potent combination of third-generation ray tracing and DLSS has resulted in a 16x leap in ray-tracing operations per pixel over the past five years. Adoption rates have soared, with over 400 RTX games and applications available, with adoption of DLSS 3 happening 7x faster than its predecessor.\nClass-Leading Performance and Features\r\nCompared to the RTX 2070 SUPER, the GeForce RTX 4070 is on average 2.6x faster with DLSS 3, and on average 1.4x faster than the GeForce RTX 3080 with DLSS 3.\nDLSS 3 provides Ada Lovelace GPUs with a tremendous performance boost, but the GeForce RTX 4070 also excels in traditional games that do not include more advanced features such as ray tracing and DLSS.\nIn these rasterized games, the GeForce RTX 4070 is on par with the GeForce RTX 3080 while running at nearly half the power \u2014 and offering an additional 2GB of memory. Additionally, the RTX 4070\u2019s memory subsystem has been enhanced with 36MB of L2 cache and 12GB of ultra-high-speed GDDR6X memory.\nPerfect for Content Creators\r\nThe GeForce RTX 4070 GPU comes backed by the NVIDIA Studio platform, which enables content creators to work faster and smarter with RTX acceleration and AI tools. Serving creators from livestreamers to video editors, the platform supercharges 100 creative apps, provides lasting stability with NVIDIA Studio Drivers and includes a powerful suite of Studio apps, such as NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122, Canvas and Broadcast.\n3D modelers rendering 4K scenes with the AI-powered DLSS 3 in NVIDIA Omniverse \u2014 a hub to interconnect existing 3D workflows, replacing linear pipelines with live-sync creation for real-time collaboration \u2014 can expect 2.8x faster performance than with last generation\u2019s GeForce RTX 3070 Ti.\nBroadcasters deploying the eighth-generation NVIDIA video encoder NVENC, with support for AV1, will enjoy 40% better efficiency. Livestreams will appear as if bitrate was increased by 40% \u2014 a big boost in image quality for popular broadcast apps like OBS Studio. AV1 is already supported in Discord with a full release coming to YouTube via OBS Studio soon.\nVideo editors will see 20% faster video export speeds, thanks to the eighth-generation NVIDIA encoder on the GeForce RTX 4070, along with AV1 incorporated into top video editing apps.\nAnd all creators can benefit from the new fourth-generation Tensor Cores for AI tools, providing a significant performance increase from the last generation.\nWhere to Buy\r\nThe GeForce RTX 4070 will be available starting tomorrow at $599.\nAn NVIDIA Founders Edition design will be available directly from NVIDIA.com and select retailers. Custom boards, including stock-clocked and factory-overclocked models, will be available from top add-in card providers such as ASUS, Colorful, Gainward, GALAX, GIGABYTE, INNO3D, KFA2, MSI, Palit, PNY and ZOTAC.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company\u2019s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling the creation of the metaverse.

Many areas along the banks of the Narmada River in the Barwani, Dhar, Khargone and Alirajpur districts of Madhya Pradesh are submerged due to the backwaters of the dam in Gujarat.A large number of displaced persons, led by Patkar, staged a sit-in protest at the office of the Narmada Valley Development Authority (NVDA), a government department, in Indore on Tuesday over alleged discrepancies in the rehabilitation of people and the award of compensation.\"The GRA does not have a single judge for months, whereas according to a 2015 order of the apex court, it should have five judges,\" said Patkar. \n\nFPJ Shorts\n\n\n\n\n\nThane Congress Warns Of Protest Over 10-Day Garbage Pile-Up; Demands Civic Action\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMumbai News: Body Of Unidentified Man Found At Marine Drive Shore; Probe Underway (Video)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u20b9122 Crore New India Co-op Bank Scam: EOW Seizes \u20b928 Crore Properties Of Bhanu Couple\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctaFX Money Laundering Case: OctaFX\u2019s Use Data Visualisation And Business Intelligence (BI) Software To Mask \u20b9800-Crore Forex Scam, ED Probe Reveals\n\n\n\n\nShe claimed currently 7,000 complaints of dam outsees are pending in the GRA, but they are not being heard due to the non-appointment of new judges for months. \n\n\n\n\nAn MP government official said initially there was a provision to appoint five judges in the GRA, but later the number of judges was reduced to three due to less number of complaints.Currently, all three posts of judges in GRA are vacant and a proposal has been sent to the MP government for their appointment.\"Generally, retired judges of the High Court are appointed in the GRA, constituted as an independent body. The dam project affected people who are dissatisfied with NVDA's decisions do take refuge in GRA,\" the official said.Patkar also claimed that at least 1,000 families in Madhya Pradesh displaced by the Sardar Sarovar dam have not been properly rehabilitated despite separate orders from the Supreme Court and various tribunals, and many of these families are still forced to live in tin sheds.\u00a0 \nRead Also\n\nWorld Heritage Day: Indore Municipal Corporation using city\u2019s heritage building premises for...\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRECENT STORIES\n\n\n\u2018Get Ready For Laugh Fest With Pintu Ki Pappi,\u2019 Says Choreographer-Turned-Actor Ganesh Acharya\n\n\n\n\n\nMadhya Pradesh: Horrific Truck Collision On Bhopal-Indore Bypass, 1 Dead, 2 Injured\n\n\n\n\n\nBizarre!

According to Grand View Research, the global AI market size reached a valuation of $136.55 billion in 2022. From this year till 2030, experts project that the segment will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3%.\nAt the culmination of the forecasted period, the top AI companies can help sector revenue hit slightly over $1.81 trillion. Therefore, investors should at least consider positioning themselves in relevant artificial intelligence stocks. Below is an eclectic list of enterprises that can benefit from this latest innovation.\n\n\n\n\nMSFT\nMicrosoft\n$288.45\n\n\nGOOG GOOGL\nAlphabet\n$105.02\n\n\nIBM\nIBM.\n$126.32\n\n\nTM\nToyota\n$135.26\n\n\nNVDA\nNvidia\n$279.31\n\n\nDIS\nDisney\n$98.75\n\n\nLMND\nLemonade\n$13.06\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence: Microsoft (MSFT)\nSource: Blue Andy / Shutterstock.com\nA rather obvious idea for artificial intelligence stocks to buy, computer software and hardware giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) pushed the needle forward in the AI department with its integration of popular chatbot ChatGPT into its ecosystem. In particular, Microsoft\u2019s incorporation of ChatGPT into its Bing search engine should significantly help boost relevance.\nOn many levels, it really comes down to simple math. As you know, Bing falls well behind in terms of market share for the global search engine space. At last count, it holds less than 3% of global share, which frankly stinks. However, with ChatGPT\u2019s intuitive question-and-answer format (via normal human language), the move should accelerate Bing\u2019s lowly position to somewhere significantly higher.\nFinancially, you\u2019re looking at a stalwart with a stable balance sheet, strong revenue and even stronger profitability. Therefore, it\u2019s one of the top AI companies that should be around for a long time.\u00a0Finally, analysts peg MSFT as a consensus strong buy. On average, their price target lands at $300.97,\u00a0 implying over 4% upside potential.\n\nArtificial Intelligence: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)\nSource: shutterstock.com/local_doctor\nWith rival Microsoft aggressively moving into the AI space, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) clearly has some catching up to do. Nevertheless, GOOG should rank among the top artificial intelligence stocks to buy. Sure, the current circumstances don\u2019t seem to bode well for Alphabet\u2019s Google ecosystem. In my opinion, however, both Microsoft and Alphabet can easily coexist.\nHaving used the ChatGPT platform for some time, it\u2019s incredibly useful for narrowing down research parameters. However, once you\u2019ve identified a path to take, Google arguably offers a more viable solution for additional research. By offering multiple choices (when available), Google forces the human operator to consider the value of the information presented.\nThe issue I have with chatbots is that they attempt to do the thinking for you. But as the rise of misinformation confirms, significant demand exists for quality and accurate information. I\u2019m afraid chatbots just aren\u2019t there yet.\u00a0In the meantime, you can rest assured that analysts peg GOOG a unanimous strong buy. Their average price target stands at $126, implying over 18% upside potential.\n\nArtificial Intelligence: IBM (IBM)\nSource: shutterstock.com/YAKOBCHUK V\nOne of the underappreciated AI firms and tech enterprises overall, IBM (NYSE:IBM) has been building for a time such as this. Admittedly, \u201cBig Blue\u201d struggled under the increasingly onerous weight of its legacy businesses in the past. However, that\u2019s exactly where it is \u2013 in the past. Moving forward, IBM represents one of the more compelling artificial intelligence stocks thanks to its myriad business units.\nMost prominently, IBM ranks among the AI leaders for its IBM Watson applications. Featuring attributes such as natural language understanding and speech-to-text protocols, Watson delivers intuitive solutions. As well, the technology enables IBM\u2019s enterprise-level clients to scale up appropriately based on business dynamics.\nAnother factor that will almost certainly help in the investment realm is the company\u2019s passive income. Currently, Big Blue carries a forward yield of 5.16%, well above the tech sector\u2019s average yield of 1.37%. Also, it commands 29 years of consecutive annual dividend increases.\nLastly, analysts peg IBM as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $146.70, implying nearly 15% upside potential.\n\nToyota (TM)\nSource: shutterstock.com/Den Rise\nTypically, when you think of Toyota (NYSE:TM), you\u2019re thinking about reliable cars, not necessarily about artificial intelligence stocks to buy. However, this perception may change \u2013 and quite soon. For those in the know, Toyota ranks among the top AI companies. Over the years, the automotive giant made significant investments in AI-based solutions such as machine learning.\nNotably, Toyota worked with other companies to use AI and ML to predict demand for taxi service while also considering influencers such as smartphone data and weather conditions. Moving forward, Toyota can help push automated mobility and transportation through its advanced tech acumen.\nAs well, CNBC recently reported that the day for $25,000 electric vehicles will soon arrive. Therefore, by researching AI/ML automotive applications now, Toyota can be in a position to offer compelling products later.\u00a0Within the past 90 days, no one covers TM. However, BofA Securities\u2019 Kei Nihonyanagi rated shares as a buy, with a $171.57 price target implying almost 25% upside potential.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\nSource: shutterstock.com/Peshkova\nAs one of the world\u2019s top semiconductor specialists, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) easily ranks among the top artificial intelligence stocks to buy. Enticingly, Nvidia gained fame through its class-leading graphics processing units (GPUs), which often find homes among top gamers. Now, as video games become more advanced, they incorporate AI to simulate realistic behaviors. All this requires intense processing power, which Nvidia naturally helps feed.\nIn addition, Nvidia\u2019s AI and ML protocols may usher in true automation regarding mobility and transportation. Further, Nvidia\u2019s processors should undergird other enterprises\u2019 efforts at industrial automation. With the company command decades of acumen developing solutions for intensive computer applications, NVDA should benefit.\nCurrently, the company owns a solid balance sheet, along with blistering revenue growth and robust profitability metrics. About the only issue is that shares might be overvalued.\nNevertheless, that didn\u2019t stop Wall Street analysts from pegging NVDA as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $287.03, implying over 6% upside potential.\n\nDisney (DIS)\nSource: Shutterstock\nWhen you think about Disney (NYSE:DIS), you\u2019re either thinking about its entertainment library or its political battle with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. However, over time, investors might regard the Magic Kingdom as one the AI leaders. That\u2019s right \u2013 in addition to ticking off certain public officials, Disney ranks among the artificial intelligence stocks to buy.\nFundamentally, AI protocols should help the House of Mouse because entertainment firms spend billions on content and events. However, humans can be fickle. An initiative \u2013 no matter how bright and attractive \u2013 can always fail. If and when they do, that can cause devastating losses for those funding the projects. Therefore, artificial intelligence can help cut down on those mistakes.\nHere, Disney has explored Affective AI, an emerging tech which seeks to detect and analyze human emotional states. Through this platform, Disney can guide its content narratives to their most effective (i.e. profitable) outcomes.\nPresently, analysts peg DIS as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $128.33, implying 28% upside potential.\n\nLemonade (LMND)\nSource: Shutterstock\nAn insurance technology specialist, Lemonade (NYSE:LMND) features plenty of potential but also plenty of risk. Nevertheless, as machines get smarter, Lemonade could easily stand among the best AI firms. Already, it\u2019s one of the intriguing artificial intelligence stocks thanks to the company\u2019s data-driven approach to delivering insurance products to its customers.\nMoving forward, the use of data for providing services will become a necessity. For one thing, computers can think faster than humans. Rifling through myriad datapoints and variables, Lemonade can almost instantly provide insurance programs through its app.\nSecond and more importantly, the rise of awareness toward social inequities undergirds the need for unbiased platforms. Theoretically, you can\u2019t get any more unbiased than a non-human protocol. Still, LMND presents risks. Since the beginning of the year, shares declined over 4%. In the trailing one-year period, they\u2019re down almost 42%.\nPlus, analysts peg LMND as a consensus hold. However, their average price target stands at $19.21, implying over 46% upside potential.\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nArtificial Intelligence, Technology\n\n\nGrowth Stocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2023/04/7-companies-that-could-benefit-from-the-rise-of-artificial-intelligence/.\n\u00a92025 InvestorPlace Media, LLC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored Headlines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMore from InvestorPlace\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHot Stocks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Top Stocks to Buy Under Trump Come From Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018BRAIN\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Luke Lango, InvestorPlace Senior Investment Analyst\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Danger that Could Derail Our Economy\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Jeff Remsburg, Contributing Editor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy Prediction Came True: Where to Find Opportunity Despite Market Unpredictability\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Eric Fry, Editor, Fry's Investment Report\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMost Popular\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 10, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBig Tech\u2019s Quantum War Has Begun \u2014 and One Tiny Stock Could Win It\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 5, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat to Make of the Weakening Economy and Trade War\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInvestors Applaud a Cool Inflation Print\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow to Escape the \u2018Tyranny of the Immediate\u2019 in Investing\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExpert Stock Picks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe System Flagging a Potential 50X Opportunity\u2026 Even in This Ugly Market\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAbout InvestorPlace\nProducts\nContact Us\nHelp\nCareers\nAdvertise With Us\nDisclosures & Disclaimers\nPrivacy Policy\nAd Choices\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\nCookie Policy\nCookie Preferences\nTerms of Use\nDMCA Policy\n All rights reserved.

The manager of CapitaLand Ascendas REIT (CLAR) A17U has announced the divestment of Singapore industrial building KA Place for a consideration of $35.38 million. According to an April 20 filing, the REIT\u2019s trustee, HSBC Institutional Trust Services (Singapore), has entered into a sale and purchase agreement to sell KA Place to KA Place SPV 1.  The consideration sum represents a 219% premium to CLAR\u2019s purchase price of $11.1 million in March 2005. The figure also represents a 55% premium to the property\u2019s market valuation of $22.8 million as at Dec 31, 2022. KA Place at\u00a0159 Kampong Ampat is a seven-storey high-specification industrial building with a carpark on the second storey. The property has a total gross floor area of 10,163 sq m and a remaining land lease tenure of about 35 years. The proposed divestment is in line with the manager\u2019s proactive asset management strategy to improve the quality of CLAR\u2019s portfolio and optimise returns for unitholders of CLAR, says the manager. \u201cAfter careful evaluation, the manager has decided that it is an opportune time to divest the property and redeploy the capital towards value-adding opportunities.\u201d Assuming the proposed divestment was completed on Jan 1, 2022, the pro-forma impact on CLAR\u2019s net property income (NPI) and distribution per unit (DPU) for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2022 would have been a decrease of $0.92 million and 0.005 Singapore cents, respectively.  Net proceeds after divestment costs are expected to be $30.65 million. CLAR\u2019s manager says the net proceeds may be recycled to fund committed investments, repay existing indebtedness, extend loans to subsidiaries, fund general corporate and working capital needs and/or make distributions to unitholders. If the net proceeds were used to repay CLAR\u2019s borrowings as at Dec 31, 2022, CLAR\u2019s aggregate leverage will be reduced from 36.3% to approximately 36.2%. The proposed divestment is expected to complete within 2Q2023. Upon completion, CLAR will own 229 properties comprising 96 properties in Singapore, 36 properties in Australia, 48 properties in the United States and 49 properties in the United Kingdom and Europe. In accordance with the trust deed dated Oct 9, 2002 constituting CLAR, the manager is entitled to a divestment fee of 0.5% of the sale consideration of the property, which would be paid in cash. Units in CapitaLand Ascendas REIT closed 3 cents higher, or 1.05% up, at $2.88 on April 20.

Now it's down to $599 with the new RTX 4070, a mid-range card focused on 1440p gaming. While it's $100 more than its predecessor's launch price, the fabulous RTX 3070, that card typically sold for more than $1,000 due to the supply chain crunch, scalpers and insatiable crypto bros. Based on what we've seen from the 4070 Ti, NVIDIA's new cards are actually staying close to their retail price, which is great news for anyone itching for an upgrade.Judging from Valve's Steam hardware statistics, I'd wager many gamers are waiting on the eventual RTX 4060 before giving up their old cards, especially if it ends up selling closer to $400. But based on my testing, the 4070 is still a solid choice for practical gamers who may wan to splurge a bit. It's fast enough to deliver excellent 1440p performance with ray tracing enabled, and it can even deliver solid 4K gaming in a pinch too. Even though it's noticeably slower than the $799 RTX 4070 Ti in most benchmarks, that may not matter much when you're actually in the heat of battle. (Just think of all you could do with that extra $200!)NVIDIA88100Expert ScoreNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070The RTX 4070 is a good upgrade for anyone with an older GPU, but the 4070 Ti is noticeably better. ProsExcellent 1440p gaming performanceDLSS 3 enables better ray tracing performance than beforeAV1 encoding will be useful to streamersQuiet and coolConsStill pricey at $599Not every game supports DLSS 3$599 at Best BuyThe RTX 4070 features NVIDIA's new Ada Lovelace architecture, sporting 5,888 CUDA cores, a base clock speed of 1,920 MHz (boost to 2,475 MHz) and 12GB of GDDR6X RAM. The 3070, meanwhile, had the same amount of CUDA cores, but it was based on NVIDIA's older Ampere architecture. It could only reach up to 1,725 MHz and had 8GB of slower GDDR6 memory. Despite those differences, the 3070 still holds up well, so I wouldn't rush out to replace it anytime soon. But if you're still holding onto an RTX 20-series GPU or something older, the 4070 may be the GPU you've been waiting for. Photo by Devindra Hardawar/EngadgetWe received the RTX 4070 Founder's Edition card from NVIDIA, which basically looks like a shrunken down version of the 4080 and 4090. It feels like a premium card, with a sleek metal case, a bevy of heatsink fins and two large fans to deal with heat. It's also a two-slot GPU, like the 4070 Ti, allowing it to fit inside of smaller cases far better than the enormous 4080 and 4090. Port-wise, there are three DisplayPort connections and a single HDMI. As with all of NVIDIA's recent cards, it also includes an adapter to connect two 8-pin PCIe power cables (a single PCIe Gen 5 cable will also work).3DMark TimeSpy ExtremePort Royal (Ray Tracing)CyberpunkBlenderNVIDIA RTX 40708,61011,195/52 fps1440p RT DLSS: 120 fps6,020NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti10,62414,163/66 fps1440p RT DLSS : 135 fps7,247NVIDIA RTX 30706,2268,032/37 fpsN/A3,500AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT11,68813,247/61 fps1440p FSRT RT: 114 fps3,516Once I started benching and playing games with the RTX 4070, it performed just as I expected: Somewhere between the RTX 3080 (which launched at $699) and the 3080 Ti ($1,119). The difference, though, is that it supports NVIDIA's DLSS 3 technology, which can help speed up ray tracing performance by inserting AI-generated frames. I was particularly impressed by how well it handled Cyberpunk 2077: in 1440p with maxed out graphics and \"ultra\" ray tracing settings, it delivered a smooth 120 fps. The RTX 3070, in comparison, struggled to hold 75 fps with the same settings using the older DLSS 2, which doesn't use frame generation.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementControl, an older title that only supports DLSS 2, had a less dramatic performance bump with the 4070. While playing in 1440p with maxed graphics and all of its ray tracing settings flipped on, it reached 106 fps, compared to 90 fps with the 3070. Still, it's a bit of a shock to see a mid-range card scoring triple digit frame rates with all of the game's ray tracing features enabled (which includes reflections, shadows and debris). Not too long ago, Control used to humble the mightiest video cards.1 / 5NVIDIA RTX 4070NVIDIA RTX 4070 top view\nNVIDIA is clearly positioning the 4070 as a 1440p-focused card, but it can still handle some 4K scenarios, so long as you're not too demanding. It hovered at 70 fps in Cyberpunk with maxed graphics and \"ultra\" ray tracing settings \u2014 that's certainly better than you'd see on any modern game console. Control, meanwhile, hit 56 fps on average. If you're only dabbling in 4K occasionally, perhaps for a lazy Sunday session on your TV, that's not too bad.As with all of NVIDIA's new hardware, the RTX 4070 is also a useful tool for streamers and media creators thanks to its hardware-based AV1 encoder. The company claims it's around 40 percent more efficient than the previous generation H.264 encoder \u2014 that means it'll take less bandwidth to deliver clear streams, a boon for anyone who wants to show off 1440p or 4K streams. The popular broadcast software OBS will soon be updated to support AV1 streaming to YouTube, which offers some dramatic clarity boons, according to PCWorld. When it comes to typical H.264 encoding, the 4070 converted 4K test clip to 1080p in 33 seconds, three seconds longer than the 4070 Ti. Photo by Devindra Hardawar/EngadgetThanks to the 4070's excellent cooling setup and relatively modest power demands (it requires a 650W PSU), its temperature never climb above 70 Celsius during my testing. I could only hear its two fans when I spent more than 30 minutes in a game using ray tracing. But really, it's not anything that'll distract you during gameplay.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementNow that we've seen NVIDIA's RTX 4070 in action, is it actually worth $599? For anyone with a GPU older than the RTX 30-series, I'd say so. (Though if you can spare an extra $200, the 4070 Ti is noticeably better.) A few years ago, we were hoping and praying for GPU prices to come back down to Earth. We've seen 4070 Ti cards stick close to its initial $799 launch price, so there's a good chance you'll actually be able to find a 4070 this year without overpaying too much. To be smart, it's worth waiting a few months for the 4060 to drop before you make any decisions.But if you've been hankering for better framerates and playable ray tracing, go with the gaming gods. The RTX 4070 is the new king of mid-range GPUs.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

Liu was CEO of the company between 2006 and 2017. He wasn\u2019t elected at the company\u2019s AGM for FY2017 in April 2017. Since then, Liu and various other parties have been in a long-drawn legal and at times physical tussle for control over both the listed entity here, as well as the company\u2019s key operating subsidiary in China. On March 3, the company appointed Liu to the board as an executive director, making him the only executive position in the four-person board. Citing powers it wields under the listing rule, SGX RegCo requires Shanghai Turbo to obtain prior approval if Liu is to be reappointed as a director or an executive officer of the company, starting from the coming AGM for FY2022. \u201cWe are of the view that it is in the interests of the public and for the protection of investors that shareholders should be given sufficient information to be able to appraise the character and integrity of Mr Liu Ming in view of the Court\u2019s judgement, lawsuits filed against him as well as the fact that Mr Liu Ming was not re-appointed as executive director by shareholders during the 2017 AGM for reasons not known to SGX RegCo,\u201d says the regulator in its notice.  SGX RegCo is known to have exercised its power to remove individuals from SGX-listed boards. A notable example was the removal of Chen Wei Ping as chairman of Midas Holdings. see also:\u00a0SGX strips Midas chairman Chen and legal representative Ma of their appointments SGX RegCo is also requiring Shanghai Turbo to appoint an independent professional May 18 to undertake an independent review of Liu\u2019s suitability as a director, prior to seeking its approval for his appointment or reappointment. \u201cThe review should cover, but is not limited to, past and present directorships, history of employment, litigation and bankruptcy checks, Mr Liu Ming\u2019s personal and business backgrounds and integrity, role in the company\u2019s business, interests in other companies, and any criminal or other records,\u201d says SGX RegCo.

The main measure is the increase in the medium-term interest rate floor (also known as the stress-test interest rate) to compute the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) and Mortgage Servicing Ratio (MSR).  Know your loan eligibility: 99.co Affordability Calculator The TDSR limits the monthly debt obligation that you can take. It includes all types of loans, such as credit card debt, car loans and property loans. The TDSR is currently at 55%. Like the TDSR, the MSR limits the monthly loan amount that you can take, but it is only for the housing loan of an HDB flat or an Executive Condo. The MSR is currently at 30%. The stress-test interest rate for bank loans has now been raised from 3.5% to 4% per annum. At the same time, the stress-test interest rate of 3% has been introduced for HDB loans.   Interest rate floor to compute TDSR and MSR   These stress-test interest rates are not the actual interest rates of your home loan, so they don\u2019t translate to the interest you\u2019ll need to pay. Instead, they are used to calculate the maximum loan amount that you can borrow. So with the increase in the stress-test interest rates, financing from the bank or HDB will be lower.   In recent months, local banks have increased the interest rates of their home loans.   On top of that, the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio limit for HDB loans has been decreased from 85% to 80%, reducing the amount you can borrow if you take an HDB loan. This is to ensure prudence in borrowing for your property purchase, as interest rates are set to increase further in the coming months. Reduced affordability The impact of the two measures is that the home loan amount you can borrow will be lower, whether you\u2019re buying an HDB flat or a private property. We illustrate how they will affect home affordability. Buying an HDB flat Let\u2019s say you and your partner have a combined income of S$6,600. Without the 3% stress-test, you could afford an HDB resale flat priced at S$540,000. This is also the median price of an HDB resale flat in September 2022. Assuming you take an HDB loan with a 25-year tenure, you may no longer be able to afford this flat due to the 3% stress-test interest rate.  Estimated max loan amountEstimated max price of HDB flatEstimated monthly instalment (at 2.6%) Stress-test interest rate of 2.6%\u00a0S$436,441.00S$545,551S$1,980 Stress-test interest rate of 3%S$417,535.00S$521,919S$1,894 % change-4.3%-4.3%-4.3%\u00a0  This is unless you\u2019re eligible for resale grants, such as the Family Grant, Enhanced CPF Housing Grant and Proximity Housing Grant (PHG), to reduce the amount you need to borrow.   Story continues Otherwise, you will need to:Lower your debt obligations Increase your income Increase your downpayment Purchase a cheaper property In this table, we break down how much your affordability is reduced based on the different monthly household income levels, if you\u2019re taking an HDB loan.

Choo, a renowned figure in the local corporate scene, was once dubbed \"IPO King\" for shepherding dozens of listings on the local bourse when he was running Westcomb Securities  Besides chairing Cytomed, Choo is also the long-time vice chairman of SGX-listed CNMC Goldmine Holdings. CytoMed, founded in 2018, was spun off from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), the government's research and development agency. For this Nasdaq IPO, some 2.4 million shares were sold at US$4, raising the pre-clinical firm gross proceeds of some US$9.65 million. Cytomed says it is focused on harnessing its licensed proprietary technologies to create cell-based immunotherapies for the treatment of human cancers. With proceeds from the listing, the company plans to\u00a0advance the clinical development of its\u00a0CTM-N2D product candidate. It will also continue the technology development of its\u00a0iPSC-gdNKT product candidate, as well as to further develop its CTM-GDT product candidate. Besides Choo, the company's other senior leadership includes Lucas Luk\u00a0Tien Wee, director and chief clinical officer and Zeng Jieming, director and chief scientific and medical officer. The company has yet to generate any meaningful revenue. For 1HFY2022 ended June 2022, the company incurred a loss of US$715,954, up from a loss of US$737,537. \u00a0 \u00a0 See Also: Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore CNMC Goldmine explores lead, zinc production CNMC Goldmine swings back into the black with 2HFY2021 earnings of US$1.68 mil Takeover offers for LionGold spurned: Soh Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

According to Grand View Research, the global AI boom could grow from about $137 billion in 2022 to more than $1.81 trillion by 2030. And according to Marketing AI Institute, \u201cArtificial intelligence will, on average, boost rates of profitability by 38% and provide an economic boost of $14 trillion in additional gross value by 2035,\u201d according to research by\u00a0Accenture.\nEven\u00a0MIT Technology Review\u00a0said, \u201cArtificial intelligence is changing the world and doing it at breakneck speed. The experts go on to predict a 50 percent chance that AI will be better than humans at more or less everything in about 45 years.\u201d\nIt\u2019s already impacting every sort of business, governments, schools, law enforcement, gaming, robotics, weaponry, cybersecurity, the environment, stocks; the list goes on\u2026\nYet, this is only the start \u2013 and its potential impact on your portfolio could be significant.\nIn fact, here are seven top AI ETFs that could help.\n\n\nGlobal X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ)\nSource: Blue Andy / Shutterstock.com\nOne of the top AI ETFs to consider is the\u00a0Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF\u00a0(NASDAQ:BOTZ). With an expense ratio of 0.68%, The Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF invests in companies that will benefit from increased adoption and utilization of robotics and artificial intelligence, including those involved with industrial robotics and automation, non-industrial robots, and autonomous vehicles, according to Global X.\nSome of its top holdings include NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG), SMC Corporation (OTCMKTS:SMCAY), iRobot Corporation (NASDAQ:IRBT), Accuray Inc. (NASDAQ:ARAY), and Brooks Automation (NASDAQ:AZTA). Since the year began, shares of the BOTZ ETF ran from about $21 to $25.05 so far. By year-end, I\u2019d like to see it closer to $35.\n\nROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF (THNQ)\nSource: shutterstock.com/YAKOBCHUK V\nAnother of the top AI ETFs is\u00a0ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF\u00a0(NYSEARCA:THNQ), which invests in companies leading the AI revolution. THNQ includes companies developing the technology and infrastructure enabling AI, such as computing, data, and cloud services, as well as companies that apply AI in various verticals, from business processes to e-commerce and healthcare.\nWith an expense ratio of 0.75%, the THNQ ETF offers me exposure to Nvidia, Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), Atlassian Corp. (NASDAQ:TEAM), Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), Cloudflare (NYSE:NET), C3.ai (NYSE:AI), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and 61 other AI-related holdings. Since the start of the year, the THNQ ETF ran from about $26.50 to $31.92. I want to see it at $40.\n\nGlobal X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV)\nSource: Olivier Le Moal/Shutterstock\nOne of the best ways to diversify your AI ETFs portfolio, as it applies to electric vehicles, is with an ETF, such as the\u00a0Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF\u00a0(NASDAQ:DRIV). In fact, the DRIV ETF tracks an index that uses artificial intelligence to select global stocks involved in the development, production, or supporting technology of autonomous and electronic vehicles. With an expense ratio of 0.68%, some of its top holdings include Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Nio (NYSE:NIO), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), NVIDIA, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM); it does so at less cost.\nSince Jan, the DRIV ETF accelerated from about $20 a share to $23.09. I\u2019d like to see this one closer to $40 a share, too, as the EV and AI stories get hot.\n\niShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF (IDRV)\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\nAnother top ETF to consider is the\u00a0iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF\u00a0(NYSEARCA:IDRV). With an expense ratio of 0.47%, you gain exposure to stocks such as Tesla, Qualcomm, NVIDIA, Apple, General Motors (NYSE:GM), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL). Over the last few months, the ETF has jumped from $35 to $37 and could see higher highs as the EV boom continues to accelerate. After all, autonomous need to use artificial intelligence to drive, along with sensors, cameras, and radar, to travel without a human behind the wheel.\n\niShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF (IRBO)\nSource: Andrey_Popov / Shutterstock\nSince Jan., the iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF (NYSEARCA:IRBO) ram from about $25 to $30. This is another one that could see $40 as the AI story unfolds. With an expense ratio of 0.47%, the ETF provides exposure to companies at the forefront of robotics and artificial intelligence innovation, including Meitu Inc., IQIYI (NASDAQ:IQ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Nvidia, MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), and another 112 different AI-related holdings. All for just $30.49 a share.\n\nFirst Trust NASDAQ AI and Robotics ETF (ROBT)\nSource: Shutterstock\nOr, take a look at the\u00a0First Trust NASDAQ AI and Robotics ETF\u00a0(NASDAQ:ROBT). With an expense ratio of 0.65%, ROBT tracks companies engaged in robotics, AI, and automation.\nTo be included in the ETF, a company must be considered: An enabler or a company that develops the building block components for robotics or AI, such as advanced machinery, autonomous systems/self-driving vehicles, semiconductors, and databases used for machine learning; An engager, or a company that designs robotics and AI in the form of products, software, or systems; Or an enhancer, which is a company that provides value-added services within the AI and robotics ecosystem.\nSome of its top holdings include AeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV), Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN), UiPath (NYSE:PATH), and Ciena Corp (NYSE:CIEN).\n\nWisdomTree U.S. AI Enhanced Value Fund (AIVL)\nSource: Andrey Suslov / Shutterstock\nThe WisdomTree U.S. AI Enhanced Value Fund\u00a0(NYSEARCA:AIVL) is a bit different. It doesn\u2019t invest in\u00a0AI stocks. Instead, it uses AI to invest. In fact, it uses an AI algorithm to invest in value stocks.\nWith an expense ratio of 0.38%, AIVL uses \u201ca proprietary, quantitative artificial intelligence model\u201d developed by Voya Investment Management, which sub-advises the fund, according to the\u00a0ETF\u2019s prospectus. Also, to be eligible for inclusion in the Parent Universe, a company must (i) be listed on a U.S.-based stock exchange, (ii) have a market capitalization of at least $100 million, (iii) have an average daily volume of at least $100,000, and (iv) have an average six months aggregate daily trading volume of 250,000 shares.\nAlso, the AI model typically chooses stocks with lower price-to-book ratios, lower price-to-earnings ratios, and greater free cash flow. At the end of 2022, some of those very stocks included Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), Roper Technologies (NYSE:ROP), and Keurig Dr. Pepper (NASDAQ:KDP), to name a few of them.\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nArtificial Intelligence, Consumer Discretionary, Automotive, Electric Vehicles, Financial, Industrial, Software, Technology\n\n\nGrowth Stocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2023/04/profit-from-the-artificial-intelligence-boom-with-these-7-ai-etfs/.\n\u00a92025 InvestorPlace Media, LLC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored Headlines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMore from InvestorPlace\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHot Stocks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Top Stocks to Buy Under Trump Come From Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018BRAIN\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Luke Lango, InvestorPlace Senior Investment Analyst\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Danger that Could Derail Our Economy\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Jeff Remsburg, Contributing Editor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy Prediction Came True: Where to Find Opportunity Despite Market Unpredictability\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Eric Fry, Editor, Fry's Investment Report\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMost Popular\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 10, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBig Tech\u2019s Quantum War Has Begun \u2014 and One Tiny Stock Could Win It\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 5, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat to Make of the Weakening Economy and Trade War\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInvestors Applaud a Cool Inflation Print\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow to Escape the \u2018Tyranny of the Immediate\u2019 in Investing\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExpert Stock Picks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe System Flagging a Potential 50X Opportunity\u2026 Even in This Ugly Market\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAbout InvestorPlace\nProducts\nContact Us\nHelp\nCareers\nAdvertise With Us\nDisclosures & Disclaimers\nPrivacy Policy\nAd Choices\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\nCookie Policy\nCookie Preferences\nTerms of Use\nDMCA Policy\n All rights reserved.

Digital wallets transactions are projected to become the most popular online payment method by 2026, but cards are still king in Singapore. According to the 2023 Global Payments Report\u00a0by Worldpay from global financial technology leader FIS, point-of-sale transaction value by digital wallets will increase by 101% from 2022 to 2026. Digital wallets are expected to overtake credit cards as the most popular online payment method, with a 40% e-commerce market share by 2026.  However, as it stands, credit and debit cards combined remain dominant as the preferred payment method in Singapore, at 53% of e-commerce and 57% of point-of-sale market share in 2022. The report, which has been released annually since 2015 and is now in its eighth edition, found that Singapore\u2019s digital wallet adoption lags behind other Southeast Asian markets, as its more mature economy is heavily influenced by use of credit and debit cards. Meanwhile, digital wallets take the spotlight with the highest market share in point-of-sale transactions in neighbouring markets like China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Australia. Yvonne Szeto, vice-president for commercial, Asia-Pacific at Worldpay, says that the prominence of cards in Singapore is a function of consumer habits. \u201cCredit cards, especially in Singapore is just such an established payment method,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s got a high penetration online\u2026 just because the user experience is perhaps a lot easier.\u201d Echoing Szeto\u2019s sentiments, global payments manager Edward Ong from Vantage Market highlights that Singaporeans are \u201creally good at calculating\u201d, and are able to get a bang for their buck with the current credit card reward system that offers cashback and miles.  But Ong feels that this behaviour will change over time. \u201cWhen digital wallets start to go into a better rewarding system, I think it will climb eventually,\u201d he adds. Addressing the future of the payments industry in Singapore, Nagesh Devata, senior vice-president for the Asia-Pacific at Payoneer, highlights the huge number of players that have emerged in this space. In order for these players to differentiate and standout, they will have to innovate, he adds. \u201cThings around trust, credibility, security and confidence all become real important factors,\u201d says Devata. \u201cAnd for us here, it's important how we convey and communicate that message.\u201d See Also: Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore Luno partners FIS to enhance payment options BNPL to be the fastest growing online payment method in Singapore Keep online fraud at bay, or brace for greater loss  Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

Timothy Kang   \u00b7 Finance Producer Updated 25 April 2023 2 min read            Grab-Singtel-backed GXS Bank today launched a flexible loan product targeted toward individuals with difficult access to credit facilities. (PHOTO: Reuters, GXS Bank)   SINGAPORE \u2014 Digital bank GXS announced on Tuesday (25 April) the launch of the GXS FlexiLoan, a personal loan product that allows individuals to borrow as little as S$200 with a tenure as short as two months. The Grab-Singtel-backed digital bank said in a statement that the GXS FlexiLoan is available to eligible Singaporeans and targeted towards underbanked individuals with difficult access to credit.  The loan doesn't require any type of collateral, and borrowers can repay the loan partially or in full without any early repayment fees or hidden processing fees. However, customers who have late payments will be charged an interest of 18 per cent per annum. Other features of the loan include enabling borrowers to make multiple loan drawdowns from their credit line without going through underwriting and approval each time. Borrowers can also choose flexible repayment terms, such as choosing a monthly repayment date that is aligned with their salary crediting date.

The effective interest rate (EIR) \u2013 the percentage of interest on a loan if compound interest accumulates for a year with no repayment \u2013 is 7.15 per cent per annum. GXS stated on its website that the EIR is calculated based on an average loan amount of S$10,000 with a 24-month repayment period.

By-invite-only savings account launched earlier The new offering is the second product launch from the bank after the GXS Savings Account, which was launched in August 2022 and is currently available on a by-invitation-only basis. GXS previously said that it aims to serve gig economy workers, self-employed entrepreneurs, small businesses and those new to the workforce with their products. \"With the launch of the GXS FlexiLoan, we are turning the spotlight on the barriers and hindrances in unsecured loan products that hold individuals back from stretching towards their goals,\" said GXS chief executive officer Charles Wong in a statement. GXS Bank is backed by a consortium consisting of ride-hailing giant Grab and telecommunication provider Singtel. The bank draws insights from data made available by the Grab and Singtel ecosystem, which collectively has over three million customers.

DBS Group\u2019s D05 digital banking service disruption last week was but a \u201ctransitory dampener\u201d, say RHB Bank Singapore\u2019s analysts. Nevertheless, the glitch has hurt DBS\u2019s reputation as a leading digital and technology bank and warnings of supervisory action would likely keep its share price range-bound in the near term, they add.  As a result, RHB analysts have cut DBS\u2019s target price to $39.80 from $42 in an April 3 note, while keeping \u201cbuy\u201d on Singapore\u2019s largest bank. The new target price represents a 21% upside against a last traded price of $33. Customers were unable to access DBS\u2019s digital services from the\u00a0morning of March 29. The bank fully restored its digital services around 5.45pm that same day. According to the bank, the glitch affected its digibank both on mobile and online, as well as its DBS PayLah and DBS mTrading services. This is the second disruption at DBS in 16 months. In November 2021, a problem with DBS Bank\u2019s access control servers disrupted its online banking services for over three days. Acknowledging the bank\u2019s failure to ensure uninterrupted digital banking services 24/7, DBS\u2019s management says it will undertake a thorough review of the incident. A special board committee will convene with immediate effect to conduct a full and detailed investigation of the incident. In response to the disruption, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has warned of supervisory action. It said the \u201cdisruption of DBS\u2019s digital services is unacceptable, coming a year after a similar incident in November 2021\u201d.  MAS has instructed DBS to conduct a thorough investigation to establish the root cause of the disruption. The regulator added that it will take the commensurate supervisory actions after gathering the necessary facts. In February 2022, MAS announced supervisory action against DBS after the November 2021 disruption. The regulator ordered DBS to set aside 1.5x on its risk-weighted assets for operational risk, which led to an additional $930 million in regulatory capital that lowered common equity tier-1 (CET-1) ratio by 40 basis points (bps). With the latest glitch, it will not be a surprise if DBS is required to further raise the multiple for operational risk, according to RHB\u2019s analysts. \u201cThat said, we believe this would not impact its operations as CET-1 ratio of 14.6% in December 2022 is comfortably above management\u2019s optimal level of 13%.\u201d Barring further service downtime, RHB believes investors will eventually refocus on the bank\u2019s \u201cstill healthy\u201d earnings trajectory. DBS posted a net profit of $8.19 billion for the FY2022 ended December, 20% higher y-o-y.   Story continues The lower target price also takes into account a lower environmental, social and governance (ESG)\u00a0premium, according to RHB\u2019s proprietary methodology.In May 2022, RHB trimmed its in-house derived ESG score for DBS to 3.2 from 3.3, out of a maximum score of 4, as analysts recalibrated the assessment of risks and regulatory requirements associated with reliability of digital services, customer data and cybersecurity.With the latest glitch, RHB analysts further slash\u00a0DBS\u2019s ESG score to 3.1, which effectively lowers the stock\u2019s ESG premium to 2% from 4%. This brings RHB\u2019s final target price to $39.80 based on an intrinsic value of $39.05 with the lower 2% ESG premium.The slash in target price also takes into account a slight \u201cbump up\u201d in equity risk premium given the recent banking sector turmoil in the US and the EU, add RHB\u2019s analysts.As at 9.46am, shares in DBS are trading 6 cents lower, or 0.18% down, at $32.94.See Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore RHB remains positive on Marco Polo Marine\u2019s prospects, ups TP to 6 cents RHB keeps 'buy' on CDL following recent acquisition moves  Briefs: MAS upbeat on alternative investment space, calls DBS disruption 'unacceptable' in separate statement Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

The new centre at 61 Robinson Road will be operated under IWG\u2019s Regus brand \u2014 one of several workspace brands owned and operated by the company. In Singapore, other IWG branded spaces include Regus, Signature, Spaces, and No18. \u201cThis new opening aims to meet the growing demand for flex spaces [in Singapore],\u201d says Darren Rogers, country manager for IWG in Singapore. IWG\u2019s latest expansion in Singapore comes as more businesses in Singapore embrace flexible work solutions in accessible and prime locations amid an uptick in the rate of employees returning to workplaces, it says. \u201cWe are thrilled to open another Regus centre in Singapore and provide more hybrid work solutions, as [flexible workspaces] continue to be the preferred choice among businesses and employees,\u201d says Rogers. \u201cAs our occupiers review their office strategies, this partnership with IWG further enhances our value proposition [of 61 Robinson Road] to bring more quality and flexible options for occupiers in the CBD,\u201d says Lian Chin Chiang, CEO and co-founder of Rivulets Investments. A novel space for work Regus at 61 Robinson marks the 13th Regus location in Singapore\u2019s CBD. In total, IWG has 24 centres across its four brands in the city-state.\u00a0Regus at 61 Robinson spans a total of 20,000 sq ft across two floors in the 20-storey building and features about 240 workstations, three meeting rooms and 76 private offices. According to Rogers, IWG launched the centre at 61 Robinson Road under its Regus brand because the type of office product under this brand is well-suited for the types of tenants the company is targeting, as well as their space and leasing requirements.

Private offices can range around 60 sq ft (suitable for one person) to around 250 sq ft (suitable for about four people). The centre also offers designated meeting rooms \u2014 ranging from around 100 sq ft to around 250 sq ft \u2014 that can accommodate two to 12 people.   Story continues Each office unit is fully furnished with desks, chairs and storage units, with the option to customise the furniture. Each office unit also comes with high-speed Internet access as well as regular cleaning and maintenance services. Users of the office spaces will also have access to shared facilities such as meeting rooms, kitchen areas and lounge areas. Furthermore, they have the option to work at any of IWG\u2019s spaces upon getting a membership with the co-working space.Regus offers three types of membership: Private Offices, Office Membership and Day Office. Private Offices offers fully-furnished offices for individuals, teams or entire companies. Office Membership offers private offices by the day. Alternatively, members can choose five, 10 or unlimited days per month to use the office space. Day Office offers the flexibility of a shared office by the hour or day.The co-working space has a business lounge located on the 11th floor, with a mix of open-seating and private meeting rooms with complimentary refreshments. It also offers a drop-in lounge on the ground floor which provides a casual and flexible workspace for visitors and tenants. Breakout areas and flex seating are available throughout the premises with the purpose of promoting productivity.There are two cafes on the first floor: a Singapore-style cafe and a craft-beer cafe. Level 5 of the building has a wellness centre boasting a traditional gym, says Lian. The expected profile of tenants includes SMEs, freelancers, entrepreneurs, MNCs and professionals, according to IWG.Collaborative working to scaleIWG hopes that its office spaces under its various brands will foster an environment of collaboration among tenants with its collaborative spaces by striking a balance between providing an office and a home for its users. This represents the evolution of the Regus brand and how office spaces are being used, says Rogers.

The ability to support companies in scaling up or down is crucial in IWG\u2019s offerings, he adds.The launch of Regus at 61 Robinson Road is about a year after IWG\u2019s opening of a Regus centre at Hiap Hoe Building at Zhongshan Park in Balestier in March 2022. The 10,328 sq ft space spans two floors and comprises 154 workstations and 49 private office suites.IWG centres in Singapore have recorded nearly a 65% year-on-year increase in visits in 4Q2022, compared to 4Q2021.Cautious leasing sentiment ahead\u00a0However, the office market in Singapore is expected to face some headwinds in the coming months that could dampen the overall leasing and rental expectations this year. This comes on the back of a tight office supply that is not expected to be resolved over the coming quarters.Andrew Tangye, head of office leasing advisory at JLL Singapore, says that the demand for office space has \u201cslowed down a little bit\u201d as a result of the tighter office availability and lack of new supply.\u201cWith all the global economic uncertainty, I think a lot of companies based here, or are looking to establish themselves here, are a bit more cautious at the moment. Certainly, 2023 is probably going to be characterised by a lot more cautionary behaviour, in terms of holding back on expanding, spending, and relocations compared to 2021 or 2022,\u201d says Tangye.Going forward, IWG hopes to expand its operations further to meet growing demand, despite the market uncertainty, says Rogers.\u201cAsia Pacific is a key region for IWG\u2019s growth. As we work towards adding more than 1,000 new locations across our global network this year, we are excited to bring more flexible workspace solutions to Singapore,\u201d adds Rogers.See Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools New Launch Condo & Landed Property in Singapore (COMPLETE list & updates) Banking hall turned business hub, The Work Project adds new elegance to 6 Battery Road Productivity, technology and sustainability will dominate workplace trends in 2023: IWG Mitsubishi Estate takes over IWG master franchise in Japan En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Cloud Providers by Revenue.  The boom in the Internet and the rise of computing have provided firms with a variety of new mediums to do business. While traditional businesses were restricted to analog computing and physical processes, these days firms have greater insights into their operations and can manage them even by sitting on opposite corners of the globe. A large part of this change is driven by cloud service providers, which is a diverse set of groups that ranges from firms such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) that provide computing capacity, to others like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) which provide the hardware that powers the services, and even more such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) that provide cloud based software as a service (SaaS) business process products.   Broadly speaking, while a couple of firms dominate the cloud market, there are a lot of\u00a0 smaller companies operating in the space as well. The cloud segment is also one of the faster growing industries in the world. According to a research report from Grand View Research, the cloud computing market was worth $484 billion last year and can grow to $619 billion by the end of last year. The sector is further estimated to then grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.1% to sit at a whopping $1.5 trillion by the end of 2030. While we've mentioned some of the largest cloud companies in the industry, there's little talk that specifically looks at some of the smallest companies in the industry. Well, there's detailed coverage of this segment in 10 Cloud Computing Stocks Under $5, with some of the most popular cloud computing providers with a share price less than $5 being Lumen Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LUMN), VNET Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:VNET), and Edgio, Inc. (NASDAQ:EGIO).   Building on this, another research report, this time from Fortune Business Insights, has even more optimistic growth estimates for the cloud computing provider market. It believes that the industry was worth $480 billion in 2022 and is estimated to be a trillion-dollar sector by 2029 through growing at a 19.9% CAGR and sitting at $1.7 trillion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm believes that the growth in artificial intelligence and machine learning will stimulate the industry's growth since they are crucial to firms' ability to monitor and analyze their data. It adds that out of the three different kinds of cloud providers, namely public clouds, private clouds, and hybrid clouds, the hybrid segment will be the fastest growing. This is due to the fact that as opposed to large firms such as Tesla, small and medium enterprises will adopt it in the near future in order to streamline their business processes, reduce costs, and improve productivity. Additionally, public clouds, namely those that offer the same products to different consumers, will continue to be the largest portion of the market.   Story Continues   Finally, taking a look at the situation on the ground, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s earnings call for its second quarter of the fiscal year 2023 provides some highlights as executives outlined: And lastly, we are going to lead in the AI era, knowing that maximum enterprise value gets created during platform shifts. With that as the backdrop, the Microsoft Cloud exceeded $27 billion in quarterly revenue, up 22% and 29% in constant currency. Now, I will highlight examples of our innovation starting with Azure. Moving to the cloud is the best way for any customer in today\u2019s economy to mitigate demand uncertainty and energy costs while gaining efficiencies of cloud native development. Enterprises have moved millions of calls to Azure and run twice as many calls on our cloud today than they did 2 years ago. And yet, we are still in the early innings when it comes to long-term cloud opportunity.  With these details in mind, let's take a look at the world's biggest cloud providers in terms of revenue, out of which the top three players are Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Amazon.com, Inc.

Photographer: Edwin Koo/Bloomberg  \u00b7 Bloomberg By Abhishek Vishnoi and David Ramli (Bloomberg) \u2014 SeaTown Holdings, indirectly owned by Temasek Holdings Pte., is planning to raise about $1.5 billion for its new Asia-focused private credit fund, people familiar with the matter said. Singapore state investment firm Temasek and its affiliates plan to commit about $1 billion for SeaTown\u2019s new private credit fund, launched late last year. An additional $500 million would be raised from external sources, the people said, requesting not to be named because the matter is private.  It\u2019s not clear whether the money coming from Temasek and its affiliates would be a fresh allocation to the alternative asset class or capital recycled from SeaTown\u2019s other private credit fund. One of the biggest shifts in debt markets in recent years has been the rise of private credit, where asset managers make loans directly to companies \u2014 often smaller or less creditworthy ones \u2014 as banks pull back. While Asia accounts for only a small portion of the global pool, it\u2019s growing quickly. Fundraising in the region touched $11.2 billion last year, up 42% increase versus 2021, according to a Global Private Capital Association report. India and Southeast Asia drove the increase in transactions for 2022, it said. Spokespeople for both SeaTown and Temasek declined to comment. Temasek indirectly owns SeaTown through its asset management group Seviora Holdings Pte. SeaTown\u2019s first private credit fund, launched in December 2019, has $1.23 billion in committed capital, according to the firm\u2019s website. Its second private credit fund was launched in November. While SeaTown\u2019s fund will primarily invest in Asia Pacific, it has the option to invest as much as 25% of committed capital in non-APAC deals, according to some of the people. That figure could still change, one of the people said. However, the fund will not actively seek out non-APAC deals, the people said. The fund is aiming for an internal rate of return of 14% to 15% and a multiple on invested capital at 1.4 times for its investors, according to some of the people. \u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.

One of them was regarding the hot semiconductor industry, the very bedrock upon which all computing technologies are based. Amazon has actually been investing in its own in-house semiconductor designs for years, and it's been increasingly focused on high-performance machine learning processors which are used, among other things, to power the large language models (LLMs) that services like ChatGPT are built upon. \nNvidia (NVDA -2.56%) stock has been booming recently based on optimism about its long-term revenue growth prospects from LLMs, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are leading the charge in this department. But could Amazon's chip investments mean trouble for Nvidia?\u00a0\n\nJassy on what makes a good investment\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) was a pioneer in the rapidly expanding cloud industry. Today, it's AWS that pays the bills at the Amazon empire, and helps fund plenty of other business investments.\nBut how does Amazon decide to invest in a new venture like semiconductor design? As Jassy explained in the 2022 annual shareholder letter, there are four primary metrics: \n\u2022 If we were successful, could it be big and have a reasonable return on invested capital?\n\u2022 Is the opportunity being well-served today?\n\u2022 Do we have a differentiated approach?\n\u2022 And, do we have competence in that area? And if not, can we acquire it quickly?\nApparently, the answer to each of those four questions was \"yes\" when AWS considered designing data center chips -- the computing hardware that powers the cloud. To kick start its silicon dream, it quietly acquired Israeli chip design start-up Annapurna Labs in 2015 for $350 million. \n\n\n\n\n\nHow Amazon's investment has paid off\nAnnapurna Labs has designed numerous chips for AWS, including its Graviton processors -- ARM-based chip alternatives to the CPUs provided by Intel and AMD.\u00a0But what about computing accelerators such as Nvidia's GPUs, which are powering new AI services like ChatGPT? \nThat's where the AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips come in. Neither of these computing accelerators rival Nvidia's latest-and-greatest designs in sheer computational power (neither do Alphabet's Google Cloud in-house chips). But that wasn't Amazon's primary goal when developing Trainium and Inferentia. Cost-effectiveness was the objective. \nAs their names imply, Trainium is geared toward training LLMs in how to behave, using massive amounts of data. Inferentia is for inference, which is where the bulk of the computing work is done after an AI model is trained. Inference is how that trained AI program makes decisions (like when you ask ChatGPT a question, and it comes back with an answer) based on what it has already learned. \nAWS is using Trainium and Inferentia for itself, but has also made its more cost-effective accelerators available to customers. Jassy said in the shareholder letter that common AI models trained with Trainium \"are up to 140% faster\" than similar GPU systems \"at up to 70% lower cost.\" And as for AI inference, Jassy said its Inferentia chips have \"saved companies like Amazon over a hundred million dollars in capital expense\" since their introduction in 2019. \n\n\n\n\n\nPut simply, Amazon's $350 million investment in Annapurna back in 2015 looks like it will have an incredible long-term payoff for AWS, and for shareholders.\u00a0\nPushing Nvidia to do better?\nCompetition is a great thing because it keeps business leaders pushing their companies toward continuous improvement. Nvidia is going to make hay from its most cutting-edge GPUs geared for advanced AI, but it has lots of other chips it can keep improving too. For example, in March, it launched new L4 GPUs geared toward AI inference, complete with a software stack to help optimize various AI workloads and lower the total cost of ownership for cloud providers and customers. \u00a0\nIndeed, while Amazon AWS and other cloud providers stir the pot with announcements about their own silicon designs, AWS remains a major Nvidia customer. AWS's in-house chips currently fill a small niche within the cloud titan's operation. \u00a0\nOf course, rising competition from its fellow tech giants is a big risk for Nvidia. But it's far from defenseless. Plus, cloud computing and AI are still early on in their adoption curves. As Jassy pointed out at the conclusion of his shareholder letter, though AWS revenue was $80 billion in 2022, \"about 90% of Global IT spending\" is still made in on-premises systems that have yet to migrate to the cloud. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, though Amazon AWS has made quick progress on designing chips in-house, there is plenty of new business to go around. Nvidia will be just fine.\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

These stocks have effectively captured the attention of forward-thinking investors seeking long-term growth opportunities.\nThe robotics sphere has been expanding at a rapid pace, with advancements in computing power and data handling capabilities facilitating mechatronic devices to perform tasks that were once deemed impossible. Moreover, industries such as healthcare, logistics, and automotive are experiencing significant disruption, making robotics stocks remarkably lucrative over the long term.\nAccording to a report last year, the global robotics market is projected to grow at a staggering annualized rate of 22.8% over the next decade, reaching a whopping $214 billion by 2030. This growth is driven by robust demand for industrial robots and technological enhancements. Artificial intelligence has vastly improved human-robot interactions, with cutting-edge chips enabling seamless collaboration. The surge in heavy-duty robotics applications continues to fuel demand for these innovative machines.\u00a0That said, let\u2019s delve into the top seven needle-moving robotics stocks that present promising long-term growth opportunities at current prices.\n\n\n\n\nPATH\nUiPath\n$17.56\n\n\nIRTC\nIrthythm\n$124.03\n\n\nNVDA\nNvidia\n$277.77\n\n\nIRBT\niRobot\n$43.64\n\n\nISRG\nIntuitive Surgical\n$255.47\n\n\nABB\nABB.\n$34.30\n\n\nTER\nTeradyne\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Robotics Stocks: UiPath (PATH)\nSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.com\nUiPath\u00a0(NYSE:PATH) is a robotic process automation (RPA) specialist, developing and supporting software bots that can effectively handle virtual tasks. These bots assist human workers in streamlining workloads and boosting productivity. Moreover, with its cutting-edge technologies, organizations can effectively automate tasks, freeing up resources and eventually leading to massive cost reductions.\nUiPath has been growing sales rapidly, with triple-digit net retention rates. In the past eight consecutive quarters, the firm has surpassed expectations on both lines. Moreover, it continues to grow its annual recurring revenues (ARR) each quarter, recently recording a 30% bump in its most recent quarter.\u00a0As it maintains stable revenue growth over the next few years, it can finally break even and reverse its stock\u2019s negative trajectory.\n\niRyhthm Technologies (IRTC)\nSource: Epic Cure / Shutterstock\niRyhthm Technologies\u00a0(NASDAQ:IRTC) is a medical device company known for its popular Zio heart rate monitor. Its advanced heart monitoring systems streamline the process of data collection and monitoring allowing healthcare professionals to make more effective decisions.\nThe firm\u2019s single-use heart monitor helps detect abnormalities in heart rate patterns. iRhythm claims its devices can effectively increase early detection, which means patients will experience lower rates of heart failures, strokes, and hospitalizations. Its core market has a 20% penetration of roughly five million patients.\nThe company has gained excellent traction with its target market, growing its revenue base by roughly 35% over the past five years. Additionally, it boasts a gross margin of 71.8% during the same period, significantly ahead of the sector median. As we advance, the firm expects 69% to 70% gross margins this year.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\nSource: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.com\nNvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) robust graphics processing units (GPU) have effectively revolutionized multiple industries, including robotics. Rapid computation is crucial for a sophisticated system like a robot, and Nvidia\u2019s GPUs effectively meet this need.\nNvidia\u2019s Jetson computing platforms are tailor-made for artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics applications. Its role in robotics is to provide the necessary computing power for AI and machine learning algorithms, enabling robots to perform complicated tasks. Through Jetson\u2019s capabilities, robotics developers can build smarter and more autonomous machines that can effectively adapt to various environments.\nFurthermore, as the robotics industry moves from strength to strength, Nvidia\u2019s Jetson platform and other initiatives could add another layer to its illustrious growth story.\n\niRobot (IRBT)\nSource: shutterstock.com/CC7\niRobot\u00a0(NASDAQ:IRBT) started as a military equipment producer, including robots for defusing bombs. Nowadays, it\u2019s popular for its robotic cleaning devices, mainly the Roomba vacuum cleaners and Braava floor mops. It has sold millions of its home-cleaning devices, which experienced a particularly significant spike in interest during the pandemic.\u00a0In recent quarters, though, growth rates have normalized, significantly weighing its stock price. However, Amazon\u2019s acquisition bid for the company could be a major catalyst for its stock price moving forward.\nAmazon is looking to acquire the business for $61 a share, which is more than 40% higher than its current stock price. Also, if the deal falls through, iRobot could be picked up by another major company as the industry consolidates.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG)\nSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.com\nCalifornia-based\u00a0Intuitive Surgical\u00a0(NASDAQ:ISRG) is a leader in developing robotic surgical procedures, covering minimally invasive to major surgeries. Perhaps the most popular product is the da Vinci surgical system, used for repairing heart valves, gynecologic procedures, and prostate surgeries. These devices can cost upward of $2 million with a sticky user base. Intuitive\u2019s installed base was at 7,544 systems at the end of December last year, a 12% bump from 6,730 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021.\nAnother fascinating product in its portfolio is Ion Endoluminal System, a robotic-assisted platform that provides minimally invasive biopsies in the lungs. Overall, the company\u2019s products have demonstrated greater accuracy and precision in delivering robust outcomes.\n\nABB Ltd. (ABB)\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\nAI pure-play ABB Ltd.\u00a0(NYSE:ABB) provided its customers with various industrial automation solutions. Its solutions include algorithms, robotics, computer visions, and others to help reduce downtime and smoothen out production processes.\u00a0The economic slowdown has severely impacted its recent results. However, better access to components, effective pricing execution, and volume release from its backlog resulted in better sales growth. Over the long term, ABB aims to deliver EBITDA margins of 15% regardless of the market conditions.\nBesides, its robotics and discrete automation segment grew over 20% in its most recent quarter and has been a bright spot over the past several quarters. It recently invested $20 million in expanding its robotics factory in the U.S. to cater to the increased demand for automation for U.S. businesses.\n\nTeradyne (TER)\nSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.com\nTeradyne\u00a0(NASDAQ:TER)\u00a0is a renowned developer of industrial equipment that focuses on automating repetitive tasks.

Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeTom Warren is a senior editor and author of Notepad, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.I could end this Nvidia RTX 4070 review early and say it\u2019s simply a $600 RTX 3080, but it\u2019s far more complicated than that. This is Nvidia\u2019s most affordable RTX 40-series card yet, after the $1,600 RTX 4090, $1,200 RTX 4080, and $800 RTX 4070 Ti. The RTX 4070 arrives on April 13th, starting at $599, which is $100 less than the RTX 3080 and $100 more than the RTX 3070.After an \u201cunlaunched\u201d 12GB RTX 4080 saw a swift rebranding to the RTX 4070 Ti without a Founders Edition, Nvidia is now ready to offer its own Founders Edition RTX 4070 to put the pressure on board partners to stick to its $599.99 retail pricing.The RTX 4070 delivers solid performance at 1440p that\u2019s comparable to the RTX 3080, but at 4K, it misses out in nearly every game. If you\u2019re wanting to upgrade from a 1080p experience to a 1440p monitor, the RTX 4070 is worth considering, but I was expecting a little more from a generational leap.7Verge ScoreNvidia RTX 4070$600$600The GoodSolid 1440p performanceLower power draw than an RTX 3080DLSS 3The Bad12GB of VRAM4K performanceThe power adapter$600 at Best Buy$600 at NeweggHow we rate and review productsHardwareI\u2019m impressed at the size of the RTX 4070, especially compared to the RTX 4080 and RTX 4090. It\u2019s the first RTX 40-series Founders Edition card that isn\u2019t giant, and it\u2019s actually shorter than the RTX 3080, too. Weirdly, it still ships in the same comically huge box that the RTX 4090 comes in, even though it\u2019s a two-slot card that will easily fit into most cases and even small form factor ones.The RTX 4070 Founders Edition card has similar design aspects to the RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 GPUs. Nvidia is using a die-cast aluminum body, dual axial fans, and an eight-layer PCB on the RTX 4070. The cooling system has been improved over the RTX 3070 thanks to a new copper pedestal that cools the GPU alongside four heat pipes. Nvidia has also improved its own axial fans so they\u2019re more powerful to improve cooling. As always, third-party cards will have a variety of cooling system designs.The RTX 4070 ports. Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeThere are three DisplayPort 1.4 ports (up to 240Hz at 4K with DSC) and a single HDMI 2.1 port (up to 60Hz at 8K with DSC) at the rear, much like the other RTX 40-series cards. Nvidia hasn\u2019t moved to DisplayPort 2.1 like AMD has, and that\u2019s probably not too much of an issue, given this is more designed for 1440p gaming than super high refresh rate 4K gaming.Like the rest of the RTX 40-series cards, Nvidia is now using a single 12-pin PCIe 5 connector on the RTX 4070. There\u2019s a 12VHPWR adapter cable in the box so you can connect two eight-pin PCIe power cables. I still really dislike this power adapter, and I recommend investing in a single cable solution from third parties like CableMod.RelatedNvidia RTX 4090 review: a 4K beastNvidia RTX 4080 review: performance, for a priceNvidia RTX 4070 Ti review: a possible AMD challenger if the price is rightSpeaking of power, Nvidia has made the RTX 4070 a lot more efficient so it can deliver RTX 3080 levels of performance while using less power. The RTX 4070 only needs a 650-watt power supply, the same as the RTX 3070 requirements, compared to the 750-watt supplies necessary for the RTX 3080 and 3070 Ti. The RTX 4070 has a 200-watt TGP, and it regularly runs below that in a variety of games. The RTX 3080 maxed out at a 320-watt TGP, so the power savings are clear for what is similar performance.The RTX 4070 ships with 12GB of memory, which is only 4GB more than the RTX 3070 and just 2GB more than the original RTX 3080 10GB model. I think it\u2019s disappointing that Nvidia hasn\u2019t gone to 16GB of memory here, especially when we\u2019re starting to see modern games already eat up 8GB cards at max settings for 1080p or 1440p gaming and far beyond that for 4K.AMD has been going in the opposite direction, shipping its $900 RX 7900 XT with 20GB memory and its $1,000 RX 7900 XTX with 24GB of memory. Nvidia\u2019s $800 RTX 4070 Ti also ships with 12GB of memory, while the $1,200 RTX 4080 comes equipped with 16GB of memory, and the $1,600 RTX 4090 has access to 24GB.1440p benchmarksFor 1440p testing, I paired the RTX 4070 with AMD\u2019s latest Ryzen 7 7800X3D processor pushing a 32-inch Samsung Odyssey G7 monitor. This monitor supports refresh rates up to 240Hz as well as Nvidia\u2019s G-Sync technology.AMD test machine:CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3DCPU cooler: Corsair H150i Elite LCDMotherboard: MSI Meg X670E AceRAM: 32GB G.Skill DDR5 6000Case: Corsair Crystal 570XPSU: Corsair HX1000WI\u2019ve put the RTX 4070 head-to-head with the RTX 3080, RTX 3070, RTX 3070 Ti, and RTX 4070 Ti to see where this latest RTX 40-series GPU slots into Nvidia\u2019s lineup. I\u2019ve tested a variety of AAA games like Cyberpunk 2077, Forza Horizon 5, and Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla. All games were tested at high or ultra settings across all of the GPUs tested, and most managed to exceed 100fps or come close to it.The RTX 4070 is around 30 percent faster than the previous RTX 3070 in most games at 1440p and offers similar performance to the RTX 3080. Meanwhile, the step-up RTX 4070 Ti is around 25 percent better than the RTX 4070 at 1440p.RTX 4070 average FPS (1440p)BenchmarkRTX 3070RTX 3070 TiRTX 3080RTX 4070RTX 4070 TiShadow of the Tomb Raider118132156159199Shadow of the Tomb Raider + DLSS 2 quality148162187202250Forza Horizon 5 Extreme97107113128155Forza Horizon 5 + DLSS 2 quality98105114127153Forza Horizon 5 + DLSS 3 qualityN/AN/AN/A159194CS:GO536555570487551Gears 596108124129167Metro Exodus Enhanced Ultra69688482104Metro Exodus Enhanced Extreme4144555470Returnal79839695122Assassin's Creed Valhalla8596105111132Watch Dogs: Legion72799190115Watch Dogs: Legion + DLSS 2 + RT4860777998Cyberpunk 207766738780102Cyberpunk 2077 + DLSS 2 quality + RT5056676886Cyberpunk 2077 + DLSS 3 quality + RTN/AN/AN/A120151The RTX 4070 delivers impressive gains over the RTX 3080 in titles like Forza Horizon 5 and Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla but loses out in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Nvidia was able to reproduce the dips in performance for CS:GO in my previous RTX 4070 Ti review, so there must be some kind of bug affecting RTX 40-series cards in the benchmark that we use.Where the RTX 4070 really comes alive is with DLSS 3. Nvidia\u2019s latest upscaling technique is exclusive to the RTX 40-series cards and uses the same AI from DLSS 2 alongside a new AI frame generation technology. DLSS 3 generates two frames using existing rendering techniques; then, a third frame is inserted between them using the new frame generation tech.The result is a big uplift in performance. I enabled DLSS 3 in Forza Horizon 5, and frame rates jumped from 127fps average with DLSS 2 to 159fps average with DLSS 3. That\u2019s a 25 percent performance bump. If we compare the RTX 3080 with just DLSS 2 to the RTX 4070 with DLSS 3, then the performance uplift is almost 40 percent.I saw even more impressive results with Cyberpunk 2077 and DLSS 3. Moving from the ray tracing ultra preset with DLSS 2 quality enabled up to DLSS 3 nearly doubled frame rates from 68fps to 120fps at 1440p on the RTX 4070.4K benchmarksOn the 4K side, the RTX 4070 isn\u2019t as impressive against the RTX 3080 here, and that\u2019s probably why Nvidia is marketing this as a 1440p card. I paired this GPU with a 31.5-inch Acer Nitro XV2 monitor. This monitor supports refresh rates up to 144Hz, but the RTX 4070 didn\u2019t come close to making use of that refresh rate even with the help of DLSS.In most games, the RTX 3080 beats the RTX 4070 at 4K, with Forza Horizon 5 and Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla the noticeable exceptions. But the RTX 4070 comfortably beats the RTX 3070 at 4K, delivering close to 60fps in most games. You\u2019ll probably want to drop some settings to get some better performance at 4K, though.RTX 4070 average FPS (4K)BenchmarkRTX 3070RTX 3070 TiRTX 3080RTX 4070RTX 4070 TiShadow of the Tomb Raider63728783103Shadow of the Tomb Raider + DLSS 2 quality89100119120148Forza Horizon 5 Extreme77738389111Forza Horizon 5 + DLSS 2 quality67738691112Forza Horizon 5 + DLSS 3 qualityN/AN/AN/A99121CS:GO306329372219282Gears 55260716483Metro Exodus Enhanced Ultra4140494860Metro Exodus Enhanced Extreme2325323041Returnal4749615670Assassin's Creed Valhalla5257646578Watch Dogs: Legion3740575265Watch Dogs: Legion + DLSS 2 + RT2022464860Cyberpunk 20773135434248Cyberpunk 2077 + DLSS 2 quality + RT2227363544Cyberpunk 2077 + DLSS 3 quality + RTN/AN/AN/A7189Once again, the RTX 4070 Ti is around 25 percent better than the RTX 4070 at 4K, but you\u2019re paying about 33 percent more for the extra performance the RTX 4070 Ti delivers at both 1440p and 4K.The RTX 3080 was all about delivering better 4K performance at less than $1,000, but nearly three years later, the latest games demand more at 4K now. It\u2019s disappointing that the RTX 4070 can\u2019t always keep up here when it\u2019s able to at 1440p.DLSS 3 obviously makes a big different in supported games, though. One of the big new additions is path tracing in Cyberpunk 2077 in its new Overdrive Mode. This mode only went live a day before this review, so I\u2019ve had limited time to test it fully across multiple GPUs, but at 1440p there are some promising results with DLSS 3 enabled on the RTX 4070.The maxed out Overdrive Mode, which provides film-like lighting and visuals runs at 61fps at 1440p on the RTX 4070. That\u2019s more than three times better than the 18fps it runs at without DLSS enabled at all.RTX 4070 DLSS 3BenchmarkRTX 4070 (1440p)RTX 4070 (4K)Cyberpunk 2077 RT overdrive188Cyberpunk 2077 RT overdrive DLSS 2 quality3617Cyberpunk 2077 RT overdrive DLSS 3 quality6125Flight Simulator7243Flight Simulator + DLSS 314986Over on the 4K side the RTX 4070 doesn\u2019t fare as well in the Cyberpunk 2077 Overdrive Mode test. It\u2019s a super demanding new technical test and it only runs at 8fps without DLSS on the RTX 4070 at 4K. Once again we see performance more than triple thanks to DLSS 3, but that\u2019s only getting things up to 25fps so you\u2019ll definitely want to play around with lowering settings or DLSS performance modes to improve the frame rates at 4K here.I also briefly tested DLSS 3 with Microsoft Flight Simulator on the RTX 4070. It\u2019s another demanding title on both CPU and GPU, and DLSS 3 manages to double frame rates at both 4K and 1440p on the RTX 4070. At 4K it brings frame rates from 43fps without DLSS all the way up to a much more playable 86fps on the RTX 4070.The new power connector on the RTX 4070. Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeI called the RTX 3070 the sweet spot for 1440p gaming nearly three years ago, and little has changed for the RTX 4070. It delivers solid 1440p gaming at frame rates that can take advantage of 144Hz monitors, particularly if you\u2019re willing to drop settings in some of the more demanding games.The RTX 4070 is very similar to the RTX 3080 performance at 1440p, but at 4K, it clearly misses out. I would have liked to have seen a little more performance with the RTX 4070, especially at 4K, but DLSS 3 is a reasonable selling point to consider if you\u2019re looking at spending around $600 on a GPU right now. DLSS 3 can make up performance in certain games, but generational leaps should really deliver it in any title.At $599, the RTX 4070 is the most reasonably priced RTX 40-series GPU so far and Nvidia\u2019s fourth in the series. It will be tempting for those still on GTX 10-series or RTX 20-series GPUs at that price point, particularly as GPUs from AMD and Nvidia have jumped in price this generation.But I\u2019d still be tempted to wait to see what AMD can offer at this price point or below. We\u2019ve only seen two RDNA GPUs from AMD so far, targeting RTX 4080-level performance with better price points. AMD might not be able to match Nvidia at the top-end RTX 4090 levels or ray tracing and DLSS performance, but many will be hoping it can beat Nvidia on price again.Correction, April 12, 2023, 2:04PM ET: The RTX 4070 is missing DisplayPort 2.1, not HDMI 2.1. They got swapped in my head, sorry for the confusion.Update, April 13, 2023, 10:00AM ET: Added links to stores selling the RTX 4070 now that it\u2019s available for purchase.See More: EntertainmentGamingNvidiaPC GamingReviewsTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

By now, you\u2019re familiar with how artificial intelligence could change every aspect of our lives. You\u2019ve likely seen the oft-cited Grand View Research stat that the global AI market could hit $1.81 trillion by 2030. And you\u2019ve probably heard Bank of America analysts say AI is on the brink of an \u201ciPhone moment\u201d and could boost the global economy by $15.7 trillion by the end of the decade.  \u201cWe are at a defining moment \u2014 like the internet in the \u201990s \u2014 where [AI] is moving towards mass adoption, with large language models like ChatGPT finally enabling us to fully capitalize on the data revolution,\u201d the firm said. Along the way, you\u2019ve also heard about the big AI stocks like C3.ai (NYSE:AI), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, GOOG), Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). However, there are a few surprising AI plays you might not have thought of like the ones below.

As its partner Atrium noted, in the past, connecting candidates with employers was largely done through paper-based processes and legacy IT systems. But Robert Half has since begun to harness the power of AI, working together with Atrium to build machine-learning models that \u201ccan quickly identify top matches to open job orders and expand their talent search by surfacing new candidates who are similar to those already on their lists in order to best meet their clients\u2019 needs.\u201d  While the latest jobs report points to a weakening labor market as companies look to cut costs by laying off workers, the incorporation of AI and machine learning should support demand for Robert Half\u2019s services.\u00a0According to ComputerWorld, two recent studies show that 35% to 45% of companies plan to use AI-based talent acquisition software and services to fill job positions in the year ahead. Caterpillar (CAT)    Source: astudio / Shutterstock.com Even construction equipment company Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is taking part in the AI boom. In fact, the company is \u201cinvesting heavily in AI,\u201d according to Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jim Umpleby. \u201cThe company has for years been digitizing everything from bulldozers to diggers to get early alerts of problems and keep them from breaking down. Its system uses AI to better anticipate when a machine may break, and in some cases may automatically alert a dealer to provide a new part,\u201d Bloomberg reports.   Story Continues Additionally, the company\u2019s digital tech division, Cat Digital, uses AI and digital twins to discover how customers use its products in an effort to improve design and efficiency.\u201cFrom selling hardware and services, Caterpillar may be able to even offer A.I.-driven customer outcomes such as ultra-granular forecasting of downtimes and highly automated drilling processes,\u201d Fortune reports.SoundHound AI (SOUN)  A sign for SoundHound AI (SOUN) out front of an office building.

This is a massive market opportunity for the company, with analyst Sam Abuelsamid predicting 90% of new vehicles will have voice assistants by 2028.\u201cConversational AI is at a watershed moment and our proprietary Dynamic Interaction and Generative AI solutions are perfectly positioned,\u201d said CEO Keyvan Mohajer in the company\u2019s latest earnings release. \u201cFrom electricity to telecommunications to internet search, each generation has established a new foundational capability to better serve society, and AI will catalyze this next horizon.\u201dSpeaking of earnings, fourth-quarter revenue was up 84% year over year to $9.5 million. Gross margin improved to 71%, while the company\u2019s losses shrunk. In other words, SoundHound AI is moving in the right direction fundamentally.On the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

It provides insights into the financial health of a company. During this time, companies release their financial results, which include revenue, earnings, and other metrics that can influence stock prices. For this reason, investors tend to focus on the earnings season to make informed investment decisions. However, one thing that occurs during this season that is not often highlighted is the change in Analyst Ratings.What Is an Analyst Rating/Recommendation?An analyst rating is both a recommendation and advice issued by financial analysts or researchers to its clients concerning what assets to invest in - and what assets not to invest in. They range from a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d to a \u201cStrong Sell\u201d based on the consensus of the recommendation. These ratings also hold an influence on the perception of a stock, like if a stock is labeled a \u201cStrong Sell\u201d, investors would highly likely avoid the stock, or traders would \u201cshort\u201d (borrow the stock from the broker and buy back at a lower cost and profit from the difference). Investors may find this in their brokers, financial websites, etc.Change in the Rating?The change in ratings occurs when one or some of the analysts change their bias/recommendation on the company, ultimately affecting the ratings or perception of most investors. These changes can allow investors to buy into companies with brighter prospects ahead of them.For example, when an analyst from HSBC changed his view on NVDA from a \u201creduce\u201d to a \u201cbuy,\u201d NVDA jumped higher and made a 52-week high.In the same way, when JP Morgan raised their rating for HP Inc and lowered Dell\u2019s rating, it caused the price to gap up and trade higher.Limitations on Analyst RatingsSince analyst ratings are based on the fundamentals and future prospects of the company, investors should still note that it is never a foolproof method. Analysts can still make mistakes in their recommendations or assumptions. Investors should still consider what the consensus says. For example, if most analysts have changed from a \u201cHold\u201d to a \u201cStrong Sell,\u201d then perhaps it's time for investors to think about liquidating their positions.Now let\u2019s look at analyst-covered companies and see how we can leverage potential changes in their rating using news, earnings release, etc.Tesla Inc. TSLATesla is Elon Musk's baby, and arguably his most important holding. Elon Musk has recently expressed his plans to launch his own AI platform, \"TruthGPT\u201d to rival ChatGPT, which Microsoft backs. Tesla is one of the players in the AI space and has been exploring automated driving by the use of AI using autopilot tells us that Tesla can be one of the beneficiaries of the new technology that Elon Musk plans to launch. Thus, it influences analyst perception of the company\u2019s prospects.With Tesla\u2019s current rating as a \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d further news on integrating AI into its products may help analysts estimate a brighter future for Tesla and raise their rating.Booking Holdings Inc. BKNGAnother way investors can follow analyst sentiment changes is during earnings releases and earnings surprises. Analysts covering companies would generally have an estimate on the company's next earnings release. However, in some cases, companies beat market expectations and catch them by surprise. The bigger the \u201csurprise,\u201d the better it is for the company. These \u201csurprises\u201d can strongly influence analyst perception and recommendation as analysts use company fundamentals as one of the key factors in their recommendations. As a result, investors should note when a prospective stock will release earnings to capitalize on these potential opportunities.Final ThoughtsInvesting in companies that analysts have vetted is one way of simplifying any investor's investment process. However, it is still good practice to be able to read through other analyst recommendations and research to have a better grasp on the company\u2019s prospects and financial health. In this environment where the market can switch directions automatically, due diligence is an investor's best friend.On the date of publication, Rick Orford had a position in: TSLA .

Alphabet's self-driving division, Waymo, was founded back in 2009, but its cars continue to be plagued\u00a0by glitches.\nIn other words, autonomous driving hasn't become foolproof yet. Of course, automakers and component suppliers have introduced various levels of autonomy in their products, but full autonomy hasn't become a reality. Still, companies involved in this space continue to test their technologies and pour money into autonomous driving systems.\nThat's not surprising as the global autonomous vehicle market is expected to generate a whopping $2.3 trillion in revenue by 2030 compared to $147 billion last year, according to Next Move Strategy Consulting. Semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA -2.56%) is going to be at the forefront of this massive growth as its artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been playing a critical role in helping autonomous vehicles get better. Let's look at the reasons why.\n\nNvidia's graphics cards have been playing a key role in autonomous driving\nNvidia has been involved in the development of self-driving cars for a long time. In January 2015, Nvidia announced the launch of the Drive CX and Drive PX automotive platforms. While Drive CX was a digital cockpit solution, Drive PX was an image-processing solution to aid the development of self-driving cars. The company upped its game in 2016 with Drive PX2, which it claimed was the world's first in-car AI supercomputer.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrive PX2 used Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) and deep learning algorithms to help the company's automotive partners develop self-driving solutions. The good part is that Nvidia has honed its automotive AI technology over the years with the help of more powerful GPUs. The company unveiled\u00a0its latest generation of Nvidia Drive, known as Thor, in September last year.\nAccording to Nvidia, Drive Thor \"achieves up to 2,000 teraflops of performance [and] unifies intelligent functions -- including automated and assisted driving, parking, driver and occupant monitoring, digital instrument cluster, in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) and rear-seat entertainment -- into a single architecture for greater efficiency and lower overall system cost.\"\nThat's a big jump over the Drive PX2's computing performance of 8 teraflops, suggesting that Nvidia's autonomous vehicle platform evolved big-time over the years and is now more capable. That's not surprising as Nvidia's GPU architecture has improved significantly since the launch of the Drive PX, which was based\u00a0on the 28-nanometer (nm) Maxwell\u00a0architecture. Thor, meanwhile, is based on the 5 nm Ada Lovelace architecture, which explains the terrific bump in performance over Nvidia's first-gen Drive platform.\nA smaller process node helped Nvidia pack a greater number of transistors more closely in its chips, allowing it to generate more computing power and reduce power consumption. As a result, Nvidia's GPUs are now way more powerful for tackling AI workloads and powering self-driving cars than they were a few years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all, GPUs are the backbone of autonomous driving functions such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) thanks to their ability to carry out millions of calculations simultaneously. They can process huge amounts of data quickly, which is the key to making decisions in real time for self-driving cars. Nvidia executive Danny Shapiro believes that Thor will enable automakers to scale up to full autonomy, which would eliminate the need for human intervention in vehicles, indicating that the company is likely to be at the forefront of self-driving technology in the future.\nMore importantly, the company's position in the autonomous vehicle market could supercharge its growth in the long run.\nAutonomous vehicles could become big business for the chipmaker\nNvidia's automotive segment is currently a small portion of its overall business, but it has been growing at a nice clip. The company generated\u00a0$903 million in automotive revenue in fiscal 2023, a 60% jump over the prior year. For comparison, Nvidia's overall revenue stood stagnant at nearly $27 billion during the fiscal year.\nNvidia credited\u00a0its robust automotive growth to the \"growth in sales of self-driving solutions, computing solutions for electric vehicle makers and strength in sales of AI cockpit solutions.\" However, this is just the beginning as Nvidia's potential automotive pipeline stands\u00a0at $14 billion for the next six years, indicating that this business is likely to gain more momentum.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven better, Nvidia sees\u00a0a $300 billion long-term opportunity in the automotive market, driven by the growing levels of automation and the increasing demand for image processing that its GPUs carry out. The good part is that Nvidia has built a solid ecosystem\u00a0of automakers, component suppliers, and software vendors to tap this huge opportunity.\nMercedes-Benz, Volvo, BYD, Navistar, and Hyundai are some of the names that are utilizing Nvidia's self-driving AI technology. As these companies bring their products to the market, the tech giant should be able to convert more of its potential automotive opportunity into actual revenue and accelerate its growth in the long run.\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) sent shares in several related companies soaring, with Apple\u00a0(AAPL -0.87%) and Nvidia\u00a0(NVDA -2.56%) stocks up 28% and 90%, respectively, since Jan. 1. \nThese companies have solid histories of growth thanks to substantial market shares in their respective industries. Apple became a mammoth in tech because of its dominance in consumer products, while Nvidia profited from increasing demand for its chips.\u00a0\nThese companies are building the future as the potential leaders of two high-growth markets: AI and VR/AR (aka the global XR market). The question is, which industry is likely to offer more significant gains over the long term?\nSo let's consider whether Apple or Nvidia is the better growth stock right now.\u00a0\nApple: The future leader of a $31 billion market\nApple has rallied investors this year with a planned venture into the global XR market, with a new headset projected to launch in 2023. Related acquisitions and patents filed over the years have all but confirmed the company's interest in the industry. However, a Bloomberg report in January revealed new details about the coming device, which is expected to feature virtual and augmented features alongside an iPhone-like OS and retail for around $3,000. \n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Statista, the VR and AR market will achieve a value of $31 billion in 2023, projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.7% through 2027. The industry's outlook is positive for Apple. However, recent headwinds could prove tricky for the company to overcome.\u00a0\n\nMeta Platforms achieved an 81% market share in global XR, according to Counterpoint Research, thanks to its line of Quest headsets. The company has sunk billions into growing the market and its metaverse, or what it sees as the next iteration of the internet. However, recent price drops for its headsets suggest encouraging consumers to adopt the technology has been challenging. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Disney recently sunsetting their metaverse divisions speaks volumes about their expectations for the future of AR and VR.\nApple has a solid history of defying expectations when entering new markets. It has been a major driver in the mass adoption of numerous technologies, such as smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and Bluetooth headphones. However, it likely has a mountain to climb to get its coming VR/AR headset into the hands of consumers.\nNvidia: A crucial role to play in the development of AI\nNvidia's stock skyrocketed in 2023, experiencing a strong recovery after plunging 50% last year. Investors grew particularly bullish over the company's prospects in AI, which has experienced a boom in recent months.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT stunned the tech world last November with its ability to produce human-like dialogue based on prompts. The advanced chatbot prompted numerous tech companies to pivot their businesses toward AI development to join the burgeoning industry.\u00a0\n\nThe AI market hit a value of $137 billion in 2022 and is expected to see a CAGR of 37.3% through 2030 (per Grand View Research). The technology has the potential to enhance countless industries, from cloud computing to education, healthcare, and more. Meanwhile, Nvidia is home to the hardware required to run and develop AI software with its graphics process units (GPUs).\u00a0\nIn fact, Nvidia is the primary supplier of GPUs to ChatGPT, which unitized 20,000 units in 2020. According to research from TrendForce, that figure will likely hit 30,000 soon as ChatGPT prepares for commercialization. Alongside competing AI platforms currently in development, demand for Nvidia's GPUs could surge in the coming years.\u00a0\nIs Apple or Nvidia the better growth stock?\nApple's market cap of $2.6 trillion compared to Nvidia's $686 billion make these companies vastly different in size and value. However, that could play in Nvidia's favor, with more room for growth as the less mature company. This is evident by comparing the companies' five-year stock performance, with the chart below showing that Nvidia has outperformed Apple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData by YCharts\nMoreover, there is very little contest between choosing to invest in the future of the global XR market or AI. VR/AR has vast potential, and if Apple and Meta's hopes for the technology come to fruition, it could change everything. However, AI currently has more tangible applications, already utilized in many industries. Additionally, Nvidia's role as a supplier of GPUs to ChatGPT strengthens the argument for the semiconductor company.\nAs a result, Nvidia is the better growth stock for now, but keeping an eye on Apple to queue up for future investment is also a great idea.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDani Cook has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

To do it again, it will rely on the exploding demand for its cutting-edge processors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$2.9T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(-2.56%)\u00a0-$3.06\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$116.47\n\n\nPrice as of March 18, 2025, 3:13 p.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you know it, these three companies might surpass Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nBerkshire\u00a0Hathaway is an enormous company. With a market capitalization topping $717 billion, Berkshire Hathaway ranks fifth on the list of largest American companies by market cap.\nAnd while Berkshire has been a staple of the top 10 dating back to 2009, many companies have overtaken Berkshire during the last 14 years.\nLet's have a look at three companies I think are poised to surpass Berkshire over the next seven years:\u00a0Tesla\u00a0(TSLA -4.87%),\u00a0Moderna\u00a0(MRNA -2.42%), and\u00a0Nvidia\u00a0(NVDA -2.56%).\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Tesla\nFirst things first: Tesla has surpassed Berkshire Hathaway's market cap once before. Between 2020 and 2022, Tesla's market cap exceeded Berkshire's. However, at the moment, Berkshire is worth roughly $200 billion more than Tesla.\nYet, I think Tesla can stage a comeback. The company is ramping up production and slashing prices, all part of its effort to become the world's largest automaker. Analysts expect Tesla to produce around 1.8 million vehicles in 2023 and 2.35 million in 2024. If that happens, Tesla could crack the top 10 in global auto sales by 2024.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's more, Tesla has several exciting new models and features on the horizon. The first Tesla Semis rolled off the line in late 2022, and production of the Cybertruck is set to start in the coming months. Similarly, some analysts think Tesla's autonomous driving technology could be a game changer, leading to a thriving robotaxi business.\nAt any rate, I believe Tesla has enough gas in the tank to easily make up the gap on Berkshire and surpass it by 2030.\n2. Moderna\n\nFor my second pick, I'm swinging for the fences with a long shot to surpass Berkshire Hathaway. Moderna is a biotech company that most people know for its COVID-19 vaccine.\u00a0\nHowever, the company's messenger RNA therapeutics and vaccines can potentially be used to treat other diseases. In fact, Moderna's chief medical officer, Dr. Paul Burton, recently noted that the company aims to produce vaccines targeting cancer, heart disease, and other serious diseases by 2030. If that prediction comes true, expect Moderna shares to skyrocket. \n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Moderna shares will need to skyrocket if the company's market cap is going to exceed Berkshire Hathaway's. Today, Moderna has a market cap of $52.8 billion, ranking No. 304 among American companies. To catch Berkshire, Moderna would need to grow 14 times. That's a big ask, but effective treatments for life-threatening diseases like cancer and heart disease would be a game changer, not just for the company -- but for the world.\nHowever, at present, those treatments remain out of reach, meaning Moderna will have to rely on other products to drive its revenue and earnings. Financially, the company remains healthy, with $18.9 billion in revenue and $9.4 billion in operating income over the last 12 months. Yet, with sales of its COVID vaccine waning, analysts expect revenue to decline by 60% in 2023 and a further 15% in 2024.\u00a0\nNeedless to say, owning Moderna isn't for everyone. Like a power hitter at the plate, Moderna is swinging for the fences. Sometimes those hitters blast it out of the park; other times, they strike out.\n3. Nvidia\n\nMy final pick is another company that also surpassed Berkshire Hathaway's market cap in the not-so-distant past: Nvidia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe maker of advanced graphics and mobile processors sported a market cap of more than $800 billion as recently as 2021. And, as of this writing, Nvidia's $658 billion market cap trails Berkshire by \"only\" $59 billion.\u00a0\nHow could Nvidia get over the hump? The growing importance of artificial intelligence (AI) is likely to do it. Nvidia's processors are sought out for use in the supercomputers behind much of the world's cutting-edge AI. Moreover, Nvidia's automotive unit boasts impressive momentum, bolstered by automakers keen to perfect reliable autonomous driving.\nYet, if Nvidia has an Achilles' heel, it's the company's rich valuation. With a price-to-earnings multiple above 150, investors must pay up for Nvidia's future growth. However, there's simply too much to like about Nvidia's growth prospects to ignore. Investors willing to buy and hold can still build a position in the name -- as long as they're willing to ride out the inevitable volatility that comes with this tech giant.\n\n\n\nJake Lerch has positions in Nvidia and Tesla.

Arya noted that the adoption of AI applications is still in an early stage and 2023 \"is probably the first year of what could be a 5 or 10 year investment cycle\". Arya noted that managing AI workloads requires high levels of computational power and resources.\u00a0He talked about how NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is now competing with cloud services providers such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) for chip market share.  Vivek Arya noted that though NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is at the forefront of the AI chip trade, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also have their own AI chips, Inferentia and TPU respectively. Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS Inferentia offers native support for PyTorch and Tensorflow, two of the most widely used deep learning frameworks for building production systems. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), an AI accelerator for deep learning applications.\u00a0Moreover, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is also developing its own AI chip. On April 18, Reuters reported\u00a0that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been working on its AI chip since 2019 and it is now in a testing phase. Vivek Arya talked about chip pricing and how the increasing adoption of AI by cloud services providers is calling for more high performance semiconductors. He said that though NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) new chips are up to 3 times more expensive than the company's previous generation products, they are also offering higher performance and increased energy efficiency. Arya further spoke about the success of ChatGPT and how it has \"created this cycle of adoption that is just kicking off\". Here is what Vivek Arya said: \"It's not just the top three\u00a0or four hyperscalers, you know, remember\u00a0each of them used to be a startup at one\u00a0point and they displaced the incumbent. And now what we have in the valley is\u00a0three or four hundred startup companies\u00a0that are trying to develop new and innovative applications with this new\u00a0technology. So when they do that they need compute power that is\u00a0available on the cloud and that is where\u00a0the need for GPUs, we think, can grow even\u00a0faster than what we had anticipated last year.\"    Story Continues As AI adoption increases, the need for more sophisticated and powerful semiconductors is expected to grow. Moreover, as cloud services providers start making in-house chips for high performance computing applications, the semiconductor equipment industry is poised to exhibit strong growth. Some of the best semiconductor equipment stocks to buy now include\u00a0ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML),\u00a0Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX), and\u00a0Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT).

Now he's avoiding crypto for some of the same reasons. Our government trade tracker caught Pelosi\u2019s 169% AI winner. Discover how to track all 535 Congress member stock trades today.\r\nLegendary investor Peter Lynch made stock-picking sound simple Tuesday morning on CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" but even he admitted that he has missed out on\u00a0some obvious buys over the years.\u00a0\n\"When companies go from crappy to semi-crappy, the stock goes up. When it goes from semi-crappy to good, they go\u00a0up, but when business gets to be terrific, get out,\" he said.\u00a0\nWhat To Know: The\u00a0vice chairman of Fidelity Management & Research averaged nearly a 30% annual return over his time as\u00a0manager of the Magellan Fund.\u00a0\n\"You have to look at companies that other people aren't looking at,\" Lynch told CNBC.\u00a0\nThere were also some companies that he didn't look at close enough. He suggested that one of his biggest mistakes was overlooking\u00a0Apple Inc AAPL.\nHe noted that Warren Buffett was able to see the explosive growth opportunity in\u00a0Apple, but he missed out even though he saw his daughter spending $250 on an iPod and figured the\u00a0Cupertino-based company probably had\u00a0great margins on the music device.\u00a0\nLynch said he\u00a0knew Apple had a clean balance sheet and he regrets not doing more homework on the name.\n\"Apple was not that hard to understand. I mean, how dumb was I?\"\nCheck This Out:\u00a0If You Invested $1000 In Apple Stock When Steve Ballmer Criticized The $500 iPhone, Here's How Much You'd Have Now\nAnother name he missed out on was Nvidia Corp NVDA. It's been a \"huge stock,\" Lynch said: \"I wish I coulda pronounced it.\"\nHe also can't figure out how to pronounce\u00a0crypto, he said with a laugh. Lynch noted that he has \"no idea\" what to make of Bitcoin BTC/USD.\nHe said he does understand the underlying framework of blockchain and he even noted that he's aware a halving is on the horizon. But he doesn't own any Bitcoin or Ethereum ETH/USD, he said.\u00a0\nAAPL, NVDA Price Action: Apple shares are up more than 26% year-to-date. Nvidia is up more than 80% since the start of the year.\nApple was down 0.25% at $164.91 and Nvidia was down 1.92% at $265.25 at the time of writing, according to\u00a0Benzinga Pro.\nRead Next:\u00a0Analyst Questions Nvidia's Valuation After Company Earned Less Than 20% Of Meta's Profits In 2022\nPhoto via Shutterstock.\u00a0\nAAPLApple Inc$212.04-0.92%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock \u2013 anytime.Reveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum77.08Growth60.77Quality79.28Value7.82Price TrendShortMediumLongOverview$BTCBitcoin$81999.90-2.73%$ETHEthereum$1891.70-1.83%NVDANVIDIA Corp$117.00-2.12%Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

The Nasdaq 100 closed at 13,092, essentially flat on the session, states\u00a0Jon Markman, editor of Strategic Advantage.\nBulls did start off better, though. Analysts at HSBC in Asia are now all in for Nvidia, re-rating the stock as a \u201cbuy\u201d and lifting the price target to $355. A month ago, the researchers had the AI chip darling rated as \u201cunderweight\u201d. The upgrade stems from pricing power. HSBC analysts believe that a shortage of AI chips puts Nvidia in a good position to increase profit margins. Bears hope that waning profitability across big tech will be in the spotlight through the current earnings season.\u00a0\nAfter the close Netflix (NFLX) reported financial mixed results and shares sunk about 3.5%. However, that weakness did not seem to impact the rest of the Nasdaq 100. The benchmark index remains mired in a narrow trading range. The bottom is 12,895, the rising 20-day moving average.\u00a0\nI expect bulls will buy any near-term decline to that level. The top of the range is 13,200. Despite reaching that level on Tuesday, bulls could not press through. Be patient, the trading range will be resolved soon.\nMCI Market Timing Engine\nMembers following this model are currently in cash or cash equivalents. Our model expects a summer rally, but the path has been choppy so far. I plan to recommend taking advantage of any near-term weakness to re-enter a leveraged Nasdaq 1000 position. I will send an intraday update when appropriate.\nBehind the Headlines\nThe Dow and the Nasdaq were little changed at 33,976.6 and 12,153.4, respectively. Industrials and energy posted the biggest gains among sectors, while health care and communication services logged the steepest declines.\nBreadth favored decliners four-three. There were 174 new lows vs 186 new highs. The new-high leaders were NVIDIA (NVDA), Oracle (ORCL), AstraZeneca (AZN), McDonald\u2019s (MCD), and Salesforce (CRM).\nGoldman Sachs' (GS) first-quarter results declined while revenue missed market expectations, as the investment banking company took a $470 million hit from the partial sale of a consumer loans portfolio. Shares fell 1.7%, the second-biggest drop among Dow components.\nBank of America's (BAC) first-quarter results surpassed Wall Street's expectations as the benefit of higher interest rates more than offset revenue declines in investment banking and asset management, while the bank prepared for a mild recession in the third quarter. The bank's shares rose 0.6%.\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) raised its full-year outlook after the healthcare products conglomerate reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, driven by growth across all of its segments. The company's stock fell 2.8%.\nThe US two-year yield rose 2.6 basis points to 4.21%, while the ten-year rate fell 1.4 basis points to 3.58%.\nIn economic news, housing starts in the US last month nudged down 0.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about 1.42 million units, the Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development said. The consensus on Econoday was for a 1.4 million print, following a downwardly revised 1.43 million reading for February. Annually, starts dropped 17% in March.\nLearn more about Jon Markman here...\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 4 - 6, 2025\nMoneyShow Masters Symposium Dallas\nOutlook 2025: Big Market Trends, Bold Investment Ideas\n\n\nLearn More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Carter\n\n\n\n\n\nKeith Fitz-Gerald\n\n\n\n\n\nErin Gibbs\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Mahaney\n\n\n\n\n\nStephen Moore\n\n\n\n\n\nLouis Navellier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Pros\u2019 Top Picks (Daily)\nSubscribe to MoneyShow\u2019s daily investment newsletter Top Pros' Top Picks and get actionable advice from our top experts, including the hottest stocks to buy and sell, ETFs and funds for short- and long-term capital appreciation, and a wide variety of dividend-paying stocks set to deliver a steady stream of safe, reliable income.\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nToday's Featured Experts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrading Insights (Weekly)\nGet an edge on the markets with our weekly trading newsletter, Trading Insights, and receive timely trade ideas covering stocks, options, futures, and more to keep you on the right side of the action.

Very few. So what should investors look for to find the next trillion-dollar companies? Is it incredible revenue growth? How about big profits? There\u2019s no obvious answer.\nOf all the S&P 500 stocks, only four have a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion: Apple, Amazon, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, GOOG). Moreover, the average age of these four companies is around 37 years. Therefore, the odds are low that firms founded in the 2000s will be the next trillion-dollar companies.\nOf the names below, the latest was founded in 1993. And while other companies may currently have larger market caps, these ones have the best shot at becoming the next trillion-dollar companies.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNVDA\nNvidia\n$277.49\n\n\nBRK-B\nBerkshire Hathaway\n$328.55\n\n\nV\nVisa\n$232.73\n\n\n\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\nChipmakers Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have batted for supremacy in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market over the past decade. While AMD\u2019s chips are cheaper, Nvidia\u2019s are generally more powerful, with the latter focused on the high-end chip market.\u00a0\nIn terms of stock performance,\u00a0AMD has seriously outperformed NVDA over the past five years, gaining more than 700% while NVDA is up around 400%. Yet, NVDA has outperformed so far in 2023, rallying 90% compared with a 35% advance for AMD. In addition to the broader rally in chip stocks, Nvidia is benefitting from investors\u2019 excitement about artificial intelligence (AI).\nAs my InvestorPlace colleague Alex Sirois recently noted: \u201cThe firm\u2019s H100 graphics cards are required to train and deploy AI software and are in short demand. Those chips are fetching between $36k to $46k through retailers and eBay. Nvidia\u2019s H100 chips are the newest chip from Nvidia and are proving integral to generative AI and large language models like ChatGPT.\u201d\nThe reality is I like both NVDA and AMD and their chief executive officers (CEOs). AMD CEO\u00a0Lisa Su has done a masterful job guiding the company through the semiconductor landmines of the past decade. Meanwhile, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has done an excellent job capitalizing on secular trends in technology such as artificial intelligence, data centers and cloud computing.\u00a0\nFrom an investment standpoint, it\u2019s hard to pick a winner between AMD and NVDA, but this is an article about the next trillion-dollar companies. I think Nvidia, which currently has a $685.4 billion market cap, gets to $1 trillion before anyone else.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \t\n\n \nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\nOf all the companies listed on a U.S. stock exchange, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) is the largest without hitting the trillion-dollar mark with a market cap of $723.3 billion. Warren Buffett\u2019s business is a beauty to behold, but it\u2019s not exactly a growth machine in the traditional sense.\u00a0\nA quick look at Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder letter highlights that since 1965, BRK-B stock has delivered an annual gain of 20% on 29 occasions out of 57 years. Over the same time, the S&P 500 has delivered a 20% return, including dividends, in 19 out of 57. Who says Berkshire\u2019s not a growth stock?\nBerkshire stock likely doesn\u2019t get as many buyers as it should because investors are worried about the Warren Buffett discount. What\u2019s that, you ask? It\u2019s the amount investors think its share price drops when the Oracle of Omaha finally goes to his maker.\u00a0\nI\u2019ve argued for years that if Berkshire were to systematically dismantle its assets through a carefully planned auction process, the proceeds would be significantly higher than $329 a Class B share.\u00a0\nFor example, the 2022 shareholder letter points out that, in 1994, Berkshire completed its seven-year accumulation of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock, paying $1.3 billion for the 400 million shares. Today, those shares would cost $25.7 billion. In 2022, Coca-Cola paid Berkshire $704 million in dividends, or 54% of its total investment.\u00a0\u00a0\nYou can\u2019t put a price on that kind of value creation. \t\n\n \nVisa (V)\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\nVisa (NYSE:V) would have to more than double its current market cap of $487.4 billion to get to $1 trillion. But, over the past five years, it\u2019s generated a cumulative return of 85%. If it keeps up this pace, it ought to get there by 2030.\u00a0\nHow does it get there sooner? It becomes the fintech of all fintech stocks. How likely is that? It\u2019s possible.\u00a0\nVisa reported its fiscal second-quarter results on April 25. Revenue of $8 billion was 11% higher than a year earlier and $200 million better than the analyst estimate. On the bottom line, net income of $4.3 billion was up 17% year over year, good for a 54% net margin. For comparison, Apple\u2019s is less than half that.\n\u201cI have been at Visa for nearly a decade and I have never been more excited about the opportunities in front of us,\u201d stated CEO Ryan McInerney in the accompanying press release. \u201cWhile there is macroeconomic uncertainty, I feel confident in Visa\u2019s ability to manage through changing environments.\u201d\nMcInerney said in Visa\u2019s analyst conference call that FedNow, the real-time payment system to be introduced by the Federal Reserve in July, is the most significant update to the U.S. payment system in the past 40 years.\n\u201cModernizing the payments infrastructure in the United States is a smart thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a necessary thing to do, and it\u2019s good for Americans.\u201d\nRather than be worried about FedNow, he\u2019s excited to see how it can help Visa become even better for its customers. A business that can win in most or all economic environments is a smart long-term bet.\u00a0\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The three main highlights are the latest Hopper H100 records which show the progress of the flagship AI GPU over the past 6 months with several software optimizations, we also get to see the first results of the L4 GPU based on the Ada graphics architecture which was announced at GTC 2023 and lastly, we have updated results of the Jetson AGX Orin which gets much more faster thanks to similar software and platform power-level optimizations. To sum up, the following are the highlights that we are going to look at today:\nRelated Story Watch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\nH100 Sets New Inference Records: Up To 54% more performance vs prior submission\nL4 Superchargers Mainstream Inference: Over 3X faster than T4\nAnother Big Leap for Jetson AGX Orin: Up To 57% more efficiency vs prior submission\n\nFor today's benchmark suite, NVIDIA will be taking a look at MLPerf Inference v3.0 which retains the same workloads which were used 6 months ago in prior submissions but the network environment has been added which accurately measures how data is sent into an inferencing platform to get the work done. NVIDIA also reveals that over a product's lifespan, the company can squeeze out almost 2x the performance through software optimizations, and that has already been seen on past GPUs such as the Ampere A100.\n\nNVIDIA H100 Delivers Huge Performance Improvement Since Launch Thanks To Software Optimizations, Up to 4.5x Increase Over Last-Gen\nStarting with the Hopper H100 performance tests, we see the MLPerf inference tests in offline and server categories. The Offline benchmarks show up to a 4.5x performance increase over Ampere A100 (BERT 99.9%) while in the Server scenario, the H100 yields an impressive 4.0x performance jump over its predecessor.\n\nTo achieve this level of performance, NVIDIA is using FP8 performance through its transformer engine that is embedded within the Hopper architecture. It works on a per-layer basis by analyzing all of the work that is sent through it and then attests whether the data can be run in FP8 without compromising efficiency. If for example the data can be run in FP8, then it'll use that, if not, then the transformer engine will utilize the FP16 Math Ops and FP32 accumulate to run the data. Since Ampere didn't have a Transformer engine architecture, it was run on FP16+FP32 rather than FP8.\n\nComparing their data to Intel's fastest 4th Gen Xeon Sapphire Rapids chip, the 8480+, the Hopper H100 GPU simply crushes it in all the performance tests and shows why GPUs are still the way to go in terms of inferencing despite Intel using a range of AI-based accelerators on their new chips.\n\nMoving over to the progression of Hopper's software side, since the 6 months of H100's availability, the GPU has seen up to 54% improvement, mainly in imaging-based networks. In 3D U-Net which is a medical imaging network, the H100 GPU sees a 31% uplift and even in BERT 99% which was shown above, the new chip gets a 12% boost over its previous benchmark submission. This is achieved by utilizing new software advances such as Optimized Non-Maximum Suppression Kernels and Sliding Window Batching on Sub-Volumes.\nNVIDIA L4 GPU: Small Card With Massive Performance, Up To 3.1x Faster Than T4 At Same Power\nNVIDIA's L4 has also made its first appearance within MLPerf. The small form factor L4 GPU was announced at GTC 2023 as a pure Tensor Core product that also supports FP8 instructions on Ada architecture although the Transformer engine is only specific to the Hopper GPUs. As a successor to the T4, the L4 GPU not only is an inference-first product but also features several video encode features for AI-based video encoding capabilities.\n\nAs for performance, the NVIDIA L4 GPU delivers a massive performance increase of up to 3.1x over its predecessor, once again in BERT 99.9% and its 2x across the board in inference benchmarks at the same power.\nBeing a small form factor design with a 72W power envelope means that the L4 can be utilized in a range of servers without having to redesign the server chassis or power delivery to host such a tiny card. Like its predecessor, the L4 is looking to be a really popular server and CSP product with almost all CSPs having a T4 instance Google has also recently announced its L4 instances which are already in private preview with more CSPs on the way.\n\nNVIDIA Orin Gets Boost Across The Board\nLastly, we have the latest performance leaps delivered to Jetson AGX Orin through the Jetpack SDK. The Orin SOC has been out for a year now and NVIDIA is showcasing significant performance uplift. In performance alone, the Orin SOC gets up to an 81% boost while in power efficiency, the chip shows up to a 63% performance jump which is dramatic and a testament to NVIDIA's commitment to GPU and silicon longevity in the server space.\n\nThese performance improvements aren't just limited to the Jetson AGX Orin but even the card-sized Orin NX which comes with 16 GB of onboard memory in a small form factor design gets up to a 3.2x performance uplift over the Xavier NX which is another great improvement and customers can expect even more performance in the future.\n\nDeci Achieves Record-Breaking Inference Speed on NVIDIA GPUs at MLPerf\nWhile on the topic of MLPerf, Deci also announced that it has achieved record-breaking inference speed on NVIDIA GPUs at MLPerf. The below chart illustrates the throughput performance per TeraFLOPs as achieved by Deci and other submitters within the same category. Deci delivered the highest throughput per TeraFLOPs while also improving accuracy. This inference efficiency translates into significant cost savings on compute power and a better user experience. Instead of relying on more expensive hardware, teams using Deci can now run inference on NVIDIA\u2019s A100 GPU, achieving 1.7x faster throughput and +0.55 better F1 accuracy, compared to when running on NVIDIA\u2019s H100 GPU. This means a 68%* cost savings per inference query.\n\nOther benefits of Deci\u2019s results include the ability to migrate from multi-gpu to a single GPU and lower inference costs and reduced engineering efforts. For example, ML engineers using Deci can achieve a higher throughput on one H100 card than on 8 NVIDIA A100 cards combined. In other words, with Deci, teams can replace 8 NVIDIA A100 cards with just one NVIDIA H100 card, while getting higher throughput and better accuracy (+0.47 F1).\n\n\n\nHardware\nOther Submitters' Throughput\nDeci\u2019s Throughput\nBERT F1 Accuracy\nDeci Optimized F1 Accuracy\nAccuracy Increase\n\n\nNVIDIA A30 GPU\n866\n5,885\n90.874\n91.281\n0.4076\n\n\nNVIDIA A100 GPU, 80GB\n1,756\n13,377\n90.874\n91.430\n0.5560\n\n\n8 x NVIDIA A100 GPU\n13,967\n103,053\n90.874\n91.430\n0.5560\n\n\nNVIDIA H100 PCIe GPU\n7,921\n17,584\n90.874\n91.346\n0.4722\n\n\n\nOn the NVIDIA A30 GPU, which is a more affordable GPU, Deci delivered accelerated throughput and a 0.4% increase in F1 accuracy compared to an FP32 baseline.\nBy using Deci, teams that previously needed to run on an NVIDIA A100 GPU can now migrate their workloads to the NVIDIA A30 GPU and achieve 3x better performance than they previously had for roughly a third of the compute price. This means dramatically better performance for significantly less inference cloud cost.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n42\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n41\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n36\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

It did this job fairly well, making setup simple and optimizing games with some custom stream-smoothing. Now Nvidia is removing GameStream from Shield devices\u2014but an even better DIY game-streaming solution is already available. Let's take a look at it and talk to the developers about why and how they made it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia's GameStream was a key part of the hardware company's pitch for its Shield products.\n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                          Nvidia\n                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Nvidia's GameStream was a key part of the hardware company's pitch for its Shield products.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Nvidia\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nNvidia is done with local streaming\nNvidia says a Shield update arriving this month will make it so \"the GameStream feature will no longer be available in app.\" If you try to skip the Shield update, GameStream will still stop working at some point (and possibly be removed from the GeForce Experience app in Windows). In the meantime, trying to dodge that update means not using GeForce Now, one of Nvidia's recommended replacements, on your Shield and missing out on all the other update fixes and features that arrive with system updates.\nIf you're a Shield owner, like I am, this stinks. Shield devices have merits of their own, receiving the longest and most consistent stream of updates of any Android/Google TV device ever released. They're still perfectly functional as stream boxes (and even more appealing if Google lands an NFL package). But a big benefit of having both a Shield and a GeForce graphics card will soon be shunted.\nThe company's suggested replacement for local streaming, Steam Link, is a reasonably simple option\u2014if all the games you want to play are on Steam, if it performs well enough, and if there's a client for your system. I've found setting resolutions and controller options to be a bit fiddly on Steam Link, and its network reliability to be (relatively, subjectively) less robust than the newer alternatives. Nvidia itself admits that with optimal settings, Steam Link is still 10 ms in latency behind its own streaming codecs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other Nvidia suggestion is GeForce Now. While it's pretty impressive at its higher tiers, it also provides only a limited slice of your games library. It requires a great broadband connection and a monthly subscription, and it serves far fewer clients than Moonlight (including, notably, Apple TV).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Proof of Linux life for Moonlight.\n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                          Kevin Purdy\n                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Proof of Linux life for Moonlight.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Kevin Purdy\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nThe better streaming client: Moonlight\nWhile GameStream was meant to push Nvidia gear, it also sparked the creation of the wonderful Moonlight software. This free, open-source app has given people access to the output of their GeForce cards from all kinds of screens since 2018. It's how I played Marvel's Midnight Suns on an iPad on my couch and Elden Ring on a Windows laptop at my in-laws' place, streaming from my own home.\nWith Moonlight, you can beam a game from an Nvidia card inside a Windows PC to a Windows/Mac/Linux computer, Chrome OS, iOS and Android and Amazon FireOS devices, a Raspberry Pi 4, and, if you're willing to tinker, homebrew apps on the PlayStation Vita, Wii U, LG's WebOS, and other single-board computers. It also works with a Steam Deck, as Moonlight installs fairly easily as a Linux app on that system. As noted, this device doesn't even have to be on your home network if you've set up your game-streaming PC and network as such.\nAll that effort could have been sunk when Nvidia nixes GameStream as a service. Luckily, Moonlight also works seamlessly with a different, more flexible server: Sunshine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                If you thought GameStream didn't give you enough options and settings, Sunshine will ... not have that problem.\n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                          Kevin Purdy\n                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      If you thought GameStream didn't give you enough options and settings, Sunshine will ... not have that problem.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Kevin Purdy\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nThe better streaming server: Sunshine\nThe Moonlight team and other developers already had a backup plan for Nvidia's GameStream retirement. Sunshine is an open-source, appropriately named alternative GameStream-like server. While setting it up is a bit more involved, it's far more expansive and useful than GameStream:\n\nIt works on Windows, Mac, and Linux\nIt supports AMD and Intel GPUs, along with Nvidia\nIt can also work with software encoding if needed\nIt supports far more native resolution options than GameStream (including custom)\nIt is managed and paired through a webpage\nIt can stream to multiple clients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting up Sunshine and Moonlight\nFor many people, setting up Sunshine can be as simple as installing it. Read the minimum requirements, check out the full documentation, grab the latest release, and install. On Windows and Mac, your system will likely warn you about this app being from an unknown developer; click through to install it if you're OK with that. Each system currently has a few extra steps to tackle for certain setups (gamepads on Windows, audio on Mac, input on Linux); be sure to read up on them.\nMost of the work for Sunshine takes place in a web browser. Once the app is installed and the service is started, open a browser and go to localhost:47990(you might get a certificate/security warning, which you can click to move past). This web console is where you can create a PIN to pair Sunshine with a Moonlight client, create shortcuts to your games (either through a wizard or by editing a JSON file), tweak configuration (including adding custom resolutions and FPS options), and stop/restart and troubleshoot Sunshine. It's a sparse interface, but it's fairly straightforward. Your first priority should be changing your admin password.\nIf you want to play games on your Sunlight server from outside your network, grab the Moonlight Internet Hosting Tool. Run it on your Windows PC, and it should automatically create the secure UPnP connection through your router that allows Moonlight to connect from outside. It's easier to make it work if you connect Moonlight to your Sunshine server while on the same network before you go remote. If you can't, you'll want to have a good way of knowing your public IP address (and you'll likely want a VNC connection ready).\nOne thing to note about Moonlight versus GameStream or Steam Link is that it gives you far more options to fine-tune your connection quality and speed. You can set exactly how much bandwidth you want the app to aim to use while streaming gameplay, prioritize quality over frame rate, and other options. Dig around in the settings and set aside some time to figure out your Goldilocks connection setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've had some issues getting my games to launch directly from Moonlight's interface using Sunshine; I seemingly don't always enter the right commands in the \"Detached Commands\" box. But it's worth noting that even if you can only get the default \"Desktop\" shortcut working, that works, too. If you get to a desktop, you can then use your touchscreen or mouse cursor (toggled on gamepads by holding down the start/menu/plus button) to navigate to your game and launch it. There's no latency penalty; Sunshine and Moonlight are really just opening a hyper-optimized VNC connection for you to play games on.\nHow Moonlight was made\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Yes, the Ouya really was the genesis of this huge project to open up Nvidia's game streaming ecosystem. It did something!\n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                          Ouya\n                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Yes, the Ouya really was the genesis of this huge project to open up Nvidia's game streaming ecosystem. It did something!\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Ouya\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nMoonlight was developed in 2013 by a group of Case Western Reserve University students at MHacks, a hackathon at the University of Michigan. Cameron Gutman, one of those students, found inspiration in an unlikely place: an OUYA box. Gutman had an OUYA without \"many good games,\" and an Nvidia Shield. He \"thought it would be a neat project to try to get the SHIELD-exclusive GameStream functionality running on the OUYA,\" Gutman told Ars.\nWhen Gutman and his team started, GameStream's protocol was \"much simpler,\" he wrote. There was no encryption, and each protocol\u2014session, video, audio, input\u2014was mapped to a different port. GameStream also logged \"quite verbosely\" on the client and server side, further speeding up the learning process. Gutman and his teammate Diego Waxemberg could simply run Wireshark to watch the traffic, then map the results from various gamepad buttons. These days, input is encrypted; a similar weekend reverse-engineering session would be far trickier. Moonlight continued to be improved and expanded upon at hackathons like MHacks and HackCWRU (Case Western) and then as an open-source GitHub repository.\nThere are three major headaches for the development team for different reasons: Android, iOS, and embedded clients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndroid's ecosystem, Gutman wrote, is \"full of nightmarishly broken hardware decoders.\" Some devices based on system-on-chips (SoCs) require manual fix-ups of their video bitstream in order to output frames \"without hundreds of milliseconds of latency.\" Those same fix-ups can increase latency or fail entirely. You can read about some of the most notable nightmares in Moonlight Android's decoder-errata.txt file, like how the HEVC decoder in the Tegra X1 inside the Pixel C can lag on certain streams, but the same Tegra X1 inside the 2019 Shield TV does not.\nThe iOS client, meanwhile, is beset by an entirely different (but not unfamiliar) problem: App Store review. Early on, Apple would accept a video of Moonlight streaming to verify its functions, but reviewers eventually wanted to test the app themselves. Because setting up GameStream or Moonlight requires on-screen PIN verification between server and client, Gutman had to \"write relay software that would fake a completely insecure server that didn't require pairing and would stream to any client that asked it.\"\nThen came App Store Review Guideline 4.2.7 for Remote Desktop Clients. Gutman said his team went back and forth with Apple and was once told that Moonlight simply wouldn't be allowed. The team had to intuit that the issue was Moonlight's inclusion of a default app to connect to, Steam. In Apple's view, Gutman surmised, remotely connecting to Steam through a Moonlight client could have violated 4.2.7(d), involving \"a store-like interface\" or \"the ability to browse, select, or purchase software.\" Removing that tile from the iOS client got Moonlight back on the store.\nBy comparison, the challenges of getting Moonlight working on Raspberry Pi, Rockchip, Amlogic, i.MX, Tegra, and other SoC-based devices are more straightforward, if arcane. Each manufacturer \"just rolled their own decoding API,\" Gutman told Ars, with most being poorly documented and some even conflicting with other binaries from the same vendor. Most are slowly moving toward the Video for Linux API (V4L2), but even that has its challenges. Gutman and his team have to build clients that work with different forks of FFmpeg, each with its own unique out-of-tree kernel patches, to make each board work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Sunshine stepped in\nA developer called ReenigneArcher picked up maintenance of Sunshine in December 2021 after the original developer, Loki (aka loki-47-6F-64), became too busy to stay on. They were originally interested in Sunshine as a way to build multi-platform support into their existing project, RetroArcher, but Sunshine soon took over their time and focus.\nIt's not just\u2014or even mostly\u2014their work, though. \"Sunshine is probably a somewhat unique open-source project, as the majority of contributions come from the community,\" they wrote in a Discord interview. In particular, Cameron Gutman, brad-richardson, psyke83, and TheElixZammuto have been heavy contributors.\nThe hardest part of keeping Sunshine alive is testing all the possible scenarios in the sprawling ecosystem, ReenigneArcher wrote. \"In Linux alone, we have close to 30 possible capture scenario depending on the hardware and type of desktop environment. Then we also have Windows and MacOS. Linux and MacOS both also support arm64 in addition to x86_64. So the scenarios to test quickly become overwhelming.\"\nI asked ReenigneArcher why they, like other Moonlight/Sunshine fans, couldn't just settle for Steam Link. They noted that they'd tested out Steam Link, Parsec, and other systems but found Moonlight and GameStream to offer the lowest latencies. Sunlight has typically performed better than Steam Link and Parsec, but it's still slightly behind GameStream. With improvements that are making their way through unstable versions, Sunshine and Moonlight should soon be on par with GameStream, or even ahead of it in certain setups.\u00a0[Update 5:25 p.m. ET, April 4:\u00a0ReengineArcher noted that the latency parity improvements are now present in the stable version].\nMoonlight and Sunshine are yet another focused, impressive open source project born out of a larger company's loss of interest in a dedicated but small market. Here's hoping you might find the pair helpful for your own PC gaming while away from your PC.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Listing image:\n    Kevin Purdy\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin Purdy\nSenior Technology Reporter\n\n\n\n\nKevin Purdy\nSenior Technology Reporter\n\n\n      Kevin is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering open-source software, PC gaming, home automation, repairability, e-bikes, and tech history.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Antony reviews and covers the latest PC hardware and laptop technologyFollow AuthorApr 29, 2023, 02:07pm EDTShareSaveCommentRetailers have leaked specifications for motherboard manufacturer MSI's pre-built systems and accidentally revealed specifications for Nvidia's highly anticipated GeForce RTX 4060 and 4060 Ti. The key information exposed is that they will have just 8GB of memory.\nNvidia's RTX 4060 and 4060 Ti look set to have the same amount of VRAM as the RTX 3060 Ti Antony Leather\n\nBoth RTX 4060 and RTX 4060 Ti models were listed in a variety of pre-built system options from MSI, including at retailer 2Compute spotted by Videocardz. The fact they have just 8GB of VRAM means they don't offer an upgrade in the memory department over their precessors - the RTX 3060 and RTX 3060 Ti, which had either 8GB or in the case of the RTX 3060, up to 12GB of GDDR6 memory.\nLeaked specifications clearly show the RTX 4060 Ti having 8GB of VRAMVideocardz\n\nThe move will likely inflame already tense views over Nvidia's lack of VRAM compared to AMD's current and previous generations. For example, AMD's Sasa Marinkovic recently proclaimed on Twitter that the company's Radeon GPUs offer a much healthier 16GB of VRAM from just $499, thanks to its Radeon RX 6800.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nThe concern is that with many modern titles already seeing benefits from more than 8GB, gamers are concerned about the longevity of a new 8GB GPU bought in 2023, which could struggle with tomorrow's games. With GPU prices at record highs, gamers are well withing their rights to want a a bit of futureproofing thrown in to their expensive purchases.\n\n\nIn part, this is due to the width of the memory bus on the graphics cards. The expected 128-bit memory bus on the RTX 4060 and RTX 4060 Ti dictates either an 8GB or 16GB configuration with one 1GB or 2GB memory module per 32 bits (128 bits allowing for four memory modules of either 1GB or 2GB capacity). Raising this to 192-bit allows for either 6GB or 12GB, with the RTX 4070 using the latter thanks to its 192-bit bus.\n\n\nThe problem for Nvidia is that the RTX 4080 only has 16GB of VRAM and it has been reluctant to use more than 12GB on cheaper models for fear of hurting RTX 4080 sales. The 12GB included with the RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 4070 is reasonable, but still less you'd expect for $800 GPUs in the case of the former. Of course, the massively boosted L2 cache with Nvidia's RTX 4000 series will help, but it doesn't stop potential owners wanting as much VRAM as possible.\nThat said, these cards are aiming for 1080p gamers who are likely using low to mid-range systems and monitors where smaller amounts of VRAM are typically not that beneficial. Also, while AMD is boasting about having 16GB of VRAM at a $499 price point, both RTX 4060 models will likely cost a lot less than this which AMD's own RX 7600 XT, which will likely compete with the RTX 4060 and 4060 Ti, is also rumored to have the same 8GB of VRAM.\nI'll be looking at the new cards when they arrive so don't forget to follow me here on Forbes or comment on the article below.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Nvidia's anti-lag Reflex tech is being integrated into the game in time for the game's launch this summer.As ever, Reflex will only be available to Nvidia GPU owners, potentially giving them an advantage over anyone running a lowly AMD graphics card, let alone any poor proles running integrated graphics.If that's slightly in jest, latency does matter when it comes to seriously competitive online gaming and the marginal gains here might just make a difference. Nvidia claims that Reflex can reduce latency by up to 35% in Counter-Strike 2.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's latest 572.16 driver isn't just for the RTX 50-series, as 20, 30 and 40-series cards are also gifted with significant updates\n\n\n\n\nIs the new RTX 5070 really as fast as Nvidia's previous flagship RTX 4090 GPU?

That's a 9ms drop from a fairly high level of latency to something quite a bit more tolerable.(Image credit: Nvidia)Meanwhile, an RTX 3060 drops from 16ms to 11ms. At the top end, Nvidia has surprisingly referenced the yet-to-be-announced, let alone launched, RTX \u00a04070 improving from 10ms to just 8ms.\u00a0In reality, both are impressive figures, but you'd be hard pressed to feel the difference going from 10ms to 8ms.\u00a0The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Nvidia's Reflex technology is something that has to be implemented at the game engine level by developers using Nvidia's tools.

So Nvidia is therefore cutting supply to help prop prices up.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nMSI says that the supply of its RTX 5090 cards will be very tight, due to a limited supply of GPUs from Nvidia\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's RTX 5070 graphics card rumoured to be delayed from February until March but that could actually be good news\n\n\n\nCertainly the RTX 4070 has been widely available since launch. In the last few days several cards have appeared at retailers around the world at well below Nvidia's recommended retail price.We've spoken to retailers in the UK who have said that their sales of the RTX 4070 have been well below what they were expecting. While gamers have been looking at the cards on these retail sites, evidenced by the traffic they've been getting on those pages, the number of people actually buying cards has been low.One UK seller, Overclockers.co.uk, currently has no fewer than three RTX 4070s at significantly below MSRP. The cheapest, the Gainward GeForce RTX 4070 Ghost, is up for \u00a3549.95, which works out to $568 once you remove the UK's monster 20% sales tax. That's a decent chunk below the official $599 MSRP for the RTX 4070.It all begs the question of whether Nvidia's premium pricing strategy is beginning to succumb to pressure. As we've reported, pretty much every other PC hardware component has returned to what you might call pre-pandemic pricing levels, with some, including storage and RAM, at historical lows.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest gaming motherboard: The right boards\nBest graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the restSo, megabuck graphics cards are now very much an outlier. That's reflected in the fact that pricing has dominated the discussion with the launch of every new Nvidia RTX 40 GPU.\u00a0At the very least, Nvidia's \"unlaunching\" of the RTX 4080 12GB and repositioning it at a lower price point with RTX 4070 Ti branding was a direct response to the negative reaction to its premium pricing strategy.With the negative PR building with each new release, the RTX 4070 not selling well, and Nvidia possibly being forced to restrict supply as a consequence, it will be interesting to see where the company prices future RTX 40 GPUs like the RTX 4060 Ti and RTX 4060. While we're not expecting to love the prices Nvidia goes for, we suspect they'll still be lower than Nvidia was originally intending or hoping for.\n\n\nJeremy LairdSocial Links NavigationHardware writerJeremy has been writing about technology and PCs since the 90nm Netburst era (Google it!) and enjoys nothing more than a serious dissertation on the finer points of monitor input lag and overshoot followed by a forensic examination of advanced lithography.

See our ethics statement.Image: NvidiaTom Warren is a senior editor and author of Notepad, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.Nvidia is making its new RTX 4070 graphics card official today after weeks of leaks. The RTX 4070 will be available on April 13th priced starting at $599 for Nvidia\u2019s own Founders Edition model. Nvidia is pitching the RTX 4070 for 1440p gaming at more than 100fps with ray tracing and the company\u2019s latest DLSS 3 upscaling tech enabled.The RTX 4070 is Nvidia\u2019s first 40-series Founders Edition card that\u2019s reasonably sized, so it can fit inside most cases \u2014 even those with small form factors. The RTX 4070 is actually shorter than an RTX 3080 and is designed to match its performance at 1440p at least. Built on Nvidia\u2019s latest Ada Lovelace architecture, the RTX 4070 includes 12GB of GDDR6X instead of the 8GB found on both the prior RTX 3070 and RTX 3070 Ti models.Nvidia\u2019s RTX 4070 is more reasonably sized than the RTX 4080. Image: Tom Warren / The VergeThat bump to 12GB of VRAM is welcome, but Nvidia could have gone further here \u2014 particularly as the latest games at 1080p and 1440p are now starting to eat up 8GB or more. In a timely blog post, AMD laid out why \u201cmore memory matters\u201d on GPUs earlier this week ahead of Nvidia\u2019s announcement. AMD was quick to point out how it shipped its RX 6800 with 16GB of VRAM more than two years ago along with its RX 6800 XT and RX 6950 XT, both with 16GB. AMD\u2019s latest flagship RX 7900 XTX ships with 24GB of memory, and the RX 7900 XT comes equipped with 20GB.Nvidia\u2019s new RTX 4070 also includes support for the AV1 codec, which will be particularly useful for streamers soon, as YouTube is getting ready to roll out AV1 livestreaming soon to improve bitrates and picture quality. The RTX 4070 also supports DLSS 3, which promises to boost frame rates in games like Cyberpunk 2077, Forza Horizon 5, and Bethesda\u2019s upcoming Redfall.DLSS 3 is exclusive to the RTX 40-series cards and uses the same AI from DLSS 2 alongside a new AI frame generation technology to generate two frames using existing rendering techniques; then, a third frame is inserted between them. The result is big boosts to frame rates, which are essential for ray tracing and even improvements like path tracing in Cyberpunk 2077.Ray-tracing usage among RTX 40-series GPUs.\ufeff Image: NvidiaInterestingly, Nvidia says 83 percent of RTX 40-series owners turn ray tracing on in RTX-capable games, and 79 percent enable DLSS, too. RTX 30-series owners turn DLSS on 71 percent of the time in RTX games, while 68 percent of RTX 20-series owners enable DLSS in these titles.The high amount of ray-tracing usage among RTX 40-series owners drops significantly for older cards, though. Just 56 percent of RTX 30-series owners enable ray tracing in RTX-capable games, and 43 percent enable ray tracing on the RTX 20-series cards. That high percentage for RTX 40-series cards will likely drop as the lineup moves increasingly toward the midrange, where performance is often favored over ray-traced visuals.I\u2019ve been testing the RTX 4070 over the past week or so and found that it can easily compete with the RTX 3080 at 1440p, but at 4K, it\u2019s not as impressive as I had hoped.

The first thing we did when configuring the test system was enter the UEFI and set all values to their \"high performance\" defaults, then we disabled any integrated peripherals that wouldn't be put to use, and enabled Resizable BAR support. The memory clock was dialed-in to its optimal performance settings using its XMP profile and the solid state drive was then formatted and Windows 11 Professional installed and fully updated. When the Windows installation was complete, we installed all of the drivers, applications and benchmark tools necessary to complete our tests.\r\n\n\nOur Test System Configuration:\n\n\n\n\nHardware Used:\nAMD Ryzen 9 5800X3D\n(3.4GHz - 4.5GHz, 8-Core)\n\nGigabyte Aorus X570 Pro Wi-Fi\n16GB G.SKILL DDR4-3200\nSamsung SSD 970 EVO\nIntegrated Audio / Network\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070\nMSI GeForce RTX 4070\nASUS TUF GeForce RTX 4070 Ti\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 12GB\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080\nAMD Radeon RX 6900 XT\nAMD Radeon RX 6950 XT\n\n\nRelevant Software:\nWindows 11 Pro 22H2\nAMD Radeon 22.11.1\nNVIDIA Drivers v531.42\n\nBenchmarks Used:\r\n            LuxMark v4\r\n            Blender v3.3.0\r\n            Blackmagic RAW Speed Test v2.6\r\n            IndigoBench v4.4.15\n\r\n            UL 3DMark\nUL VRMark\r\n            Unigine Superposition\r\n            CryTek Neon Noir\r\n            Final Fantasy XIV Endwalker\r\n            Assassin's Creed Valhalla\r\n            FarCry 6\r\n            F1 2022\r\n            Guardians Of The Galaxy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxMark v4.0 Benchmarks\nLuxMark is a cross-platform,\u00a0OpenCL-accelerated 3D rendering benchmark. It's a tool based on the open source LuxRender physically-based spectral rendering engine, which accurately models the transportation of light and supports high dynamic range. LuxRender features a number of material types to allow rendering of photo-realistic and artistic scenes. LuxRender is free software, licensed under the GPL, that offers plugins for packages like Blender, Maya, Cinema 4D and 3DS Max.\r\n\n\n\n\n\r\nThe new GeForce RTX 4070 series cards trade victories with the Radeon RX 6900 series here, depending on the model being rendered, and the RTX 4070s clearly outrun the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti. they couldn't quite can't catch the higher-end Radeon RX 7900 series and RTX 40-series cards, though.\n\nIndigoBench Rendering Benchmarks\nIndigoBench\u00a0is based on Indigo 4's advanced rendering engine and offers both CPU and GPU rendering modes for its two built-in models. The standalone benchmark is available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux and outputs results in M/Samples per second.\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nThe MSI GeForce RTX 4070 and NVIDIA Founders Edition cards performed similarly here. Both cards outpaced all of the Radeons we tested, with both models. They outran the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti as well, but slot in behind the RTX 4070 Ti and previous-gen RTX 3090 Ti.\nBlender v3.3.0 GPU Rendering Benchmarks\r\nBlender is a free and open source 3D creation suite that can handle everything from modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation. The developers offer a standalone benchmarking tool that will track performance while rendering a handful of models. We used all three of the default models for these tests...\n\n\n\n\r\nBlender is capable of exploiting NVIDIA's RT cores using the OptiX backend API, which results in a massive uplift in performance for the NVIDIA-powered cards. That said, the standings look similar to Indigobench, with the GeForce RTX 4070s outperforming all of the Radeons and the RTX 3070 Ti.\r\nBlackmagic RAW Speed Test Results\r\nThe\u00a0Blackmagic RAW Speed Test is a CPU and GPU benchmarking tool that tests the speed of decoding full-resolution Blackmagic RAW frames. The tool can be used to evaluate the performance at various resolutions and bitrates on the CPU or using OpenCL or CUDA on a GPU. We're reporting two results here, both at an 8K resolution, but at differing bitrates and compression levels.\n\n\n\n\r\nAlthough it's a completely different type of creator workload, the Blackmagic RAW Speed Test has the GeForce RTX 4070cards finishing in a similar position. In the 8K 3:1 test, all of the cards perform similarly due to system memory bandwidth limitations. In the 8K 12:1 test, which uses more compressed data, the field separates and the GeForce RTX 4070s land in the familiar position, just behind the RTX 4070 Ti, but ahead of the 3070 Ti and Radeons.\r\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrev\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, MSI, GeForce, GPU, (nasdaq:nvda), ada lovelace, geforce rtx 4070\n\n\n\nRelated content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 4070 Review: NVIDIA Ada Hits A More Mainstream $599\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowerColor Hellhound Radeon RX 7900 XTX Spectral White Review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D Review: Return Of The PC Gaming King\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolidigm P44 Pro SSD Review: Ultra-Fast PCIe Gen 4 PC Storage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D Review: No Compromise Gaming And Creator Performance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT STUFF IN PC COMPONENTS\n\nGeForce RTX 4070 Review: NVIDIA Ada Hits...\nPowerColor Hellhound Radeon RX 7900 XTX...\nAMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D Review: Return Of...\nSolidigm P44 Pro SSD Review: Ultra-Fast...\nAMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D Review: No...\nRazer Blade 16 Laptop Review: RTX 4090 &...\nSamsung T7 Shield 4TB Review: Fast,...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKEEP INFORMED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSITE\n\nHome\n\n\nReviews\n\n\nNews\n\n\nBlogs\n\nFull Site\n\nSitemap\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nPC Components\n\n\nSystems\n\n\nMobile\n\n\nIT Infrastructure\n\n\nLeisure\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nCOMPANY\n\nAbout\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\nNews Tips\n\n\nContact\n\n\nPrivacy And Terms\n\n\nHotTech\n\n\n\nMORE\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nShop\n\n\n\nSTAY CONNECTED\n\nTwitter\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n            As an Amazon and Howl Technologies Associate, HotHardware earns a commission from qualifying purchases made on this site.

Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The VergeTom Warren is a senior editor and author of Notepad, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.Microsoft is reportedly working on its own AI chips that can be used to train large language models and avoid a costly reliance on Nvidia. The Information reports that Microsoft has been developing the chips in secret since 2019, and some Microsoft and OpenAI employees already have access to them to test how well they perform for the latest large language models like GPT-4.Nvidia is the key supplier of AI server chips right now, with companies racing to buy up these chips and estimates suggesting OpenAI will need more than 30,000 of Nvidia\u2019s A100 GPUs for the commercialization of ChatGPT. Nvidia\u2019s latest H100 GPUs are selling for more than $40,000 on eBay, illustrating the demand for high-end chips that can help deploy AI software.While Nvidia races to build as many as possible to meet demand, Microsoft is reportedly looking in-house and hoping it can save money on its AI push. Microsoft has reportedly accelerated its work on codename Athena, a project to build its own AI chips. While it\u2019s not clear if Microsoft will ever make these chips available to its Azure cloud customers, the software maker is reportedly planning to make its AI chips available more broadly inside Microsoft and OpenAI as early as next year. Microsoft also reportedly has a road map for the chips that includes multiple future generations.Microsoft\u2019s custom SQ1 processor. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The VergeMicrosoft\u2019s own AI chips aren\u2019t said to be direct replacements for Nvidia\u2019s, but the in-house efforts could cut costs significantly as Microsoft continues its push to roll out AI-powered features in Bing, Office apps, GitHub, and elsewhere.Microsoft has also been working on its own ARM-based chips for several years. Bloomberg reported in late 2020 that Microsoft was looking at designing its own ARM-based processors for servers and possibly even a future Surface device. We haven\u2019t seen those ARM chips emerge yet, but Microsoft has worked with AMD and Qualcomm for custom chips for its Surface Laptop and Surface Pro X devices.If Microsoft is working on its own AI chips, it would be the latest in a line of tech giants. Amazon, Google, and Meta also have their own in-house chips for AI, but many companies are still relying on Nvidia chips to power the latest large language models.See More: AIMicrosoftNewsNvidiaTechMore in this streamSee allAnthropic\u2019s plan to win the AI raceAlex HeathMar 14CommentsComment Icon BubbleContent vampires.Adi RobertsonMar 14CommentsComment Icon BubbleGemini can now personalize its answers based on your search historyEmma RothMar 13CommentsComment Icon BubbleMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

And wouldn't you know it, prices of AMD's last-gen Radeon RX 6950 XT have tumbled to just over $600. Which immediately begs the question, which is the best graphics card for your roughly 600 bucks?We'll skip over the question of where the hell the rest of AMD's RX 7000-series graphics cards are, because right now its strategy seems to be relying on its last-gen options to take the fight to Nvidia outside of the $999 RX 7900 XTX.This then is a classic contest between a last-gen GPU with traditional enthusiast specs including a big memory bus and loads of VRAM versus the young upstart with more advanced technology and features but hailing from lower down the model line.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nAn ode to the RTX 4090 and why high-end GPUs can sometimes be the best value\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 XT review (Asus Prime OC)\n\n\n\nIn a nutshell it's a question of a 256-bit bus and 16GB of VRAM versus more advanced ray tracing support and that DLSS 3 goodness.

That's Nvidia's MO when it comes to graphics memory. And, I'm sorry, but 'just enough' isn't actually good enough for $600. Especially when just enough applies today and can't be relied on tomorrow.AMD's Radeon RX 6950 XT, you see, is a proper enthusiast-spec card. You get a 256-bit memory bus and 16GB of VRAM and that means plenty of bandwidth and indeed sufficient VRAM for the latest games.You could argue that the increased cache of newer GPUs like the RTX 4070 makes memory bandwidth less critical. I'm sure Dave will. And it's true. But the problem with the RTX 4070's stingy 192-bit bus isn't bandwidth, it's the limitations it makes for graphics memory allocation.\u00a0The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Long story short and without getting into the technicalities, a 192-bit bus means Nvidia had to go for 12GB of VRAM. 16GB isn't an option with a 192-bit bus. And for better or worse, 12GB is marginal when it comes to the most demanding current games.That is only going to get worse. Sure, if you're only planning to keep your new card for a year, 12GB versus 16GB may not prove much of an issue. But I'd say within around 18 months to two years 12GB is going to be a real barrier.Already, numerous games can exceed 12GB depending on the settings used, including The Last of Us, Resident Evil 4, Forspoken and a fair few others. That roster will only increase.The real irony is that turning on ray tracing, which the RTX 4070 is inherently better at, only makes matters worse. It tends to bump up VRAM usage significantly, only making it more likely that the RTX 4070 runs into problems as more and more games use ray tracing in future.Of course, I haven't even mentioned the fact that the 6950 XT is around 15% faster than the RTX 4070 at pure raster rendering even when running out of VRAM isn't an issue.All of which isn't to say that I don't value the RTX 4070's feature set. In my view, DLSS scaling is definitely that little bit sharper and more effective than AMD's FSR. And frame generation in DLSS 3 is a nice feature, even if it's absolutely not the same thing as adding more frames and will do nothing to help the RTX 4070 in those instances when it runs out of VRAM.But the point is that I do think the RTX 4070 has a better feature set. The problem is that it's been unnecessarily hobbled by Nvidia's stinginess. With 16GB of VRAM, I'd overlook the RTX 4070's raster performance deficit happily. But I ain't paying $600 for a card that's already flirting with obsolescence.Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070(Image credit: Future)The case for the Nvidia RTX 4070Dave James - Mostly Human(Image credit: Future)Part of it is going to be a bit of pride, but I don't think I could reasonably spend $600 on an RX 6950 XT over an RTX 4070. Even now I'm typing that, it doesn't seem right, considering the AMD Radeon card was a $1,100 GPU at launch. So, is it just an innate struggle on my behalf to drop such a significant amount of money on a last-gen piece of tech?I'm going to say, no.If you're looking at straight raster performance the AMD card has a fairly significant edge, especially for two cards that now cost the same amount of cash with the red team dropping its pants on pricing for its once flagship GPU. And a few years ago that would have absolutely been enough for me to say 'stuff the RTX 4070, imma get me some AMD goodness.'\u00a0But we no longer live in a world where the old rules of graphics card performance apply. Native resolution and rasterised rendering aren't the only things to consider anymore. Since Nvidia dropped real-time ray tracing as a genuine ting in 2018 it's gained ever more traction in the intervening years.Sure, at the outset it was only in a handful of games, and such a performance hog that it felt more a proof of concept feature than anything people would actually use on a day-to-day basis. And Nvidia's own data bears this out, with it reporting that only 37% of RTX 20-series gamers enabled the feature back in 2018.Less so the emergent upscaling magic of DLSS, where only 26% of gamers who could use it would.Both technologies have significantly improved, and so have the GPUs which run them, making ray tracing, this top end of the graphical feature stack actually playable on a wide range of Nvidia cards.(Image credit: Future)And that name dropping of the green team there is deliberate, because however much more prevalent ray tracing has become in the gaming consciousness, and in actually released games, AMD is still not great at the ol' tracing of rays. Though it's improved in the RDNA 3 architecture, any game that uses even a smidge of ray tracing effects puts the RX 6950 XT behind the RTX 4070 in our benchmarks.Jeremy's argument that the difference between 16GB and 12GB of VRAM is going to make the real difference going forward is fine, but I'm yet to be convinced that is going to be a real battle outside of some very specific instances.\u00a0Then there's upscaling, which lowers the demands on VRAM, and the extra L2 cache Nvidia's slapped onto its Ada GPUs means it has the bandwidth, too. While AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution is an impressive upscaler in its own right, the company is still playing catchup with DLSS and even more so now that Nvidia has dropped the RTX 40-series' not-so-secret weapon: Frame Generation.AMD's got its own frame interpolation feature reportedly incoming, but Nvidia's Frame Generation is here, and already gifting RTX 40-series gamers free frame rate upgrades with no visible fidelity hit and super smooth gaming even at 4K.It's not enabled in every game, and needs to be coded in by the devs, but it's being baked into game engines now and will certainly become more widely used. I don't want to find myself with an RX 6950 XT, proud of its old school raster performance, when I really want to be running some shiny new lighting effects at 4K in a new game.Granted, there aren't many new games these days, but I still think I'd find it hard taking a step back in GPU generational terms. Especially given the performance gap between the RTX 4070 and RX 6950 XT could well end up getting wider over time.Benchmarks1440p gaming performanceImage 1 of 74K gaming performanceImage 1 of 9AMD RX 6950 XT vs. Nvidia RTX 4070: the verdict(Image credit: Future)Which is better: RX 6950 XT vs. RTX 4070?Ah, it's a tough one, but taking everything into consideration it's the RTX 4070 as the better option for PC gamers today.\nAs we said, it's weighing up the memory versus the feature set, and Jeremy and I both agree that the RTX 4070 has the edge in terms of the graphical features, but we don't agree about just how significant the difference between 16GB and 12GB of VRAM is going to be.\nThere is also the fact that right now the RX 6950 XT is only ~$600 because of a massive discount owing to the release of the RTX 4070. How long that is going to be a realistic retail price, or even how many of these cards are left out in retail, is up in the air.\nGoing forward, the RTX 4070 is the better choice. At least until AMD gets a move on and finally gives us the RX 7800 XT with reportedly RX 6950 XT levels of performance, improved ray tracing, frame interpolation and what? A $499 price tag?\nKeep dreaming...\n\n\nJeremy LairdSocial Links NavigationHardware writerJeremy has been writing about technology and PCs since the 90nm Netburst era (Google it!) and enjoys nothing more than a serious dissertation on the finer points of monitor input lag and overshoot followed by a forensic examination of advanced lithography.

NVIDIA\u2019s AI platform has consistently shown leadership across both training and inference since the inception of MLPerf, including the MLPerf Inference 3.0 benchmarks released today.\n\u201cThree years ago when we introduced A100, the AI world was dominated by computer vision. Generative AI has arrived,\u201d said NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang.\n\u201cThis is exactly why we built Hopper, specifically optimized for GPT with the Transformer Engine. Today\u2019s MLPerf 3.0 highlights Hopper delivering 4x more performance than A100.\n\u201cThe next level of Generative AI requires new AI infrastructure to train large language models with great energy efficiency. Customers are ramping Hopper at scale, building AI infrastructure with tens of thousands of Hopper GPUs connected by NVIDIA NVLink and InfiniBand.\n\u201cThe industry is working hard on new advances in safe and trustworthy Generative AI. Hopper is enabling this essential work,\u201d he said.\nThe latest MLPerf results show NVIDIA taking AI inference to new levels of performance and efficiency from the cloud to the edge.\nSpecifically, NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs running in DGX H100 systems delivered the highest performance in every test of AI inference, the job of running neural networks in production. Thanks to software optimizations, the GPUs delivered up to 54% performance gains from their debut in September.\nIn healthcare, H100 GPUs delivered a 31% performance increase since September on 3D-UNet, the MLPerf benchmark for medical imaging.\n\nPowered by its Transformer Engine, the H100 GPU, based on the Hopper architecture, excelled on BERT, a transformer-based large language model that paved the way for today\u2019s broad use of generative AI.\nGenerative AI lets users quickly create text, images, 3D models and more. It\u2019s a capability companies from startups to cloud service providers are rapidly adopting to enable new business models and accelerate existing ones.\nHundreds of millions of people are now using generative AI tools like ChatGPT \u2014 also a transformer model \u2014 expecting instant responses.\nAt this iPhone moment of AI, performance on inference is vital. Deep learning is now being deployed nearly everywhere, driving an insatiable need for inference performance from factory floors to online recommendation systems.\nL4 GPUs Speed Out of the Gate\nNVIDIA L4 Tensor Core GPUs made their debut in the MLPerf tests at over 3x the speed of prior-generation T4 GPUs. Packaged in a low-profile form factor, these accelerators are designed to deliver high throughput and low latency in almost any server.\nL4 GPUs ran all MLPerf workloads. Thanks to their support for the key FP8 format, their results were particularly stunning on the performance-hungry BERT model.\n\nIn addition to stellar AI performance, L4 GPUs deliver up to 10x faster image decode, up to 3.2x faster video processing and over 4x faster graphics and real-time rendering performance.\nAnnounced two weeks ago at GTC, these accelerators are already available from major systems makers and cloud service providers. L4 GPUs are the latest addition to NVIDIA\u2019s portfolio of AI inference platforms launched at GTC.\nSoftware, Networks Shine in System Test\nNVIDIA\u2019s full-stack AI platform showed its leadership in a new MLPerf test.\nThe so-called network-division benchmark streams data to a remote inference server. It reflects the popular scenario of enterprise users running AI jobs in the cloud with data stored behind corporate firewalls.\nOn BERT, remote NVIDIA DGX A100 systems delivered up to 96% of their maximum local performance, slowed in part because they needed to wait for CPUs to complete some tasks. On the ResNet-50 test for computer vision, handled solely by GPUs, they hit the full 100%.\nBoth results are thanks, in large part, to NVIDIA Quantum Infiniband networking, NVIDIA ConnectX SmartNICs and software such as NVIDIA GPUDirect.\nOrin Shows 3.2x Gains at the Edge\nSeparately, the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin system-on-module delivered gains of up to 63% in energy efficiency and 81% in performance compared with its results a year ago. Jetson AGX Orin supplies inference when AI is needed in confined spaces at low power levels, including on systems powered by batteries.\n\nFor applications needing even smaller modules drawing less power, the Jetson Orin NX 16G shined in its debut in the benchmarks. It delivered up to 3.2x the performance of the prior-generation Jetson Xavier NX processor.\nA Broad NVIDIA AI Ecosystem\nThe MLPerf results show NVIDIA AI is backed by the industry\u2019s broadest ecosystem in machine learning.\nTen companies submitted results on the NVIDIA platform in this round. They came from the Microsoft Azure cloud service and system makers including ASUS, Dell Technologies, GIGABYTE, New H3C Information Technologies, Lenovo, Nettrix, Supermicro and xFusion.\nTheir work shows users can get great performance with NVIDIA AI both in the cloud and in servers running in their own data centers.\nNVIDIA partners participate in MLPerf because they know it\u2019s a valuable tool for customers evaluating AI platforms and vendors. Results in the latest round demonstrate that the performance they deliver today will grow with the NVIDIA platform.\nUsers Need Versatile Performance\nNVIDIA AI is the only platform to run all MLPerf inference workloads and scenarios in data center and edge computing. Its versatile performance and efficiency make users the real winners.\nReal-world applications typically employ many neural networks of different kinds that often need to deliver answers in real time.\nFor example, an AI application may need to understand a user\u2019s spoken request, classify an image, make a recommendation and then deliver a response as a spoken message in a human-sounding voice. Each step requires a different type of AI model.\nThe MLPerf benchmarks cover these and other popular AI workloads. That\u2019s why the tests ensure IT decision makers will get performance that\u2019s dependable and flexible to deploy.\nUsers can rely on MLPerf results to make informed buying decisions, because the tests are transparent and objective. The benchmarks enjoy backing from a broad group that includes Arm, Baidu, Facebook AI, Google, Harvard, Intel, Microsoft, Stanford and the University of Toronto.\nSoftware You Can Use\nThe software layer of the NVIDIA AI platform, NVIDIA AI Enterprise,\u00a0 ensures users get optimized performance from their infrastructure investments as well as the enterprise-grade support, security and reliability required to run AI in the corporate data center.\nAll the software used for these tests is available from the MLPerf repository, so anyone can get these world-class results.\nOptimizations are continuously folded into containers available on NGC, NVIDIA\u2019s catalog for GPU-accelerated software. The catalog hosts NVIDIA TensorRT, used by every submission in this round to optimize AI inference.\nRead this technical blog for a deeper dive into the optimizations fueling NVIDIA\u2019s MLPerf performance and efficiency.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | GPU | Hardware | Inference | Machine Learning | NGC | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | NVIDIA Jetson | Recommender Systems | TensorRT \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Recently, there are lots of rumors popping up regarding the chip so we decided to round them up and see what Blackwell is shaping up to be.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 \"Blackwell\" GPU Rumored To\nThe latest rumors come from TechTubers, RedGamingTech & Moore's Law is Dead, who published their recent videos talking about NVIDIA's next-gen architecture. Since Blackwell is still a few years away from launch, this information isn't final and rumors are meant to be taken with a grain of salt though still interesting because more renowned leakers have made similar statements in the past.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM MemoryBased on previous information, we already know that Blackwell is the codename for NVIDIA's next-gen GPU architecture that is meant to succeed Hopper, and unlike Hopper, Blackwell comes with a consumer-esque GB102 GPU in addition to the GB100 GPU which was leaked a while back.\n\nThere have also been reports that Blackwell GPU architecture will be introduced in 2024 which means that GTC 2024 might be the first server-level introduction before the architecture ships out to GeForce cards.\nNVIDIA Blackwell GPUs To Retain Monolithic Die\nSo starting off with the details, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 series that utilizes the Blackwell GPUs is going to retain a monolithic die approach. Moore's Law is Dead states that NVIDIA isn't worried by AMD's chiplet strategy given what they were able to release during the first consumer-chipset gen in the form of Navi 31 \"RDNA 3\". The green is expected to keep on utilizing a monolithic die which still retains more advantages with the biggest one being having the product manufactured on time.\n\nADA-next seems to be another monolithic chip.\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) July 19, 2022\n\n\nMaybe Blackwell.\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) July 19, 2022\n\nLast year, Kopite7kimi also revealed that Ada-Next, Blackwell, might be another monolithic chip. It looks like NVIDIA has so far taken the rear seat in chiplet designs as both its consumer and server offerings still use monolithic GPUs. AMD may go the full chiplet route in RDNA 4 generation but the chipmaker is making chiplet GPUs for its server offerings.\nNVIDIA To Utilize TSMC 3nm Process Node To Make Blackwell GPUs?\nUpdate: Kopite7limi states that NVIDIA is not going to use a 3nm process node but something else.\n\nI'm afraid it won't use 3nm.\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) April 10, 2023\n\nThe second rumor is that NVIDIA will be utilizing TSMC's 3nm process node to manufacture the Blackwell GPUs. So far, all recent GPU launches by NVIDIA have been a node shrink starting with the Pascal GPUs that were made on TSMC's 16nm, Turing on TSMC's 12nm, Ampere on Samsung 8nm, and the current Ada GPUs utilize the TSMC 4N (5nm Optimized) node.\nTSMC's 3nm wafers are rumored to break the $20,000 US pricing, leading to increased costs of next-gen Intel, AMD & NVIDIA CPUs/GPUs. (Image Credits: DigiTimes)\nTSMC commenced volume production of its 3nm node in Q4 2022 and the node is stated to be better than expected, as per rumors. However, just as impressive as the node might sound, it's going to be super expensive too. According to insiders, TSMC 3nm wafers cost 25% more than TSMC's 5nm wafers which might result in increased prices for next-gen GPUs such as the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 \"Blackwell\" series. NVIDIA's CEO also reportedly visited Taiwan to talk with TSMC's CEO about securing 3nm wafers early on for their next-gen GPU lineup.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 \"Blackwell\" Graphics Cards Early \"Rumored\" Specs\nNext up, we have a ton of information from RedGamingTech who have received it from their own sources. The details start off by stating that Blackwell GPUs will feature massive overhaul to CUDA architecture though this isn't a ground-up design to say. The Blackwell SM units are expected to get a \"New Structure\" and there will be further optimizations and additions made to the denoising and Ray/Path Tracing hardware units.\nConsidering NVIDIA's recent push for Path Tracing in modern AAA titles, it looks like we will get even stronger on-chip hardware to process them. Maybe RT units will be replaced with more enhanced PT units, anything's possible, right?\n\nThe Blackwell GPUs are said to feature support for GDDR7 memory and while GDDR6X still has some room to spare but if GDDR7 provides better efficiency then it would definitely be a better choice. Now Samsung is working on its brand new GDDR6W DRAM which should provide even better performance & higher capacities though it's been a while since NVIDIA went back to the Sammy team on the consumer-end chips since leveraging Micron's technology. NVIDIA is using Samsung HBM solutions for its HPC and AI chips.\nWith that said, GDDR7 doesn't sound that far-fetched at all considering Cadence has already introduced the first solutions for verification testing of the new memory standard. Even Samsung announced that it will offer up to 36 Gbps transfer speeds with PAM3 signaling on GDDR7 dies & Micron is also expected to unveil its solution sooner or later. We are still a full year away from '24 so an intermediate refresh with GDDR6W and GDDR6X may still be possible (*cough* RTX 4090 Ti *cough*).\n\nIt's too early to discuss Blackwell now. I won't be surprised if it has a 512-bit memory interface.\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) April 7, 2023\n\nKopite7kimi also raises the possibility that Blackwell might feature a 512-bit SKU though NVIDIA has gone that route in a long time. The last 512-bit card from the vendor was the GTX 285 all the way back in 2009. But just in case there's a monster Blackwell GPU designed by NVIDIA, then we can get over 2 TB/s of bandwidth using 36 Gbps dies:\n\n128-bit @ 36 Gbps:\u00a0576 GB/s\n192-bit @ 36 Gbps:\u00a0846 GB/s\n256-bit @ 36 Gbps:\u00a01152 GB/s\n320-bit @ 36 Gbps:\u00a01440 GB/s\n384-bit @ 36 Gbps:\u00a01728 GB/s\n512-bit @ 36 Gbps: 2304 GB/s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe NVIDIA Blackwell GeForce RTX 50 series is also rumored to utilize a PCIe Gen 5 interface and offer clock speeds of 3 GHz+. The GB102 GPU should be the flagship of the gaming lineup and is said to rock 144 SMs, and 96 MB of L2 cache. That's the same amount of SMs and cache on the fully-enabled Ada AD102 GPU but it looks like the underlying changes to the architecture will be providing a significant boost in performance.\nNVIDIA Blackwell GPUs To Offer Another 2x Increase Over Ada?\nFinally, the performance is said to be another 2x leap over Ada GPUs. The Ada GPUs themselves offered a massive jump over the previous gen such as the RTX 4090's cut-down AD102 core but there were significant uplifts in all segments (Rasterization / Ray Tracing / DLSS). Further updates can push Blackwell GPUs to new heights and we can wait to see what NVIDIA has in store for the gaming community.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhat do want to see on NVIDIA's next-gen RTX 50 series?\n\n\n Faster Rasterization Performance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Faster Ray/Path Tracing Performance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Faster DLSS (Frame-Gen / Standard) Performance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n More VRAM Per Segment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Faster Clock Speeds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Bigger Cache\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Higher Power Efficiency\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Better Cooling\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Better Coolers / Design\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Better Prices Per Segment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n More Video Capabilities\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n More Gaming Technologies\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Better Overclocking Capabilities\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Better Availability & Supply\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n156\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n73\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n66\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n65\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n46\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

WhiteApril 6, 2023  11:46 am EST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Megias/Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to get your game on, you need a solid graphics card (also called a GPU) that can run it properly. Nvidia makes some of the best GPUs and has been an undisputed market leader for years. However, Nvidia GPUs can get pricey, so not every card is worthwhile. Which one suits your particular needs and your budget? We're here to answer those questions.\nAdvertisement\n\nChoosing the right graphics card for your PC build is the key to smooth gaming. Whether you're putting together a rig all by yourself or buying a pre-built, the graphics card and processor are the two components that have the most significant impact on your computer's gaming performance.\u00a0\nDo you want to play at 1080p, 1440p, or 4K? Are you gearing up to play all the latest titles, such as \"God of War: Ragnarok\" or \"Forspoken,\" or are you more into indie games? Finally, how much can you spend? Ponder these questions and check out the GPUs below because we've got something for every budget.\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3060\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaryia_K/Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's RTX 3060 has been among the most popular GPUs in recent years. It no longer belongs to the latest generation, but it's still excellent value, and it will support 1080p gaming on high to max settings. If you want to balance cost and performance, the RTX 3060 is a budget-friendly solution that lets you play all the games you want.\nAdvertisement\n\nRegarding specs, the GPU comes with 3584 CUDA cores, and its clock can be boosted to 1.78 GHz. The RTX 3060 can be found in two variants \u2014 one with 12 GB of GDDR6 memory and one with 8 GB. Despite being a cheap option, it gives you access to modern features that bolster graphics and increase performance, such as ray tracing and Nvidia Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), an image upscaling technology. Keep in mind, however, that the RTX 3060 may not be able to keep up in many games when it comes to ray tracing.\u00a0\nThe RTX 3060 is an affordable gateway to building a midrange computer. You can find it on Amazon, with prices ranging from $340 to $400, depending on the exact model you're buying. If you have a little wiggle room in your budget, you can also get an RTX 3060 Ti, which is close in price but has considerably better specs.\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStepanPopov/Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\nIf you're angling more toward 1440p gaming than 1080p, the RTX 3070 Ti will be able to handle it, and it won't cost you an arm and a leg. Where the RTX 3060 may falter at 1440p, the RTX 3070 Ti should be able to run most games smoothly at that resolution, and that's on max settings.\u00a0\nAdvertisement\n\nRegarding specs, the RTX 3070 Ti features 6144 CUDA cores \u2014 a considerable step up from the RTX 3060. It's only available with 8 GB of GDDR6X memory, and the base model made by Nvidia itself has a boost clock of 1.77 GHz. While that's identical to the cheaper RTX 3060, the extra graphics cores make this GPU much more capable.\u00a0\nAt current prices, the RTX 3070 Ti is usually more worthwhile than the RTX 3070. You can find it for as low as $630 on Amazon. If you want to save money but still play at 1440p, the RTX 3070 is a decent alternative.\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntinhkhuong/Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\nTime to move on to the next generation of Nvidia GPUs. There are plenty more cards in the RTX 30-series, but the more expensive models are not worth it anymore \u2014 you can usually score a better deal on a card in the RTX 40-series. Despite the upgrade in specifications, the RTX 4070 Ti still fares better at 1440p than it does at 4K, but you can successfully game on a 4K monitor with this GPU if you compromise on some graphics settings in certain games.\nAdvertisement\n\nThis model has 7680 CUDA cores, 12 GB of GDDR6X memory, and a massively improved clock speed that can hit as high as 2.61 GHz. Moving on to the next generation of cards means accessing DLSS 3.0, Nvidia's latest supersampling technology that generates entire frames instead of just pixels.\nYou can usually find this GPU for around $800-$900 on Amazon. To get similar performance from a last-gen card, you'd have to buy the RTX 3080 Ti, and that card is a lot more expensive most of the time.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4080\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Megias/Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to indulge in comfortable 4K gaming but don't quite need the best of the best, pick up the RTX 4080. It's powerful enough to let you game at 60 fps in 4K, which means playing on max settings without ray tracing enabled.\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it's better at ray tracing than the RTX 4070 Ti (and considerably so), there may be titles where you may not hit a steady 60 fps in 4K with ray tracing. For most gamers, this won't be a problem, but this is why it's not a top-of-the-line GPU \u2014 there are still things it can't do. However, compared to the flagship RTX 4090, it is cheaper and has a significantly lower power consumption.\nThe GPU has 9728 CUDA cores, a maximum boost clock of 2505 MHz, and 16 GB of GDDR6X memory. The total board power (TBP) was rated at 320W \u2014 a significant reduction from the 450W required by the RTX 4090. This GPU is a huge step down from the RTX 4090 and a sizeable upgrade from the RTX 4070 Ti.\nYou can usually find the RTX 4080 for $1,190 and upward, which is close to the initial selling price set by Nvidia. If the cost exceeds $1,350, you're usually better off adding an extra $200 to buy an RTX 4090 instead.\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4090\n\n\n\n\n\n\nserhatctk/Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's RTX 4090 sits at the top of the list of the best graphics cards for gaming. With ray tracing enabled, it'll fly through 4K gaming on max settings. It's also solid for professional use cases like video and photo editing or machine learning. The catch? It's costly. This is the best GPU you can get and the priciest GPU right now.\nAdvertisement\n\nThe RTX 4090 has specs that are nothing short of insane. It has 16,384 CUDA cores, a maximum clock speed of 2.5 GHZ, and a whopping 24 GB of GDDR6X VRAM. It has over 40% better specs than the RTX 4080, and it shows. Currently, there shouldn't be any games that the RTX 4090 can't tackle, and that's with all the settings at max and with ray tracing on.\nWhile the RTX 4090 is an absolute beast, most gamers have no use for a graphics card that powerful. You should only buy it if you want the best and don't mind spending a lot of money. The prices of this card can vary, with the cheapest models hovering around $1,600 and the most expensive going well above $2,000.\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The reason being told is due to a poor response to the recently released graphics card which launched at $599 US.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM MemoryAlthough the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card did manage to move lots of units during the initial launch day, the coming days haven't been great and since its launch on the 13th of April 2023, the card is still available in plenty of stock at worldwide retailers. The reference-priced cards are the ones that are moving units with no one seemingly paying extra for the premium models as they are priced very close to the RTX 4070 Ti which offers a bigger performance jump.\nNVIDIA GeForce Generational Performance / Price Trend (Image Credits: Harukaze5719 & 3DCenter):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nCutting down the supply by one month will minimize the effects of a potential oversupply of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 graphics cards both in upstream and downstream supply chains. The thing to keep in mind is that NVIDIA has already pre-booked TSMC's 4N wafers for its RTX 40 GPU lineup so if more supply is required, they can push for it however that is something that NVIDIA is currently avoiding as it wants its AICs to get rid of the last remaining GeForce RTX 30 inventory.\nIt is expected that after the announcement of NVIDIA RTX 4070 products, the sales are not good, and the price is even a little bit broken. Countermeasures have been discussed internally. The first eve of the book is to limit the supply of the RTX 4070 series and maintain a stable price system.\nThe supply of AIC brand RTX 4070 in China is very large, and the next RTX 4070 series low-quality models will be released If there is a problem of out of stock, the company must order the source of goods and buy at the same time before accepting the order, so it is necessary to bargain at will.\nMachine Translate via Chinese Board Channel Forums\nAn RTX 3060 Ti variant from MSI is a one-way AIBs will try to clear away their last Ampere chips. It looks like at least some retailers have started using the recently reported rebates to undercut the MSRP set by NVIDIA. Videocardz reports that in Poland, the RTX 4070 has fallen 9% below its MSRP of 3199 PLN and can now be bought for as low as 2913 PLN and several MSRP cards are retailing for 2999 PLN. A price of 2913 PLN converts to $695 US and although that is much higher than the US MSRP, the prices include hefty VAT.\nhttps://twitter.com/TechEpiphany/status/1647231335575040000\nAs for sales in Germany, Techepiphany has the latest numbers in for the launch week of RTX 4070 and while it is doing well and selling more than the other cards, we have to remember that this is still a fresh launch and much can change in the coming week. At Newegg US, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 is still available in stock at MSRP prices and has yet to appear within the Best Sellers list.\nSome of the factors as to why the card may not be selling well could be due to the price hike versus the last gen and the small performance bump. The NVIDIA GeForce 70-class GPUs have historically been around as fast as the last-gen flagship however, the RTX 4070 was the smallest performance jump over its 80-class predecessor. The RTX 3070 on the other hand retailed at $499 US and was able to be on par or ahead of the RTX 2080 Ti.\n\nOne can say that the introduction of the 90-class has taken the flagship performance one notch higher which is why the 70-class can't compete with the flagships anymore but still, the 4070 could've offered a decent bump over the 3080. If AICs do go for a price cut and settle close to $549 US, then the card may do well but it would also put pressure on the sales of the 4060 Ti which is why they are trying to avoid this for now. We will see how the next few months bode for the RTX 4070, meanwhile, you can check out our review of the card here.\nNVIDIA GeForce GPU Segment/Tier Prices\n\n\n\nGraphics Segment2023-20242022-20232021-20222020-20212019-20202018-20192017-20182016-20172014-2016\n\n\n\n\nTitan TierGeForce RTX 4090GeForce RTX 4090GeForce RTX 3090 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3090GeForce RTX 3090Titan RTX (Turing)Titan V (Volta)Titan Xp (Pascal)Titan X (Pascal)Titan X (Maxwell)\n\n\nPrice$1599 US$1599 US$1999 US\n$1499 US$1499 US$2499 US$2999 US$1199 US$1199 US$999 US\n\n\nUltra Enthusiast TierGeForce RTX 4080 SUPERGeForce RTX 4080GeForce RTX 3080 TiGeForce RTX 3080 TiGeForce RTX 2080 TiGeForce RTX 2080 TiGeForce GTX 1080 TiGeForce GTX 980 TiGeForce GTX 980 Ti\n\n\nPrice$999 US$1199 US$1199 US$1199 US$999 US$999 US$699 US$649 US$649 US\n\n\nEnthusiast TierGeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPERGeForce RTX 4070 TiGeForce RTX 3080 12 GBGeForce RTX 3080 10 GBGeForce RTX 2080 SUPERGeForce RTX 2080GeForce GTX 1080GeForce GTX 1080GeForce GTX 980\n\n\nPrice$799 US$799 US$799 US$699 US$699 US$699 US$549 US$549 US$549 US\n\n\nHigh-End TierGeForce RTX 4070 SUPER\nGeForce RTX 4070GeForce RTX 4070\nGeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16 GBGeForce RTX 3070 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3070GeForce RTX 3070 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3070GeForce RTX 2070 SUPERGeForce RTX 2070GeForce GTX 1070GeForce GTX 1070GeForce GTX 970\n\n\nPrice$599\n$549$599 US\n$499 US$599\n$499$599\n$499$499 US$499 US$379 US$379 US$329 US\n\n\nMainstream TierGeForce RTX 4060 Ti\nGeForce RTX 4060GeForce RTX 4060 Ti\nGeForce RTX 4060GeForce RTX 3060 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3060 12 GBGeForce RTX 3060 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3060 12 GBGeForce RTX 2060 SUPER\nGeForce RTX 2060\nGeForce GTX 1660 Ti\nGeForce GTX 1660 SUPER\nGeForce GTX 1660GeForce GTX 1060GeForce GTX 1060GeForce GTX 1060GeForce GTX 960\n\n\nPrice$449\n$299$399 US\n$299 US$399 US\n$329 US$399 US\n$329 US$399 US\n$349 US\n$279 US\n$229 US\n$219 US$249 US$249 US$249 US$199 US\n\n\nEntry TierRTX 3050 8 GB\nRTX 3050 6 GBRTX 3050RTX 3050GTX 1650 SUPER\nGTX 1650GTX 1650 SUPER\nGTX 1650GTX 1050 Ti\nGTX 1050GTX 1050 Ti\nGTX 1050GTX 950GTX 750 Ti\nGTX 750\n\n\nPrice$229\n$179$249 US$249 US$159 US\n$149 US$159 US\n$149 US$139 US\n$109 US$139 US\n$109 US$149 US$149 US\n$119 US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs;

Starting at $599, the GeForce RTX 4070 runs most modern games at over 100 frames per second at 1440p resolution.\n\u00a0\nDominate in style with the ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4070\nThe ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4070 offers the same incredible engineering as the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti, but at a more affordable price. At 3.12 slots thick and 338.9 mm long, this card provides plenty of surface area on its MaxContact heatsink for airflow while utilizing the new cyberpunk design and ultra-rigid structure of its larger siblings. A 16-pin power connector ensures compatibility with the latest 12VHPWR PSU standard, and an adapter is included to ensure compatibility with other power supply. These cards also feature three new 11-blade Axial-tech fans that can push 31% more air volume and 56.3% more static pressure than their predecessors on the ROG Strix GeForce RTX 3080. A massive vented backplate ensures superior airflow, and 0 dB technology keeps the cards completely silent under lighter workloads.\nAll must-have Strix features are here as well: gamers can choose between performance and quiet modes with a Dual BIOS switch; connect PC case fans to two FanConnect II headers; and light up a rig with a ring of ARGB tail-lights compatible with Aura Sync. Meanwhile, reliable power delivery and time-tested build quality through the ASUS Auto-Extreme manufacturing process ensures this card will stand with users for years to come.\n\u00a0\nPerformance and reliability meet in the TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 4070\nASUS also offers a TUF Gaming variant of the GeForce RTX 4070, complete with the same powerful GPU as the Strix version, with a slightly thicker heatsink and shorter card design. A wide vent on the high-strength aluminum backplate improves airflow compared to previous-generation models. At 3.15 slots and boasting the new 11-blade Axial-Tech fans, users won\u2019t be left wanting for cooling potential. Plus, the shorter 301 mm length offers wider case compatibility.\nThe TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 also offers the Dual BIOS switch and a redesigned ARGB TUF logo along the shroud for a touch of flair, alongside the military-grade capacitors and Auto-Extreme manufacturing quality all TUF cards are known for. If gamers want a durable card that will prove its worth time and time again, the TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 stands firm in its commitment to long-lasting gaming performance.\n\u00a0\nCreate the perfect build with all-new black and white Dual GeForce RTX 4070 GPUs\nFor the first time since the release of NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 40 Series family of graphics cards, ASUS is proud to announce that ASUS Dual cards are back in the mix. Now available in the standard black color tone and a new white version, these cards are the perfect match for more economical or small-form-factor builds. Redesigned with a new look for the 40 Series, the Dual cards evoke the space age with retro-futuristic style elements, including a semi-transparent view onto the heatsink at the top of the card. For builders who have a more subdued sense of style or do not need RGB, the Dual GeForce RTX 4070 is a perfect fit.\nPremium features like an all-aluminum backplate, 11-blade Axial-tech fans, and a Dual BIOS switch are present in the Dual cards. But as their names suggest, the Dual GeForce RTX 4070 only has two fans, giving the card a total length of just 267.1 mm, offering much greater compatibility with compact systems. Featuring a single 8-pin PCIe\u00ae power connector, the Dual GeForce RTX 4070 can be easily deployed into an existing build.

Stay up to date with our Where to buy RTX 4070 live tracker so you don't miss a stock drop in your region.The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 is here - finally, a true midrange GPU from Nvidia's mighty new RTX 4000 lineup! We've waited long enough, but how does it compare to its predecessor?At $599, the RTX 4070 is far more accessible than the other cards currently available in Nvidia's next-gen selection, but it's still not cheap; that means it's gonna have to work hard to justify its spot on our best graphics card list.Naturally, it dumpsters the card it's replacing - the previous-gen GeForce RTX 3070 - in every conceivable area, with the more sensible price point undoubtedly making it a very attractive choice for PC gamers everywhere.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5090 vs RTX 4090: we put Nvidia's best graphics cards head-to-head\n\n\n\n\nAMD RX 9070 XT vs 9070: Which RDNA 4 GPU should you buy?\n\n\n\nBut it's a hundred bucks pricier at retail than its progenitor, and the RTX 3070 will likely decline in price the longer its replacement is available, so do you really need to spring for the next-gen card?\u00a0We're going to break down all the details, and hopefully you can use this article to figure out what the best Nvidia graphics card for you is - and the RTX 4070 has its work cut out for it. We called the RTX 3070 \"one of the best graphics cards of all time\" back when we reviewed it in 2021, so this could be one hell of a matchup.Nvidia RTX 4070 vs RTX 3070: Price(Image credit: Future)Generational price increases never make us happy, so you can probably guess which card is going to win this round. At $599 / \u00a3599 / around AU$900, the RTX 4070's MSRP sits a hundred bucks (or pounds, if you're on His Majesty's GPU Service) above the retail price of the RTX 3070.In fact, bad news for Brits: the 4070 is proportionally more expensive in the UK. The RTX 3070 originally retailed for $499 / \u00a3469 / AU$809 - no such currency adjustments abound this time.Now, the 3070 was actually very hard to find for that retail price for quite a while, thanks to the chaos caused by the global chip shortage and a seemingly endless slew of scalpers hoovering up GPUs for crypto mining. In an amusing twist of fate, though, the crypto market crash has seen graphics card pricing stabilize somewhat - you can currently pick up a 3070 for $499.99 on Newegg.\u00a0Neither of these GPUs will be going on our best cheap graphics card list, sure, but the 3070 is obviously the cheaper option for anyone looking to build or upgrade on a (relative) budget.We'll dig more into the performance further down, but here's the gist: the RTX 4070 does perform well enough to justify its 20% price rise. The gaming performance disparity increases at higher resolutions, so consider what display you'll be using; if you're using one of the best gaming monitors running at 1080p with a high refresh, the 3070 is going to be the better value. Above that, you do get more bang for your buck with the 4070.However, chances are the 4070 is gonna be selling significantly above that $599 MSRP in the immediate aftermath of the launch, especially for third-party models of the card - while the 3070 is liable to plunge in value without legions of crypto-bros trying to grab them. So right now, we've got to give the win to the older card; if only to discourage Nvidia from similar generational price hikes in the future!Winner:\u00a0Nvidia RTX 3070Today's best Nvidia RTX 4070 deals1 Amazon customer review\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $968View Deal $1,098View Deal No price informationCheck WalmartWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesToday's best RTX 3070 deals $680View Deal $751.43View Deal No price informationCheck WalmartShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesNvidia RTX 4070 vs RTX 3070: Design(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)It's important to note that both the RTX 4070 and 3070 have plenty of variant models available from Nvidia's third-party manufacturing partners, and everyone has different tastes.Some of you will prefer the classic Founders Edition version, while others might want to spring for an RGB-laden card from MSI, Asus, or one of the other board partners. Ultimately, there won't be a huge amount of difference, so we'll compare Nvidia's FE models here.Unlike the RTX 3070 FE, which sported two exposed open-face fans on its front side, the RTX 4070 FE shares the same design as the more expensive GPUs in the RTX 4000 lineup - that means a closed-panel layout on one side of the card, concealing one of the two fans behind it. This presumably provides slightly superior airflow, though we don't have the data to properly back up that claim right now.Notably, the RTX 4070 FE is a lot smaller than the other Lovelace cards Nvidia has released so far, using the same two GPU slots in your PC case as the RTX 3070 FE does. That's great news, since some of us were getting sick of overly chunky GPUs.Some less welcome news is the presence of Nvidia's highly contentious 12VHPWR 16-pin power connector, which requires a specialized adaptor to be used with older ATX power supplies and was notably at the center of 'cablegate', the crisis that saw some of Nvidia's flagship RTX 4090 cards overheating and damaging people's systems.Meanwhile, the RTX 3070 FE uses the older but more established 8-pin connection standard for power supply, which is still being used by AMD and may also be found in some third-party models of the 4070 - which rather begs the question of why Nvidia felt the need to include it here. Another win for the 3070, then.Winner:\u00a0Nvidia RTX 3070Nvidia RTX 4070 vs RTX 3070: Performance(Image credit: Future)My test bench specsHere is the systems I used to test the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 and RTX 3070:CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D\nCPU Cooler: Cougar Poseidon GT 360 AIO Cooler\nDDR5 RAM: 32GB Corsair Dominator Platinum @ 5,200MHz & 32GB G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo @ 5,200MHz\nMotherboard: ASRock X670E Taichi\nSSD: Samsung 980 Pro SSD @ 1TB\nPower Supply: Corsair AX1000 80-Plus Titanium (1000W) Case: Praxis WetbenchUnsurprisingly, the RTX 4070 roundly thrashes its predecessor when it comes to raw performance. Both GPUs are 1440p graphics cards, and while there's also the option to use Nvidia's DLSS upscaling tech to play games at 4K, that's the main resolution we'll be comparing these two cards at for gaming.Looking at synthetic and creative tests first though, the RTX 4070 beats the 3070 comfortably in every area except the Handbrake video transcoding test, where the gains were very minimal since both GPUs use the same video codec. Photoshop performance (as tested by the PugetBench benchmark) was also similar, with the 4070 retaining a smaller edge.Elsewhere, 4K rendering in Lumion 12.5 was massively faster on the 4070 - unsurprising since the 4070 is a lot more 4K-capable than the 3070 - while performance in both the CUDA and RTX tests of the V-Ray GPU rendering benchmark was hugely superior to the older card.Swipe to scroll horizontallyCreativeBENCHMARKNVIDIA RTX 4070NVIDIA RTX 3070DIFFERENCEHandBrake (4K to 1080p, FPS)1701671.80%Lumion 12.5 (4K render, 4-star, FPH)26499166.67%V-Ray GPU (CUDA)1,8711,42331.48%V-Ray GPU (RTX)2,6291,81944.53%PugetBench Photoshop1,5171,4862.09%Row 5 - Cell 0 Row 5 - Cell 1 Row 5 - Cell 2 Row 5 - Cell 3 Average Creative Performance1,5871,25126.86%Looking at synthetic graphical tests, the PassMark 3D synthetic test saw the 4070 perform about a 12% better on average across all resolutions than the older card. Results elsewhere were more pronounced; the most significant differential we saw was in ray-traced workloads, as demonstrated by the 3DMark Port Royal RTX benchmark.This was unsurprising; Nvidia is now onto its third generation of ray-tracing technology, so it's not earth-shattering news to see that's the area where the RTX 4070 most reliably defeats its predecessor.Average performance across all resolutions in our synthetic tests was just above 20% better in the 4070 - lining up with the price increase almost exactly, but not the staggering 50%+ increase some had been hoping for.Swipe to scroll horizontallySyntheticBENCHMARKNVIDIA RTX 4070NVIDIA RTX 3070DIFFERENCEPassMark 3D34,91331,06312.39%3DMark Firestrike44,28834,69627.65%3DMark Firestrike Ultra10,0378,60516.64%3DMark Time Spy17,77813,49631.73%3DMark Port Royal11,1548,26934.89%Row 5 - Cell 0 Row 5 - Cell 1 Row 5 - Cell 2 Row 5 - Cell 3 Average Synthetic Performance36,68730,33920.92%Of course, gaming is the real meat here, since the RTX 4070 is the card PC gamers are going to want to snap up - and the RTX 3070 is one of the most popular gaming GPUs right now according to the Steam Hardware Survey - occupying the number four spot at the time of writing and climbing fast.Swipe to scroll horizontallyGaming (FPS, 1440p, Max graphics settings, No DLSS)BENCHMARKNVIDIA RTX 4070NVIDIA RTX 3070DIFFERENCETotal War: Warhammer III917226.39%Cyberpunk 2077 (No RT)48449.09%Cyberpunk 2077 (Psycho RT)352540.00%Tiny Tina's Wonderlands1077738.96%Returnal (No RT)1017829.49%Returnal (RT On)765538.18%Row 6 - Cell 0 Row 6 - Cell 1 Row 6 - Cell 2 Row 6 - Cell 3 Average performance (1440p)765928.81%Once again, we see here that ray-traced workloads are where the RTX 4070 shines, outperforming the 3070 far more significantly in games with RTX on. Without ray-tracing, Cyberpunk 2077's performance only varied by nine percent between the two cards; turning on the heavily demanding Psycho RTX preset saw that differential leap all the way up to forty percent.The results above are all for playing at 1440p, since that's the most reasonable comparison point; as you can see in our Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 review, the RTX 4070 does actually excel a lot more at 4K than the 3070, even without DLSS.And since it's one of Nvidia's next-gen GPUs, it can take advantage of full frame generation with DLSS 3, potentially providing even higher framerates at higher resolutions. If you're looking to play at 4K, this is a no-brainer. Below that, the performance gulf gets smaller, and the 3070 remains a perfectly valid choice.Swipe to scroll horizontallyFinal Performance AveragesCATEGORYNVIDIA RTX 4070NVIDIA RTX 3070DIFFERENCESynthetic Benchmarks36,68730,33920.92%Creative Benchmarks1,5871,25126.86%Gaming Benchmarks (all resolutions)977529.34%Swipe to scroll horizontallyFinal Performance Average13,39811,01521.63%Final Points Per MSRP Dollar22.3722.071.36%Winner:\u00a0Nvidia RTX 4070Which one should you buy?(Image credit: Future)So, it looks like the RTX 4070 actually loses this time fight. That price-to-performance stat up above is particularly damning - barely 1% more bang for your buck than the last time around, Nvidia? And that's using dollars; pricing in other regions actually sees the 3070 offer better value for money.But honestly? We still feel perfectly happy recommending the RTX 3070; we stand by what we said about it back in 2021. It really is one of the best GPUs ever made, and if you're able to get one below MSRP in the coming months, it'll be a very sound investment.That doesn't mean that the 4070 is bad, though - quite the opposite. It actually offers the most performance per dollar of any of Nvidia's current RTX 4000 lineup, by a pretty significant margin; its big brother the RTX 4070 Ti is close, but the more expensive next-gen GPUs don't even touch it when it comes to value for money.\u00a0AMD isn't even in the conversation here either; we've yet to see more affordable desktop cards from Team Red's Radeon RX 7000 series. So if you want a sensibly-priced graphics card that is fully future-proofed, we'd argue that the RTX 4070 is the one to pick. While Nvidia has said some newer features (like DLSS 3) will be available on previous-gen GPUs, they're bound to perform better on newer hardware.Oh, and again, if you've got a 4K monitor, buy the 4070. The 3070 is great, but it's simply not a true 4K card even with DLSS. That's part of why you're probably going to see the 4070 creeping up the ranks of our best graphics card list in the near future!\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nChristian GuytonSocial Links NavigationEditor, ComputingChristian is TechRadar\u2019s UK-based Computing Editor.

The $599 MSRP means it's also replacing the RTX 3070 Ti, with 50% more VRAM and dramatically improved efficiency. Is the RTX 4070 one of the best graphics cards? It's certainly an easier recommendation than cards that cost $1,000 or more, but you'll inevitably trade performance for those saved pennies.\n\nAt its core, the RTX 4070 borrows heavily from the RTX 4070 Ti. Both use the AD104 GPU, and both feature a 192-bit memory interface with 12GB of GDDR6X 12Gbps VRAM. The main difference, other than the $200 price cut, is that the RTX 4070 has 5,888 CUDA cores compared to 7,680 on the 4070 Ti. Clock speeds are also theoretically a bit lower, though we'll get into that more in our testing. Ultimately, we're looking at a 25% price cut to go with the 23% reduction in processor cores.\n\nWe've covered Nvidia's Ada Lovelace architecture already, so start there if you want to know more about what makes the RTX 40-series GPUs tick. The main question here is how the RTX 4070 stacks up against its costlier siblings, not to mention the previous generation RTX 30-series. Here are the official specifications for the reference card.\u00a0Swipe to scroll horizontallyNvidia RTX 4070 Compared to Other Ada / Ampere GPUsGraphics CardRTX 4070RTX 4080RTX 4070 TiRTX 3080 TiRTX 3080RTX 3070 TiRTX 3070ArchitectureAD104AD103AD104GA102GA102GA104GA104Process TechnologyTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NSamsung 8NSamsung 8NSamsung 8NSamsung 8NTransistors (Billion)3245.935.828.328.317.417.4Die size (mm^2)294.5378.6294.5628.4628.4392.5392.5SMs46766080684846GPU Cores (Shaders)58889728768010240870461445888Tensor Cores184304240320272192184Ray Tracing \"Cores\"46766080684846Boost Clock (MHz)2475250526101665171017651725VRAM Speed (Gbps)2122.42119191914VRAM (GB)121612121088VRAM Bus Width192256192384320256256L2 Cache (MiB)3664486544ROPs6411280112969696TMUs184304240320272192184TFLOPS FP32 (Boost)29.148.740.134.129.821.720.3TFLOPS FP16 (FP8)233 (466)390 (780)321 (641)136 (273)119 (238)87 (174)81 (163)Bandwidth (GBps)504717504912760608448TGP (watts)200320285350320290220Launch DateApr 2023Nov 2022Jan 2023Jun 2021Sep 2020Jun 2021Oct 2020Launch Price$599$1,199$799$1,199$699$599$499There's a pretty steep slope going from the RTX 4080 to the 4070 Ti, and from there to the RTX 4070. We're now looking at the same number of GPU shaders \u2014 5888 \u2014 as Nvidia used on the previous generation RTX 3070. Of course, there are plenty of other changes that have taken place.\n\nChief among those is the massive increase in GPU core clocks. 5888 shaders running at 2.5GHz will deliver a lot more performance than the same number of shaders clocked at 1.7GHz \u2014 almost 50% more performance, by the math. Nvidia also likes to be conservative, and real-world gaming clocks are closer to 2.7GHz... though the RTX 3070 also clocked closer to 1.9GHz in our testing.\n\nThe memory bandwidth ends up being slightly higher than the 3070 as well, but the significantly larger L2 cache will inevitably mean it performs much better than the raw bandwidth might suggest. Moving to a 192-bit interface instead of the 256-bit interface on the GA104 does present some interesting compromises, but we're glad to at least have 12GB of VRAM this round \u2014 the 3060 Ti, 3070, and 3070 Ti with 8GB are all feeling a bit limited these days. But short of using memory chips in \"clamshell\" mode (two chips per channel, on both sides of the circuit board), 12GB represents the maximum for a 192-bit interface right now.\n\nWhile AMD was throwing shade yesterday about the lack of VRAM on the RTX 4070, it's important to note that AMD has yet to reveal its own \"mainstream\" 7000-series parts, and it will face similar potential compromises. A 256-bit interface allows for 16GB of VRAM, but it also increases board and component costs. Perhaps we'll get a 16GB RX 7800 XT, but the RX 7700 XT will likely end up at 12GB VRAM as well. As for the previous-gen AMD GPUs having more VRAM, that's certainly true, but capacity is only part of the equation, so we need to see how the RTX 4070 stacks up before declaring a victor.\n\nAnother noteworthy item is the 200W TGP (Total Graphics Power), and Nvidia was keen to emphasize that in many cases, the RTX 4070 will use less power than TGP, while competing cards (and previous generation offerings) usually hit or exceeded TGP. We can confirm that's true here, and we'll dig into the particulars more later on.\n\nThe good news is that we finally have a latest-gen graphics card starting at $599. There will naturally be third-party overclocked cards that jack up the price, with extras like RGB lighting and beefier cooling, but Nvidia has restricted this pre-launch review to cards that sell at MSRP. We've got a PNY model as well that we'll look at in more detail in a separate review, though we'll include the performance results in our charts. (Spoiler: It's just as fast as the Founders Edition.)Image 1 of 2Four GPCs, one NVENC, and one NVDEC for the RTX 4070(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The full AD104 implementation includes five GPCs, four NVDEC units, and two NVENC blocks.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Above are the block diagrams for the RTX 4070 and for the full AD104, and you can see all the extra stuff that's included but turned off on this lower-tier AD104 implementation. None of the blocks in that image are \"to scale,\" and Nvidia didn't provide a die shot of AD104, so we can't determine just how much space is dedicated to the various bits and pieces \u2014 not until someone else does the dirty work, anyway (looking at you, Fritzchens Fritz).\n\nAs discussed previously, AD104 includes Nvidia's 4th-gen Tensor cores, 3rd-gen RT cores, new and improved NVENC/NVDEC units for video encoding and decoding (now with AV1 support), and a significantly more powerful Optical Flow Accelerator (OFA). The latter is used for DLSS 3, and while it's \"theoretically\" possible to do Frame Generation with the Ampere OFA (or using some other alternative), so far only RTX 40-series cards can provide that feature.\n\nThe Tensor cores meanwhile now support FP8 with sparsity. It's not clear how useful that is in all workloads, but AI and deep learning have certainly leveraged lower precision number formats to boost performance without significantly altering the quality of the results \u2014 at least in some workloads. It will ultimately depend on the work being done, and figuring out just what uses FP8 versus FP16, plus sparsity, can be tricky. Basically, it's a problem for software developers, but we'll probably see additional tools that end up leveraging such features (like Stable Diffusion or GPT Text Generation).\n\nThose interested in AI research may find other reasons to pick an RTX 4070 over its competition, and we'll look at performance in some of those tasks as well as gaming and professional workloads. But before the benchmarks, let's take a closer look at the RTX 4070 Founders Edition.MORE:\u00a0Best Graphics CardsMORE:\u00a0GPU Benchmarks and HierarchyMORE:\u00a0All Graphics Content\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n6\n\n\n7\n\n\n8\n\n\n9\n\n\n10\n\n\n\nCurrent page:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Founders Edition Review\n\n\n\nNext Page Nvidia RTX 4070 Founders Edition Design\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n4K\nGeForce RTX 4070\nBenchmark\nGeForce\nrtx\nray tracing\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (83)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

The gist goes something like this. User turned on ray tracing. User turned off ray tracing. Boom! Chalk one up for the ray-tracing column, because look, they turned it on!Nvidia doesn't provide any details as to what it takes to qualify as an RTX gamer who enables either DLSS or ray tracing. Could a brief experimentation as implied above qualify?

(Image credit: Nvidia)It's certainly fair to say that without disclosing what games these numbers apply to and how long gamers used RT settings and so whether they stuck with ray tracing for the long haul, the simple fact that 83% of gamers with RTX 40 GPUs turned ray tracing on at some point, which is all we know for sure from the data, doesn't mean a whole lot.The comparative numbers with earlier generations and the uptick in usage is interesting, but again doesn't necessarily imply anything straightforward.\u00a0Back in 2018 Nvidia states that 37% of RTX 20-series gamers enabled ray tracing (in the four games that used it back then) and just 26% enabled DLSS.You could argue that the increased RT usage on RTX 40 cards makes sense given that those GPUs offer better ray-tracing performance than earlier generations. But if that is what's driving higher RT usage on RTX 40 GPUs, why is DLSS usage lower progressively on older generations? Admittedly, it wasn't as good back then as it is today.Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest gaming motherboard: The right boards\nBest graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the restYou might expect upscaling usage to be more prevalent on older GPUs that need more help attaining decent frame rates. But nope. RTX 30-series GPU owners still use DLSS less than RTX 40 owners, and RTX 20 owners use it less still.We could speculate that existing RTX 40 cards out in the wild (the data relates to February this year) are high-end models more likely to be owned by switched on enthusiasts aware of these features, whereas older GPUs are perhaps more mainstream and more likely to be used by gamers who simply run at whatever settings the game throws up by default and don't dig too deeply into the graphical options.This is, indeed, Nvidia's take when we spoke to the company about the numbers ahead of the RTX 4070 launch. That could easily be why, some RTX 20 owners are overlooking the benefits of DLSS. But unless Nvidia is able to provide a more detailed breakdown of the figures, we simply won't know the specifics.Either way, there's certainly little doubt that both upscaling and ray tracing are becoming increasingly critical features for modern graphics cards, however you want to interpret this data.\n\n\nJeremy LairdSocial Links NavigationHardware writerJeremy has been writing about technology and PCs since the 90nm Netburst era (Google it!) and enjoys nothing more than a serious dissertation on the finer points of monitor input lag and overshoot followed by a forensic examination of advanced lithography.

Vote for him at our Wash100 site as your favorite GovCon figure from this year\u2019s class of awardees.\nRobbins has led NVIDIA\u2019s federal team and its work over the past five years to assist government customers in transforming agency processes with artificial intelligence and accelerated computing platforms.\nIn a March 2023 guest piece for StateTech magazine, Robbins zeroed in on recommendations from the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology to modernize wildland firefighting missions.\n\u201cThe dramatic increase in wildfires presents danger to U.S. land, residents and first responders, but we have the technology available to make fighting these fires safer and more effective,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cAI-driven systems, especially those already being prototyped in the private sector, will provide the edge needed to better fight these fires as well as to predict their paths of destruction and even snuff them out before they rise up.\u201d\nIn December 2022, NVIDIA outlined the company\u2019s ideas on the future of domestic chip production in response to the National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s request for information.\nRobbins wrote in a LinkedIn post that the 12-page document includes the potential applications of AI in lithography, cybersecurity and electronic design.\nHe also uses the professional networking platform to advocate for collaboration between technology vendors to accelerate AI adoption in the government and enterprise sectors.\nNVIDIA and Octo teamed up in August 2022 to develop AI-based service offerings for the public sector through the latter company\u2019s oLabs innovation center. Two months later, NVIDIA and Oracle forged a multiyear partnership to integrate accelerated computing tools into the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\nThe six-time honoree sparked a conversation around AI when he attended a recent Executive Mosaic-hosted senior leadership event. His commitment to championing the advancement of such technology in the federal sector helps shape the GovCon narrative.\nExecutive Mosaic congratulates Anthony Robbins and the NVIDIA organization for their selection to receive the 2023 Wash100 award.

The RTX 4070 is set to cost $600, which is a substantial 25% discount when compared to the Ti version. Having said that, looking at the specs we do expect it to be ~20% slower. The same 12GB VRAM as the 4070 Ti are there though, so the RTX 4070 is looking pretty good and we're very excited to check it out.\nLike the RTX 4070 Ti, the new vanilla non-Ti 4070 is based on the AD104 silicon, though it's been cut down version to 5888 CUDA cores, or 23% fewer than the Ti, there's also 23% fewer texture units and 20% fewer ROP units. The base clock has been set at 1920 MHz, which is 17% lower, while the boost clock has only been reduced by 5%.\n\nOn the memory front, Nvidia is still using 21 Gbps GDDR6X on a 192-bit wide bus for a bandwidth of 504 GB/s. As noted earlier, you're still getting 12GB of VRAM, which we now believe to be the minimum amount of VRAM that should be provided on a graphics card not targeting entry-level performance.\nNvidia is producing a Founders Edition of the RTX 4070 which isn't something they did for the 4070 Ti. With a total graphics power rating of just 200 watts, Nvidia's been able to create a dual-slot card - after having become so accustomed to massive 4090, 4080 and 4070 Ti graphics cards, the RTX 4070 seems small, but in reality it's fairly typical when compared to previous generation models, roughly matching the size and weight of the RTX 3070 FE model.\n\nNvidia's RTX 4070 Founders Edition uses a single 12VHPWR connector, with a dual 8-pin adapter included in the box. However, Nvidia's board partners are free to use the more standard 8-pin connector and are only required to use a single 8-pin connector. On hand for this review we have the MSI Ventus 3x model, which uses a single 8-pin power input. It's a long, triple-fan card and it only requires two expansion slots, so that's nice, and we'll look at thermals and power figures soon.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nGeForce RTX 4090 Ti\nGeForce RTX 4080\nGeForce RTX 4070 Ti\nGeForce RTX 4070\n\n\nPrice MSRP\n$1,600\n$1,200\n$800\n$600\n\n\nRelease Date\n12-Oct-22\n16-Nov-22\n5-Jan-23\n13-Apr-23\n\n\nCodename\nAD102\nAD103\nAD104\n\u00a0\n\n\nProcess\nTSMC N4 5nm\n\n\nCore Config\n16384 / 512 / 176\n9728 / 304 / 112\n7680 / 240 / 80\n5888 / 184 / 64\n\n\nGPU Boost Clock\n2520 MHz\n2505 MHz\n2610 MHz\n2475 MHz\n\n\nMemory Capacity / Type\n24 GB / GDDR6X\n16 GB / GDDR6X\n12 GB / GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Speed\n21 Gbps\n22.4 Gbps\n21 Gbps\n\n\nBus Type / Bandwidth\n384-bit / 1.1 TB/s\n256-bit / 717 GB/s\n192-bit / 504 GB/s\n\n\nTotal Board Power\n450w\n320w\n285w\n200w\n\n\n\nSomething a bit different about this release is that there are two separate embargos. One for non-overclocked models like Nvidia's FE card and MSI's Ventus 3x, and a second embargo which will be lifted 24 hours later covering the overclocked partner models.\n\nNvidia appears to be prioritizing reviews of models that are meant to sell at or very near the $600 MSRP, while the more premium OC cards can only be reviewed once on sale the following day. Part of the strategy there seems to make it clear that the RTX 4070 is a $600 product, but how true that ultimately ends up being is of course yet to be seen.\nThe RTX 4070 Ti isn't quite at $800 but most entry-level models are close enough at $810 to $820 as of writing, while overclocked models (Suprim X, Strix, Aorus, for example) are all up around $950 which is an absurd price for a graphics card with 12GB of VRAM.\n\nOur test system is powered by the Ryzen 7 5800X3D with 32GB of DDR5-3200 dual rank memory, which we don't foresee becoming an issue for 1440p benchmarks and isn't a problem at all for 4K testing either. But in the coming week we do plan to start refreshing all our GPU data with many new gaming titles on our 7800X3D test system. The graphics card we're testing is the MSI RTX 4070 Ventus 3x, but please note that performance should be exactly the same as the Founders Edition model.\nBenchmarks\nFirst up we have Watch Dogs: Legion, where at 1440p the RTX 4070 was good for 127 fps on average, making it a fraction slower than the RTX 3090 Ti, which means it's also slower than the Radeon 6800 XT.\nPerformance in this game is just 13% slower than the 4070 Ti, and also 23% behind the Radeon 7900 XT. So in short, we're roughly looking at previous-gen high-end performance for $600, and about what you would have paid for the 6800 XT.\n\n\nJumping up to 4K doesn't change much. The RTX 4070 was good for 72 fps which is very much Radeon 6800 XT-like performance, making it 19% slower than the Ti model.\nWhen compared to previous-gen GeForce GPUs, it was 3% faster than the RTX 3080 and 26% faster than the 3070 Ti.\n\nNext up we have Rainbow Six Extraction and here the RTX 4070 is good for 191fps, which is very much RTX 3080 levels of performance, making it 26% faster than the 3070 Ti.\nIt's also 10% faster than the Radeon 6800 XT, but 7% slower than the similarly priced 6950 XT, based on current retail pricing. We're also looking at an 18% performance deficit to the 4070 Ti and 20% to the 7900 XT.\n\nThe GeForce RTX 4070 is still very capable at 4K, rendering just shy of 100 fps, which means Radeon 6950 XT and RTX 3080-like performance in this game - not bad for $600.\nThe margins remain much the same to the Ti version, this time trailing by 19%.\n\nThe Far Cry 6 results are CPU limited at 1440p which is less of an issue for the RTX 4070, and more of an issue for the faster GPUs. For example, it was just 6% slower than the 4070 Ti, though it was still 17% slower than the 7900 XT.\n\nMoving to 4K solves the bottleneck and now the RTX 4070 is 14% slower than the 4070 Ti and 31% slower than the 7900 XT. In this game we're looking at RTX 3080 levels of performance.\n\nMoving on to Assassin's Creed Valhalla at 1440p we see that the RTX 4070 is 16% slower than the Ti model and 27% behind the Radeon 7900 XT.\nHowever, we are looking at RTX 3080 Ti, 3090 and 6900 XT-like performance, so we think for $600 that's a positive result, despite being a more mild 19% boost over the 3070 Ti.\n\nThen at 4K we're looking at much the same, here the RTX 4070 is 15% slower than the 4070 Ti, though when compared to the previous generation, it was delivering Radeon 6800 XT and RTX 3080 performance.\n\nNext we have the Hunt: Showdown results and no surprises here, the RTX 4070 is delivering 6800 XT performance, so slightly slower than the RTX 3080 in this example and just 14% faster than the RTX 3070 Ti.\n\nThe results at 4K are even less favourable, here the 4070 was just 6% faster than the 3070 Ti, making it 8% slower than the 6800 XT and 21% slower than the 4070 Ti.\n\nThe Outer Worlds saw the 4070 pumping out 141 fps at 1440p which positioned it between the 6800 XT and 3080 in our graph, so a fairly typical result there. It was also just 14% slower than the 7900 XT and 16% slower than the 4070 Ti, which is a good result when compared to those more expensive models.\n\nWe find much the same at the 4K resolution, here the 4070 is now 17% slower than the\n4070 Ti and 16% slower than the 7900 XT, while 76 fps on average meant we were looking at 6900 XT-like performance.\n\nThe RTX 4070 ripped through the Modern Warfare II benchmark with 182 fps making it just 11% slower than the 4070 Ti, though it was 32% slower than the 7900 XT. Still when compared to previous gen products the new 4070 was comparable to the 6800 XT, which meant it was actually faster than the 3090 Ti.\n\nThen at 4K we're again looking at 6800 XT performance, though this time that did make it slightly slower than the 3090 Ti, which is obviously still a great result.\n\nThe RTX 4070 looks well down on our Hitman 3 graph at 1440p, but with 147 fps on average it was 4% faster than the RTX 3080 and just 3% slower than the 6800 XT. That said it was around 20% slower than the 4070 Ti and 7900 XT.\n\nJumping up to 4K did advantage the higher core count models as here the 4070 was 30% slower than the 4070 Ti and 38% slower than the 7900 XT, which admittedly is a very large margin. Still when compared to previous generation parts we are looking at RTX 3080 levels of performance.\n\nNext we have the F1 22 results and by default this game enables ray tracing with the ultra high preset, so we've left RT effects enabled. Here the 4070 was good for 90 fps at 1440p, making it 10% faster than the RTX 3080 and just 3% slower than the 7900 XT. Moreover it was just 10% slower than the 4070 Ti, so a really good result here for Nvidia's new $600 offering.\n\nThen at 4K we're looking at RTX 3080 Ti and 3090 performance, making the 4070 only slightly slower than the 7900 XT in this example. Then we see that it's 13% slower than the 4070 Ti, so again a good result for the 4070 here.\n\nThe 4070 doesn't look amazing in our Cyberpunk 2077 benchmark, here it rendered just 80 fps on average making it 25% slower than the 4070 Ti and a massive 32% slower than the 7900 XT. When compared to previous generation products we're only looking at RX 6800 levels of performance, though that still meant it was 14% faster than the 4070.\n\nPerformance margins are much the same at 4K, here the 4070 was 24% slower than the Ti model and 37% slower than the 7900 XT. Meanwhile we're again looking at RX 6800 levels of performance, making it slightly faster than the 3070 Ti.\n\nThe 4070 was also rather unimpressive in Dying Light 2, at least relative to parts like the 7900 XT which were 35% faster, or even the Ti model which was 29% faster. That said it was 20% faster than the 3070 Ti with RTX 3080-like performance.\n\nMeanwhile the 4K data is even less impressive, here the 4070 was just 15% faster than the 3070 Ti, making it 8% slower than the 3080 and RX 6800.\n\nThe Halo Infinite results look much better, at 1440p the 4070 finds itself situated between the 3090 and 3090 Ti, making it 15% faster than the 6800 XT and 17% faster than the 3080. It was also just 4% slower than the 7900 XT, though it was still 18% slower than the Ti version.\n\nThen at 4K we're looking at 68 fps on average, which is still 3080 Ti/3090 levels of performance, and only slightly slower than the 6950 XT, so a good result overall.\n\nLast up we have Shadow of the Tomb Raider and we're not using the built-in benchmark here, rather we're measuring in-game performance using the demanding village section. Here the 4070 rendered 139 fps which is 6900 XT and RTX 3090-like performance, making it 17% slower than the 4070 Ti.\n\nIncreasing the resolution to 4K reduces the average frame rate to 74 fps, but we're still looking at 3080 and 6800 XT levels of performance, making the RTX 4070 18% slower than the Ti model.\n13 Game Average\nThe GeForce RTX 4070 is good for 126 fps in our 13 game average at 1440p, which is the same result we received from the Radeon 6800 XT. This means the RTX 4070 is on average 4% faster than the RTX 3080 and 24% faster than the 3070 Ti.\nImpressively, it's sitting just 7% behind Nvidia's previous generation flagship, the GeForce RTX 3090, or 14% slower than the refreshed RTX 3090 Ti which eventually became the 30 series flagship.\n\nOther relevant comparisons include the AMD's older flagship, the 6950 XT which is a tad faster, while scoring an average frame rate just 7% slower than the Radeon 6900 XT. When compared to the RTX 4070 Ti, the 4070 is 18% slower there, and 22% slower than the 7900 XT.\n\nLooking at the 4K resolution average, we still see the GeForce RTX 4070 delivering on average 69 fps, which means it was neck and neck with the Radeon 6800 XT once again. It was 20% slower than the Ti model and 27% slower than the 7900 XT.\n\nFor those of you interested, here's a look at the more CPU limited 1080p data using the Ryzen 7 5800X3D. Here the GeForce RTX 4070 is just 14% slower than the Ti model and 16% slower than the 7900 XT.\nRay Tracing + DLSS\nLet's now look at ray tracing and DLSS performance at 1440p in a few titles, starting with F1 22. The RTX 4070 is just 10% slower than the Ti model in this racing game when running with ray tracing enabled, and then just 4% slower with RT disabled, though we're likely running into the limits of our 5800X3D CPU here.\n\nIt's still interesting to note that with ray tracing enabled, the RTX 4070 is 14% slower than the 3090 Ti, but with DLSS enabled performance was about the same and then with RT disabled the RTX 4070 was 15% faster - some interesting scaling there. We're also looking at similar ray tracing performance to the Radeon 7900 XT, so the RTX 4070 is certainly much better value when it comes to RT performance.\n\nIn Watch Dogs: Legion the RTX 4070 is 19% slower than the 4070 Ti when using ray tracing and 13% slower with RT disabled. Then when compared to the RTX 3090 Ti, it's 22% slower using ray tracing but just 3% slower with RT disabled.\nWhen compared to the Radeon 7900 XT we find that the RTX 4070 is 11% slower with RT enabled and a much more substantial 23% slower with it disabled.\n\nMoving on to the Guardians of the Galaxy, we see that the RTX 4070 is 16% slower than the 4070 Ti with ray tracing enabled, 21% slower than the 3090 Ti, but also 5% faster than the 7900 XT. Then with RT disabled it's 11% slower than the 7900 XT and 4070 Ti.\n\nNext we have Fortnite using hardware ray tracing with Lumen and Nanite enabled.\nHere the RTX 4070 was 16% slower than the 4070 Ti and 3090 Ti, and 21% slower than the 7900 XT. So far we're seeing strong RT performance from RDNA 3 using the Unreal Engine 5, though it's unclear if this will be the case for all games using it.\n\nThe GeForce RTX 4070 performed very well in Doom Eternal using the ultra nightmare preset. We're looking at 249 fps on average with ray tracing enabled, making it 16% slower than the 4070 Ti and 12% slower than the 3090 Ti.\nThat said, it was 20% slower than the 7900 XT, the Radeon GPU appears to perform very well in this game, and that's especially true with RT disabled where it was almost 60% faster than the 4070.\n\nResident Evil Village also plays well on the Radeon 7900 XT, but even so the more affordable RTX 4070 was still very impressive, pumping out 144 fps using the ray tracing preset at 1440p, making it 16% slower than the 4070 Ti and 18% slower than the 3090 Ti.\n\nThe Spider-Man Remastered results are unfortunately quite CPU limited with ray tracing enabled, though probably less so in the case of the RTX 4070 as it was 12% slower than the 4070 Ti and 17% slower than the 7900 XT. Still, 116 fps on average is impressive and DLSS was able to bump that up to 128 fps.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is an extremely demanding game, even without ray tracing, so unsurprisingly the RTX 4070 is limited to just 39 fps here, though DLSS quality mode drastically improved performance getting us to 69 fps.\nIn this example, the RTX 4070 is 24% slower than the 4070 Ti and 3090 Ti, but beat the 7900 XT by an 11% margin. Of course, the 7900 XT was faster with RT disabled, but if you care about ray tracing the RTX 4070 represents really great value at $600.\nPower Consumption\nThe GeForce RTX 4070 is particularly impressive in the power efficiency department. We're measuring total system usage here and as you can see the RTX 4070 allowed for a total system consumption of 318 watts, which is 11% less than the RTX 3070 - super impressive given it offered roughly 40% more performance in this test.\n\n\nWe find similar figures in other games, Doom saw total system usage hit 314 watts which is a 10% reduction when compared to the RTX 3070 and a 26% reduction compared to the 6800 XT, which delivered a similar level of performance.\n\nDying Light 2 saw more of the same, 314 watts total system usage which was a good improvement over previous generation models.\n\nBy locking the frame rate at 90 fps, we can see just how efficient the RTX 4070 really is.\nTotal system usage dropped by 4% when compared to the 4070 Ti and a massive 22% when compared to the Radeon 7900 XT, that is a remarkable power saving at the same level of performance, so excellent work here by Nvidia.\nCost Per Frame\nIt's now time for the all-important cost per frame analysis and we'll start with the MSRP figures. Based on our 1440p data, the $600 MSRP makes the RTX 4070 the best value GPU released at this performance tier for this generation and last, though to be fair AMD has yet to release a $600 RDNA 3 competitor - still, when compared to Radeon RX 6000 and GeForce 30 series offerings, the RTX 4070 looks good, at least based on MSRP pricing...\n\nIf Nvidia can indeed deliver RTX 4070 graphics cards at the $600 MSRP, then it will be a good value product relative to what we've seen from AMD and Nvidia recently. We've often talked about how the Radeon 6800 XT and GeForce RTX 3080 10GB were the last sensible high-end products and the RTX 4070 is delivering similar performance at a more competitive price (at launch).\nWe're only talking about an 8% improvement over the Radeon 6800 XT after 2 years, but compared to what we have been getting, that's actually a good result. It's also an 18% improvement from the RTX 3080 and a 19% improvement over the terrible value RTX 3070 Ti.\nOn that note, we feel the RTX 4070 is best compared in terms of value with either the GeForce RTX 3080 10GB or RTX 3070. When compared to the 3070, we're looking at an 8% improvement in cost per frame, or the same margin seen when comparing with the Radeon 6800 XT or plain old 6800.\nThat's good but not mind-blowing. Basically the RTX 4070 is 20% more expensive than the RTX 3070 and offers on average 31% more performance.\n\nNow if we look at current retail pricing for each product - including the older GPUs that can still be purchased new - we find that the RTX 4070 is less attractive. The Radeon 6950 XT is a particular standout here as it's just $50 more than the RTX 4070 MSRP, but offers 16% more performance on average.\nThe Radeon 6950 XT also offers 4GB of extra VRAM, though RT performance is weaker and you miss out on features like DLSS and frame generation, which are probably worth paying a premium for, depending on the type of gaming you do.\nThe Radeon 7900 XT is also appealing at $800. Granted, it's quite a bit more than the RTX 4070, but you're getting loads more VRAM at 20GB and almost 30% more performance, so we'd say the 7900 XT will turn out to be a significantly better investment, but that's merely a guess on our part.\nAll in all, while there are viable Radeon alternatives, even with a direct RDNA 3 competitor, we'd say the new RTX 4070 remains a compelling option at $600.\nCooling\nTaking a quick look at operating temperatures after an hour of load inside a closed ATX case. MSI's Ventus 3x peaked at just 64c with a fan speed of 1400 RPM. This card was whisper quiet and very cool. Impressive results which prove that all you need for optimal operation is a base model MSRP card that's well equipped like this MSI offering.\nThen we have Nvidia's FE model which ran slightly hotter, peaking at 67c with a slightly louder 1700 RPM fan speed, but still an exceptionally good result, especially when you consider how compact the FE model is.\nWhat We Learned\nGiven the current market, the GeForce RTX 4070 happens to be a rather good deal and it's certainly much closer to an acceptable price tag than any other current generation GPU release so far. We're talking Radeon 6800 XT / GeForce RTX 3080 levels of performance for $600 - not exactly mind-blowing stuff after about two and a half years - but it's a $50 to $100 discount when comparing launch MSRP pricing and it's not like the crypto bubble didn't happen.\n\nIn an ideal world, the GeForce RTX 4070 would be a $500 product, meaning that $600 is a 20% markup but still much closer to our ideal price than everything that's come before it. That makes it hard for us to criticize the $600 MSRP, because the numbers tell us that the RTX 4070 is now the best value GPU priced above $500 (both current and previous generation), while also including support for the modern technologies such as DLSS 3.\nSpeaking of DLSS 3, the reason why we included no DLSS 3 benchmarks in this review is the same reason given in our RTX 4080 review and further discussion when we cross-tested FSR and DLSS after some Reddit controversy. But in short, a big issue with DLSS 3 benchmarks is reporting frame generation as an FPS metric, as 120 fps for example using DLSS 3 frame generation really isn't 120 fps: it's the smoothness of 120 fps but with the input of roughly half that frame rate, plus a few graphical issues. This is a serious issue for benchmarking and we would suggest any reviewer benchmarking with frame generation enabled should report the numbers as \"120 DLSS 3.0 fps\", as an example.\n\nGoing back to buying recommendations, the RTX 4070 is a solid offering but there are a few alternatives you may want to consider. The Radeon 6800 XT can be had for around $570 and it offers more VRAM, but you'll have to weigh that up against the lack of DLSS support and inferior ray tracing performance - we'd probably still go with the RTX 4070. The Radeon 6950 XT could make for a stronger case with on average ~15% more performance for $650, but the same pros and cons apply here.\nThere's also a case to be made for the Radeon RX 7900 XT, which is on the next price tier at $800. In terms of cost per frame they are matched, and the Radeon is on average nearly 30% faster. The big draw card is the extra 8GB of VRAM, 12 GB to 20 GB is a massive upgrade which may hand the 7900 XT a serious visual advantage in the not to distant future, much like what we're seeing when comparing the Radeon 6800 and RTX 3070 in modern games today. But, of course, $200 is still a lot of money, and may only be well justified if you're planning on holding onto your next graphics card for 3 - 4 years.\n\nAs mentioned before, we'll quickly note that 12GB is now what we consider to be the bare minimum - that is to say, you shouldn't purchase a graphics card with less than 12 GB VRAM when spending over $200 in a new GPU. It is our opinion that 8GB should be reserved for entry-level gaming products now, and anything less than 8 GB isn't suitable for current generation gaming.\nBottom line, the GeForce RTX 4070 is a good value product packing a strong feature set and excellent performance. We're happy that the RTX 4070 has turned out to be a product that we can recommend, and we expect this GPU to sell very well if they can meet the promised $600 MSRP.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4090 on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 7900 XT on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 7 7700X on Amazon\n\nFurther Testing\nSince we posted this original review of the GeForce RTX 4070, we have written new comparisons and relevant benchmarks you may be interested in:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 vs. 4070 Ti: Is the Ti Worth It?\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 vs. RTX 4060 Ti 16GB\nGeForce RTX 4070 vs. Radeon RX 7800 XT\nGeForce RTX 4070 vs. RTX 2070: Worthy Upgrade or Not?\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 103\n\n\n Got something to say?

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Antony reviews and covers the latest PC hardware and laptop technologyFollow AuthorApr 24, 2023, 11:44am EDTShareSaveCommentGraphics card prices could be falling in coming weeks if AMD's recent move is anything to go by. It's Radeon RX 6950 XT now costs just $630, down from nearly $700, shortly after the launch of Nvidia's RTX 4070 two weeks ago. The RX 6950 XT now sits within $30 of the new Nvidia card, but has 16GB of video memory compared to just 12GB for the RTX 4070.\nAMD's Radeon RX 6950 XT now costs just $630ASRock\n\nMany have argued that Nvidia is including too little memory with its latest graphics cards, both to handle the latest games and given the graphics cards' price. AMD typically includes 16GB of memory with its RX 6800 and 6900-series cards, all of which are in the mix in competing with RTX 4070.\n\nIn a recent snub of Nvidia, AMD emphasised its memory advantage saying the latest games \u2018require ample video memory to ensure your games run without a hitch'.\n\nAMD snubs Nvidia for not including more memory on its graphics cardsAMD\nIt seems AMD is keen to compete at least at the $600 mark, and the RX 6950 XT not only has more memory than the RTX 4070, but outperforms it in most games too. The Nvidia card isn't beaten everywhere, though, and still has the advantage of DLSS and excellent ray tracing performance as well as supremely low power consumption.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nHowever, there are plenty of games that already push the RTX 4070's 12GB of video memory to its limits. Far Cry 6 for example requires 12GB of VRAM to fully utilize its HD texture pack for enhanced graphics, and this is a relatively old game now.\n\nNvidia is widely expected to launch the highly anticipated RTX 4060 series in the next six weeks and AMD could be doing the same with the Radeon RX 7600 series at the May Computex event in Taiwan. This will mean renewed competition in the mid-range and hopefully price cuts to previous generation models too.\n\n\nThis is important as AMD's absence from the mid-range and low end markets after the launch of its Radeon RX 7900-series cards a few months ago have meant its only weapon against Nvidia below this level was price cuts. Even now, there is no clear timeline for a 7800-series or 7700-series despite the likes of the Radeon RX 6800 having launched all the way back in 2020.\nHowever, with Nvidia's higher prices and lack of mid range models itself, at least below the RTX 4070, this has meant that prices remain stubbornly high for those looking to build PCs with modest budgets. If both companies are aiming to release new mid-range models within weeks of each other, this could be good news for PC gamers.\nAre you looking to upgrade or build a PC in the near future?

The RTX Remix creator toolkit Early Access is coming soon.\nThe RTX Remix runtime captures a game scene, and replaces assets at playback while injecting RTX technology, such as path tracing, DLSS 3 and Reflex into the game. Already, mod developers have been using the RTX Remix runtime from Portal With RTX to create experimental ray traced scenes in numerous classic games.\nTo further empower the mod development community to extend Remix\u2019s game compatibility and feature set, NVIDIA is releasing the RTX Remix runtime as open source on GitHub today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RTX Remix runtime is open source with a permissive MIT license, and includes the following components:\n\nUSD capture and replacement modules, which are responsible for capturing a game scene to USD, and replacing original game assets with modded game assets at runtime.\nBridge, which translates the renderer from a x86 to a x64 instruction set. This component uncaps the memory available for rendering.\nScene manager, which uses information coming through the D3D9 fixed function API to create a representation of the original scene, track game objects frame to frame, and set up the scene to be path traced.\nThe core path tracer, which includes the rendering loop, the material handling, and the game specific rendering features (e.g., decals and particles). Please note, the various technologies (DLSS, NRD, RTXDI) that accelerate our path tracer and enable it to render in real time will continue to be available via their existing SDKs and licenses from the\u00a0NVIDIA Developer portal.\n\nOpen sourcing unlocks numerous possibilities to extend the feature set of the Remix runtime. A few examples of projects that advanced mod developers might tackle via source code access include:\n\nMaking more of their favorite games compatible with Remix\nModernizing the fluid simulation to render smoke and fire with realistic volumetrics\nInjecting custom post effects shaders in the runtime\nAdding animated lights (e.g., flickering fire, or lights that cycle through colors)\nReplacing animated character meshes\nChanging camera positions in games (e.g., turning a first person game into an isometric one)\nIncorporating virtual reality support into the renderer\nImplementing dynamic conditional replacements (e.g., add fog or change a light in response to a player\u2019s position)\n\nThere is ample opportunity to change how classic titles are played, and open source widens the possibilities beyond our imagination. We look forward to seeing what mod developers will build with source access.\nFor PC gamers, an open source RTX Remix runtime will help broaden the variety of games with RTX mods and the types of mods themselves.\nHow To Get Involved\nThe RTX Remix runtime source code can be found on GitHub, and bugs can be reported here.\nOur main goal is to expand game compatibility and extend the features of Remix in collaboration with the community. In keeping with that aim, NVIDIA will accept pull requests on Github for code submissions from the community, provide feedback, and help advance code until it is mature enough to be merged into the official RTX Remix runtime.\nTo further help the community with Remix, several Remix engineers have joined the community-led RTX Remix Showcase Discord server, are providing guidelines on compatibility, and responding to mod developers\u2019 questions about RTX Remix. If you are looking to get started with your own Remix runtime open source project, head over to the Discord to find subject matter experts to collaborate with. We have also prepared some starter guides and documentation for mod developers as we continue to prepare the RTX Remix application.\nModding is all about community, and providing an open source RTX Remix runtime will help empower mod developers to expand Remix compatibility to even more classic PC games. We look forward to seeing how creators usher in this new era of modding with RTX Remix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\n#SHOTWITHGEFORCE\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           Philippines\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nLegal Info\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It offers a ton of performance and ECC memory capacity in a relatively easy-to-integrate dual-slot blower cooler. While the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 is a very capable, but huge GPU, this is more mundane in size and is intended for professional applications. If you purchase a NVIDIA RTX 6000 in a pre-built workstation or loose, there is a good chance it comes via PNY who helped us do this review. Thanks to PNY for the support on this. Let us get to the review.\nNVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Graphics Card Review\nFirst off, the NVIDIA RTX 6000 is a dual-slot blower-style cooler design. Blower-style coolers fell out of favor as TDPs increased after the \u201cPascal\u201d generation of GPUs. The advantage of these GPUs is that they are much more compact and are designed to fit in workstations including those that fit server-like dual-width GPUs.\nNVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Card Front 1\nSomething that may not be obvious, but that we showed in our previous\u00a0BOXX APEXX S3 Overview is that these cards are very glossy. Enough so that high-end cameras like the Canon R5 and even the Sony Alpha 1 will focus on components reflected off of the surface of the card.\nBOXX APEXX S3 Intel Core I9 13900K And NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Edition 8\nThe rear of the card has a full card backplate. This is a matte finish contrasting with the glossy opposite side. In either event, this is not a RGB-laden design which is refreshing.\nNVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Card Back 2\nNVIDIA is still using its \u201cGold\u201d ribbed coloring for the top and bottom edges of the GPU. Here we can also see the PCIe x16 connector.\nNVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Card Bottom\nThe top of the unit will give folks pause. While there are connectors for things like the 3D stereo function there is a notable absence. The NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada generation does not have NVLink. Given the cost and level of this card, this may shock some of our readers. The previous generation NVIDIA RTX A6000 48GB GPU did support NVLink.\nNVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Card Angle\nThe end of the card is a solid piece of metal except for two features. There are two screw mounting points for GPU retention brackets. Those are common in high-end workstations like the\u00a0Lenovo ThinkStation P620 and\u00a0Supermicro AS-5014A-TT workstations. Comparison video on those here. The other feature is the PCIe CEM5 16-pin power connector.

And finally, there\u2019s a member of the RTX 40-series possibly worth buying other than the $1,600 flagship. Meet the 12GB GeForce RTX 4070. It\u2019s hitting the streets for $599 on April 13.\nThe GeForce RTX 4070 delivers exceptionally fast 1440p gaming performance while sipping power, a combination that let Nvidia create an adorably tiny Founders Edition version of the GPU. Those frame rates climb even higher in games that support Nvidia\u2019s DLSS upscaling technology, and astronomically higher in games embracing DLSS 3 Frame Generation\u2014even with ray tracing flipped on. Exceptional software features like Nvidia Broadcast, Reflex, and RTX Video Super Resolution help sweeten the pot.\n\n\nThe RTX 4070 may be worth considering but it\u2019s not a slam-dunk recommendation. Paying $599 for a 70-class graphics card explicitly marketed for 1440p gaming deeply aches, especially when Nvidia made technical decisions that actively hurt the GPU\u2019s 4K gaming prowess. We\u2019d also like to see 16GB of memory in a $600 graphics card in 2023. Still, while the RTX 4070 costs $100 more than its predecessor and delivers middling upgrade value over last-generation GeForce offerings, it\u2019s nowhere near as insultingly overpriced as the $800 RTX 4070 Ti and $1,200 RTX 4080 are.\nWith those broad-strokes impressions out of the way, let\u2019s dig into the details.\n\n\n\n\nFurther reading: Where to buy the GeForce RTX 4070\nWhat are the GeForce RTX 4070\u2019s specs?\nNvidia\u2019s $599 GeForce RTX 4070 uses a cut-down version of the 4N \u201cAda Lovelace\u201d AD104 GPU found in the RTX 4070 Ti. Here\u2019s a look at its core specifications:\nGraphics Processing Clusters: 4Texture Processing Clusters: 23Streaming Multiprocessors: 46CUDA Cores: 5888Tensor Cores: 184 (4th Generation)RT Cores: 46 (3rd Generation)Texture Units: 184ROP Units: 64Base Clock: 1920MHzBoost Clock: 2475MHzMemory Clock: 10500MHzMemory Data Rate: 21Gb/sTotal Video Memory: 12GB GDDR6XMemory Interface: 192-bitTotal Memory Bandwidth: 504GB/sTransistor Count: 35.8 billionConnectors: 3x DisplayPort, 1x HDMIPower Connectors: 2x PCIe 8-pin cables (adapter in box) OR 300W or greater PCIe Gen 5 cablePower Supply Required:650W\nThis all represents solid advances over the technology inside last generation\u2019s $499 RTX 3070 and $599 RTX 3070 Ti, though it\u2019s a significant step back from the 4070 Ti\u2019s might\u2014that card runs roughly 15 to 25 percent faster, depending on the game and resolution. The performance gap widens slightly at 4K resolution.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nYou don\u2019t really want the GeForce RTX 4070 for 4K gaming anyway\u2014a conclusion that\u2019s supported by Nvidia\u2019s decision to market this GPU around playing games at 100 frames per second at 1440p resolution. As we discussed extensively in the RTX 4070 Ti\u2019s review, Nvidia equipped the AD104 GPU used by both 4070 cards with a surprisingly narrow 192-bit memory bus, which constrains overall memory bandwidth. The RTX 4070 comes with GDDR6X, faster memory than its predecessor, as well as a much larger L2 cache (36.8K) for keeping more tasks on the GPU itself. Both of those help boost memory performance but I wouldn\u2019t buy this card for 4K gaming\u2014only 1440p.\nBy contrast, the\u00a0RTX 3080\u2014which, again, was a higher-tier card that cost $100 less than the 4070 Ti\u2014wielded a 320-bit bus, which is typical for a high-end GPU. Even the\u00a0already-pandemic-overpriced $600 RTX 3070 Ti\u00a0had a 256-bit bus. You had to go all the way down to the\u00a0$330 RTX 3060\u00a0to find an Nvidia GPU with a 192-bit bus last generation.From PCWorld\u2019s RTX 4070 Ti review\nThat goes doubly so given its 12GB memory capacity\u2014a very welcome upgrade over the 8GB that Nvidia\u2019s 70-class remained stuck on since the GTX 1070\u2019s launch in 2016. That said, with games gobbling ever-increasing amounts of VRAM now that the latest console generation (and 16GB of shared memory) are the standard, I\u2019d be nervous about buying a graphics card for 4K gaming with less than 16GB of memory. The RTX 4070\u2019s 12GB should be fine for most games at 1440p, though note that flipping on ray-tracing effects eats heavily into VRAM as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nThe GeForce RTX 4070 Founders Edition is substantially smaller than the gargantuan RTX 4080 FE.Brad Chacos/IDG\nThis is a tremendously energy-efficient graphics card, which let Nvidia craft a smaller, totally adorable dual-slot version of its Founders Edition board. Nvidia\u2019s fantastic-looking FE designs treat almost every part of the card as a heatsink and utilize unorthodox flow-through fan cooling. That all holds true with the RTX 4070 FE\u2014it\u2019s just so much smaller than its triple-slot siblings. This beast will be popular in high-end small form-factor gaming builds.\nThe GeForce RTX 4070 delivers exceptional 1440p gaming performance in even the most strenuous games, with best-in-class ray tracing performance if you want to turn those cutting-edge lighting features on.\nNvidia equipped the RTX 4070 Founders Edition with a single HDMI 2.1 port as well as three DisplayPort 1.4a connections. It also uses the new 16-pin 12VHPWR connector despite its relatively modest power demands\u2014you only need a 650W supply\u2014so be prepared to look at the unsightly too-short adapter plugs in your case if you don\u2019t want to invest in a new ATX 3.0 power supply (or at least custom 12VHPWR cords). FE cards don\u2019t include extra features like dual-BIOS switches or customizable RGB lighting.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 12VHPWR power connector on the RTX 4070. You\u2019ll need to use the included adapter to run it with standard cabling.Brad Chacos/IDG\nAs an RTX 40-series \u201cAda Lovelace\u201d graphics card, the GeForce RTX 4070 also supports Nvidia\u2019s staggering arsenal of features, including DLSS, DLSS 3 Frame Generation, Nvidia Broadcast, RTX Video Super Resolution, superb ray-tracing prowess, Nvidia Reflex, and more. Nvidia\u2019s software stack is a major feather in its cap. It\u2019s worth noting that while the RTX 4070 supports AV1 encoding, new to GeForce this generation, product manager Justin Walker told me the 4070 only includes a single AV1 encoder rather than the pair found in higher-priced RTX 40-series offerings.\nGot it? Good. Let\u2019s get to the benchmarks.\n\n\nOur test system\nWe test graphics cards on an AMD Ryzen 5900X PC used exclusively for benchmarking GPUs. We now test with PCIe Resizable BAR (also known as Smart Access Memory on Ryzen systems) active, as most modern gaming PCs released in the last four years support the performance-boosting feature, either natively or via a motherboard firmware update. Nvidia also recommends turning on the optional \u201cHardware-accelerated GPU scheduling\u201d option in Windows to let the RTX 40-series stretch its legs to the fullest, so we\u2019ve made that tweak as well. Most of the hardware was provided by the manufacturers, but we purchased the storage ourselves.\nAMD Ryzen 5900X, stock settingsAMD Wraith Max coolerMSI Godlike X570 motherboard32GB G.Skill Trident Z Neo DDR4 3800 memory, XMP activeCorsair HX1500i power supply (and optional $20 12VHPWR 600 cable for Nvidia GPUs)1TB SK Hynix Gold S31 SSD x2\nWe test a variety of games spanning various engines, genres, vendor sponsorships (Nvidia, AMD, and Intel), and graphics APIs (DirectX 9, 11, DX12, and Vulkan), to try to represent a full range of performance potential. Each game is tested using its in-game benchmark, sanity checked by Nvidia\u2019s FrameView tool, at the highest possible graphics presets unless otherwise noted, with VSync, frame rate caps, real-time ray tracing or DLSS effects, and FreeSync/G-Sync disabled, along with any other vendor-specific technologies like FidelityFX tools or Nvidia Reflex. We\u2019ve also enabled temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) to push these cards to their limits.\n\nWe run each benchmark at least three times and list the average result for each test. Outside of esports, we\u2019ve limited our benchmarks to 4K and 1440p resolutions, as those are the natural fits for these juggernaut GPUs (despite the 4070 Ti\u2019s paltry bus width). We test features like ray tracing and DLSS in a separate section, as upscaling features like DLSS and AMD\u2019s rival FSR tweak the look of games to help them run faster. \u00a0\nWe\u2019re going to show these benchmarks without individual game commentary. In addition to paying attention to how the RTX 4070 performs in relation to the 4070 Ti, 3080, and 3070, also note how it compares against AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 6800 XT and 6900 XT\u2014two last-generation models that are faster and more memory-packed than Nvidia\u2019s new offering, and can often be found for less on the street. Nvidia\u2019s GPUs womp in ray tracing and extra features, though they lag behind Radeon in raw esports frame rates.\n\n\nHow fast is the GeForce RTX 4070?\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nThe RTX 4070 and 4070 Ti deliver especially underwhelming 4K performance in CSGO.Brad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nHow is the RTX 4070\u2019s ray tracing and DLSS performance?\nIn addition to traditional gaming tests, we separately benchmark how graphics cards perform with ray tracing enabled at the highest possible settings (though we stick to Ultra, not Psycho, in Cyberpunk 2077).\nSince ray tracing tanks frame rates, we also test how Nvidia and AMD\u2019s DLSS and FSR upscaling technologies, respectively, manage to claw back performance using their Balanced quality presets, which straddle the line between optimizing for better image quality and faster frame rates. We\u2019ve also chosen benchmarks that show how Nvidia\u2019s new DLSS 3 Frame Generation can supercharge frame rates and visual smoothness even further by inserting AI-generated frames between every GPU-rendered frame. Nvidia says DLSS 3 is being adopted 7x faster than DLSS 2 was and it can deliver truly transformative visual smoothness in games that support it, as evidenced by Cyberpunk 2077\u2018s glorious Overdrive path tracing mode, but it\u2019s only available for new RTX 40-series offerings.\n\n\n\n\nNote that DLSS and FSR both work by rendering a frame at a lower resolution, then scaling it to fit your screen using software smarts. They also have several different quality presets available. Comparing DLSS vs. FSR in raw frame rate isn\u2019t as apples-to-apples as comparing native gaming performance, in other words, but still worth examining as they\u2019re features most gamers will use in the real world. That warning goes doubly so for DLSS 3\u2019s radical AI frame generation, which can sometimes generate artifacts and other slight inconsistencies, as Hardware Unboxed\u2019s excellent video above shows.\nThe charts below show native 1440p performance; native 1440p with ray tracing ultra active; upscaled DLSS/FSR Balanced mode performance with ray tracing ultra active; and, for RTX 40-series GPUs only, DLSS 3 Frame Gen performance with ray tracing ultra active. You can also activate DLSS/FSR or DLSS 3 without ray tracing active for even faster frame rates but we only tested that scenario in Red Dead Redemption 2 because there are only so many hours in the day, y\u2019all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077\u2019s showcases the best that Nvidia\u2019s RTX technology suite has to offer.Brad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nIs the GeForce RTX 4070 power efficient?\nWe test power draw by looping the\u00a0F1 22\u00a0benchmark at 4K for about 20 minutes after we\u2019ve benchmarked everything else (to warm up the GPU) and noting the highest reading on our Watts Up Pro meter, which measures the power consumption of our entire test system. The initial part of the race, where all competing cars are onscreen simultaneously, tends to be the most demanding portion.\u00a0\nThis isn\u2019t a worst-case test; this is a GPU-bound game running at a GPU-bound resolution to gauge performance when the graphics card is sweating hard. If you\u2019re playing a game that also hammers the CPU, you could see higher overall system power draws. Consider yourself warned.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nDespite flinging out fantastic frame rates, the GeForce RTX 4070 absolutely sips power. No complaints, just admiration.\nWe test thermals by leaving GPU-Z open during the\u00a0F1 22\u00a0power draw test, noting the highest maximum temperature at the end.\n\n\nThat supreme power efficiency let Nvidia craft an adorably tiny Founders Edition model. It isn\u2019t the coolest or the quietest GPU around, and custom models will no doubt reach loftier numbers (albeit in much larger packages), but it\u2019s still plenty cool and plenty quiet. Again, no complaints.\nShould you buy the GeForce RTX 4070?\nIt depends on what you want in a graphics card, and what you\u2019re willing to spend on it.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nThe GeForce RTX 4070 delivers exceptional 1440p gaming performance in even the most strenuous games, with best-in-class ray tracing performance if you want to turn those cutting-edge lighting features on. Nvidia\u2019s killer software stack enhances every aspect of the GPU, from creation to streaming to gaming, with features like Nvidia Reflex, Broadcast, RTX Video Super Resolution, and DLSS 3 Frame Generation truly improving your day-to-day experience. If you found yourself nodding along to our defense of the 4070 Ti by a 1440p gamer, you\u2019re the prime audience for the $200-cheaper RTX 4070.\nThe RTX 4070 also supports AV1 encoding, unlike previous-gen GPUs, while its incredible power efficiency let Nvidia make its Founders Edition model nice and tiny. It\u2019ll fit into most any system. \u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s not a slam dunk though. Nvidia\u2019s decision to equip the RTX 4070 with a 192-bit bus and 12GB of memory prevent us from being able to recommend it for long-term 4K gaming, especially with memory requirements only rising in modern games. (We applaud the bump in memory from 8GB to 12GB, but $600 graphics cards really should have 16GB or more in 2023.)\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA rival with more vram and 4k gaming capabilities\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nRadeon RX 6800 XT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want a 4K graphics card around this price range, complete with more memory, consider AMD\u2019s last-generation Radeon RX 6800 XT or 6900 XT instead (or the 6850 XT and 6950 XT variants). Both come with 16GB of VRAM, wide memory buses, and run as fast or faster than the RTX 4070, especially at 4K resolution. Radeon GPUs also excel at esports frame rates. The 6950 XT can be found for as little as $650 these days, while the 6800 XT can be found around $570. Alternatively, the new Radeon RX 7900 XT is a potential consideration at $850. You give up AV1 encoding, DLSS, and Nvidia\u2019s excellent ray tracing chops and extra features, however. Avoid the $800 4070 Ti for 4K gaming.\nYou\u2019re giving up something with either side these days. It remains a fairly bleak time for $500-plus graphics cards.\n\n\n\n\nThe RTX 4070 is smol.Brad Chacos/IDG\nAs I said right up top, the $599 GeForce RTX 4070 is the only current Nvidia 40-series graphics card potentially worth your money aside from the flagship RTX 4090. That\u2019s because Nvidia didn\u2019t jack its price as painfully as the $800 RTX 4070 Ti and $1,200 RTX 4080, not because it\u2019s a good value. The $599 RTX 4070 is $100 more than its predecessor, and $100 less than the RTX 3080. In most games, the RTX 3080 trades blow or is a handful of frames faster than the RTX 4070. Sure, the RTX 4070\u2019s power efficiency and DLSS 3 Frame Gen features are deeply impressive indeed, but in raw gaming performance, Nvidia\u2019s 40-series continues to offer stagnant gen-on-gen value, 2.5 years after the 30-series launched. Not every game will support features like DLSS or FSR.\n\n\nBuy the GeForce RTX 4070 if you want a reasonably sized, highly efficient 1440p gaming beast, complete with access to all the latest and greatest Nvidia software features\u2014and if you\u2019re willing to spend $600 on a graphics card like that. Avoid it for long-term 4K usage, and comparison shop before you buy as last-gen graphics cards may offer better value. Here\u2019s where you can buy the RTX 4070 if you\u2019re interested.\nEditor\u2019s note: This review first published on April 12, but was updated April 13 to include information on where you can buy the graphics card.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBest Prices Today: GeForce RTX 4070\t\t\n\n\n\n\nRetailer\n\n\nPrice\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct\n\n\nPrice\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from Backmarket\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Brad Chacos, Executive Editor, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos spends his days digging through desktop PCs and tweeting too much.

Qualcomm and SiMa.ai win in Edge Data Center and Embedded Edge respectively, while Neuchips wins in data center recommendations for power. \n\nBig News! There is a potential solution on the horizon to vastly broaden the field of benchmark submission we cover at the end: the Collective Knowledge Playground. \n\nOk, this story is long but I think its worth telling. Stay with me. Lots to unpack. so thanks for reading!\n\n\nOnce every 6 months, MLCommons releases another round of benchmarks for AI inference processing, the job of running neural networks in production. And once again no one is able to best NVIDIA on a head-to-head performance basis. NVIDIA and its partners ran and submitted benchmarks across the entire suite of MLPerf 3.0: image classification, object detection, recommendation, speech recognition, NLP (large language models), and 3D segmentation. NVIDIA is quick to point out that many customers need a versatile AI platform, although that is primarily true in a data center setting. Many edge AI apps only use one or two AI models such as image classification or detection. More on. that later.\nI love this slide as it shows the broad spectrum of companies participating in the community effort ... [+] to  define and run AI benchmarks, as well as provide training data sets and best practices across the community.MLCommons\n\nNew to this round of MLPerf are SiMa.ai and Neuchips for edge image classification and data center recommendation, respectively.Six new companies submitted benchmark runs, notably SiMa.ai and Neuchips.  Over 5300 results were ... [+] submitted, with 2400 power results.MLCommons\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\nWhat about ChatGPT?\nWhile there are currently no benchmarks for (very) large language models such as GPT or Google LaMDA, MLCommons executive director David Kanter said the community is working on a new benchmark that will test inference, and presumably training, performance and power consumption of 100B-parameter-class models that have recently created the i-Phone moment for AI. While that implies a six month wait, the current BERT benchmark is still very useful to assess platforms for the smaller large language models that are typically extracted from models such as GPT-3. And NVIDIA H100 brandishes a Transformer Engine which dominated BERT in these the MLPerf 3.0 benchmarks.\n\nThe Performance Game\nNVIDIA and others ran the benchmarks on the latest from NVIDIA: the H100, the L4, and the Jetson AGX Orin. Missing is the H100 NVL announced 2 weeks ago at GTC; just didn\u2019t get it ready in time. But it should shine for large model inference like ChatGPT!\nThe three platforms NVIDIA tested cover the broad range of inference systems the company provides. NVIDIA\n\n\nAs usual, NVIDIA ran all the MLPerf benchmarks, including the new networked models that feed the model data to the servers over a network instead of having the parameters already loaded into the system. The NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs delivered the highest performance in every test of AI inference. Thanks to software optimizations, the GPUs delivered up to 54% performance gains from their debut in September. Remember that NVIDIA has more software than hardware engineers for a reason.NVIDIA H100 performance increased dramatically since its first showing 6 months ago, as much as 4X ... [+] for BERT, the current best approximation for ChatGPT.NVIDIA\nThe new NVIDIA L4 Tensor Core GPUs made their debut in the MLPerf tests at over 3x the speed of prior-generation T4 GPUs. Again, updated software plays a large role in performance gains over time. Available in a PCIe low-profile form factor, these accelerators ran all MLPerf workloads, consistent with NVIDIA\u2019s belief that customers want a versatile and flexible AI platform. These GPUs support the FP8 format, which is essential to get the best performance on the BERT NLP model.The new L4 inference results are over 2-3 times faster than the T4 from NVIDIA.  Once again, NVIDIA ... [+] ran all the benchmarks, and didn't just pick one.NVIDIA\n\nAnd in the edge market where performance matters, NVIDIA is again the leader. The NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin system-on-module delivered gained up to 63% in energy efficiency and 81% in performance compared with its results a year ago. Jetson AGX Orin supplies inference when AI is needed in confined spaces at low power levels, including on systems powered by batteries.Jetson, NVIDIA's AI platform for Edge computing showed dramatic increases in performance over the ... [+] last year, and 20% to over 50% increase in power efficiency.NVIDIA\nUsing AI to improve AI models\nOne company that surprised me this round is the Israeli startup Deci, which provides ML optimization services to companies like Adobe and others. What they do is somewhat akin to what EDA leader Synopsys does to improve chip designs; they apply AI to optimize an AI model given the model, the data, and the target runtime chip. Deci delivered the best natural language processing (NLP) throughput efficiency, outperforming other MLPerf submitters within the BERT 99.9 category on NVIDIA A30, A100 & H100 GPUs. In fact,. Deci\u2019s throughput on A100 outperforms other results on the NVIDIA H100 GPU by 1.7x. This means that ML teams can save approximately 68% of their inference costs while also improving the speed and accuracy of their models.Deci delivered fantastic model optimizations for NVIDIA A100 H100 GPUs and can be applied to ... [+] virtually any hardware architecture.Deci\nThe amazing part of this story is that the optimization process is automatic! And they have the customer list to prove that it actually works, as well as hardware partners including NVIDIA, Intel, AWS, and many system vendors such as HPE.\nIn Inference AI, Power Matters\nWhile NVIDIA GPUs delivers industry leading performance, that performance lead comes at a cost besides purchase cost: power consumption. Power matters for inference at the edge, both the edge data center (Qualcomm) and in the embedded edge market, in this case SiMa.ai. Note that these two company\u2019s don\u2019t really compete, in spite of the common \u201cEdge\u201d terminology. \u201cWe\u2019ve never come across Qualcomm at any of our prospective companies,\u201d said Gopal Hegde, VP of Products at SiMa.ai.\nLet\u2019s start with Qualcomm. The company\u2019s Cloud AI100 was submitted for over 25 server platforms with 320 results, all of which are the best in the industry in terms of power efficiency, latency, and throughput in its class. As a testament to the importance of software optimizations over time, Qualcomm has demonstrated a 75% performance and a 52% power efficiency improvement since they began this journey 3 years ago.\nThe 3.0 results include new benchmarks in the open division, including a block pruned BERT Large over a network that delivered 100% accuracy and 2.8x better performance than its closed division submission. The Open Division of MLPerf allow for all types of tricks and changes, so long as the accuracy is reached.Qualcomm is justifiably proud of its accomplishments in power-optimized data center leadership.Qualcomm Technologies Inc.\nFor SiMa.ai, who as we said earlier focuses on embedded edge AI for apps such as smart vision, robotics, manufacturing, drones, or automotive. The goal of AI at the embedded edge is to enable these devices to perform sophisticated data processing and analysis locally, without sending data to a remote server or cloud for processing. This can improve the speed and efficiency of data processing, reduce latency, and enable real-time decision-making.SiMa.ai shared this with us to show the broad range of image processing they handle at 15 watts ... [+] compared to NVIDIA Xavier AGX and Orin.SiMa.ai\nSome examples of AI at the embedded edge include voice assistants that can understand and respond to user commands, sensors that can detect anomalies and trigger alerts, and autonomous vehicles that can recognize and respond to their surroundings in real-time.\nTo reach the power customers demand, one has to design an edge chip from the ground up. Scaling down a data center AI chip just won\u2019t cut it. So SiMa.ai built the MLSoC chip from the ground up as an embedded platform. In the MLPerf 3.0 round, the company bested NVIDIA Jetson power efficiency for image classification by 47%, not bad for a first round. And remember the performance gains I mentioned above for Qualcomm? I\u2019d expect SiMa to continually increase their performance with each release of their TVM back end software.\nConclusion and The Future\nOnce again, NVIDIA wins in performance, but faces increasing competition for power-constrained environments such as the Edge Data Center and the Embedded Edge,, where Qualcomm and SiMa.ai had winning results. NVIDIA has far more software engineers than many of their competitors have employees, and these engineers continue to squeeze more performance out of each generation of chips. Its going to be very difficult for anyone to catch them, especially in the data center and in edge applications requiring flexibility of running many models.\nNotably, Amazon AWS, AMD data center GPUs like the Instinct MI250, Google TPU (which had published great results in the past), Tesla and Intel Gaudi were all no-shows, as were startups Cerebras, Graphcore, Groq and Samba Nova. Its very hard to imagine these companies aren\u2019t interested in showing how well they run the latest models on their latest hardware. Go figure. When I was at IBM Power servers, we had an unwritten rule: don\u2019t publish any benchmark you didn\u2019t win. That worked well then, but in the modern world, not so much.\nSo, how to solve this apparent vendor intransigence? One possibility is to engage the community to run and submit benchmarks, models, and learnings through a new  MLCommons Collective Knowledge challenge to run, reproduce and optimize MLPerf inference v3.0 benchmarks led by cTuning foundation and cKnowledge Ltd.\nGrigori Fursin , the Collective Knowledge Founder, said \u201cThe open-source CK technology has helped to automate, unify and reproduce more than 80% of all submission results including 98% of power results with very diverse technology and benchmark implementations from Neural Magic, Qualcomm, Krai, cKnowledge, cTuning, DELL, HPE, Lenovo, Hugging Face, Nvidia and Apple across diverse CPUs, GPUs and DSPs with PyTorch, ONNX, QAIC, TF/TFLite, TVM and TensorRT using popular cloud providers (GCP, AWS, Azure) and individual servers and edge devices provided by the CK users and contributors.\u201d\nSo if this strategy works out, and as the backends for new chips like TPU, AWS Inferentia, and AMD are completed, we should see an explosion in valid comparisons that will help all users and buyers of AI technology. I am super excited about this development.\nFinally, I can\u2019t wait to see the VLLM benchmark competition when that arrives in six months. Perhaps the massive pile of money now on the table with ChatGPT and the new CK playground and its competitors will enable more companies to be more transparent.

Click the image to view it at full size.\n\nBenchmarks and performance in DCC applications\nAlthough the launch video for the GeForce RTX 4070 focuses on gaming performance, Nvidia has also released a few benchmark results for CG work.\nRendering speed in Omniverse, Nvidia\u2019s real-time design and collaboration platform, is 2.8x that of the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, the equivalently priced previous-generation card.\nIt\u2019s also interesting to see scores for image generation with Stable Diffusion: the first time we\u2019ve seen a generative AI tool used as an official GPU benchmark \u2013 but not, we suspect, the last.\nPricing and release dates\nThe GeForce RTX 4070 is available now with a MSRP of $599.\nRead more about the new GeForce RTX 4070 on Nvidia\u2019s product website\n\n\nRelated Posts\nNvidia unveils new GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 GPUs\nNvidia releases the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti\nNvidia announces four new GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs\nNvidia launches GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Topics\n # Ada Lovelace # AI # AI art # Ampere # arch viz # benchmark # boost clock # cg # clock speed # comparison table # compute performance # consumer GPU # CUDA core # D5 Render # DCC # Deep Learning Super Sampling # DLSS # DLSS 3.0 # FP32 # frame generation # game art # game development # gaming card # gaming GPU # GDDR6X # GeForce RTX # GeForce RTX 40 Series # GeForce RTX 4070 # GeForce RTX 4070 Ti # GeForce RTX 4080 # GeForce RTX 4090 # generative AI # GPU # GPU computing # GPU rendering # graphics card # graphics memory # machine learning # NVIDIA # Omniverse # optical flow # Optical Flow Accelerator # performance # power consumption # price # processor speed # ray tracing # release date # render upscaling # RT core # specifications # specs # Stable Diffusion # TDP # Tensor core # vfx # visual effects # visualization \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n5 key features in Blender 4.4\nCheck out the key changes in the latest version of the open-source 3D app, including important updates to animation and the CPU compositor.\nTuesday, March 18th, 2025\n\n\n\n\nSketchsoft releases Feather 1.1\nPromising 3D sketching app for iPad gets time-saving new workflows for Apple Pencil users, including support for haptic feedback.\nTuesday, March 18th, 2025\n\n\n\n\nGIMP 3.0 is out after seven years in development\nLong-awaited update to the open-source image editor adds non-destructive layer effects and better interoperability with Photoshop.\nTuesday, March 18th, 2025\n\n\n\n\nAdobe releases Substance 3D Modeler 1.21\nCheck out the new export features in the VR modeling software.

In both, cutting-edge features have been employed to heighten immersion, increase image quality, reduce system latency, and accelerate performance.\nWe\u2019re delighted to present a preview of next generation rendering with the release of the technology preview of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, which upgrades the game with full ray tracing, otherwise known as path tracing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe technology preview of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode launches today, taking lighting, shadowing and reflections to the next level. To learn more, we spoke to Jakub Knapik, Vice President and Global Art Director at CD PROJEKT RED.\nSince release, Cyberpunk 2077 has included the most advanced technology and features around, including multiple ray tracing technologies, NVIDIA Reflex, and NVIDIA DLSS 2. On April 11th, you\u2019re unveiling Full Ray Tracing with the technology preview of Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode. What does this add for enthusiast gamers who play with graphics cranked up for the highest level of immersion and image quality?\nA: With Cyberpunk 2077 and its Ray Tracing implementation, we always strived to create the most immersive and believable open-world experience. It was our goal from day one, and our cooperation with NVIDIA allowed us to push the boundaries of what was possible with the technology back then. But we didn\u2019t just stop there.\nAfter the game\u2019s release, we started working on something that would push the experience to a new level. With Ray Tracing: Overdrive, aka Path Tracing, we fundamentally revamped the whole rendering and lighting pipeline with an approach that up until now was mainly known for its inclusion as part of visual effects in films and animations.\nWith Path Tracing, we allow all our lights in the game, sometimes hundreds or more sources of it, to provide pixel-perfect illumination and shadows across the whole visible world. We don\u2019t reduce ourselves to a carefully selected group of lights that we can use, but we set ourselves totally wild and free.\nThanks to this approach, players get very organic looking and visually mesmerizing world representation with beautiful gradients and realism. I am aware that every few years someone goes and says that now lighting in games is more realistic, but I do feel that with Path Tracing we are really getting super close to giving players a totally cinematic experience, without having to hold back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX Direct Illumination (RTXDI) is used to transform lighting, most noticeably in Night City. What has the freely-available SDK enabled you to achieve?\nA: Night City is a super vibrant and complex cyberpunk megalopolis. It is full of light sources like lamps (both on the streets and above), spotlights, car lights, neons, screens, billboards, and more. There are moments in the game when the scene is full of light sources!\nTraditionally, we had to carefully pick how many lights would cast shadows. It is a very well-known limitation of every real time rendering engine, and we were no different with our REDengine. So imagine that you see a busy street passage with plenty of merchant stalls, vending machines, lamps, and whatnot, but only a few of the lights on screen can cast shadows.\nAll other light sources just light through walls, objects, or characters, leading to potentially odd-looking and very disconnected lighting. RTXDI allows us to cast shadows from every possible light source on screen, be it a hundred or even more, with practically no limitations. It fundamentally changes the Direct Illumination realism and makes the whole world so much more grounded, deep, and dimensional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull ray tracing helps with grounding objects within their surroundings, like the car above. Click here to view the comparison in 4K\nAlong with artificial lights, the technology preview of Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode transforms natural lighting from the sun and moon. How does this differ from the existing ray-traced Global Illumination technology, and what software is used?\nA: With the iteration of REDengine used for Cyberpunk 2077, we relied on a hybrid indirect illumination technique, one that would allow us to provide Global Illumination across all target platforms. To do that, we used a GI Probes-based system that provided a dynamic solution for all the lights in the game within a certain distance from the camera and within a fixed world space resolution that was manually set per location depending on the needs, in most cases between 1.5m to 4m.\nThis solution provides indirect diffuse to the geometry in the game. With Ray Tracing: Ultra and Ray Tracing: Psycho settings we also provide a significantly more precise, but somewhat delicate indirect diffuse response for sunlight. With the new Ray Tracing: Overdrive, we decided to go all the way, as Path Tracing provides us with the most accurate solution we could wish for.\u00a0\nThanks to this we are totally free, no longer constrained by a fixed world space grid of probes and a rather small resolution of the system, and can provide a super detailed, pixel perfect, incredibly realistic indirect illumination. What\u2019s more, we no longer provide just indirect diffuse, but also indirect specular response. As a result, light has so much more directionality and makes the visible world deeper and simply more beautiful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sunlight bounces off the floor to indirectly light a cardboard stack for more realistic lighting and occlusion.

What improvements will gamers experience?\nA: With Ray Tracing: Overdrive, we can finally experience fully balanced light transition through the game. Light rays bounce through the world, providing both illumination and reflections. To strike a balance between performance and quality, we decided that two ray bounces will provide a sweet spot in that regard. This means that when we look in a mirror, we see a reflective surface that still reflects the world properly.\nPreviously we could only hope for one bounce. As a result, some rooms or surfaces looked somewhat darker, as a single light ray was not enough to provide proper information about the world, thus missing that one part of the puzzle. For players, Ray Tracing: Overdrive means that even very glossy interiors or super complex rooms will look very natural and sophisticated, providing a very immersive experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull ray tracing helps to balance the diffuse and specular response of materials to the light, resulting in even more realistic reflections. Click here to view the comparison in 4K\nWhat was your first thought when you turned DLSS 3 on in Cyberpunk 2077?\nA: I remember when we were introduced to the idea behind DLSS 3 months before we could actually test it, and it already sounded quite amazing, actually. When you run it, it does feel quite surreal to be able to make a game run almost twice as fast with the flip of a switch. In all honesty, it does at times feel like real-life magic. It does look like a super smart solution to a problem that the industry was looking to solve for years.\nDid the existence of DLSS 3 make the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode a reality?\nA: When working on Ray Tracing: Overdrive, I did often see changes in the performance based on the state of development we were currently in, but it was always rather certain that this is the technology of the future and will require super powerful hardware for the best performance.\nRay Tracing: Overdrive actually started as a solution for Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Photo Mode; that was the initial idea I had. This changed when NVIDIA\u2019s team shared plans for their future technology, which looked like it could really make it possible to play at that quality in real time. I was blown away by the possibility and we instantly moved our efforts towards that direction. DLSS 3 was a key element in making it possible.\u00a0\nConcurrently with the integration of DLSS 3, you also brought NVIDIA Reflex to Cyberpunk 2077, for all gamers dating back to those using GeForce GTX 900 Series GPUs. What did the integration process entail, and what quantifiable benefits does Reflex deliver for Cyberpunk 2077 players?\nA: Reflex is a solution that plays really well with DLSS 3, because it focuses on minimizing the input lag in the game. In action-heavy moments, you need the game to respond as swiftly as possible, especially with the high frame rates provided by DLSS 3.\nThe integration process went smoothly. Through our close collaboration with NVIDIA engineers, we were able to quickly identify the places to integrate parts of Reflex that measure particular frame parts and optimize those in terms of capturing input.\nAs a player, you will mostly see the benefits in places where accuracy and responsiveness are crucial, so situations like driving through dense parts of Night City at high speeds or taking part in challenging shootouts as you are progressing through the story.\nDoes DLSS 3\u2019s proven Frame Generation technology influence your plans for future games, making you more ambitious, increasing detail and immersion because you know a large number of gamers will be able to view and appreciate your worlds at launch? Is Frame Generation the future?\nA: Absolutely, this technology allows us to target a quality level that is higher than ever before. It adds that extra level of headroom for us when thinking of the game\u2019s graphical settings, but also some creative decisions in the future.\nWith fully ray traced game graphics now approaching and sometimes surpassing the quality of CG in some television shows, what in your opinion is the next development challenge to surmont?\nA: I do feel the next step lies in AI integration that goes beyond the development phase of projects. It is a new and very much uncharted world that we\u2019re getting to and it is up to us to find a way to marry the heart and soul of developers and the near limitless muscle power that this new technology provides. But AI can also dramatically change the way the game world interacts with the player, and it\u2019ll be extremely interesting to see that area grow and evolve in the future.\nThanks so much for your time. Before we sign off, is there anything else you would like to add about Cyberpunk 2077 or its technology?\nA: I would like to share that I am super excited about Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Ray Tracing: Overdrive mode that we\u2019re releasing to players very soon now. I really do hope they will share our passion for this technology, even if it is just a glimpse into the future. There always needs to be that first step that many will question, but one that needs to happen before change arrives. We worked super hard, both CD PROJEKT RED and NVIDIA, to make this new graphical mode a reality, and give players something very special \u2014 like we always aim to do with our games.\n---------------\nThe technology preview of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode is out today on all PC store fronts where Cyberpunk 2077 is sold.

The Verge\u2019s James Vincent once called one such model an \u201cemotionally manipulative liar,\u201d which pretty much sums up the current state of things.\nThe companies behind these models say that they\u2019re taking steps to fix the problems, like implementing filters and teams of human moderators to correct issues as they\u2019re flagged. But there\u2019s no one right solution. Even the best models today are susceptible to biases, toxicity and malicious attacks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn pursuit of \u201csafer\u201d text-generating models, Nvidia today released NeMo Guardrails, an open source toolkit aimed at making AI-powered apps more \u201caccurate, appropriate, on topic and secure.\u201d\nJonathan Cohen, the VP of applied research at Nvidia, says the company has been working on Guardrails\u2019 underlying system for \u201cmany years\u201d but just about a year ago realized it was a good fit for models along the lines of GPT-4 and ChatGPT.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been developing toward this release of NeMo Guardrails ever since,\u201d Cohen told TechCrunch via email. \u201cAI model safety tools are critical to deploying models for enterprise use cases.\u201d\nGuardrails includes code, examples and documentation to \u201cadd safety\u201d to AI apps that generate text as well as speech. Nvidia claims that the toolkit is designed to work with most generative language models, allowing developers to create rules using a few lines of code.\nSpecifically, Guardrails can be used to prevent \u2014 or at least attempt to prevent \u2014 models from veering off topic, responding with inaccurate information or toxic language and making connections to \u201cunsafe\u201d external sources. Think keeping a customer service assistant from answering questions about the weather, for instance, or a search engine chatbot from linking to disreputable academic journals.\n\n\u201cUltimately, developers control what is out of bounds for their application with Guardrails,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThey may develop guardrails that are too broad or, conversely, too narrow for their use case.\u201d\nA universal fix for language models\u2019 shortcomings sounds too good to be true, though \u2014 and indeed, it is. While companies like Zapier are using Guardrails to add a layer of safety to their generative models, Nvidia acknowledges that the toolkit isn\u2019t imperfect; it won\u2019t catch everything, in other words.\nCohen also notes that Guardrails works best with models that are \u201csufficiently good at instruction-following,\u201d \u00e0 la ChatGPT, and that use the popular LangChain framework for building AI-powered apps. That disqualifies some of the open source options out there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd \u2014 effectiveness of the tech aside \u2014 it must be emphasized that Nvidia isn\u2019t necessarily releasing Guardrails out of the goodness of its heart. It\u2019s a part of the company\u2019s NeMo framework, which is available through Nvidia\u2019s enterprise AI software suite and its NeMo fully managed cloud service. Any company can implement the open source release of Guardrails, but Nvidia would surely prefer that they pay for the hosted version instead.\nSo while there\u2019s probably no harm in Guardrails, keep in mind that it\u2019s not a silver bullet \u2014 and be wary if Nvidia ever claims otherwise.\n\n\nTopics\n\nAI, AI, Dev, Enterprise, nvidia, open source \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tKyle Wiggers\t\n\n\n\nAI Editor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tKyle Wiggers is TechCrunch\u2019s AI Editor.

The reason for this pushback is said to be due to a slowed-down PC market and economic tensions which have gripped the globe.\nRelated Story Watch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For UnveilingNVIDIA won't be introducing any new GeForce GPUs this year and possibly even the next since they are yet to complete the transition to their brand new Ada Lovelace architecture. The GPU maker is going to unveil its mainstream parts in the coming month and we can expect slight refreshes down the road such as the RTX 4090 Ti and RTX 4080 Ti. The laptop segment can also see a refresh at the CES 2024 show floor.\n\nThe company however is reportedly stuck with lots of inventory and doesn't intend to produce lots of gaming GPUs till the supply starts moving. Recent price hikes on GeForce RTX GPUs per segment have made consumers unwilling to buy the mainstream cards as much as they did the last-gen. The existing stock of older GeForce RTX 30 series GPUs also doesn't make it easy since those cards offer better value and can be found in the used market for way lower prices.\nNVIDIA estimates that it will not enter the 3nm generation until 2025.\nDue to the slowdown of AMD, NVIDIA, which holds the dominant position in the GPU market, is still there. Currently, gaming GPUs use the 5/4nm family, while AI GPUs are 7nm and 5/4nm families. It is estimated that by 2025 Years will enter the 3nm generation.\nMachine Translated DigiTimes\nThis year at GTC 2023, NVIDIA unveiled no new roadmap or plans to introduce a brand-new GPU. The company announced brand new Hopper products and volume production of its 4N powered Data Center chips which are now shipping to supercomputers, HPC customers, and the AI segment too. Considering that there is a healthy demand for Hopper which costs 10-20 times more than the average consumer GPU, the company is most likely going to focus its efforts on producing Hopper and delivering it to customers before moving to a brand-new GPU architecture.\n\nWith that said, NVIDIA's next-gen GPUs are already deep into development. We know that Blackwell is one of the many potential architecture codenames for the next-gen chips. The GPU is likely going to be announced at next year's GTC but won't see production until close to 2024 or even early 2025 which would be similar to Hopper which saw first volume shipments several quarters after its first reveal. According to leaker, Kopite7kimi, Blackwell GPUs may not utilize the 3nm process node and will be a monolithic design.\n\nI'm afraid it won't use 3nm.\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) April 10, 2023\n\nSo there's a possibility that Blackwell could launch on TSMC's 4nm design which will still be an upgrade over the TSMC 4N which is an optimized 5nm node. The generation after Blackwell is possibly going to utilize a 3nm or sub 3nm process from TSMC.\nThe GPU giant and chipmaker are also going to leverage its own AI prowess to develop the next-gen GPU. With the help of Machine Learning, NVIDIA will be capable of making chips \"Better Than Humans\" and along with cuLitho, the same chips will be designed and manufactured 40x faster than traditional designs. NVIDIA is working with ASML and TSMC to help with the adoption of this technology.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n71\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n47\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n41\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nTesla Records Its Best Sales Week Of The Year So Far In China As Bulls Flock To Poke Holes In Mark Rober\u2019s FSD-Denigrating Video\n\n\n\n35\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n34\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Stay up to date with our Where to buy RTX 4070 live tracker so you don't miss a stock drop in your region.The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 is here at long last, and for gamers who've been starved for an upgrade, go ahead and pick this one up. It can do just about everything.It's hard to follow up the RTX 3070, one of the best graphics cards of all time, and in our Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 review, we praised that card for being an outstanding performer at 1080p and 1440p \u2014 which is where the overwhelming number of PC gamers game at \u2014 while also being a much more affordable option over the other two launch cards for Nvidia's Ampere lineup. We especially noted how the RTX 3070 offered comparable performance to the RTX 2080 Ti for half the price.Everything we said about the RTX 3070 applies just as easily to the RTX 4070, only now it doesn't just dabble in 4K; it can competently game at every resolution, making it a graphics card that everybody can fall in love with without spending a fortune.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti review: nearly perfect, but with one major flaw\n\n\n\n\nAMD RX 9070 XT review: delivering exactly what the market needs with stunning performance at an unbeatable price\n\n\n\nA lot has changed since the RTX 3070 launched towards the end of 2020, and unfortunately, not everything changed for the better. Things are more expensive pretty much everywhere you look, and the Nvidia RTX 4070 isn't immune. At $599 (about \u00a3510 / AU$870), the RTX 4070 is fully 20% more expensive than the RTX 3070 was at launch.(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)I'm not happy about this at all, and you shouldn't be either, but all you have to do is look at the scores the RTX 4070 puts up on the board and you'll be as hard pressed as I am to dock it any points for this. It consistently puts out RTX 3080-level performance more or less across the board and even manages to bloddy the nose of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, and while the RTX 3080 beats out the RTX 4070 at native 4K, turn on DLSS and the RTX 3080 simply gets blown out.\u00a0On the other side of the aisle, the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT is Team Red's nearest real competition, and it struggles to justify itself in the presence of the RTX 4070. While the RX 7900 XT solidly outperforms the 4070, it's also 50% more expensive, and the benefits of the RX 7900 XT get quickly drowned out by the power of DLSS, especially in titles with DLSS 3.Moreover, the RTX 4070 makes for a pretty competent creator GPU, offering indie developers and artists who don't have the funding to get themselves an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 a handy option for getting some work done within a more limited budget. It's not going to power a major movie studio or anything, but if you're dabbling in 3D modeling or video editing, this card is great compromise between price and performance.Finally, wrap this all into a package that feels like a downright normal graphics card from ye olden days, back before you needed to include support brackets and balast to keep your gaming PC from tipping over, and you end up with a graphics card that can easily power some of the best gaming PCs that can actually fit into your PC case and your budget.This graphics card has its issues, which is inevitable, but given what's on offer here, it's easy enough to look past its shortcomings and enjoy some truly outstanding performance at at a reasonable enough price.Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 review: Price & availability(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)How much is it? $599 (about \u00a3510 / AU$870)When is it out? April 13, 2023Third-party cards retail prices will match or exceed Nvidia's MSRPThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 is available starting April 13, 2023, with an MSRP of $599 (about \u00a3510 / AU$870). Third-party partners will have their own versions of the RTX 4070 that will vary in price, but they will always have a matching or higher regular retail price than the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Founders Edition.Notably, the RTX 4070 is getting a 20% price increase over the card it's replacing, the RTX 3070, which had a launch price of $499 in the US (about \u00a3425 / AU$725). While we'd have loved to see the price stay the same gen-over-gen, this should come as no surprise to anyone who has been watching GPU price inflation recently.The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080, for example, has a ludicrously high MSRP of $1,199 (a roughly 72% jump over the RTX 3080), while the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 also increased its price over the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 to $1,599 from the 3090's $1,499.Meanwhile, we haven't seen AMD's direct RTX 4070 competitor yet, the AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT, but the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT is the closest AMD has this generation with an $899 / \u00a3799 (around AU$1,350) MSRP, putting it 50% more expensive than the RTX 4070.This card is also the same price as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, for what it's worth, and considering that the RTX 4070 punches well above the 3070 Ti's performance, you do at least get a better sense of value out of this card than anything from the last generation.Today's best Nvidia RTX 4070 deals1 Amazon customer review\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $968View $1,098View No price informationCheck WalmartWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesPrice score: 4 / 5Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 review: Features & chipset(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)DLSS 3 with full Frame GenerationThird-gen Ray Tracing Cores and fourth-gen Tensor CoresLower TGP than RTX 3070Swipe to scroll horizontallyNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 GPU specs ComponentNvidia RTX 4070Nvidia RTX 4070 TiNvidia RTX 3070Price$599 (about \u00a3510 / AU$870)$799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,479$499 (about \u00a3425 / AU$725)GPUAD104AD104GA104Transistor count35.8 billion35.8 billion17.4 billionTGP200W285W220WCUDA Cores5,8887,6805,888RT Cores466046Tensor Cores184240184Base Clock1,920MHz2,310MHz1,500MHzBoost Clock2,475MHz2,610MHz1,725MHzVRAM12GB GDDR6X12GB GDDR6X8GB GDDR6Memory Clock1,313MHz1,313MHz1,750MHzBus Size192-bit192-bit256-bitMemory Bandwidth504.2 GB/s504.2 GB/s448.0 GB/sThe Nvidia RTX 4070 doesn't change too much on paper over its last-gen predecessor, featuring the same number of streaming multiprocessors, therefore the same number of CUDA cores (5,888), ray-tracing cores (46), and tensor cores (184).It does bump up its memory to the faster GDDR6X and adds an additional 50% VRAM for a total of 12GB. With a 192-bit bus and a memory clock of 1,313MHz, the RTX 4070 has an effective memory speed of 21 Gbps, equal to that of the Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti, for a memory bandwidth of 504.2 GB/s.It has a lower base and boost frequency than the 4070 Ti, clocking in at 1,920MHz base and 2,475MHz boost (compared to 2,310MHz base and 2,610MHz boost for the 4070 Ti), but this is a substantial bump up from the 1,500MHz base and 1,725MHz boost frequency of the RTX 3070.This is owing to the 5nm TSMC process used to fab the AD104 GPU, compared to the Samsung 8nm process for the RTX 3070's GA104. Those faster clocks also power next-gen ray tracing and tensor cores, so even though there are the same number of cores in both the RTX 4070 and the RTX 3070, the RTX 4070's are both much faster and more sophisticated.Also factor in Nvidia Lovelace's DLSS 3 with Frame Generation capacity, something that Nvidia Ampere and Turing cards don't have access to, and what looks like two very similar cards on paper turns out to be anything but in practice.Finally, thanks to the 5nm process, Nvidia is able to squeeze more performance out of less power, so the TGP for the RTX 4070 is just 200W, making it a fantastic card for a lower-power, sub-600W build.Features & chipset: 5 / 5Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 review: Design(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)Same size as the RTX 307016-pin power connectorSame design as RTX 4090 and RTX 4080Swipe to scroll horizontallyNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Founders Edition specsHeader Cell - Column 0 Nvidia RTX 4070Nvidia RTX 3070Nvidia RTX 4080SlotsDual-slotDual-slotTriple-slotDimensions (L x W x H)9.5 x 4.4 x 1.5 ins | 242 x 112 x 38 mm9.5 x 4.4 x 1.4 ins | 242 x 112 x 36 mm12 x 5.5 x 2.5 ins  | 310 x 140 x 39 mmWeight2.25 lbs | 1.02 kg2.25 lbs | 1.02 kg4.66 lbs | 2.11 kgPower1 x 16-pin1 x 12-pin1 x 16-pinOutputs3 x DisplayPort 1.4b, 1 x HDMI 2.13 x DisplayPort 1.4b, 1 x HDMI 2.13 x DisplayPort 1.4b, 1 x HDMI 2.1CoolingTwin-fanTwin-fanTwin-fanWith the RTX 4070 Founders Edition, Nvidia finally delivers a next-gen graphics card that can actually fit in your case without requiring a construction winch to hold it in place.OK, the previous cards weren't that bad, and even at the reduced form factor and weight, you'll still want to toss a GPU bracket into your case for good measure (there's no harm in protecting your investment, after all).Image 1 of 6(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)But holding the RTX 4070 in my hand, this is the first card of this generation that doesn't feel like a piece of machinery. Even the more modestly-sized AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX and RX 7900 XT feel substantial, while the RTX 4070 feels like an old school GeForce graphics card from a couple years back.The RTX 4070 Founders Edition keeps the same fan design as the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 that preceeded it (a fan on the front and back), but it shrinks everything down to a dual-slot card about two-thirds the size of those monsters. The RTX 4070 also features the same outputs as previous RTX Lovelace cards (so no USB-C out), and a 16-pin power connector with an included adapter for two 8-pin leads to power the card.With a TGP of 200W, Nvidia could theoretically have just gone with a single 8-pin connector, but Team Green seems absolutely committed to the 12VHPWR cable, it seems. I'll never stop complaining about this, but it is what it is. If you have an ATX 3.0 power supply, you won't need to worry about that, but the rest of us will have to deal with additional cable management.Design score: 4.5 / 5Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 review: Performance(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)Phenomenal gaming performanceCan easily push 60 fps in 4K gaming with DLSSRTX 3080 performance at 60% of the powerRight out the gate, let's just say that the Nvidia RTX 4070 is the best 1440p graphics card on the market right now, and it's likely to remain at the top of that list for a good long while.Its performance prowess isn't limited to just 1440p, mind you, and when I get into the gaming performance, you'll see that its 4K gaming potential is exciting (with caveats), but for starters, we can dig into its synthetic performance in tests like 3DMark to see how the fundamentals stack up.General PerformanceSwipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 3DMark Firestrike3DMark Nightraid3DMark SpeedwayRTX 4070 Ti54,882184,1835,457RX 7900 XT67,645211,9165,182RTX 3080 Ti48,057178,8835,249RTX 308044,619179,0244,594RTX 407044,288179,5574,454RTX 3070 Ti37,217163,1203,728RTX 307034,696154,1773,409Swipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 3DMark Port Royal3DMark Time Spy3DMark Firestrike ExtremeRTX 4070 Ti14,25623,01827,223RX 7900 XT14,04726,26034,356RTX 3080 Ti12,92719,21523,576RTX 308011,58317,63821,659RTX 407011,15417,77821,482RTX 3070 Ti8,75414,68718,308RTX 30708,26913,49616,844Swipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 3DMark Time Spy Extreme3DMark Firestrike Ultra3DMark Wildlife ExtremeRTX 4070 Ti11,09113,56846,251RX 7900 XT12,81117,37045,772RTX 3080 Ti23,5769,78912,148RTX 30808,78011,00538,073RTX 40708,54110,03736,008RTX 3070 Ti7,2549,28631,230RTX 30706,6328,60528,322Swipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 3DMark Wildlife Extreme UnlimitedPassmark 3D DirectXAverage PerformanceRTX 4070 Ti45,99140,61042,411RX 7900 XT47,50033,32846,926RTX 3080 Ti41,02736,62839,057RTX 308037,24234,95737,197RTX 407035,34334,91336,687RTX 3070 Ti31,11731,60632,391RTX 307028,21731,06330,339As you can see, the RTX 4070 outperforms the RTX 3070 by about 21% overall, while underperforming the RTX 3080 by about 1.37%, which is close enough to effectively tie the last-gen 4K powerhouse, and underperforms the RTX 3080 Ti by about 6%. Considering that the RTX 3080 Ti's MSRP is nearly twice that of the RTX 4070, this is an astounding result.\u00a0The RTX 4070 does lag behind the RTX 4070 Ti and the RX 7900 XT by quite a bit, averaging about 22% worse performance than the RX 7900 XT and about 13.5% worse performance than the RTX 4070 Ti. These current-gen cards also have substantially better hardware, so this isn't unexpected.Creative PerformanceWhen it comes to creative performance, well, we have a more limited dataset to work with since Blender Benchmark 3.5.0 decided it only wanted to test half the cards I tried to run it on (including failing to run on the RTX 4070), so we'll have to come back to that one at a later date once the benchmark is updated.In the meantime, the tests I was able to run really showcased how well the RTX 4070 can handle creative workloads. On Adobe Premiere and Adobe Photoshop, the RTX 4070 performed noticeably better than the RTX 3080 across both apps and fell in very close behind the RTX 4070 Ti for an overall second place finish.Swipe to scroll horizontallyPugetBench for Adobe Suite PerformanceHeader Cell - Column 0 Adobe PremiereAdobe PhotoshopRTX 4070 Ti1,2781,533RX 7900 XT1,1091,519RTX 3080 Ti1,1821,467RTX 30801,1631,486RTX 40701,2101,521RTX 3070 Ti1,0541,486RTX 30701,1131,486In lieu of Blender's Benchmark, V-Ray 5 is a fairly good stand-in, as well as an excellent benchmark in its own right.

Still, 170 frames per second encoding from 4K to 1080p is not bad at all.Overall then, the RTX 4070 puts in a solid creative performance, besting the RTX 3080, the RX 7900 XT, the RTX 3070 Ti, and the RTX 3070, while barely losing out to the RTX 3080 Ti.Swipe to scroll horizontallyAverage Creative PerformanceRTX 4070 Ti1,939RX 7900 XT1,393RTX 3080 Ti1,699RTX 30801,551RTX 40701,587RTX 3070 Ti1,311RTX 30701,251Gaming Performance(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)As good of a creative card as the RTX 4070 is, in its bones, this is a gamers' graphics card, so gaming performance is definitely where I spent most of my time testing the RTX 4070.

Turn ray tracing to the max and your get an average fps of 34 with a floor of 25, which is just better than a slideshow.\u00a0The RTX 3080 doesn't fare too much better on this metric, managing 40 fps on average with a floor of 29 fps at max settings with ray tacing turned on, while the RTX 3080 Ti averages about 36 fps and a floor of 19 fps. This does put the RTX 4070 just behind the 3080 Ti in terms of average fps and with a higher fps floor than the 3080 Ti.If you're dead set on ray tracing, the RTX 4070 can certainly deliver, thanks to DLSS, which can bump those numbers back up to 79 fps on average with a floor of 55 fps. Compare that to the RTX 3080's 80 fps average with a 58 fps floor in our tests and the RTX 4070 can definitely go toe to toe with the RTX 3080 when ray tracing on max settings if DLSS is on.\u00a0In addition, the RTX 4070 gets about 10% less fps on average than the RTX 3080 Ti at 4K with ray tracing and DLSS on, (79 fps to the 3080 Ti's 88 fps), and a roughly 14% lower fps floor than the RTX 3080 Ti (55 fps to the 3080 Ti's 64 fps).\u00a0Swipe to scroll horizontallyCyberpunk 2077 (No RT, No DLSS)Header Cell - Column 0 1080p1440p2160pRTX 4070 Ti111 (90 min)66 (51 min)29 (21 min)RX 7900 XT128 (53 min)79 (58 min)34 (27 min)RTX 3080 Ti104 (83 min)63 (50 min)29 (22 min)RTX 308094 (76 min)57 (45 min)26 (20 min)RTX 407085 (69 min)48 (37 min)19 (15 min)RTX 307073 (60 min)44 (37 min)19 (15 min)Swipe to scroll horizontallyCyberpunk 2077 (Psycho RT, No DLSS)Header Cell - Column 0 1080p1440p2160pRTX 4070 Ti74 (56 min)47 (35 min)19 (14 min)RX 7900 XT49 (37 min)31 (24 min)15 (11 min)RTX 3080 Ti63 (49 min)41 (30 min)18 (11 min)RTX 308058 (45 min)37 (27 min)15 (8 min)RTX 407057 (44 min)35 (27 min)15 (8 min)RTX 307041 (14 min)25 (11 min)4 (2 min)Swipe to scroll horizontallyCyberpunk 2077 (2160p, Psycho RT, DLSS 2 / FSR 2.1)Header Cell - Column 0 QualityUltra PerformanceRTX 4070 Ti43 (33 min)100 (82 min)RX 7900 XT28 (22 min)69 (54 min)RTX 3080 Ti38 (29 min)83 (68 min)RTX 308034 (25 min)74 (60 min)RTX 407032 (26 min)76 (62 min)RTX 3070 Ti18 (11 min)54 (19 min)RTX 307023 (13 min)52 (12 min)Swipe to scroll horizontallyCyberpunk 2077 (2160p, Psycho RT, DLSS 3 w/ FG)Header Cell - Column 0 QualityUltra PerformanceRTX 4070 Ti60 (17 min)127 (84 min)RTX 407058 (15 min)99 (62 min)Overall, the RTX 4070 manages an average 57 fps at 4K, with a floor of 41 fps, across all the settings I tested. This is about 28% lower than the RTX 4070 Ti (79 fps average, overall), about 10% lower than the RTX 3080 (63 fps average, overall), the RX 7900 XT (64 fps average, overall), and the RTX 3080 Ti (64 fps average, overall).These numbers skew a bit against the RTX 4070, since the RTX 4070 Ti, RX 7900 XT, RTX 3080, and RTX 3080 Ti all handle native 4K gaming much better, but so few people play at native 4K anymore that is a fairly meaningless advantage.\u00a0Meanwhile, the RTX 4070 actually beats the RX 7900 XT by about 20% when using DLSS (versus the RX 7900 XT's FSR) at 4K with max settings and ray tracing; 79 fps on average to 66 fps on average, respectively. It also manages to strike a dead heat with the RTX 3080 (80 fps average) and come just 10% short of the RTX 3080 Ti's average RT performance at 4K with ray tracing.\u00a0It's important to note as well that these don't factor in DLSS 3 Frame Generation, to make it a fair comparison.As for the RTX 3070, the RTX 4070 manages about 39% better average 4K performance, with a 53% higher fps floor (57 fps average with a 43 fps floor for the RTX 4070 compared to the RTX 3070's 41 fps average and 28 fps floor).Swipe to scroll horizontallyReturnal (No RT, No DLSS)Header Cell - Column 0 1080p1440p2160pRTX 4070 Ti167 (79 min)124 (70 min)74 (45 min)RX 7900 XT152 (71 min)128 (78 min)74 (36 min)RTX 3080 Ti136 (65 min)109 (68 min)69 (47 min)RTX 3080128 (65 min)100 (48 min)63 (41 min)RTX 4070131 (76 min)101 (65 min)59 (39 min)RTX 3070103 (62 min)78 (39 min)42 (12 min)Swipe to scroll horizontallyReturnal (Epic RT, No DLSS)Header Cell - Column 0 1080p1440p2160pRTX 4070 Ti136 (87 min)99 (47 min)55 (36 min)RX 7900 XT102 (60 min)78 (55 min)45 (31 min)RTX 3080 Ti113 ( 87 min)85 (45 min)50 (31 min)RTX 3080104 (53 min)78 (43 min)45 (27 min)RTX 4070109 (63 min)76 (54 min)52 (30 min)RTX 307080 (45 min)55 (16 min)12 (4 min)Swipe to scroll horizontallyReturnal (2160p, Epic RT, DLSS / FSR)Header Cell - Column 0 QualityUltra PerformanceRTX 4070 Ti84 (57 min)138 (75 min)RX 7900 XT63 (42 min)102 (53 min)RTX 3080 Ti74 (46 min)120 (77 min)RTX 308069 (47 min)110 (64 min)RTX 407065 (43 min)113 (75 min)RTX 307022 (8 min)85 (49 min)When it comes to 1440p gaming, the RTX 4070 is on much more solid footing, even if some of the bigger cards definitely perform better in absolute terms. The RTX 4070 underperforms the RTX 3080 by about 8% in non-ray-traced, non-upscaled 1440p gaming, on average (105 fps to the RTX 3080's 115 fps), though they both have a very similar floor around 80-85 fps.\u00a0Meanwhile, the RTX 4070 falls about 12% short of the RTX 3080 Ti's 119 average fps at non-ray-traced, non-DLSS 1440p.Swipe to scroll horizontallyTiny Tina's Wonderland (Badass, No FSR)Header Cell - Column 0 1080p1440p2160pRTX 4070 Ti360 (266 min)258 (194 min)137 (100 min)RX 7900 XT182 (125 min)125 (95 min)66 (55 min)RTX 3080 Ti173 (135 min)125 (100 min)70 (57 min)RTX 3080160 (128 min)114 (92 min)64 (52 min)RTX 4070156 (124 min)107 (91 min)56 (47 min)RTX 3070120 (93 min)77 (61 min)38 (30 min)Both the RTX 4070 Ti and RX 7900 XT kinda clobber the RTX 4070 with roughly 25-29% better performance at non-ray-traced, non-upscaled 1440p gaming, and this carries over into gaming with ray tracing settings maxed out, though the RTX 4070 is still getting north of 60 fps on average (67 fps, to be precise), with a relatively decent floor of 51 fps.The real kicker though is when we turn on DLSS, at which point the RTX 4070 beats out everything but the RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 3080 Ti, including the RX 7900 XT, which it outperforms by about 29% on average (125 fps to 97 fps), with a much higher floor of 88 fps to the RX 7900 XT's 60 fps, a nearly 49% advantage.The RTX 4070 also beats the RTX 3080 here too, with about 5% better performance on average and a 7.5% higher fps floor on average than the RTX 3080. Incredibly, the RTX 4070 is just 3% slower than the RTX 3080 Ti when both are using DLSS at 1440p with max ray tracing.As for the RTX 3070, the RTX 4070 gets about 35% better performance at 1440p with ray tracing and DLSS 2.0 than the card it replaces (125 fps to 93 fps), with a nearly 53% higher fps floor on average (87 fps to the 3070's 57 fps), meaning that where the RTX 3070 is setting the 1440p standard, the RTX 4070 is blowing well past it into territory the RTX 3070 simply cannot go.The story is pretty much the same at 1080p, with there being essentially no difference between the RTX 4070, the RTX 3080, the RTX 3080 Ti, and the RX 7900 XT, with the RTX 3070 languishing about 30% behind and the RTX 4070 Ti off on its own out ahead of everyone else.Swipe to scroll horizontallyAverage Overall PerformanceHeader Cell - Column 0 1080p1440p2160pRTX 4070 Ti173 (123 min)131 (91 min)79 (58 min)RX 7900 XT139 (92 min)106 (74 min)64 (46 min)RTX 3080 Ti136 (95 min)108 (77 min)64 (40 min)RTX 3080138 (96 min)103 (73 min)63 (47 min)RTX 4070136 (93 min)99 (73 min)57 (43 min)RTX 3070108 (75 min)77 (51 min)41 (28 min)There has been a lot of talk about the RTX 4070 ahead of its launch as benchmarks have leaked and people have looked at numbers out of context and downplayed the performance of the RTX 4070 based on one or two tests.

And I haven't even touched on the new features packed into Lovelace that you can't get with the last-gen Nvidia graphics cards.The numbers are what they are, and the RTX 4070's performance is simply outstanding across every resolution in all the ways that matter.Performance score: 5 / 5Should you buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 ?(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)Swipe to scroll horizontallyNvidia GeForce RTX 4070AttributesNotesRatingValueWhile 20% more expensive than the card it replaces, its performance more than justifies its price.4 / 5Features & chipsetTSMC's 5nm process, mature RT and Tensor cores, and 50% more VRAM than the RTX 3070 add up to a hell of a graphics card.5 / 5DesignLike the RTX 4080, but smaller and more manageable, save for the 16-pin power cable that's arguably unnecessary.4.5 / 5PerformanceGreat 4K gaming performance and respectable creative performance as well, all for 200W power draw.5 / 5TotalRow 4 - Cell 1 4.625 / 5Buy it if...You want next-gen performance for less than $600\nThe Nvidia RTX 4070 offers performance on par with the RTX 3080 and even the RTX 3080 Ti for a good deal less.You don't want a massive GPU\nGraphics cards are starting to resemble transformers nowadays (both the autobot and power plant variety), so it's nice to get a graphics card that's just normal-sized.You want next-gen features like DLSS 3\nNvidia's hardware is often on the bleeding edge of the industry, but things like DLSS 3 and Nvidia Reflex are Nvidia's not-so-secret force multiplier here.Don't buy it if...You can get an RTX 3080 cheap\nGenerally, the RTX 4070 is going to outperform the 3080, but if you don't care about the advanced features and can grab the 3080 in a bargain bin, you could save some money.You're looking for Nvidia's next budget card\nThe RTX 4070 is a lot cheaper than the rest of the current-gen graphics card lineups from Nvidia and AMD, but at $600, it's still too expensive to truly be a \"budget\" GPU.Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 review: Also considerSwipe to scroll horizontally Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 TiAMD Radeon RX 7900 XTPrice:$599 (about \u00a3525 / AU$870)$799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1479$899 / \u00a3899 / AU$1,619Boost Clock2,475MHz2,610MHz2,394MHzVRAM12GB GDDR6X12GB GDDR6X20GB GDDR6Memory Bandwidth504.2 GB/s504.2 GB/s800.0 GB/sStreaming Multiprocessors5,8887,6805,376Ray Tracing Cores466084Tensor Cores184240N/AConnector1 x 16-pin1 x 16-pin2 x 8-pinOutputs1 x HDMI 2.1, 3 x DisplayPort 1.4b1 x HDMI 2.1 3 x DisplayPort 1.4a1 x HDMI 2.1a, 2 x DisplayPort 2.1, 1 x USB Type-CIf our Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 review has you considering other options, here are two more graphics cards to consider...AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT\nWhile its bigger sibling gets a lot more attention, don't sleep on the RX 7900 XT. It's one of the best graphics cards AMD has ever produced, and while it's a good bit more expensive than the RTX 4070, it's powerful and future-proofed enough for 8K gaming that you'll be able to get a lot of use out of this card in the long-term.\nRead our full AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT reviewNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti\nThe Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti doesn't have a Founders Edition, so it's going to be more expensive than its $799 MSRP, but the performance on offer here makes this an excellent alternative to the RTX 4070 if you've got some extra cash to spend.\nRead our full Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti reviewHow I tested the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)I spent about 50 hours with the RTX 4070 in totalBesides general benchmarking, I used the card for everyday gaming and creative workMy test bench specsHere is the systems I used to test the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070:CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D\nCPU Cooler: Cougar Poseidon GT 360 AIO Cooler\nDDR5 RAM: 32GB Corsair Dominator Platinum @ 5,200MHz & 32GB G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo @ 5,200MHz\nMotherboard: ASRock X670E Taichi\nSSD: Samsung 980 Pro SSD @ 1TB\nPower Supply: Corsair AX1000 80-Plus Titanium (1000W) Case: Praxis WetbenchWhen I test a graphics card, I start by making sure that all tests are performed on the same test bench setup to isolate GPU performance. I then run it through a series of synthetic benchmarking tools like 3DMark as well as in-game benchmarks in the most recent PC games I can access like Cyberpunk 2077 and F1 2022.\u00a0I run everything on the maximum settings possible without upscaling tech, and I run all tests at the resolution a reader is most likely to use a given card at. In the case of the RTX 4070, this meant testing at 1080p, 1440p, and 2160p.I also make sure to install the latest relevant drivers and rerun tests on any competing graphics card that I might have already reviewed and tested, like the RTX 4070 Ti, RX 7900 XT, and RTX 3080 to make sure that I have the most current scores to account for any driver updates. All of these scores are recorded and compared against the card's predecessor, its most direct rival, and the card directly above and below it in the product stack, if those cards are available.\u00a0I then average these scores to come to a final overall score and divide that by the card's MSRP to see how much performance every dollar or pound spent actually gets you to find how much value the card actually brings to the table.Finally, I actually use the card in my own personal computer for several days, playing games, using apps like Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator, and watching for any anomalies, crashes, glitches, or visual disruptions that may occur during my time with the card. Having extensively covered and tested many graphics cards over the years, I know what a graphics card should do and how it should perform, and can readily identify when something is not performing up to expectations and when it exceeds them.\u00a0Read more about how we testFirst reviewed April 2023\n\n\nJohn LoefflerSocial Links NavigationComponents EditorJohn (He/Him) is the Components Editor here at TechRadar and he is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY.

The GeForce RTX 4070 launches with a heavier price tag than the RTX 3070, and doesn\u2019t make the shin-splintering performance leap forward that its predecessor did, but between its high speeds, low power usage, and DLSS 3 advantage, it\u2019s a potent upgrade regardless.\n\n\n\n\nHow To Install A Graphics Card\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\nI\u2019ve been benchmarking a relatively beefy (but dead quiet) custom model, the MSI GeForce RTX 4070 Gaming X Trio. It\u2019s a ways above the RRP/MSRP, and if you\u2019re lucky with stock you might be able to snatch an RTX 4070 Founders Edition for \u00a3589 / $600.\nMSI GeForce RTX 4070 Gaming X Trio specs:\n\nCUDA Cores: 5888\nBoost clock: 2625MHz\nVRAM: 12GB GDDR6X\nPower: 215W\nRecommended System Power: 650W\nPrice: \u00a3670 / $650 (other RTX 4070 models start at \u00a3589 / $600) \n\nThat\u2019s \u00a3120 / $100 more than the RTX 3070 launched at, which isn\u2019t ideal. But I can\u2019t muster the same horrified shock for this price bump that the RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 induced so effortlessly. For once thing, the RTX 4070 is much cheaper than the last-gen RTX 3080, a card that performs almost identically without DLSS 3 \u2013 and falls well behind with the new upscaler\u2019s frame generation feature switched on. That immediately makes it a better deal than one of the 30 series' heaviest hitters.\nSecond, the RTX 4070 does make improvements beyond FPS counts. Taking advantage of the Ada Lovelace architecture\u2019s efficiency savings, it uses less power than the RTX 3070, with a maximum draw of 200W to the older GPU\u2019s 220W (the RTX 4070 Gaming X Trio can draw up to 215W, but again, that\u2019s less than the most efficient RTX 3070 design.) You also get 12GB of GDDR6X VRAM here, same as on the RTX 4070 Ti and a marked upgrade from the 8GB of GDDR6 on the RTX 3070. While the RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 ask for hundreds of pounds more than their 30 series equivalents, the RTX 4070 at least seems more concerned with maintaining a workable sense of value. Not to mention how much easier it is to simply install this graphics card in a mid-tower case, a real issue with the bulkier cards further up the range.\n\n\n \n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 review: 4K performance\nDespite its heightened price, the RTX 4070 is still a 1440p GPU at heart, just as the RTX 3070 was. Yet the latter could perform reasonably well as a kind of budget 4K card, a quality that carries over to the new model.\nWithout upscaling help from DLSS, or even AMD FSR/Intel XeSS, it\u2019s not going to hit 60fps in every maxed-out game. The RTX 4070 Ti has a better record for this, so remains the smarter pick if you want a 40 series GPU to hook up to your 4K monitor (and that doesn\u2019t cost four figures). Even so, the RTX 4070 ain\u2019t half bad:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nOf course, DLSS is still a great tool to have at such a demanding resolution. With Nvidia\u2019s upscaler running in Quality mode, the sharpest available, 74fps in Horizon Zero Dawn becomes 103fps, and while a combination of Quality DLSS with Ultra-level ray tracing kept Watch Dog Legion averaging 49fps. Shadow of the Tomb Raider gets a particularly enormous boost from DLSS: even after adding Ultra ray tracing, Quality DLSS had it shoot up from 56fps to 87fps.\nThe RPS test PC:\n\nCPU: Intel Core i5-11600K\nRAM: 16GB Corsair Vengeance LPX\nMotherboard: Asus TUF Gaming Z590-Plus WiFi\nPSU: NZXT C1000 Gold\n\nThen there\u2019s DLSS 3. The number of games that support this is, to be sure, quite small. But it\u2019s growing, and the RTX 4070 can make effective use of the AI frame generation feature. Cyberpunk 2077, running at native 4K and with Psycho ray tracing enabled, only averaged 16fps on this GPU: far too low to play. But with DLSS 3 on Performance mode, and with frame generation enabled, the RTX 4070 can run the same settings at 71fps \u2013 a 343% (!) improvement. Not even the RTX 4090 sped up that much. F1 22 could also rise from 43fps at native 4K to 87fps with DLSS 3\u2019s frame generation, and that was with the upscaler\u2019s finer Quality mode.\n\n\n \n\nOn a tactile level, Cyberpunk 2077 admittedly won\u2019t feel like it\u2019s running at 71fps \u2013 aiming and driving will have a more sluggish sensation, as your PC is only treating about half of those frames as 'real' (the rest having been conjured up outside of the usual rendering pipeline). This is also one reason why the RTX 4070 is better suited to 1440p. And yet, even if you\u2019re underwhelmed by how the RTX 3070 is only 10-20fps behind in most of these graphs, DLSS 3 does show how it can help the RTX 4070 to far, far higher levels of visual smoothness.\n\n\n \n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 review: 1440p performance\n1440p very much feels like home for the RTX 4070: it\u2019s guaranteed high framerates on maxed-out game settings, with or without DLSS, and won\u2019t fall victim to CPU bottlenecking nearly as often as at 1080p. Mostly. Depending on the game.\nStill, even in bottleneck-resistant games like Metro Exodus and Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, the RTX 4070 can keep up with the RTX 4070 Ti \u2013 a card that costs hundreds more. And on a gaming monitor with a sufficiently high refresh rate, there\u2019s a clearly visible smoothness upgrade on the RTX 3070 in games like Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Total War: Three Kingdoms, and F1 22.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n(Also, we don\u2019t have enough RTX 3080 results in the books to include it these graphs, but the ones we do have confirm the RTX 4070 usually matches it within 1-3fps. And sometimes the newer card is respectably faster, with the RTX 3080 only managing 94fps in Shadow of the Tomb Raider and 98fps in Horizon Zero Dawn.)\nPlaying at 1440p also lets the RTX 4070 handle top-quality ray tracing without always needing backup from an upscaler. Adding Ultra RT effects to Metro Exodus only saw it drop to 70fps, which still looks super smooth, and although doing to same for Watch Dogs Legion forced it down to 54fps, that\u2019s still fine and playable.\nThrowing in Quality-level DLSS, however, will polish it up to 61fps, and over in Hitman 3, a combination of Quality DLSS and full ray tracing produced 80fps: a far slicker experience than the 53fps it got with un-upscaled RT effects. Yes, DLSS in general remains a strong reason to go with an Nvidia GPU specifically, and once again DLSS 3 can take its framerate improvements to a new level.\n\n\n \nMSI's Gaming X Trio design doesn't make for the most compact RTX 4070, but it is much smaller than their RTX 4070 Ti Suprim X 12G.\n\nCyberpunk 2077\u2019s Psycho ray tracing becomes much easier to handle at 1440p, and thus even without DLSS 3\u2019s frame generation \u2013 only Quality-level upscaling \u2013 the RTX 4070 got it running at a comfortable 62fps. With frame generation, that became 106fps.\nI also tried out Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s brand new Overdrive Mode, which replaces all the individual ray tracing effects with full-on path tracing. This is too much for the RTX 4070 at 4K, but at 1440p, it could run Overdrive Mode with Quality DLSS at a viable 42fps average. With frame generation, that ticks up to 73fps, which looks great and handles well enough (as the PC still thinks it\u2019s running that 42fps average). Path tracing is one of the next big frontiers in game rendering tech, so it\u2019s very encouraging that the RTX 4070 can cope with it this well.\n\n\n \n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 review: 1080p performance\nMost interpretations of current British law would say I can\u2019t come round your house and physically restrain you from buying a \u00a3599 graphics card to use at just 1080p. But I still don\u2019t recommend it. \nSure, 100fps will be a gentle stroll for the RTX 4070 in most games, but unless you\u2019ve also gone overboard for Full HD by buying a high-end gaming CPU, it\u2019s going to get bottlenecked. Our test PC has a Core i5-11600K, a very capable chip that\u2019s not even three years old, and with it the RTX 4070 is still limited to the point where the RTX 3070 can catch up:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nThere\u2019s still an advantage for the Ada Lovelace hardware when ray tracing is involved \u2013 with it on max, Metro Exodus averaged 92fps on the RTX 4070 and 79fps on the RTX 3070 \u2013 but the DLSS 3 benefit becomes questionable. Unlike at higher resolutions, deploying even the best-quality upscaling at 1080p will make the overall image look soft and blurry. And it\u2019s not like you\u2019d need the extra AI-generated frames anyway.\n\n\n \n\nAt 1440p, on the other hand, the RTX 4070 shines. Besides making the RTX 3080 effectively obsolete, it offers a decent upgrade on the RTX 3070 that becomes a gigantic one when playing with ray tracing and DLSS 3. That it does so while cutting the amount of electricity it drinks is a very pleasant surprise as well.\nIf, though, you can\u2019t stomach paying this much for a Quad HD setup, it might be worth waiting to see if and when Nvidia come up with an RTX 4060 (or RTX 4060 Ti). Historically, Nvidia\u2019s XX60 GPUs have typically been able to have a fair crack at 1440p, even if they tend to be aimed more towards superfast 1080p. Here\u2019s hoping any they, and any other future RTX 40 series cards, take their cues from the RTX 4070: more power, smarter tech, better efficiency.\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n          \n\n\n\n            Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n          \n\n\n\n            In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nJames Archer: James had previously hung around beneath the RPS treehouse as a freelancer, before being told to drop the pine cones and climb up to become hardware editor.

Here's a closer look at the artificial intelligence hardware roadmaps for Intel. AMD and NVIDIA.David ChernicoffNVIDIA The Grace Hopper Superchip combines the Grace ARM CPU architecture with the Nvidia Hopper 9th generation data center GPU.      It\u2019s fair to say that AI is changing the perspective of  CPU/GPU manufacturers. While the ongoing performance race in the x86 space  continues, it has been shaped by the focus on sustainability and energy  efficiency, leading Intel and AMD to release versions of their CPU chipsets  that are optimized to meet those needs, as well as the traditional \u201cwe\u2019re the  fastest at workload X\u201d approach.The GPU market has also seen massive changes over the last  few year. After record sales for Nvidia and AMD GPUs beyond the gamer community  to the cryptocurrency mining market, the bottom fell out of crypto with the  crash in the value of those currencies over the last two years. Demand was so  strong that Intel, who had paid short shrift to dedicated GPUs for years, even  got into cryptocurrency, releasing competitive GPUs pretty much just as the market  for them crashed.But now AI has taken up the slack in the GPU space, given the  ability of GPUs to handle Machine Learning / AI workloads with greater aplomb  than most CPU technologies, though CPUs are still handling significant amounts  of the AI development and processing. GPUs have become\u00a0 the preferred.processor for machine learning tasks because of the way that they work. While CPUs can perform exceedingly fast sequential operations, GPUs are able to break down complex problems into smaller pieces and process them in parallel.\u00a0 Machine learning, deep learning, and AI inference are usually massively distributed processes that show significant benefit in performance from the capabilities of GPUs when compared to CPUs.So where do these traditional players in the market stand?  Let\u2019s take a look.IntelEarlier this year Intel formally announced availability of  the fourth-generation Xeon Scalable server CPUs based on their 7nm process.  With up to 60 cores and 8-socket configurations the CPU fully supports the  Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX), the extensions to the x86 instruction set  from Intel and AMD that are specifically designed to accelerate machine  learning and AI related workloads. At the product announcement, Intel claimed  that in company testing the new CPUs achieved up to 10 times higher PyTorch  performance for real-time inference and training using the AMX BF16 processing  when compared to the previous generation testing using FP32. The CPU also  includes up to four different integrated IP accelerators, depending on model.  These accelerators include:Intel Quick Assist Technology (QAT)Intel Dynamic Load Balancer (DLB)Intel In-Memory Analytics Accelerator (IAA)Intel Data Streaming Accelerator (DSA)Additionally, AI technology startup Deci claims that in conjunction with their  proprietary Automated Neural Architecture Construction technology they were  able to deliver comparable performance to GPU-based systems in natural language  processing (NLP)\u00a0 models and computer  vision using these latest generation Xeon hardware.Directly in the GPU market, Intel has announced \u00a0the Xe2 HPG (high performance graphics) GPU for  the discrete GPU market. This a difficult market to design products for, with a  range of products and technologies ranging from the low performance space, to  data center specific, to gaming. Tom Petersen of Intel said in an interview  with HardwareLuxxx \u201cbecause you\u2019re getting into the datacenter, external  desktop, and integrated graphics business; they all have different ways to  optimize.\u201d The Intel discrete GPU products\u00a0  are marketed under the name Intel  Arc.In 2022, Intel launched its second generation of the Habana  Deep Learning processor, the Gaudi2 processor for deep learning, moving the  technology to their 7nm process, tripling the number of cores and memory  looking to compete directly with the Nvidia A100 80G on computer vison and NLP  models. Intel acquired Habana in 2019 to boost its offerings for AI.\u00a0AMDAMD is in an interesting position. It has announced that  they will be integrating AI hardware into its x86 CPUs, the AMD Ryzen AI  engine, which will make its first appearance on the Ryzen 7040 Series mobile  processors, which should be shipping now. AMD's most recent refresh of its top-of-the-line data center CPU, the fourth-generation Epyc, does have up to 96  cores, and supports PCI-E 5.0 and exemplary memory performance, which are important  in the AI space, as well as support for AVX-512Vector neural network instruction  (VNNI), also supported by Intel\u2019s latest, that is designed to accelerate  convolutional neural network loops. No specific announcement has been made yet  regarding integrated AI hardware at this level of processor. But, as with Intel, this level of CPU can be used for AI/ML tasks in the data center.AMD is also introducing AI along its product line, as  evidenced by today\u2019s announcement of the Alveo MA35D media accelerator, a dedicated  video processing unit that is designed to accelerate the entire video  processing pipeline and includes an integrated AI processor that evaluates  content on a frame-by-frame basis to minimize bitrate while improving the  perceived visual quality allow for a higher-performance, more energy-efficient  deployment.Of course, AMD has an established line of high-performance  discrete gaming GPUs, the AMD Radeon RX, that can be repurposed to AI/ML  projects.\u00a0 To encourage this, the AMD GPU  software stack, ROCm, has been evolving to add a focus on the deep learning  critical to AI. With the most recent release ROCm 5.0, AMD is offering a selection of  turnkey frameworks on the AMD Infinity Hub to  speedup development of ML workloads in areas such as life sciences, image and  video, and autonomous driving. ROCm is a direct competitor to Nvidia\u2019s CUDA  toolkit.NvidiaNvidia is the big dog in the AI data center hardware game.  As we pointed  out in March, AI is where Nvidia\u2019s focus now lies and its product  portfolio acknowledges this. Multiple  versions of the Nvidia A100 Tensor Core GPU deliver acceleration at scale for  the enterprise class GPU deployment along with a complete set of supporting CUDA software and the addition of\u00a0 the Nvidia EGX platform and its optimized  software for the enterprise. Entry-and mid-level hardware solutions in the form of servers  built around discrete graphics cards, starting with the RTX 4000 series provide  a selection of price points for hardware investment in building an ML/AI  infrastructure for your business. The range of Nvidia AI hardware runs the  gamut from dipping your toes in the water to complete hybrid cloud enterprises.  Development can be done on desktop, cloud, or in the data center depending upon  the level of investment in hardware if you want on premise and your choice of  cloud provider for off-premise solutions.What might be most interesting for data centers is Nvidia\u2019s  attack on the CPU market to accompany its existing AI hardware GPU focus. Due  for release in the first half of the year, the Grace CPU Superchip has 144  ARM-based cores and 1 TB/s of memory bandwidth and is explicitly designed for  HPC applications that are CPU and memory intensive. The Grace Hopper Superchip, which is due to ship alongside  the Grace Superchip, combines\u00a0the Grace  ARM CPU architecture with the Nvidia Hopper 9th generation data  center GPU. Designed to handle applications that require terabytes of data and  expected to increase the speed of processing these huge data sets and giant  scale AI problems at unprecedented level of performance. It\u2019s a bright and shining futureWhatever choice your business makes in terms of a direction  to follow for your data center AI/ML hardware support, there will be lots of options  available and significant changes in both the ML support and deployed inference  models as we move forward. As Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the 2023 Nvidia  GTC last month \u201cAI has reached it\u2019s iPhone moment\u201d and just taking a look  around your own workspace will show you the impact of that moment on hardware,  software, and the way work is done.\u00a0 About the Author David ChernicoffDavid Chernicoff is an experienced technologist and editorial content creator with the ability to see the connections between technology and business while figuring out how to get the most from both and to explain the needs of business to IT and IT to business.Continue ReadingNVIDIA: New Hardware Will Transform Data Centers into AI FactoriesNVIDIA Unveils Beefed-Up AI Hardware for Data CentersSponsored RecommendationsOptimizing AI Infrastructure: The Critical Role of Liquid CoolingIn this executive brief, we discuss the growing need for liquid cooling in data centers due to the increasing power demands of AI and high-performance computing.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n\n\n\nThe worst-kept secret that is the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 is just around the corner. So, here comes AMD trying to get its punches in first by trash talking the new GPU's VRAM allocation. Not necessarily overtly, but by implication. And graphs.AMD has a new blog post demonstrating how it sees the impact of 12GB of VRAM versus 16GB when gaming at 4K. Needless to say, AMD's published numbers for 12GB look ugly (via Tom's Hardware).Among the GPUs AMD uses to make the comparison are its own RX 6800 XT and Nvidia's RTX 3070 Ti. The former runs 16GB, the latter 12GB. But with the RTX 4070 supposedly days away from launch and every leak under the sun expecting it too to offer 12GB of graphics memory, the timing of this critical salvo from AMD is unlikely to be a coincidence.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nAMD might have told us little about its RDNA 4 graphics cards but at least we know the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT have 16 GB of VRAM\n\n\n\n\nAMD's Frank Azor says no 32 GB RX 9070 XT for you, probably because a 32 GB mid-range GPU didn't make much sense in the first place\n\n\n\nIntriguingly and as is increasingly becoming clear, AMD shows how enabling ray tracing often sees a big jump in VRAM usage. The ironic consequence of that? Enabling what is traditionally a competitive advantage for Nvidia can see VRAM usage exceed 12GB and turn the tables, leading AMD GPUs to out-perform Nvidia GPUs with ray tracing enabled.Just to absolutely hammer home the point, AMD also shows advantageous numbers for its new 20GB RX 7900 XT versus the 12GB RTX 4070 Ti and a few other GPU combos where the AMD board delivers a lot more VRAM for the money.(Image credit: AMD)The joker card in all of this is, of course, upscaling. Running a lower resolution and upscaling reduces VRAM usage and if Nvidia's DLSS scaling tech wasn't already very important, it could become absolutely critical in the near future and not just for the RTX 4070.Current rumours indicate the upcoming RTX 4060 and RTX 4060 Ti will offer just 8GB of VRAM. That could be a limitation for native resolution gaming in some titles, even at 1080p. In which case, the competitiveness of those GPUs could hinge on using DLSS by default.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.If limited VRAM does prove a problem for Nvidia, the sticking point will be bus width. Nvidia is proving to be particularly aggressive this time around regarding bus width on its RTX 40-series GPUs with that rumoured step down to 128-bit for the xx60-series cards.(Image credit: AMD)The problem with that is how it dictates memory allocation due to existing memory chip specs. The RTX 4070 Ti's 192-bit bus, for instance, effectively limits Nvidia to a choice of 12GB or 24GB. It can't do 16GB with a 192-bit bus.Equally, the rumoured 128-bit bus of the RTX 4060 results in a choice between 8GB and 16GB. The latter is tricky for Nvidia both in terms of cost and the potential for awkward comparisons within its own GPU line up. Can it really offer more VRAM on the RTX 4060 than the RTX 4070?It remains to be seen exactly what specs the RTX 4070 and RTX 4060 will have on desktop and indeed exactly how impactful VRAM sizes are going to be for this generation of GPUs.But at this point it does seem quite likely that, more than in any other recent generation of GPUs from Nvidia and AMD, how much VRAM you get with your GPU could be major battle ground.

Wilson \u2022\nApr 30, 2023 at 04:12am EDT\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA third-party power management tool known as NVIDIA GPU Power Management enables lots of fine-tuning for GeForce GPUs in applications.\nA new unofficial power management tool for NVIDIA GPUs\u00a0 appears, allowing users to alter settings per application\nModern games such as Cyberpunk 2077 require a lot of graphical prowess to run and can make cards such as the RTX 4090 sip over 450W when path tracing is enabled. However, there are also older games that don't require the extra power and all the extra performance is going to waste if the same cards are sipping over 400W power while producing frames beyond the monitor's refresh rates.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total CostSome of the most common applications to limit power or locking framerate include MSI's Afterburner application (one of the top GPU applications available) or NVIDIA System Management Interface command lines (NVIDIA-SMI). The latter must be altered manually, but a new application allows users to control the power with an easy user interface called NVIDIA GPU Power Management.\nThis new tool is not a product of NVIDIA. It utilizes the NVIDIA GPU driver application and allows users to individually change each application's power management and memory settings so that all titles can be tailored for the user without needing to be in the game or application. This new graphical user interface (GUI) tool does the work of what would usually only be available through command lines.\nImage source: Guru3D\nThe NVIDIA GPU Power Management application, created by developer Simon Macer, is available via Sourceforge. Macer has also created an AMD Radeon Setup Tool Project specifying the components and other options before installation.\nThe NVIDIA GPU Power Management tool offers users the ability to:\n\nAutomatically apply Power Limit after booting the system: Automatically apply GPU Power Limit after booting OS.\nPower Limit Profile Management (NVPL Profile): You can define power limits for your application on NVIDIA Power Management. The range of power limit depends on your graphics card. Usually, GeForce RTX 4090 has more power max/min range.\nAdaptive VRAM Clock Control: Adaptive VRAM Clock. App whitelist automatically adjusts the minimum VRAM Clock to prevent GPU from deep power saving.\nNVIDIA GPU Performance State Monitor\n\nSince this is not an official NVIDIA application or tool, there are risks to downloading anything that alters the user's system. It is always a good option to measure any risks or issues with installing new software and do a system backup before installing software such as the NVIDIA GPU Power Management tool. The tool appears to be safe through virus detection software, but that does not mean the risk is eliminated. Always be cautious before installing software from 3rd party sources.\nNews Sources: NVIDIA Power Management tool, AMD Radeon Setup Tool Project, NVIDIA Developer Site, VideoCardz\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n159\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n124\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n79\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n50\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n29\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n920\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The graphics card also brings the pricing of the Ada Gaming lineup down to $599 US, being the most lowest priced next-gen card yet. Besides just adding more performance and efficiency, it adds a range of new features including:\nRelated Story NVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\nNew Streaming Multiprocessors (SM) \u2013 The new SM delivers up to 2x performance and power efficiency\n4th Generation Tensor Cores and Optical Flow \u2013 Enable and accelerate transformative AI technologies, including the new frame rate multiplying NVIDIA DLSS 3\n3rd Generation RT Cores \u2013 Up to 2x ray tracing performance, delivering incredibly detailed virtual worlds like never before\nShader Execution Reordering (SER) \u2013 SER improves ray tracing operations by 2x, boosting FPS up to 44% in Cyberpunk with RT: Overdrive Mode\nDLSS 3 \u2013 A revolutionary breakthrough in AI-powered graphics that massively boosts performance using AI to generate additional high-quality frames\nNVIDIA Studio \u2013 Unmatched performance in 3D rendering, video editing, and live streaming\nAV1 Encoders \u2013 The 8th generation NVIDIA Encoder (NVENC) with AV1 is 40% more efficient than H.264, enabling new possibilities for streamers, broadcasters, and video callers\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 uses a cut-down AD104 GPU configuration with 46 SMs for a total of 5888 CUDA cores The GPU will come packed with 36 MB of L2 cache, 184 Texture Mapping Units & a total of 64 ROPs. The clock speeds for the graphics card are rated at 1920 MHz base and 2475 MHz boost clocks. The card offers 29 TFLOPs of FP32, 67.4 TFLOPs of RT, and 466 TFLOPs on INT8 compute output.\n\nNVIDIA states that increasing the L2 cache by 9 times on the RTX 4070 versus the RTX 3070 (36 MB vs 4 MB) improves performance, reduces latency, & increases power efficiency, as data access can remain on-chip (rather than having to rely on memory bandwidth).\n\nAs for memory specs, the GeForce RTX 4070 features 12 GB GDDR6X capacities that will be adjusted at 21.0 Gbps speeds across a 192-bit bus interface. This will provide up to 504 GB/s of bandwidth. This is the same memory configuration as used by the RTX 4070 Ti and 4 GB more memory versus the 3070 series graphics cards.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 12 GB \"Official\" TBP - 200W\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 8 GB \"Official\" TBP - 220W\n\nAs far as the power consumption is concerned, the TBP is rated at 200W. The card will be powered by a single 16-pin connector which can theoretically deliver up to 600W of power. Custom models will be offering higher TBP targets but are also open to using standard 8-pin connectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Graphics Cards Performance\nAs for the performance of these monster GPUs, NVIDIA shared the computational and gaming performance figures and it looks like the GeForce RTX 4070 will be sitting in between the 3080 10GB and 12GB models without DLSS 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nJust for comparison's sake:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090: 83 TFLOPs (FP32) (2.5 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080: 49 TFLOPs (FP32) (2.5 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti: 49 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.86 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti: 40 TFLOPs (FP32) (2.6 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090: 36 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.69 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070: 29 TFLOPs (FP32) (2.48 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080: 29 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.71 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti: 21 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.77 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070: 20 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.75 GHz Boost clock)\n\nBased on a boost clock speed of 2.48 GHz, you get up to 29 TFLOPs of compute performance and you can definitely squeeze out a lot more with an overclock as we had demonstrated with the RTX 4090. One should remember that compute performance doesn't necessarily indicate the overall gaming performance.\n\n\nFP32 Compute Horsepower Comparisons (Higher is Better)\n\nCompute Power\n\n\n020406080100120\n\n\n\n\n\n020406080100120\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 4090\n\n82\n\n\n7900 XTX\n\n61\n\n\n7900 XT\n\n51\n\n\nRTX 4080\n\n49\n\n\nRTX 3090 Ti\n\n40\n\n\nRTX 4070 Ti\n\n40\n\n\nRTX 3090\n\n36\n\n\nRTX 4070\n\n29\n\n\nRTX 3080\n\n29\n\n\nRX 6900 XTX\n\n25\n\n\nRTX 3070 Ti\n\n22\n\n\nRTX 4060 Ti (Theoretical)\n\n22\n\n\nRTX 3070\n\n20\n\n\nRTX 3060 Ti\n\n16\n\n\nRTX 3060\n\n13\n\n\n\u00a0 Xbox Series X\n\n12\n\n\nPlayStation 5\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nAs for the gaming performance, NVIDIA heavily emphasizes the use of RTX & DLSS3 plus the new RT-overdrive mode when comparing the GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card with older RTX 30 GPUs.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 1440P Performance:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 DLSS 3 Performance:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 eSports Performance:\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Synthetic Benchmarks:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Power Profiles:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Graphics Cards Price & Availability\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card will be available starting tomorrow for a price of $599 US.

Wilson \u2022\nApr 27, 2023 at 05:30am EDT\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent reports citing NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 40 price reduction and limited production may be due to excess inventories, claims a report by EETimes. According to an analysis by \\research firm, Arete Research, NVIDIA is amongst the list of TSMC's Top fabless customers whose inventory far exceeds the 5-year industry average of 92 days.\nNVIDIA Inventory Issues Could Be The Reason GeForce RTX 40 GPUs Have Been Limited In Production, Price Cuts & Promos To Alter Course?\nWhen the recent NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 hit the market two weeks ago, the amount of inventory across the board, except for a few manufacturers' graphics cards, was packed on many retail shelves, whether online or in stores. NVIDIA has begun to sell the cards for cheaper to entice new and returning consumers, but it is not only due to the cards not selling fast enough.\nRelated Story China\u2019s In-House EUV Machines Reportedly Entering Trial Production In Q3 2025, Utilizing An Approach That Offers A Simpler, Efficient Design; SMIC & Huawei To Benefit Greatly\n\nTSMC and Samsung were previously on an increased path to be the first company to develop and manufacture the 3nm process technology for chips used in processors and graphics cards. TSMC recently acquired this goal, but not without problems. According to a report by EE Times, the semiconductor giant is struggling with \"tool and yield\" issues that are slowing the volume of production of 3nm-based chips to its customers, i.e., NVIDIA.\nOur 3-nm technology is the first in the semiconductor industry to high-volume production with good yield. As our customers\u2019 demand for N3 [TSMC terminology for 3 nm] exceeds our ability to supply, we expect N3 to be fully utilized in 2023, supported by both HPC and smartphone applications. Sizable N3 revenue contribution is expected to start in the third quarter, and N3 will contribute a mid\u2013single\u2013digit percentage of our total wafer revenue in 2023.\n\u2014 C.C. Wei, Taiwan Semiconductor Co. CEO during a conference call with analysts\nThe report explains that over the last five years, \"the industry's chip inventory safety line\" was, at most, an estimated 92 days. NVIDIA has the most extensive inventory of GPUs, with an estimated 220 days' worth of supply. NVIDIA is one of six companies that are the largest fabless customers for TSMC and is the highest of five companies to exceed what is being called the \"warning line.\"\nThe current market conditions aren't supporting either with inflation and economic devaluation of currency making gamers reluctant to buy new graphics cards such as NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 40 series. NVIDIA is also trying to limit production so that its partners don't end up with excessive inventories which would mean that price cuts and other incentives might be the only solution to push these GPUs out of warehouses.\n\nThe recent NVIDIA cuLitho hardware and software are being utilized in NVIDIA graphics cards, such as the H100 GPU, which uses a 5nm process technology. The new software and hardware will assist TSMC in \"deploying inverse lithography and deeper learning.\"\nWe recently see TSMC partnered up with NVIDIA, Synopsys, and ASML on 2-nm production and beyond. TSMC is currently the only foundry within that group.\n\u2014 Brad Lin, research analyst, Bank of America\nTSMC is slated to increase N3, N4, and N5 nodes to assist companies like Apple and its A17 and M3 processors, ASIC-based server processors, and fabricate N4 and N5 nodes for AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA during H2 2023. However, N3 nodes are delayed because of the demand for adopting \"multi-patterning with EUV lithography\" from EUV lithography company ASML.\nWhile the high cost of EUV multi-patterning has made the cost/benefit of EUV unattractive, loosening the design rules to minimize the number of EUV multi-patterning layers has led to a much higher die size.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Antony reviews and covers the latest PC hardware and laptop technologyFollow AuthorApr 12, 2023, 08:59am EDTShareSaveCommentWe can finally reveal performance numbers for Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4070 - it's cheapest RTX 40-series card to date - which will retail from $599, putting it in direct competition with Nvidia's own RTX 3080 and AMD's Radeon RX 6800 XT.\nNvidia's RTX 4070Antony Leather\n\nThe card has a heavily trimmed specification compared to the RTX 4070 Ti, with a lower peak boost frequency, 5,888 versus 7,680 Cuda cores, 184 versus 240 Tensor cores and 46 versus 60 RT cores.\n\n\nBoth cards have a 192-bit memory bus and 12GB of GDDR6X memory, but the 49MB of L2 cache in the RTX 4070 Ti dwarfs the 36MB in the RTX 4070. The benefits, though, mean a much cheaper, smaller and less power-hungry graphics card - the RTX 4070 will retail from $599, has a cooler just 243mm/9.5in long and a board power of 200W versus 285W.\n\n\nWhile it shares some specifications with the RTX 3070, the latter was $100 cheaper, so we are dealing with a small price hike here. Still, this is by far the cheapest RTX 40-series graphics card so far and one that looks set to be pitched against most resolutions out there, especially as it supports DLSS 3.0 and frame generation and should offer better performance in DLSS and ray tracing in games than the RTX 3080 too.\n\n\nTest system\nI used an Intel Core i9-12900K, 32GB of Kingston Fury 6400MHz DDR5 memory strapped to an NZXT N7 Z790 motherboard along with the latest drivers and Windows 11 updates. As the RTX 4070 is likely to face 1080p, 1440p and 4K resolutions, despite its relatively hefty price, I've also included 1080p benchmarks below, but only with specific graphics cards, namely the RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT, with these being the closest models in price, and also the RTX 3070, which is its direct predecessor to see how much things have moved on in one generation.\n\n\nBenchmarks\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\nHalo Infinite\nHalo Infinite's campaign mode saw the RTX 4070 dominate the RX 6800 XT and RTX 3070 at 1080p, but closely match the RTX 3080, living up to Nvidia's claims that the two cards perform similarly. Stepping up to 1440p and the gap surprisingly widens with a great result for the RTX 4070, which even beat the RX 6950 XT and traded blows with the RX 7900 XTX too. At 4K, it fell back passed both those cards, trading blows with the RTX 3080, but still bettering AMD's RX 6900 XT and 6800 XT.\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator\nIn Flight Simulator, the RTX 3080 had a small lead at 1080p, was a touch slower overall at 1440p and about level at 4K, with the RX 6800 XT sitting below the RTX 4070 in all three resolutions. With DLSS enabled, the RTX 4070 edged out in front of the RTX 3080 and RTX 3080 Ti, with a big lead over the RX 6800 XT.\nWatch Dogs: Legion\nAt 1080p, the RTX 4070 was a little slower than the RTX 3080, but noticeably quicker than the RX 6800 XT. A similar picture was a revealed at 1440p, except here it managed to better AMD's RX 6950 XT too, although the RTX 3080 edged out a bigger lead. At 4K the card struggled, only bettering the RX 6800 XT, with the RX 6900 XT, 6950 XT and RTX 3080 all managing higher frame rates.\nForza Horizon 5\nForza is definitely an AMD-favoring game so it's no surprise to see the RX 6800 XT come top here, but the RTX 4070 still managed to beat the RTX 3080. At 1440p, the RTX 4070 fared better, edging out a bigger lead over the RTX 3080, but still failing to topple the RX 6800 XT. Finally, at 4K, it closed the gap on the RX 6800 XT and again outperformed the RTX 3080, so represents decent value if you plan on gaming at high resolutions in this game.\nMetro Exodus Enhanced Edition\nAt 1080p the RTX 4070 was generally faster than the RX 6800 XT overall with a much higher average frame rate and also bettered the RTX 3080. At 1440p, the RTX 4070 again beat the RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT, but the extra performance offered by the pricier RTX 4070 Ti was clear. Stepping up to 4K and the RTX 4070 offered a decent lead over the RTX 3080 and was far faster than the RX 6800 XT - a lead that was enhanced by switching on DLSS where it was again quicker than the 3080, also with DLSS enabled.\nFar Cry 6\nThe RTX 4070 and RX 6800 XT traded blows in Far Cry 6 with the AMD card eventually winning overall thanks to a better result at 4K. The RTX 4070 had the measure of the RTX 3080 at 1080p and 1440p but again at 4K it struggled and the RTX 3080 was quicker. With DXR reflections enabled at 4K, the situation improved with the RTX 4070 matching the RX 6800 XT and a with a slightly better result overall than the RTX 3080.\nDLSS 3.0 testing\nI only had time to test one game with DLSS 3.0 but it's clear that if you're prepared to use it, it can offer huge increases in performance, leapfrogging even the RTX 4090\u2019s stock result and essentially doubling its own stock results. However, the RTX 4070 Ti was even faster here.\nPerhaps the best result here is power efficiency. With a system power draw of 322W, it was a good 30W lower than the RTX 3070 and over 100W more power frugal than the RTX 4070 Ti with an even bigger gap to the RTX 3080. This means it offers excellent performance per watt and combined with its small size, is a great choice for a small form factor mini-ITX PC.\nConclusions\nOverall the RTX 4070 is slightly quicker than the RTX 3080 and often has a decent lead over the AMD RX 6800 XT too. The key benefit, though, is its supremely lower power consumption and low operating temperatures, which will delight those with meagre power supplies or mini-ITX PCs and indeed those looking to save on their utility bills. It looks certain that even smaller models than the Founders Edition card I reviewed here today will be released in future.Nvidia's RTX 4070Antony Leather\nThe only thing that can upset sales will be Nvidia lowering the price of the RTX 3080 or indeed AMD with the RX 6800 XT. Assuming we do actually see cards available around the proposed $599 mark, this makes it a better buy than the RTX 3080, although the latter did occasionally offer better performance, usually at higher resolutions. where o\nIt's more expensive than the RTX 3070 was at launch and $600 is still a lot for what is essentially a mid-range graphics card, but with the benefits of DLSS 3.0 and its excellent power efficiency thrown in too, this is undoubtedly the most attractive RTX 40-series card so far, especially to your typical gamer looking to upgrade from RTX 20-series or earlier models or the RTX 3070 and below.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

The developer kit puts the power of the SoM in the hands of developers by making it accessible.\n\nBelow is a snapshot of the benchmark that compares the performance of AI vision models on Jetson Nano and Jetson Orin Nano.\nPerformance Comparison between Jetson Nano and Jetson Orin Nano 8GB nvidia\n\nJetson Orin has a graphics processing unit (GPU) based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, an ARM CPU, next-generation accelerators for deep learning and vision, high-speed interfaces, fast memory bandwidth, and support for multiple types of sensors. The performance and flexibility enable customers to build products with in-built, advanced intelligence that seemed impossible before. With this device, developers can infuse AI into applications running at the edge, while makers and builders can leverage Robotics Operating System (ROS) to build intelligent machines.\n\nThe Jetson Orin Nano 8 GB module has an NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPU with 1024 CUDA cores, 32 third-generation Tensor Cores, and a 6-core ARM CPU. This device allows multiple AI application pipelines to run simultaneously, delivering high-performance inference. The developer kit carrier board has a lot of connectors, including two MIPI CSI connectors that support camera modules with up to four lanes and allow for higher resolution and frame rates than before.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nThe developer kit has a bootable microSD card and two M.2 Key-M NVMe sockets for additional storage needs. It comes with a Gigabit ethernet connector and a 40-pin expansion header to connect sensors and actuators.\n\nWith generative AI getting all the attention, NVIDIA ensured that the latest SoM and developer kit could run transformer models. Transformer models such as GPT, BERT, and DALL-E learn the context by analyzing the relationships between various elements of sequential data, thus avoiding the need for massive labeled datasets.\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s USP is the powerful combination of hardware and software for the AI accelerators. The Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit runs the latest version of JetPack - v5.1.1 - which has everything from the operating system to the high-level APIs developers consume to build edge AI applications. It has CUDA-X accelerated computing stack targeting AI use cases for industrial IoT, manufacturing and smart cities.\nNVIDIA now has a product line-up of SoMs that covers the entire spectrum of edge computing:\nJetson Orin Nano 4GB and 8GB - Priced at $259 and $499, these SoMs are the most affordable yet powerful edge computing devices delivering 40 TOPS or trillion operations per second of AI performance. Note that these modules need to be a part of the developer kit to develop and debug AI models and applications. The Jetson Orin Nano 8GB developer kit will be available soon for $499.\nJetson Orin NX 8GB and 16GB - These modules deliver up to 100 TOPS of AI performance in the smallest Jetson form factor, with power configurable between 10W and 25W. The 16GB version of the SoM sells for $699, while the 8GB version costs $479.\nJetson AGX Orin 32GB and 64GB - Delivering up to 275 TOPS of AI performance, this variant of Jetson Orin is the most potent version. The 32GB SoM costs $999.00, and the high-end 64GB version has a retail price of $1,799.00. The fully assembled, ready-to-use Jetson AGX Orin 64GB Developer Kit is sold at $1,999.00.\nNVIDIA has partnered with various OEMs and hardware manufacturers to develop reference boards and developer kits for Jetson Orin Nano. Companies such as Advantech, Aetina, Auvidea and Seeed Studio have devices with varying form factors and features.\nWhen it comes to edge computing, NVIDIA continues to invest in hardware and software to empower developers to build next-generation AI-enabled applications. The Jetson Nano Orin Developer Kit puts the power of AI in the hands of developers, builders, and makers.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

It's the company's first launch in over a year of a graphics card that could charitably be described as \"mainstream,\" both in performance and in price. It costs $600.\nIt's not productive to keep going back to the also-$600 GTX 1080, at the time the fastest graphics card you could buy anywhere from anyone, and wondering how we got here from there (some of it is inflation, not all of it). But I keep doing it as a reminder that $600 is still more than many people pay for their entire PC, tablet, smartphone, or high-end game console. No other component in a gaming PC has seen its price shoot up like this over the same span of time; a Core i5 CPU cost around $200 in 2016 and costs around $200 now, and RAM and SSDs are both historically cheap at the moment.\nTo review the 4070 is to simultaneously be impressed by it as a product while also being frustrated with the conditions that led us to an \"impressive\" $600 midrange graphics card. It's pretty fast, very efficient, and much more reasonably sized than other recent Nvidia GPUs. In today's topsy-turvy graphics card market, I could even describe it as a good deal. But if you're still yearning for the days when you could spend $300 or less on a reasonably performant GPU with the latest architecture and modern features, keep waiting.\nThe RTX 4070, and a 40-series refresher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4070 Founders Edition is dwarfed by the 4090 and 4080 design, though third-party GPU makers can make bigger cards if they want. \n              \n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's GeForce RTX 4070 Founders Edition is dwarfed by the 4090 and 4080 design, though third-party GPU makers can make bigger cards if they want. \n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Most of these photos are just here to drive home how small the 4070 is compared to the 4080/4090 design.\n              \n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of these photos are just here to drive home how small the 4070 is compared to the 4080/4090 design.\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      The 4070 is shorter, narrower, and shallower. \n              \n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 4070 is shorter, narrower, and shallower. \n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of these photos are just here to drive home how small the 4070 is compared to the 4080/4090 design.\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe 4070 is shorter, narrower, and shallower. \n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      A graphics card for ants.\n              \n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      The Founders Edition still uses a 12VHPWR connector instead of regular 8-pin power connectors.\n              \n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      The 4070 is even smaller than AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX and XT, which are already more reasonably sized than the 4080/4090.\n              \n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      An unsurprising array of ports includes three DisplayPort connectors and one HDMI. \n              \n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Founders Edition version of the RTX 4070 we reviewed is considerably smaller in every dimension than the Founders Edition RTX 4080 and RTX 4090, plus most of the 4070/4070 Ti/4080/4090 cards from Nvidia's partners. The two-slot GPU is just 240 mm long (compared to 310 mm for the 4080/4090) and 40 mm tall (compared to 61 mm). That's before you account for the extra space taken up by the 12VHPWR-to-8-pin power connector, which is still pretty bulky even though it only requires a pair of 8-pin connections rather than three or four. But it's still a small enough card to fit in just about any PC case, including prebuilt OEM mini-towers and tiny custom ITX builds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RTX 4070 has a lot in common with the 4070 Ti, the GPU originally announced as the \"RTX 4080 12GB\" before being \"unlaunched\" and relaunched. They share the same AD104 GPU die, a smaller chip than the AD102 flagship used in the RTX 4090 or the AD103 used in the 4080 series. They also both use 12GB of GDDR6X memory on a 192-bit interface. The 4070 has fewer CUDA cores (5,888, down from 7,680), but the 4070 and 4070 Ti are much more similar than the 16GB and 12GB RTX 4080 cards would have been.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      The 4070 Founders Edition is small, but the included 12VHPWR adapter does add bulk. Some newer power supplies include a native 12VHPWR connector.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Andrew Cunningham\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nThat 192-bit memory interface is narrower than the 256-bit interface used by the 3070 and 3070 Ti, which Nvidia has compensated for by adding 32MB of extra L2 cache to the 4070 (for a total of 36MB). That cache and much faster base and boost clock speeds are the 4070's biggest improvements over the last-gen cards.\n\n\n\n\nRTX 4090\nRTX 4080\nRTX 4070 Ti\nRTX 4070\nRTX 3080 Ti\nRTX 3080 10GB\nRTX 3070 Ti\nRTX 3070\nRTX 3060\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n16,384\n9,728\n7,680\n5,888\n10,240\n8,704\n6,144\n5,888\n3,584\n\n\nBoost Clock\n2,520 MHz\n2,505 MHz\n2,610 MHz\n2,475 MHz\n1,665 MHz\n1,710 MHz\n1,765 MHz\n1,725 MHz\n1,777 MHz\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n384-bit\n256-bit\n192-bit\n192-bit\n384-bit\n320-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n192-bit\n\n\nMemory Clock\n1,313 MHz\n1,400 MHz\n1,313 MHz\n1,313 MHz\n1,188 MHz\n1,188 MHz\n1,188 MHz\n1,750 MHz\n1,875 MHz\n\n\nMemory size\n24GB GDDR6X\n16GB GDDR6X\n12GB GDDR6X\n12GB GDDR6X\n12GB GDDR6X\n10GB GDDR6X\n8GB GDDR6X\n8GB GDDR6\n12GB GDDR6\n\n\nTGP\n450 W\n320 W\n285 W\n200 W\n350 W\n320 W\n290 W\n220 W\n170 W\n\n\n\nBecause it shares the same Ada Lovelace architecture as the other RTX 4000 GPUs, the RTX 4070 also supports Nvidia's new DLSS 3 and the accompanying DLSS Frame Generation (DLSS FG) features. DLSS is AI-assisted upscaling that takes a lower-resolution image rendered by your GPU and upscales it, improving frame rates at high resolutions while losing relatively little detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      When combining DLSS upscaling with DLSS frame generation, Nvidia can (under the right conditions) produce a more detailed, higher-frame-rate image without requiring the raw GPU performance it would normally take to render that image.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Nvidia\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nDLSS FG, you might recall from our RTX 4090 review, \"doubles\" your frame rate by creating one AI-interpolated frame for every frame that the GPU renders. DLSS FG works in concert with typical DLSS upscaling\u2014Nvidia says that \"seven out of every eight pixels\" can be generated by AI when DLSS and DLSS FG are both enabled. The result can be a clean-looking, high-resolution, high-frame-rate image rendered using just a fraction of the GPU performance that would be needed to render the same scene natively. Nvidia claims the RTX 4070 can be 1.4 times as fast as an RTX 3080 when DLSS FG is enabled.\nBut as we found in our RTX 4090 review, it tends to work best when your GPU is already pumping out reasonable frame rates, making imperfections in the AI-generated frames harder to perceive. In other words, it's a lot better at making a 60 fps image look like a 120 fps image than it is at making a 15 fps image look like a 30 fps image. DLSS FG can also add latency, making it harder to recommend for twitchy competitive first-person shooters, and it's compatible with a relatively narrow selection of games (though Nvidia's list of \"50-plus titles\" includes big names like Microsoft Flight Simulator,\u00a0Diablo IV,\u00a0and\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance and power use\n\n\n\n\nGaming testbed\n\n\nCPU\nAMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D (provided by AMD)\n\n\nMotherboard\nAsus ROG Crosshair VIII Dark Hero (provided by ASUS)\n\n\nRAM\n64GB DDR4-3200 (provided by Crucial)\n\n\nSSD\nWestern Digital Black SN850 1TB (provided by Western Digital)\n\n\nPower supply\nEVGA Supernova 850 P6 (provided by EVGA)\n\n\nCPU cooler\n280 mm Corsair iCure H115i Elite Capellix AIO\n\n\nCase\nLian Li O11 Air Mini\n\n\nOS\nWindows 11 22H2 with Core Isolation on, Memory Integrity off\n\n\n\nNvidia's reference numbers and other reviews have confirmed that the 4070 performs much like the last-generation 10GB version of the RTX 3080, a card that debuted at $699 in late 2020. It usually wins by a little and sometimes loses by a little, but the numbers are generally within five percent or so of each other. We didn't have a 3080 to test against, but we've provided benchmark data from several other cards to put the 4070's performance in context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross all of our rasterized gaming tests (that is, a mix of Direct3D 12, Direct3D 11, and Vulkan titles with no ray-tracing effects enabled), the 4070 was about two-thirds as fast as the RTX 4080 while only costing half as much, which is a pretty good value proposition. Across our test suite, the 4070 could usually turn in frame rates near or above 100 fps when playing at 1440p, and it even gets pretty close to the 60 fps mark running at 4K. Especially in games with DLSS support, the 4070 is more than usable as a 4K GPU, though its 12GB RAM limit may become a problem in newer games with fancier effects.\nThat said, in terms of raw rasterized game performance, it's not quite\u00a0as big a slam dunk as the 3070 was when it was released. That GPU could soundly beat the more-expensive previous-generation RTX 2080 and 2080 Super for less money while trading blows with the RTX 2080 Ti. The RTX 4070 occasionally comes within a few percent of matching the 3080 Ti, but it consistently comes up short. That's not bad, especially if you can actually buy a 4070 for $599, but previous midrange GeForce cards have done a slightly better job of bringing last-generation flagship performance down to more reasonably priced PCs.\nIn games with heavier ray-tracing effects, it becomes clearer why Nvidia is marketing this first and foremost as a 1440p card. Games with lighter effects, like Shadow of the Tomb Raider or\u00a0Forza 5, do fine. In both cases, the card maintains its \"great at 1440p, solid at 4K\" position. In Hitman 3, the GPU falls a bit short of the 60 fps line at 1440p and short of the 30 fps line at 4K. In Cyberpunk 2077, which has always been a bit of a torture test for graphics cards, it does worse, hitting 30 FPS at 1440p but struggling at 4K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurning DLSS on in these games\u00a0mostly helps across the board. In\u00a0Cyberpunk, it's the difference between workable and unplayable at 4K, at least when you have all the ray-tracing effects enabled. For games that can already hit 60 fps or above, it simply provides more of a cushion, helping things run smoother on high-refresh-rate monitors. It's not a \"turn all the settings up and forget about it\" card like the RTX 4090 is, but games that don't run smoothly should only need a few small settings tweaks to run well.\nAs for DLSS FG: in our RTX 4090 review, we speculated that the AI-accelerated frame-generation feature might not scale\u00a0down very well. In games that are already running at 50 or 60 fps, DLSS FG can add a hint of extra smoothness without unduly impacting image quality. But when there are fewer rendered frames to work with, generating the interpolated frames requires more guessing, and some of those guesses are going to be wrong.\nWe had to crank games up to 8K to start seeing signs of this with the 4090, but for the 4070, you can begin to see it at 4K with games like\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077 that are running at around 30 fps with DLSS enabled. Lights and fine lines in the Cyberpunk benchmark are noticeably more shimmery on the 4070 than they are on a 4080 with the same settings (or our 3080 Ti with DLSS enabled but without DLSS FG support), and small, fast-moving particle effects become difficult to see clearly. I don't really notice any of this on the 4080 with DLSS FG enabled.\nIn\u00a0Cyberpunk, I think the 4070 actually looks a bit better at 1440p with DLSS (but not DLSS FG) enabled than it does running at 4K with DLSS FG enabled. Regular DLSS upscaling (and, to a somewhat lesser extent, AMD's FSR and Intel's XeSS) is great because it can take a borderline-playable game and make it playable. If DLSS FG already requires a game to be running well to deliver on its promise, it's not as much of a selling point for lower-end cards. Expect this to be even more noticeable on any 4060 or 4050-series GPUs we see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Power efficiency is one of the RTX 4070's best qualities. \n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Andrew Cunningham\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nThe 4070's performance is reasonably respectable on its own, but the results become particularly impressive when you take its power consumption into account. It consumed less than 200 W in our tests, while last-generation cards that can beat it usually consume 300 W or more. It's pretty much in line with the RTX 4080's power use\u2014two-thirds as fast while using two-thirds as much power.\nFor another intriguing comparison point, look at the RTX 3060, the most popular GPU on Steam right now; the 4070 runs nearly twice as fast as the 3060 while consuming just 16 percent more power. The 3060 isn't really a 4070 competitor today, but you could find 3060s for way over $599 if you were trying to buy one back in 2021. That's what we mean when we say the 4070 is a reward for those who sat out the RTX 3000-era GPU shortage\u2014this level of performance at this price would have been unthinkable during the peak of the last crypto mining boom.\nPower use is one reason why we haven't talked much about how AMD's cards stack up to the RTX 4070. The two to consider are the RX 6800 XT ($579) and the RX 6950 XT ($649) since the company still hasn't released lower-end RDNA 3-based RX 7000-series cards to follow up the 7900 XTX and 7900 XT yet. And while the 6950 XT, at least, is capable of beating the 4070 in many benchmarks, it does so while consuming 86 percent more power. Once you factor in the RX 6000 series' poor ray tracing performance, it's difficult to recommend the 6950 XT, even if you do get a bit more raw performance for a similar price.\n\nNot a bargain, but it\u2019s worth what it costs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      The RTX 4070 is a nice GPU, but it's not \"budget.\"\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Andrew Cunningham\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070\n      \n\n\n        $600 at Best Buy\n      \n\n\nReading other coverage of the RTX 4070, the adjective I take the most issue with is \"budget.\" This is a $600 graphics card, and no matter the comparison point you pick\u2014past xx70-series GPUs, the cost of a fully-built high-end game console, the cost of the entire rest of the PC you're putting it in\u2014it's not a \"budget\" card. When people say \"budget\" or \"affordable\" about the RTX 4070, they of course mean to say \"affordable relative to the RTX 4090, 4080, and 4070 Ti,\" but that's not an impressive achievement by itself. The RTX 4000-series are all historical outliers when it comes to pricing, and the 4070 is, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is impressive is the GPU\u2019s price-to-performance ratio\u2014roughly as fast as an RTX 3080 but priced $100 lower. And let\u2019s be honest, for the vast majority of its life span, buying an RTX 3080 for anything close to $700 was a virtual impossibility. The RTX 4070 is the first GPU that properly rewards people who decided to wait out the RTX 3000 generation because of the shortages and price inflation that accompanied it.\nThe card's size and power efficiency, at least in the Founders Edition card we tested, is also impressive for its performance level. You get RTX 3080-ish performance at less than two-thirds the power consumption, and it's small enough that (for once) you don't need to break out the spec sheet for your case to ensure it will fit. Whether you're installing an upgrade in some prebuilt desktop or looking for an efficient card for your tiny mini ITX custom-build, this 4070 will fit fine (though using the 12VHPWR-to-8-pin adapter adds a lot of bulk, especially if you're trying not to bend or pull on the cable in ways that might cause problems).\nAs for the competition, purely in terms of rasterized gaming performance for the money, the RX 6800 XT ($579) and RX 6950 XT ($649) are competitive with the RTX 4070, but both cards consume way more power (about 50 percent more for the 6800 XT and nearly twice as much for the 6950 XT), and both cards are soundly beaten by the 4070 in any benchmark with ray-tracing effects enabled. AMD's FSR 2 looks fine and is supported by many games, but it doesn't help performance as much as DLSS does at comparable resolutions and quality settings, and AMD has yet to replicate anything like DLSS FG. AMD still offers good performance per dollar if you don't care about any of that other stuff, but it's a long list of things you have to decide not to care about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, the RTX 4070 is a great graphics card for people who have $600 to spend on a graphics card. It's frustrating that it isn't a little faster or\u00a0a little cheaper, which keeps it from being as easy to recommend as cards like the 1070 or 3070 were. And it's annoying that people with $200 to $400 to spend have been so underserved by the major GPU makers for so many years. We're way past the days of Nvidia and AMD putting genuine effort into $200 GPUs\u00a0rather than leaving old and/or compromised models to do the job.\nBut the 4070 is a solid value for the price, giving you all of the benefits of Nvidia's latest architecture, outstanding 1440p performance, usable-with-compromises 4K performance, and excellent power efficiency. For the people who can afford it in the first place, it's worth the money.\nThe good\n\nA good all-around performer at a price that, in today's GPU market, is relatively reasonable and commensurate with performance\nExcellent 1440p performance, even with ray tracing turned on\nCompetent at 4K, especially in games that support DLSS\nGreat power efficiency\nDLSS remains a great performance-boosting feature\nActually in stock at MSRP a week after launch\n\nThe bad\n\n12VHPWR connector seems especially unnecessary in a GPU that only needs one or two 8-pin connectors (some partner cards do use 8-pin power instead of 12VHPWR)\nAll the partner cards that are still gigantic\nLimited game compatibility for DLSS 3 and DLSS FG\nEven putting aside latency issues, DLSS FG struggles to help games that aren't already running pretty well without it\n\nThe ugly\n\nThe conditions that have led us to a \"mainstream\" GPU that sells for six hundred dollars\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 review: Second only to the 4090\u2014for now\n          \n\n            Price-to-performance is a bit better than the 4090, if you can find it at $1,200.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Listing image:\n    Andrew Cunningham\n  \n\n\n\n  Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through\n  affiliate\n    programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Cunningham\nSenior Technology Reporter\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Cunningham\nSenior Technology Reporter\n\n\n      Andrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with a focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of operating systems like Windows and macOS.
