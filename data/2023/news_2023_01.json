Raising eyebrows among stakeholders is insider transaction disclosures, specifically involving Nvidia Director Mark Stevens. Historically, Stevens has demonstrated pensive trading behaviors with NVDA stock, implying his concerns about broader economic viability. Still, insider trading ultimately represents speculation so investors must take the assessment with a grain of salt.\nAccording to data from Finviz, Stevens disclosed four transactions this month \u2014 all of them sales. Starting from a transaction date (which differs from the filing date) of Jan. 9 and ending on Jan. 13, the director sold a total of 275,000 shares.\nFurther, it\u2019s not just about the number of shares of NVDA stock sold. Rather, it\u2019s the sudden spike in transaction count. In December, Stevens only incurred one transaction, a sale of 60,000 shares. Overall, in 2022, the director sold 738,150 shares.\nIntuitively, the insider\u2019s accelerated sales of shares owned seemingly bodes poorly for NVDA stock. After all, when insiders buy shares, the principles of economic rationality dictate that only one core reason exists: they believe said securities will rise in value. However, the inverse assumption \u2014 that insiders sell because shares will erode \u2014 doesn\u2019t always ring true.\nFundamentally, it\u2019s impossible to know exactly the motivations of any transaction. For sales, the water becomes further muddied. Primarily, because stocks depend on market valuations, holding too much wealth in them presents major risks. Therefore, the sale of NVDA stock could simply be a matter of prudence rather than a premonition.\n\n\nPlaying Detective for NVDA Stock\nWhile no one can say with absolute authority \u2014 other than the party itself \u2014 why insider selling occurred, such disclosures still carry relevance. Specifically for NVDA stock, investors can analyze Stevens\u2019 prior trading behaviors.\nPer Finviz, the director\u2019s first insider sale occurred on Nov. 23, 2015. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, Stevens only posted a total of four selling transactions. However, the red-ink fireworks truly exploded when Covid-19 initially capsized the global economy.\nJust in April 2020, Stevens disclosed five insider sells, totaling 121,125 shares of NVDA stock. From that point on, the director continued to sell shares that year up until July 2. Across the subsequent four transactions, Stevens sold 79,381 shares.\nHowever, from that July date, Stevens held on until the next insider sale of 58,000 shares on Nov. 22, 2021. Recall that from early July 2020 to roughly the back half of November 2021, NVDA stock tripled in value. Of course, it was also in November 2021 that the cryptocurrency market crashed, hurting Nvidia\u2019s mining-centric processors.\nIt\u2019s speculation but Stevens may have sensed trouble brewing, thus exiting at the first opportunity. Later, when geopolitical flashpoints erupted and inflationary pressures squeezed Nvidia\u2019s customers, the director continued dumping NVDA stock.\n\nWhy It Matters\nAnother inference regarding Stevens\u2019 insider transactions could be that the director may be too pensive. For instance, the director could have accrued exponentially more wealth with a bit more confidence and patience. Thus, some investors may treat the insider dumping as a bullish signal for NVDA stock.\nAgain, it\u2019s impossible to know for sure. For absolute facts, data from TipRanks reveals that NVDA stock carries a moderate buy consensus view, breaking down as 21 buys, five holds and one sell. The average expert price target stands at $203.24, implying a nearly 20% upside from the time-of-writing price.\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nSemiconductor, Technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2023/01/director-mark-stevens-keeps-selling-nvidia-nvda-stock/.\n\u00a92025 InvestorPlace Media, LLC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored Headlines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMore from InvestorPlace\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHot Stocks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Top Stocks to Buy Under Trump Come From Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018BRAIN\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Luke Lango, InvestorPlace Senior Investment Analyst\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Danger that Could Derail Our Economy\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Jeff Remsburg, Contributing Editor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy Prediction Came True: Where to Find Opportunity Despite Market Unpredictability\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Eric Fry, Editor, Fry's Investment Report\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTop Stories\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFeb 8, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWolfpack Research Short Report Sends B.

They should be able to participate in that,\" she said.\nThis led some of her colleagues, on both the left and the right, to sharply criticize her \u2014 and draft legislation to restrict members of Congress and their spouses from trading stocks.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Year after year, politicians somehow manage to outperform the market, buying and selling millions in stocks of companies they're supposed to be regulating,\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said. \"Wall Street and Big Tech work hand-in-hand with elected officials to enrich each other at the expense of the country. Here's something we can do: ban all members of Congress from trading stocks and force those who do to pay their proceeds back to the American people. It's time to stop turning a blind eye to Washington profiteering.\"\u00a0\nSen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, introduced a similar bill alongside Sen. Mark Kelly with the intent to ban members of Congress and their families from trading stocks.\n\"Members of Congress should not be playing the stock market while we make federal policy and have extraordinary access to confidential information,\" Ossoff said.\u00a0\n\n\nOn July 21, Pelosi denied that her husband uses information she provides to make stock trades, and she has\u00a0softened her stance on a congressional stock-trade ban.\u00a0\nIn September, Pelosi backed a bill House Democratic leadership advanced that would ban various government officials, including members of Congress, from trading individual stocks. But many government reform groups panned this legislation, and the fate of a congressional stock-trade ban in general remains unclear.\u00a0\nOn November 17, 2022, Pelosi announced her plan to step down from her leadership role after 19 years of leading House Democrats. In 2018, she announced her plan to step down as Democratic leader by the end of 2022.\n\n\nShe said she will, however, remain a member of Congress, having easily won re-election in November 2022.\nPaul Pelosi has endured a turbulent and tragic 2022: he pleaded guilty to a DUI charge in August, and he is now recovering from head injuries he sustained after being attacked with a hammer in the Pelosis' home in October.\nA previous analysis from Insider estimated that the Pelosis are worth at least $46,123,051, making Nancy Pelosi one of the 25 richest members of Congress. The vast majority of the couple's wealth is derived from stocks, options, and investments made by Paul Pelosi.\u00a0\nHere are all of the trades reported by Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2021 and 2022:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAllianceBernstein Holding L.P.

Insider collected and analyzed the trades listed in each of Pelosi's periodic transaction reports submitted since 2021.\nFederal lawmakers are required to report stock trades made by themselves, their spouses, and their dependent children.

Capital World, on Jan 27, announced that it will sell most of its space, including retail units, at its Capital City Mall in Johor Bahru to retailer Mustafa, for RM368 million ($113.6 million). This is Mustafa\u2019s first foray into the Malaysian market.  The 11-storey Capital City Mall is located in Johor Bahru\u2019s Tampoi suburb and was completed in April 2018. It has 1,602 strata-title retail units with a total net lettable area of 902,994 sq ft. The mall is part of a freehold integrated development in Tampoi. The integrated development includes a 315-room hotel, an 18-storey tower with 630 serviced suites, and 690 serviced apartments spanning three blocks. The mall opened in October 2018 but has been shut since February 2020 as the company and one of its key subsidiaries ran into financial difficulties and had to seek court protection from creditors while they restructured their debts. The mall is expected to reopen in the second half of 2023. The assets sold by Capital World include 591 unsold retail units, 374 accessory parcels and 2,181 car parking spaces. The unsold retail units have a combined net lettable area (NLA) of 641,216 sq ft. The 374 accessory parcels, which include alfresco and multipurpose areas, come up to a total of 1.28 million sq ft.  The consideration comes after Capital World and Mustafa entered into a commercial option to purchase on Nov 18, 2022. The option took effect a month later. The price is based on the independent valuation report dated Aug 15, 2022. The report was prepared by VPC Alliance (JB) Sdn Bhd. As part of the agreement for the sale, Capital World will also build a four-storey cold storage facility within the mall for Mustafa. Capital World is a property developer that works with land owners on a joint-venture (JV) basis to enhance the value of their real estate assets. The company exited a scheme of arrangement in April 2022 after having restructured about RM187 million of debt. It had about RM166.3 million of net assets as at Sept 30, 2022. For the 1QFY2023 ended Sept 30, 2022, the company made a loss of RM3.3 million. According to Capital World, the proceeds from the sale will give the company \u201cthe financial muscle to build and complete these remaining components of the integrated development and pursue other real estate opportunities, including helping Mustafa identify potential sites in Malaysia and Indonesia to develop into mega stores\u201d. On the move, Mustaq Ahmad, Mustafa\u2019s managing director says, \u201cHaving established ourselves in Singapore\u2026 we believe the time is ripe for us to get into Malaysia, more so now that pandemic restrictions are out of the way.\u201d   Story continues He adds: \u201cOne of our key challenges until now has been finding an appropriate site. Capital City Mall meets many of the requirements for our first flagship store in Malaysia, given its close proximity to Singapore, ample floor area and ideal floor plates.\u201dHoo Khee Leng, Capital World\u2019s CEO, says, \u201cHaving Mustafa as a key player in our integrated development is a major catalyst for Capital World as they have what it takes to run a thriving retail business given that they are a household name in Singapore. We fully expect the mall, as well as the rest of the integrated development, to be well received now that international travel has resumed. This deal with Mustafa will also fast-track Capital World\u2019s turnaround and restore value to shareholders as we work towards getting the company\u2019s share trading suspension lifted.\u201dShares in Capital World last traded 0.5 cent after they were suspended for trading on Feb 14, 2020. The company has till April 30 to submit a trading resumption proposal to the Singapore Exchange Regulation.See Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore Capital World to restructure, suspends shares trading Capital World to raise $18.3 mil from 2 private investors A Johor developer with a unique business model for regional expansion Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

In the roughly 57 years he's spent as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.14%) (BRK.B -0.02%), the Oracle of Omaha, as he's come to be known, has created more than $685 billion in value for shareholders, as well as delivered an aggregate return for the company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of more than 3,800,000%, through Jan. 25, 2023.\nBuffett's ability to consistently outperform the S&P 500 has encouraged generations of investors to ride his coattails. Thanks to required quarterly 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, mirroring the Oracle of Omaha's buying and selling activity is relatively easy.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBut you might be surprised to learn that Berkshire Hathaway's 13F doesn't tell the complete story.\nBack in 1998, Buffett's company acquired General Re for $22 billion.\u00a0 While General Re's reinsurance operations were the prize of this buyout, it also owned a specialty investment firm called New England Asset Management (NEAM). When Berkshire Hathaway bought General Re, it also acquired NEAM.\nAs of the end of September, New England Asset Management had nearly $5.9 billion in assets under management and positions in 184 securities. Even though Warren Buffett doesn't guide NEAM's buying and selling activity as he does Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio, what New England Asset Management buys is, ultimately, owned by Buffett's company. You could say it's Buffett's own secret portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat follows are three surprising stocks you probably had no clue Warren Buffett technically owns.\n\nWalt Disney\nThe first shocker is that Warren Buffett's company is actually the owner of 15,154 shares of Walt Disney (DIS -0.08%), courtesy of New England Asset Management. Walt Disney is what I'd regard as Warren Buffett's biggest investing mistake.\nIn 1966, Warren Buffett and a consortium of investors purchased 5% of Disney, which equated to a $4 million investment.\u00a0 At the time, Disney was an up-and-coming theme-park operator with proprietary film content that didn't come close to matching its content library today. Buffett and his investors sold this 5% stake in Disney just one year later for a 50% return. Had Buffett and his consortium stuck around, this stake would be worth almost $9.9 billion today.\nThe interesting thing is that Warren Buffett owned shares of Walt Disney a second time -- and, once again, chose not to stick around all that long. When Disney acquired Capital Cities/ABC in 1996, which Berkshire Hathaway held a position in, Buffett's company came into possession of roughly 73.84 million split-adjusted shares of the \"House of Mouse.\" These shares, which were sold by Buffett and his team between 1999 and 2000, would be worth approximately $8 billion today. Including dividends paid, the Oracle of Omaha missed out on more than $19 billion in gains.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut thanks to NEAM, Warren Buffett indirectly has a chance to redeem himself.\nWalt Disney's most exciting growth driver at the moment looks to be its streaming operations. In less than three years following its launch, Disney+ amassed more than 164 million subscribers, which demonstrates the lure of the Disney brand.\u00a0 If CEO Bob Iger is successful at increasing prices for Disney's streaming platforms while being mindful of expenses, profitability for this segment shouldn't be too far off.\n\nNewmont\nA second stock you'll be jaw-dropped to find as a holding by Warren Buffett's company is gold miner Newmont (NEM 0.67%). New England Asset Management held 37,328 shares of Newmont as of the end of the third quarter.\nTo not beat around the bush, the Oracle of Omaha dislikes gold as an investment. According to Buffett:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Gold] gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head.\n\nAs you can gather, Buffett is a fan of businesses that produce ongoing utility and value. Whether it's utilities that provide electricity, oil companies that fuel your car, food and beverage businesses that fill your belly, or banks that create pathways for homeownership, the Oracle of Omaha only invests in businesses that can continually provide utility.\nNevertheless, gold is revered as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, which is what's made it such a popular holding for much of the past year. Newmont is the world's largest gold producer, with annual production expected to average around 8 million gold equivalent ounces through 2031. The company is also sitting on 96 million ounces of gold reserves and countless projects that should take its production well into the 2040s.\u00a0\nGiven that gold stocks historically perform their best during the very early stages of a new bull market, we're getting close to the sweet spot for Newmont and its mining peers.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\nThe third surprising stock you'd never have guessed Warren Buffett owns is graphics card and semiconductor solutions specialist Nvidia (NVDA -2.56%). New England Asset Management's third-quarter 13F showed it held 3,050 shares of Nvidia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason this is a such a shock is simple: Warren Buffett generally avoids tech stocks. With the exception of Apple, pretty much every other tech-oriented company in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio has been added by one of Buffett's investing lieutenants (Todd Combs and Weschler). The Oracle of Omaha has never had the time nor drive to keep up on the changing tech landscape, and has preferred devoting most of his energy and research to the financial and consumer staples sectors.\nOn the bright side, Nvidia is a beast in the graphics processing unit (GPU) arena. It accounts for close to 20% of the global GPU market and an astounding 80% of global discrete graphic cards.\u00a0 The latter being GPUs that are separate from the processor. Maintaining such a large role in the GPU space has allowed Nvidia to become a major player in the gaming industry.\n\nBut things are far from perfect for one of the United States' largest publicly traded companies. For instance, U.S. regulators barred Nvidia from shipping its artificial intelligence-driven A100 GPUs to China for security reasons in early September. Even though Nvidia developed a slower GPU for China, the end result could be a significant reduction in expected sales.\u00a0\nWe're also seeing macroeconomic weakness in key markets for Nvidia. A bear market in cryptocurrencies has limited the purchase of mining solutions, while COVID-19 vaccine uptake has caused gaming GPU demand to fall off a cliff. Gaming revenue fell 51% from the prior-year period in the fiscal third quarter.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nLong story short, I wouldn't expect Buffett to be championing Nvidia as a buy for Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio anytime soon.\n\n\n\nSean Williams has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Originally revealed back in October as the RTX 4080 12GB that was later \"unlaunched,\" the core specs and hardware didn't change \u2014 only the price and name are new. Following in the footsteps of the more potent RTX 4090 and RTX 4080, the cards officially go on sale tomorrow, January 5, 2023. Except reviews can go up a day early, so potential buyers at least get some advice before taking the plunge.\n\nWill the RTX 4070 Ti rank among the best graphics cards? That's a tough call, which we'll get into more during this review. What we can say is that, based on our GPU benchmarks hierarchy testing, it's faster than most of the 30-series offerings and basically ties the RTX 3090, at a lower price point. That's the good news. The bad news is that this is by far the most expensive xx70-class graphics card Nvidia has ever released. We've gone from $329 on a GTX 970 to $379 on the GTX 1070, then $499 for the RTX 2070 and 2070 Super, $499 for the RTX 3070 as well with $599 for the 3070 Ti, and now we're looking at $799 for an RTX 4070 Ti.\n\nPut that way, what we're really talking about feels a lot more like a replacement for the RTX 3080 12GB. Nvidia never gave that an official MSRP, but we briefly saw prices dip into the $700\u2013$800 range before supply apparently dried up. Absent the cryptocurrency boom of 2020\u20132022, the 3080 12GB and 3080 Ti probably would have landed in the $800\u2013$900 range. Now Ethereum has gone proof of stake and cryptocurrency mining profits are in the toilet, but it seems we're still looking at mining-inflated graphics card prices.\n\nThere are alternative ways of looking at things as well. We don't have hard numbers on how many cards have been sold, but all of the RTX 4090 cards at retail are still selling for over $2,000. RTX 4080 cards meanwhile seem to be relatively available at close to their base $1,200 price, but none of them are actually selling at or below that price point. The same goes for AMD's new RX 7900 XTX and RX 7900 XT, the latter of which can be found for $899 while the former is mostly sold out and often costs $1,200 or more.\n\nIn other words, there's clearly enough demand from people with deep pockets that newer, faster graphics cards at lower prices is a fantasy we're not going to experience. We've heard some speculation that RTX 4090 prices in particular are greatly inflated due to demand from the professional sector \u2014 if all you want is a number crunching monster for AI research, the 4090 at $2,000 is actually a great deal compared to $5,000\u2013$10,000 for actual professional cards that may not even be as fast! But how far down the stack will that go before such professionals simply opt for a faster card?\n\nHopefully not down to the $800 range, and equally hopefully we won't get scalpers trying to buy up every card and then resell them on eBay. But we probably need a lot more than hope for either of those to be likely.\n\nWe've previously covered Nvidia's Ada Lovelace architecture, so the only real question now is how performance scales down to the AD104 GPU with fewer shaders, less memory, less cache, a narrower memory interface, etc. Leaked details from the rebadged RTX 4080 12GB suggest it will be around 20\u201325 percent slower than the RTX 4080\u2026 which puts it in RTX 3090 territory. Here's a look at the specifications for the new and previous generation Nvidia cards, alongside AMD's new RX 7900 offerings.\u00a0Swipe to scroll horizontallyNvidia and AMD GPU SpecificationsGraphics CardRTX 4070 TiRTX 4090RTX 4080RTX 3090 TiRTX 3080 TiRTX 3080RTX 3070 TiRX 7900 XTXRX 7900 XTArchitectureAD104AD102AD103GA102GA102GA102GA104Navi 31Navi 31Process TechnologyTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NSamsung 8NSamsung 8NSamsung 8NSamsung 8NTSMC N5 + N6TSMC N5 + N6Transistors (Billion)35.876.345.928.328.328.317.445.6 + 6x 2.0545.6 + 5x 2.05Die size (mm^2)294.5608.4378.6628.4628.4628.4392.5300 + 222300 + 185SMs6012876848068489684GPU Shaders76801638497281075210240870461441228810752Tensor Cores240512304336320272192N/AN/ARay Tracing \"Cores\"6012876848068489684Boost Clock (MHz)261025202505186016651710176525002400VRAM Speed (Gbps)212122.4211919192020VRAM (GB)12241624121082420VRAM Bus Width192384256384384320256384320L2 Cache48726466549680ROPs801761121121129696192192TMUs240512304336320272192384336TFLOPS FP3240.182.648.74034.129.821.761.451.6TFLOPS FP16 (FP8/INT8)321 (641)661 (1321)390 (780)160 (320)136 (273)119 (238)87 (174)123 (123)103 (103)Bandwidth (GBps)50410087171008912760608960800TBP (watts)285450320450350320290355300Launch DateJan-23Oct-22Nov-22Mar-22Jun-21Sep-20Jun-21Dec-22Dec-22Launch Price$799 $1,599 $1,199 $1,999 $1,199 $699 $599 $999 $899 We've mentioned before that Nvidia appears to be attempting to stretch out the range of performance offered with the RTX 40-series, and the same thing happened with the RTX 30-series. From the fastest to slowest RTX 20-series GPU, the RTX 2080 Ti was about double the performance of the RTX 2060. Meanwhile, last generation's RTX 3090 Ti was three times as fast as the RTX 3050. At present, we don't even have a vanilla RTX 4070, never mind a future RTX 4050, and we're already looking at potentially double the performance from the bigger and more expensive RTX 4090.\n\nThings of course won't scale perfectly, but the 4090 does have more than twice as many GPU shaders, Tensor cores, RT cores, etc. It also has exactly twice as much memory and memory bandwidth, but only 50% more L2 cache. There will be workloads \u2014 stuff like AI training and inference comes to mind \u2014 where the card that costs twice as much will deliver twice the performance while consuming twice as much power. But we'll get to the benchmarks soon enough.\n\nWhat about AMD's RX 7900 series cards? The RX 7900 XT costs $100 more than the 4070 Ti, and at least in several areas it looks to have superior specs. The teraflops figures favor AMD's GPU by nearly 30%, for example, and AMD gives users 67% more memory with 59% more memory bandwidth. There's little doubt that Nvidia will still pull ahead when it comes to ray tracing performance \u2014 and deep learning workloads \u2014 but for rasterization AMD might come out ahead. But then we also have to ask: Do you want to spend nearly $1,000 for a graphics card that relegates ray tracing to second tier status?\n\nSure, we get it: There still aren't many games where ray tracing is required, and quite a few games that support ray tracing only seem to use it for modest improvements in image fidelity while dropping performance quite a bit. But there are games like Control and Cyberpunk 2077 where it can make a difference, so spending a bit more \u2014 or in this case, potentially saving money \u2014 to get a superior feature set is something plenty of gamers seem willing to do.Image 1 of 2The RTX 4070 Ti has five Graphics Processing Clusters (GPCs), 60 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), and 48MB of L2 cache. It's the full AD104 implementation, except that three of the NVDEC units are disabled.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The full AD104 implementation includes four NVDEC units, likely for use in future professional cards that focus on video streaming applications.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Besides all the usual graphics hardware, Nvidia's latest Ada Lovelace GPUs have a few extras. AMD still doesn't have a Tensor core equivalent \u2014 its AI Accelerators share the same execution units as the GPU shaders \u2014 which means in FP16 workloads the 4070 Ti has potentially triple the throughput of the RX 7900 XT. And for AI inference work that can leverage the FP8 hardware, Nvidia doubles performance yet again.\n\nThere's also the enhanced Optical Flow Accelerator (OFA), which powers the DLSS 3 algorithm and may be used for other video related tasks. Nvidia says that over 50 games with DLSS 3 are in the works, with about 15 currently available. Even better news is that every one of those games with DLSS 3 also supports DLSS 2 and Reflex, which means anyone with an RTX card can benefit \u2014 just not with Frame Generation.\n\nIf you're interested in AI research, especially without forking over the money for a professional workstation, Nvidia's GeForce cards certainly warrant a look. There are quite a few AI tools already available, including things like Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, and more. It's possible to get those tools running on non-Nvidia GPUs, but after months of looking for a good AI benchmark, I can say that many of the open source tools focus on Nvidia while AMD (or Intel) GPUs are at best an afterthought.\u00a0MORE:\u00a0Best Graphics CardsMORE:\u00a0GPU Benchmarks and HierarchyMORE:\u00a0All Graphics Content\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n6\n\n\n7\n\n\n8\n\n\n9\n\n\n\nCurrent page:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Review\n\n\n\nNext Page Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti Design and Assembly\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n4K\nGeForce RTX 4070\ngtx\nBenchmark\nGeForce\nrtx\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (98)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

I use it more as \"acceptable but not awesome.\" I wouldn't call an excellent dinner \"palatable,\" I'd say it was delicious or some other word that means I really like it. Taco Bell is palatable, for example. So is Wendy's. But neither is great, just like an $800 replacement that's only moderately faster than the outgoing $800 cards.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJarredWaltonGPU\n\n\nsabicao said:I really do feel Toms', Anand and all the other highly regarded tech sites have an obligation to express how stupid these prices are.

Newcomers cannot be led to believe that it is ok for a x70 series to cost 700 bucks. No freaking way.They're only \"wrong\" when everyone refuses to pay them. Unfortunately, we're being shown time and time again that there are apparently enough people willing to spend $800 for this level of performance that we'll continue to see them. As stated in the conclusion, if Nvidia had tried to sell this as a $600 card, or a $500 card, and then scalpers just snapped them all up and asked for $800 or more, we'd be right back where we started. Except then we'd have scalpers contributing nothing and taking a chunk of the profits.\n\nSo yeah, don't buy a $800 card if you don't want to spend that much. Wait for prices to come down, or go with a cheaper and slower alternative. But if others keep paying a lot more than you're willing to pay, nothing is going to change.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhannibal\n\n\nCheaper than expected\u2026 \nLets see what real price end up after two to tree weeks\u2026 when those few \u201dcheap\u201d MSRP GPUs run out\u2026 $1200?\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElusive Ruse\n\n\nHmmm, appreciate the review Jared, yet I gotta object to your \"almost\" endearing tone and conclusion.

They're still both in stupid territory, though.\n\nI mostly agree with everything, so nothing more to add, really. Maybe just the mention this card won't have an FE (as I've read and heard), so the first batch of $800 cards will last whatever the AIBs want them to be on shelves. Which, I'm sure, won't be long. This card will be over $850 for sure.\n\nRegards.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoadedaxe\n\n\nsabicao said:I really do feel Toms', Anand and all the other highly regarded tech sites have an obligation to express how stupid these prices are.

As long as everyone keeps paying these prices, Nvidia is going to keep charging them.

It still has quite some performance, and the 4K FPS are not bad as such. The numbers just don't convince me that it wouldn't drop below 60 (real) FPS at 4K with the next round of game releases, so I wouldn't pick it up for 4K at that price. \n\nAnd scalpers sure may be an issue, but if the RTX 4070 Ti is meant as \"the entry-level GPU for 4K gaming, or for top 1440p gaming\", then it wouldn't necessarily be a miscalculation if it would be produced in higher numbers, so that scalpers would have a garage full of them while they still would be in-stock at the retailers.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 98 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeydous NJ98-CP V2 HE Review: Dedicated calculators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicron 4600 2TB SSD Review: The New Baseline in SSDs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogitech G Pro X Superlight 2 Dex Review: A very close second\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASRock PG-1600G Phantom Gaming power supply review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID-Cooling FX 360 INF Pink Review: Stylishly pink, but loud in more ways than one\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewSonic XG2536 25-inch FHD IPS 280 Hz gaming monitor review: Incredibly quick and value priced\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWD Black SN7100 SSD Review: The power efficiency king, with caveats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D Review: Stunning gaming performance meets top-tier productivity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMacBook Air (M4, 2025) review: Blue skies ahead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple Mac Studio (Early 2025) Review: Renewed vigor with M4 Max and M3 Ultra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

See our ethics statement.Ana Diaz (she/her) is a culture writer at Polygon, covering internet culture, fandom, and video games. Her work has previously appeared at NPR, Wired, and The Verge.Nvidia has released its most unnerving AI-powered software yet. A new camera feature added in a recent update to the Nvidia Broadcast app edits a live feed so that it looks like someone is always looking into the camera, even if that\u2019s not the case. It\u2019s an unsettling feature that had me shouting and screaming the first time I saw it in real time.Known as Eye Contact, the feature debuted earlier this month as part of the 1.4 patch for Nvidia Broadcast, software that enhances video for livestreaming and videoconferencing. Nvidia said in a blog post that Eye Contact is intended for content creators who want to maintain eye contact with the camera at all times, even if they\u2019re, say, looking at notes or a script off screen. Now that it\u2019s been out for a few weeks, we have a better idea of what it can do.In one interesting demo of the feature posted on Twitter, you can see scenes from Jurassic Park edited with Eye Contact so that the actors are always looking (mostly) at the camera. It\u2019s weird and off-putting! Probably even if you\u2019ve never seen the movie before! It\u2019s like the person was so preoccupied with whether or not they could do this that they didn\u2019t stop to think if they should...I hopped into a video call with a Polygon colleague to see Eye Contact in action myself. It felt uncanny, even though I was just looking at my co-worker the entire time. I think it\u2019s partly because completely uninterrupted eye contact doesn\u2019t feel natural or normal if you\u2019re having a casual conversation. Also, the software isn\u2019t perfect \u2014 Nvidia says it\u2019s in the beta stage \u2014 so at points he would turn his head and look to the side, and his eyes would snap back to staring directly at the camera; it sort of looked like he was a possessed character from a horror movie.The Eye Contact feature is yet another example of AI becoming easily usable by everyday consumers. ChatGPT, which can be used for a variety of applications like writing essays, became an overnight sensation due to its natural-language output. Other software like DALL-E, Midjourney, and Free AI Art Generator is being used to create memes and recreate the look of certain directors\u2019 films.If you, too, would like to use this AI black magic, all you need to do is download Nvidia Broadcast \u2014 although your computer will need certain hardware for it to work, including an Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics card; you can view the full system requirements here.See More: CultureGamingPCMost PopularBrandon Sanderson shared a list of his 10 favorite games, and they make perfect senseBring back the 2000s-era sci-fi flopbusterThere will likely never be a Hunger Games sequel, says Suzanne Collins\u2019 editorThe Lord of the Rings illustrated box set is on sale for its lowest price everIndie game\u2019s \u2018lesbian toggle\u2019 makes it hilariously unplayablePatch NotesThe best of Polygon in your inbox, every Friday.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has quietly started selling its\u00a0RTX 6000 Ada Generation\u00a0graphics card. Based on the AD102 GPU with 18,176 CUDA cores enabled, this is the 'fattest' AD102 configuration available to date \u2014 142 of the 144 Streaming Multiprocessors are enabled. Rated for 300W of power consumption, the board is designed for computer aided design, digital content creation, virtual desktop infrastructure, and other professional applications.\n\nPricing varies pretty widely, ranging from $6,800 to $8,600 depending on the retailer. Nvidia has the card listed at $6,800, with a limit of five per customer \u2014 just in case you're trying to put together a bunch of workstations. Other outlets like CDW are marking it up an additional 25% or so, with availability set for 4\u20136 weeks out.\n\nNvidia's RTX 6000 Ada based on the AD102 GPU has 18,176 CUDA cores enabled, and while Nvidia doesn't specify clocks anywhere that we can find, it's partners like PNY and Leadtek quote to 91.1 FP32 TFLOPS of compute performance. That equates to a GPU boost clock of 2505 MHz and is about 10% higher than the\u00a0GeForce RTX 4090, which features 16,384 CUDA cores. However, there are clear differences between the RTX 6000 Ada and the consumer-focused RTX 4090.\n\nThe RTX 6000 Ada is designed for professional applications, and so it carries 48GB of GDDR6 memory with ECC enabled, featuring a peak memory bandwidth of 960 MB/s \u2014 slightly lower than 1,008 MB/s offered by the GeForce RTX 4090.\u00a0That suggests Nvidia is using 20 Gbps GDDR6 memory rather than the slightly faster 21 Gbps GDDR6X, but power use may also be slightly lower on the GDDR6 chips.The RTX 6000 comes equipped with four DisplayPort 1.4a connectors that can drive four 4K or 5K displays (4K at 240 Hz is supported via DSC), or two 8K displays (120 Hz with DSC).\n\nOne of the intriguing things about the RTX 6000 Ada is its power consumption. Despite its higher compute performance and 48GB of memory onboard, the RTX 6000 Ada is rated for just 300W of power, down from the 450W rating on the gamer-oriented GeForce RTX 4090. Both GPUs have similar official boost clocks of around 2.5 GHz, though the minimum guaranteed clocks on the RTX 6000 are lower and we suspect it won't clock quite as high in heavy computational workloads.(Image credit: Nvidia)Because of its relatively limited power consumption, the RTX 6000 Ada Generation graphics card comes with a dual-wide cooling system and a blower fan to ensure that it fits into workstations and servers. It uses one 12VHPWR (16-pin CEM 5.0 PCIe) power connector for power delivery, so it will require an appropriate cable adapter to fit into existing machines that do not have a native 16-pin connector.\n\nAnother interesting thing about Nvidia's RTX 6000 Ada professional graphics card is its price. Nvidia sells the board for\u00a0$6,800, slightly lower than the $6,999 launch price of its RTX A6000 predecessor. But value added reseller CDW lists the product for\u00a0$8,615, while a Japanese retailer found by\u00a0@momomo_us lists the unit for\u00a0$8,524\u00a0without tax. We are not sure why resellers are charging so much more than Nvidia itself, but for now it looks like it makes the most sense to buy the RTX 6000 Ada board directly from the Nvidia.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nWorkstation\nGeForce RTX 3090\nCUDA\nGeForce\nrtx\nHardware\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (16)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

Used to be their pro cards ran DP at 1/2 the 32-bit rate but the spec sheet for the RTX 6000 doesn't mention it. That, and some error correction and other goodies, justified the cost.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAr558\n\n\nYeh this is just stupid, although I doubt anyone will actually accidentally by a $7k GPU without doing the research.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJDJJ\n\n\nImagine paying $7000-$8000 and it doesn't have DisplayPort 2.1. Jensen is really being stubborn about this. Sure, there's been a bit of a catch 22 about adoption...DP 2.1 has been out a few years now, but the card makers got complacent with crypto sales, and the monitor makers weren't making the update without supporting cards. But AMD cards now come with DP 2.1 support, and monitors from Samsung and others are rolling out with 2.1 support as we speak.\n\nWe've now hit the upper bounds of what DSC compression can do with DP 1.4a's limited bandwidth. This is especially true for creators who have demanding requirements, e.g. a larger color space, etc. But even more problematic is that these newer cards are being held back. We are already seeing the 4090 bump up against the upper limits of 1.4a's bandwidth, and DSC does come at a cost as well ... there's no such thing as a free lunch. While many consumers won't notice the problems and limitations of compression and/or bandwidth limits playing PUBG, professionals should be hesitating about paying a premium over non-Ada versions of pro cards, or upgrading with such a handicap and lack of future-proofing. \n\nI can only think either Jensen and Team Green have gotten so complacent they think as long as you post a bump in processing power, they'll sell out, even if the interface becomes a problem. Or maybe marketing is worried about the optics of updating to 2.1 in the pro card, while assuring the masses that 1.4a is all they need, having misjudged where the market was moving while trying to maximize profits in the wake of the loss of crypto sales. We can only guess at their motives, but at the end of the day, missing the boat on DP 2.1 will probably mean some professionals will see insufficient improvement in this card vs a previous model, especially at the price premium, to justify purchasing now. \n\nI'll be curious to see what happens when AMD fixes their alleged issues with clock speeds on RDNA 3 and puts out a contender to challenge or surpass RTX 4090, such as an RX 7990 XTX rumored to be planned for 2023. If that forces NVIDIA to put out a 4090 Ti, it will certainly need to support DP 2.1 in order to compete, and to show actual gains over the 4090. Where will that put the RX 6000 Ada? Will they quietly update that as well?\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyaraM\n\n\nThis seriously is confusing. Who even thought that up?\n\nJDJJ said:Imagine paying $7000-$8000 and it doesn't have DisplayPort 2.1. Jensen is really being stubborn about this. Sure, there's been a bit of a catch 22 about adoption...DP 2.1 has been out a few years now, but the card makers got complacent with crypto sales, and the monitor makers weren't making the update without supporting cards. But AMD cards now come with DP 2.1 support, and monitors from Samsung and others are rolling out with 2.1 support as we speak.\n\nWe've now hit the upper bounds of what DSC compression can do with DP 1.4a's limited bandwidth. This is especially true for creators who have demanding requirements, e.g. a larger color space, etc. But even more problematic is that these newer cards are being held back. We are already seeing the 4090 bump up against the upper limits of 1.4a's bandwidth, and DSC does come at a cost as well ... there's no such thing as a free lunch. While many consumers won't notice the problems and limitations of compression and/or bandwidth limits playing PUBG, professionals should be hesitating about paying a premium over non-Ada versions of pro cards, or upgrading with such a handicap and lack of future-proofing. \n\nI can only think either Jensen and Team Green have gotten so complacent they think as long as you post a bump in processing power, they'll sell out, even if the interface becomes a problem.

They seem to concentrate on the successor.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriesiansam\n\n\nKamen Rider Blade said:Whomever came up with the name just made things needlessly confusing.\n\nWhy the eff are they calling it the RTX 6000 when their mainline consumer Video Cards are called RTX #000 series?\n\nWe're currently on the RTX 4000 series\n\nIn 2x generations, there is going to be a literal name collision with RTX 6000, unless they plan on starting a brand new naming scheme all together.\nGranted that has happened before, but still.\n\nI thought they planned on Using <Letter Generation>#### as their new Professional WorkStation card Product Naming Scheme.\n\nAfter 1 generation of use, they throw it away?\n\nNow they're just calling it RTX 6000 Ada Generation ?\nHow is that a good naming scheme?\n\nIt was better when they used the Quadro name and everybody knew what was their Professional WorkStation line.anonymousdude said:To make matters worse there's an Quadro RTX 6000 that's fairly recent too. So you've got Quadro RTX 6000, RTX A6000, and now RTX 6000 Ada Generation. Absolute genius here by Nvidia.Kamen Rider Blade said:To: Jensen Huang, CEO of nVIDIA.\n\nFIRE the idiot on your Marketing Team, whomever was the one who that thought this naming scheme was a good idea, they deserve to be FIRED ASAP!Anyone actually in the market for this kind of GPU, will have done their research and know exactly what they are buying.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKamen Rider Blade\n\n\nFriesiansam said:Anyone actually in the market for this kind of GPU, will have done their research and know exactly what they are buying.Maybe, but it also leads to needless confusion.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJDJJ\n\n\nKyaraM said:This seriously is confusing. Who even thought that up?\nWhat are you confused about? Linus Tech Tips did a video about the 4090 saturating the bandwidth available on DP 1.4a with DSC compression, and the downsides to DSC. From this point forward, any card with better performance will need more bandwidth to see those gains realized on the screen and justify a higher cost.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 16 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm debuts new Snapdragon G handheld gaming PC chips to compete with Intel and AMD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina to spend $55 billion on R&D in 2025 \u2014 Semiconductor, AI and quantum computing fields to benefit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBambu Lab Announces New Printer: H2D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotherboard dies after marathon 100-hour BIOS update process, vigil attended by thousands online\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD boasts its Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is up to 12.2x faster than Lunar Lake in AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreeware image editor GIMP 3.0 arrives after seven years of incubation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle's Gemini 2.0 Flash is reportedly capable of removing watermarks \u2014 Also found to generate AI celebrity photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi and ChatGPT bring AI conversations to your retro rotary phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI Afterburner update enables RTX 50 series owners to push their GDDR7 VRAM up to 36 GT/s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD manager reports 45% GPU retail market share in Japan \u2014 Eyes 70% as the next target\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

We\u2019re also deep diving on new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.\nArtist Ducky 3D creates immersive experiences through vibrant visuals and beautiful 3D environments in the alien-inspired animation Stylized Alien Landscape \u2014 this week In the NVIDIA Studio.\nDucky 3D is a modern Renaissance man who works with musicians from around the world, creating tour packages and visual art related to the music industry. As a 3D fanatic who specializes in Blender, he often guides emerging and advanced 3D artists to new creative heights. It\u2019s no surprise that his weekly YouTube tutorials have garnered over 400,000 subscribers.\nStylized Alien Landscape is uniquely individualistic and was built entirely in Blender using geometry nodes, or geo nodes.\nGeo nodes can add organic style and customization to Blender scenes and animation.\nThe use of geo nodes in Blender has recently skyrocketed. That\u2019s because they virtually make modeling a completely procedural process \u2014 allowing for non-linear, non-destructive workflows and the instancing of objects \u2014 to create incredibly detailed scenes using small amounts of data. Geo nodes can also organically modify all types of geometry, including meshes, curves, volumes, instances and more. Many of these were edited in the making of Stylized Alien Landscape.\nDucky 3D opened a new scene, created a simple cube and applied several popular geo nodes, including random value, triangulate and dual mesh. By simple trial and error with numeric values, he was able to create a provocative, alien-inspired visual.\n\u201cI use geometry nodes to take advantage of the dual mesh, which creates organic shapes by manipulating with simple deformations,\u201d he said.\nDucky 3D\u2019s GeForce 4090 RTX GPU ensured smooth movement in the viewport with virtually no noise.\nSimply adding a transform node to the mix got the animation going. Ducky 3D then copied all nodes and scaled the duplicated render to create two animations rotating simultaneously.\nNext, Ducky 3D turned his focus to lighting the object, selecting the Blender Cycles renderer to do so.\n\u201cRendering lighting is drastically better in Cycles, but you do you,\u201d he said with candor.\nBlender Cycles RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in the viewport unlocks interactive, photoreal rendering for modeling and animation work.\nDucky 3D applies shading nodes to \u201cStylized Alien Landscape.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nHere, Ducky 3D can quickly create more realism in two ways: adding depth of field by playing with distance options and the flat shaded view, and bringing the background out of focus and the object into focus.\nVolume \u201cjust makes things look cool,\u201d Ducky 3D added. Selecting the world and clicking principled volume made the scene nearly photorealistic.\nWith the help of geo nodes, Ducky 3D refined the texture to his desired effect, using the bump node, color ramp and noise texture.\nFor more on the making of Stylized Alien Landscape, check out the video below.\n\n\u201cI needed my viewport to perform well enough to see detail through the added volume,\u201d he said. \u201cThank goodness for the AI-powered NVIDIA OptiX ray tracing API that my GeForce RTX 4090 GPU enables.\u201d\nDucky 3D accomplished the slightly odd atmosphere that he wanted for his piece through the addition of fog.\n\u201cFog is tough to render, and the GPU helped me see my viewport clearly,\u201d he said.\n3D artist Ducky 3D\u2019s workstation.\u00a0\n\nFor more Blender tutorials, check out Ducky 3D\u2019s YouTube channel or the NVIDIA Studio Blender playlist.\nEnter the #NewYearNewArt Challenge\u00a0\nA new year comes with new art, and we\u2019d love to see yours!

In that time, we\u2019ve seen a slew of competitors start up \u2013 ranging from Microsoft xCloud to Rainway to Google Stadia, some of which have since shut down. After an eternity in beta, GeForce Now launched to the public in 2020 \u2013 just in time to catch the coattails of other early streamers like Microsoft and Stadia. In all that time, the quietly capable GeForce Now never seemed to claim mindshare or word of mouth.That\u2019s due in part to GeForce Now taking a completely different tack to streaming. GeForce Now streams the PC games you already own. Nvidia isn\u2019t running a games store here, instead, it connects to your existing digital game libraries. It uses these digital game stores to verify your ownership of the games, then lets you play them on just about any device.Nvidia GeForce Now \u2013 Screenshots12 ImagesAnd because the games are cloud-based, there\u2019s no updating or maintenance required. But it also means only select games are supported. It\u2019s effectively free, at least for an hour session at a time, but since launch the subscription prices have gotten a bit more expensive \u2013 there\u2019s a $9.99 subscription that\u2019s replaced the previous $4.99 option. This tier, dubbed \u201cPriority\u201d gives you access to premium servers, ray tracing in games that support it, 6-hour play sessions, with up to 1080p resolution and 60fps.In late 2022, Nvidia also upgraded its highest-performance tier, \u201cUltimate.\u201d For $19.99 a month, you get access to a 4080 rig (when available), the fastest servers available, an 8-hour session length, up to 4K resolution, and up to 120fps. (If you purchase a 6-month subscription instead of monthly, you can save some money: $8.33 a month for Priority or $16.67 a month for Ultimate.)GeForce Now \u2013 Setup and InterfaceWhen we first reviewed GeForce Now, the service supported just north of 400 games. These days, it's even more packed with more than 1500 to choose from. It\u2019s also become much easier to find the games you\u2019re looking for. There\u2019s a carousel of hot games, a dedicated search bar, and lockers that spotlight developers, genres, and more. The library is much more impressive than the paltry selection once found on Google Stadia, but the offerings feels a bit more limited than Xbox Cloud Gaming. Of the 76 games currently in my Steam library, only 26 were available to play on GeForce Now. It\u2019s still disappointing when you\u2019re amped for a certain game, only to find it not available on the service. For instance, I was very interested in putting the latency through its paces by testing out Elden Ring, but it was not available. Neither was Vampire Survivors, Modern Warfare II, or FIFA 23. Still, GeForce Now is no slouch. You can check the long list of supported games here.Running games is significantly smoother than it once was. Now, instead of performing a game-by-game check to confirm your ownership, GeForce simply connects to your Ubisoft, Steam, and Epic Games accounts. Games that are not in your library are simply unavailable to launch, replacing a green \u201cPlay\u201d button with a gray \u201cGet\u201d button. Once you\u2019ve tapped that play button, the screen chugs along for a minute with a display that\u2019s a dead ringer for the AOL 56k modem dial-up connection. That said, connecting to GeForce\u2019s servers is also much faster than it used to be, so this antiquated UI is almost unnoticeable. Once you\u2019ve connected with your virtual rig, things get a little weird. GeForce opens what looks like a virtualized desktop, complete with a virtualized window of Steam, Epic Games Store or whatever client you own the game at. (It\u2019s unclear how GeForce Now determines which store to load up if the game is available on multiple stores.) This is when GeForce Now asks you to log into your Steam, Epic, etc. account to verify that you own the game you want to play \u2013 two factor authentication and all. Once you\u2019re finished authenticating, click play to start the game, just like when using Steam or another client on a regular PC. Occasionally, when you start a game, you\u2019ll need to wait for a rig (hence the subscription for priority access to servers). However, when testing the Ultimate subscription, I never ran into any queues. Each platform I tested performed its setups just a little differently. Each was relatively painless, and Nvidia has taken significant steps to streamline this process. Still, there are a few oddities. For instance, when loading a Steam game on Nvidia Shield, there\u2019s a pretty sizable delay after you hit start. At one point, I was certain the system had frozen, only to have the game load up about 60 seconds later. Another quirk is that once you\u2019ve loaded into your virtual machine, you can only play the game that you launched it with. For example, if you select The Witcher 3 in GeForce Now and launch into the virtualized Steam page, but then decide you want to play Cuphead instead, you have to fully exit out of the virtual machine and re-launch Cuphead from GeForce Now. From a user experience standpoint, things could definitely be streamlined. As it is, it feels like it\u2019s still in beta.And while iOS gamers can access GeForce Now from their devices' browsers, actually setting it up is a bit of a pain. In order to test GeForce Now on my iPhone, I was forced to confirm my email address three separate times \u2013 and then games refused to load at all. After about 20 minutes, I successfully loaded into The Witcher, only to have it drop my game and freeze the app. Subsequent testing was more successful, but required a strong internet connection \u2013 5G was a bit too spotty for a stable session.GeForce Now \u2013 Visual PerformanceEvery single person reading this is going to have a different experience with GeForce Now\u2019s performance. Whether you\u2019re gaming on Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or cellular, our environments are drastically varied, with different ISPs, routers, congestion, and limitations. Heck, I had a great experience in one room of my house, and a slipshod experience in another.Nvidia recommends a minimum of 15 Mbps for 60fps at 720p or 25 Mbps for 1080p, and suggests connecting via Ethernet for the best experience. To get the most of their Ultimate Tier, Nvidia recommends 45MBPs for 3840x2160 at 120fps, or 35 MBPs for iMacs or Macbooks. My office/game room is a small separate building, separated by about 50 feet of backyard. However, I use a 5Ghz Orbi router and satellite to connect to the internet, which got me measured speeds of 48.56 Mbps down and 41.63 Mbps up. This was more than enough for me to max out just about every setting for every game I played. And while there were a few \u201cspotty connection\u201d messages, more often than not it usually had zero impact on my gameplay. All around, it seems stability has been much improved since we first tested the service. I tested on a variety of different devices and internet speeds, and while I experienced a number of stutters, the graphics remained crisp \u2013 even shortly before booting me from the game. Rarely did gameplay devolve into the smudgy, cubist hellscape I\u2019ve grown accustomed to with poor connections. In my living room, with my Shield TV connected directly to an ethernet cord, nearly every game I played through GeForce Now looked stunning and played with indiscernible latency, even when I had RTX on, or bumped the fps to the maximum. In fact, I could barely tax it. At one point I simulated a congested network by streaming music to my Sonos, watching YouTube TV, and loading a video on my phone. Even with all that going on, games didn't falter in the slightest. Each game looked pristine and I had no noticeable latency. While I remain unconvinced that streaming would ever provide the crispest graphical fidelity, there were times playing GeForce Now when visuals looked about as good as they ever have. I often found myself scrutinizing water reflections, or the hair of a character in Witcher 3. And at times, I really felt that what I was experiencing was every bit as good as it would have been on my desktop. When I loaded up Tomb Raider, I was able to turn all the graphics options to ultra \u2013 textures, hair quality, you name it. Even with everything cranked to the max, the game still streamed without any lag or buffering. If you have a gaming PC, you\u2019re probably within your rights to be incredulous. After all, what\u2019s the difference between being stuck in the room with the fastest internet and the room with your gaming rig?But for that small contingency of gamers who 1) don\u2019t own a gaming PC, 2) want to play the best PC games, and 3) have blazing fast internet \u2013 GeForce Now still seems like a winner. In some ways, it\u2019s almost perfectly suited for Mac enthusiasts, though the in-your-face gamer aesthetic will doubtlessly turn many of them off. GeForce Now \u2013 Latency and BandwidthIf your internet is fast enough, it\u2019s really difficult to perceive any latency with GeForce Now. The only time I really felt any was when I was playing graphically-intensive games far from the router. GeForce Now has several settings that can improve or worsen latency as well. Streaming quality is decided by flipping a toggle: Balanced, Data Saver, Competitive, or Custom. The three generic options allow you to incentivize resolution, frames per second, or bandwidth. Nvidia approximates data usage, and it varies from 4 GBs to 16GBs per hour, depending on which Streaming Quality you select. Somewhat surprisingly, Competitive, which optimizes for 240fps, isn\u2019t intended to use the most data \u2013 it sits around an approximated 14 GB/hr. By dropping all the settings in the Custom tab, you can get the bandwidth usage down to what Nvidia suggests will be about 1 GB/hr.If your internet is barely capable of streaming games, none of these options are going to have much effect on your play. But, by setting Nvidia\u2019s Custom tab to that 1 GB/hr threshold, I was able to noticeably improve the quality of my experience during games with poor connections. It still wasn\u2019t perfect, but the experience was significantly improved, which bodes well for those with close-but-not-great connections.Purchasing GuideNvidia GeForce Now is available for PC, Mac, Android, and Shield TV. You can also play on iOS through a browser workaround. GeForce Now is available in three membership tiers. Free provides access to 1-hour session lengths on basic rigs. Priority provides RTX-capable rigs, 6-hour sessions, and up to 60 fps and 1080p resolution for $9.99 a month. And finally, the Ultimate tier provides the highest performance \u2013 RTX 4080 rigs (when available), 8-hour session length, access to the fastest servers, and up to 4K resolution and 120 fps.\nVerdictThere\u2019s something really special about playing a new PC game on a Mac that\u2019s almost a decade old. GeForce Now is still a genuinely exciting service, and the technology has only gotten better these last few years. When your internet connection is stellar, the experience is nearly on-par with desktop gaming. Unfortunately, despite its catalog growing nearly 400% since we first tested it, the holes are more noticeable now than ever.In This ArticleGeForce NowNVIDIANvidia GeForce Now Review (2023 Update)7Review scoringgoodGame streaming remains imperfect, but Nvidia\u2019s service gives a glimpse of the future at a very reasonable price.Nic VargusMore Reviews by Nic Vargus8Razer BlackWidow V4 Pro Gaming Keyboard Review8Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch Review (early 2023 model)6SteelSeries Apex 9 TKL Keyboard ReviewIGN LogoReviews\u2022Editor Columns\u2022News\u2022Guides\u2022How to Watch Guides\u2022Elden Ring DLC Interactive Map\u2022GTA 5 Cheats\u2022IGN Store\u2022HowLongToBeat\u2022Deals\u2022Contact Us\u2022IGN YouTube\u2022IGN TikTok\u2022IGN Twitter\u2022Map Genie"

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Founder and Principal Analyst,\nCambrian-AI Research LLCFollow AuthorJan 09, 2023, 07:14pm ESTShareSaveCommentThis article is more than 2 years old.The upcoming MI300, which will ship Latter this year after NVIDIA\u2019s Grace/Hopper Superchip, certainly has a shot at it. But there remain a lot of unknowns that will determine how well it performs for AI applications. And then there is Software. Yeah, Software. Lots of Software.\nAMD Instinct MI300 is a combination of its flagship CPU and GPU. AMD\n\nAt the 2023 CES Keynote address, AMD\u2019s CEO Dr. Lisa Su reiterated the company\u2019s plan to bring the Instinct MI300 to market by the end of this year, and showed the monster silicon in hand. The chip is certainly a major milestone for the company, and the industry in general, being to most aggressive chiplet implementation seen so far. Combining the industry\u2019s fastest CPU with a new GPU and HBM can bring many advantages, especially since it supports sharing that HBM memory across the compute complex. The idea of a big APU isn\u2019t new; I worked on the cancelled Big APU at AMD in 2014, and am a true believer. But combining the CPU and GPU onto a single package is just the start.\n\nWhat we know\nThe MI300 is a monster device, with nine TSMC\u2019s 5nm chiplets stacked over four 6-nm chiplets using 3D die stacking, all of which in turn will be paired with 128GB of on-package shared HBM memory to maximize bandwidth and minimize data movement. We note that NVIDIA\u2019s Grace/Hopper, which we expect will ship before the MI300, will still share 2 separate memory pools, using HBM for the GPU and much more DRAM for the CPU. AMD says they can run the MI300 without DRAM as an option, just using the HBM, which would be pretty cool, and very fast.\n\n\nAt 146B transistors, this device will take a lot of energy to power and cool; I\u2019ve seen estimates of 900 watts. But in this high-end of AI, that may not matter; NVIDIA\u2019s Grace-Hopper Superchip will consume about the same, and a Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine consumes 15kW. What matter is how much work that power enables.\nAMD will combine 24 EPYC CPU cores, an unknown number of CDNA 3 GPU cores, and 128GB of HBM3 all on ... [+] one chip.AMD\n\nAMD reiterated its claim from its Financial Analyst Day that the MI300 would outperform its own MI250x by 8X for AI, and deliver 5X the power efficiency. We would note here that this is actually a low bar, since the MI250 doesn\u2019t support native low-precision math below 16-bits. The new GPU will probably support 4- and 8-bit int and floating point, and will have four times the number of CUs, so 8X is a chip-shot AMD may exceed.\nAMD claims that the MI300 will outperform its current data center GPU by 8X, but that could mostly ... [+] be due to expected support of native low-precision math units.AMD\n\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\nWhat we don\u2019t know\nSo, from a hardware standpoint, the MI300 looks potentially very strong. but, as we have all seen with GPT-3 and now ChatGPT, large foundational language models are the new frontier for AI. To accelerate these, NVIDIA Hopper has a Transformer Engine which can speed training by as much as 9X and inference throughput by as much as 30X. The H100 Transformer Engine can mix 8-bit precision and 16-bit half-precision as needed, while maintaining accuracy. Will AMD have something similar? AMD fans better hope so; foundational models are the future of AI.\nWe also do not know how large a cluster footprint will be. Specifically, NVIDIA is going from an 8-node cluster to a 256-node shared memory cluster, greatly simplifying the deployment of large AI models. Similarly, we don\u2019\u2019t yet know how AMD will support larger nodes; different models require a different ratio of GPUs to CPUs. NVIDIA has shown that it will support 16 Hoppers per Grace CPU over NVLink.\nSoftware is a huge issue for AMD\nFinally in the software arena, I think we have to give AMD a hall-pass: given the AMD AI hardware performance to date, there hasn\u2019t been much serious work on the software stack. Yes, ROCm is a good start, but really only covers the basics, just getting code to work reasonably well on the hardware.The AMD ROCm software stack focusses on making DNN's run well on AMD Hardware.AMD\nConversely, consider ROCm compare to NVIDIA\u2019s software stack. The ROCm libraries are roughly equivalent to ONE of the little icons on the NVIDIA image below: CuDNN. NVIDIA doesn\u2019t even reference things like OpenMPI or debuggers and tracers; these are just table stakes. Or Kubernetes and Docker. AMD has no Triton Inference server, no RAPIDS, no TensorRT, etc., etc., etc. And there is no hint of anything approaching the 14 application frameworks on the top of NVIDIA\u2019s slide.NVIDIA software stack for AI and HPC forms a deep and wide protective moat.NVIDIA\nThat being said, some customers, such as OpenAI, have insulated themselves from vendor supplied software and it\u2019s opacity. Last year, OpenAI introduced the open source Triton software stack, circumventing the NVIDIA CUDA stack. One could imagine OpenAI could use its own software on the MI300 and be just fine. But for most everyone else, there is so much more to AI software than CUDA libraries.\nConclusions\nAMD has done an admirable job with MI300, leading the entire industry in embracing chiplet-based architectures. We believe that the MI300 will position AMD as a worthy alternative to Grace/Hopper, especially for those who prefer a non-NVIDIA platform. Consequently, AMD has the opportunity to be considered a viable second source for fast GPUs, especially when HPC is the number one application space and AI is an important but secondary consideration. AMD\u2019s Floating Point performance is now well ahead of NVIDIA. And Intel\u2019s combined CPU + GPU, called Falcon Shores, is slated for 2024, assuming no slips.\nBut what we and the market needs to see is real-world application performance. So, let\u2019s see some MLPerf, AMD!\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Disclosures: This article expresses the opinions of the author, and is not to be taken as advice to purchase from nor invest in the companies mentioned.

In just a short time, UF has become one of the top public colleges in the U.S. and developed a groundbreaking neural network for healthcare research.\nIn a recent episode of NVIDIA\u2019s AI Podcast, host Noah Kravitz sat down with Glover, who is also senior vice president of academic affairs at UF. The two discussed the university\u2019s efforts to put AI to work across all aspects of higher education, including a public-private partnership with NVIDIA that has helped transform UF into one of the leading AI universities in the country.\nJust a year after the partnership was unveiled in July 2020, UF rose to No. 5 on the U.S. News and World Report\u2019s list of the best public colleges in the U.S. The ranking was, in part, a recognition of UF\u2019s vision for infusing AI into its teaching and research.\nLast March, UF Health, the university\u2019s academic health center, teamed with NVIDIA to develop GatorTron, a neural network that generates synthetic clinical data researchers can use to train other AI models in healthcare.\nAccording to Glover, the success of UF\u2019s AI initiatives can be attributed to \u201ca combination of generous philanthropy, some good decisions, a little inspiration and a few miracles here and there along the way.\u201d\u00a0\nHe believes that the university\u2019s AI-powered vision has significantly impacted its teaching and research and will continue to do so in the future.\n\nThe AI Podcast \u00b7 UF Provost Joe Glover on Building a Leading AI University \u2013 Ep. 185\nYou Might Also Like\nArt(ificial) Intelligence: Pindar Van Arman Builds Robots That Paint\nPindar Van Arman, an American artist and roboticist, designs painting robots that explore the differences between human and computational creativity.

And DLSS 3 adds new Frame Generation technology to multiply performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 3 adoption continues to accelerate, with 6 new games adding support in the next few weeks,\u00a0 including Dying Light 2 Stay Human, HITMAN 3, Dakar Desert Rally, Deliver Us Mars, Marvel\u2019s Midnight Suns, and PERISH. \u00a0\nAnd there\u2019s a bunch more DLSS 3 games coming down the pipe, too, including Atomic Heart, ILL SPACE, THRONE AND LIBERTY, The Day Before, Tower of Fantasy, Warhaven, and Witchfire, which we announced earlier this month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 3 Multiplies Frame Rates\nPowered by new hardware capabilities of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture, DLSS 3 generates entirely new high quality frames, rather than just pixels.\nThrough a process detailed in full in our NVIDIA DLSS 3 article, DLSS 3 combines DLSS Super Resolution technology and DLSS Frame Generation to reconstruct 7/8ths of the displayed pixels, accelerating performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn GPU-limited games, DLSS 2 Super Resolution technology can increase your frame rates by up to 2X. With DLSS 3, we can multiply performance.\nCertain games make extensive use of the CPU which can limit performance. DLSS 3 operates on the GPU, bypassing CPU bottlenecks and boosting frame rates. In Microsoft Flight Simulator, for example, DLSS 3 boosts frame rates by up to 2X.\nDLSS 3 games are backwards compatible with DLSS 2 technology - developers simply integrate DLSS 3, and DLSS 2, also known as DLSS Super Resolution, is supported by default. Additionally, integrations of DLSS 3 also include NVIDIA Reflex, reducing system latency for all GeForce RTX users, making games more responsive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarvel\u2019s Midnight Suns DLSS 3 Update Available Now\nFrom the creators of the critically-acclaimed tactical XCOM series comes Marvel\u2019s Midnight Suns, where the rich story, character relationships, customization and progression of an RPG combines with the tactical strategy and combat mechanics of a card-based tactics game. Set in the darker side of the Marvel Universe, you will forge unbreakable bonds with legendary Marvel Super Heroes and dangerous supernatural warriors in the fight against the world\u2019s greatest threat yet\u2026 the demonic forces of Lilith and the elder god Chthon.\nLaunched last month to critical acclaim, VGC awarded Marvel\u2019s Midnight Suns with a 5 out of 5, calling it a \u201cmodern strategy classic;\u201d PC Gamer said it was \u201ccompletely brilliant\u201d and scored it an 88 out of 100, and Rock Paper Shotgun called it \u201cone of the best superhero games full stop.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt launch, Marvel\u2019s Midnight Suns boasted immersive, ray-traced ambient occlusion and ray-traced reflections effects, improving the fidelity and spectacle of battles, and adding detail to your exploration of the heroes\u2019 home base. To ensure the highest levels of performance, NVIDIA DLSS 2 was available alongside ray tracing, and\u00a0now Marvel\u2019s Midnight Suns is upgrading to NVIDIA DLSS 3, further accelerating performance for GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen activated, DLSS 3 multiplies performance on GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards by up to 2.2X. Without DLSS 3, performance becomes CPU limited at 70-80 FPS, preventing players from utilizing the full capabilities of their systems. With DLSS 3, we blow past the limit and deliver a significantly faster, more fluid experience for GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlongside\u00a0this game update, which includes DLSS 3, 2K and Firaxis Games also released a new DLC featuring Deadpool, everyone's favorite Merc with a Mouth, who teams up with the Midnight Suns! With Marvel\u2019s Midnight Suns - The Good, the Bad, and the Undead*, you can add Deadpool to your roster, play new story missions, encounter new enemies, unlock and add Deadpool\u2019s Abbey upgrade to your homebase, and experience Deadpool\u2019s trademark banter with the rest of the game\u2019s roster.\n*This content requires Marvel's Midnight Suns to play and is included in the Season Pass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHITMAN World of Assassination DLSS 3 Update Available Now\nIO Interactive\u2019s critically acclaimed HITMAN 3 introduced support for DLSS 2, ray-traced opaque reflections, and ray-traced shadows, last year. Now, alongside the HITMAN World of Assassination update, DLSS 3 has been added. When DLSS 3 is enabled, 4K performance with a GeForce RTX 4090 will be boosted by 2.4X to 162 FPS, and with a GeForce RTX 4080 increased by 2.7X to 127 FPS.\u00a0 With a GeForce RTX 4070 Ti at 1440p, DLSS 3 increases performance by 2.1X and delivers 145 FPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload and play the HITMAN World of Assassination demo on Steam to see the difference DLSS 3, DLSS 2 and ray tracing makes, or stealth your way through the entire game on Game Pass for PC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDying Light 2 Stay Human DLSS 3 Upgrade Arrives January 31st\nSince its launch last February, Dying Light 2 Stay Human has boasted a bevy of beautiful, game-changing ray-traced effects, which were accelerated by DLSS 2 Super Resolution. From January 31st, GeForce RTX 40 Series players can multiply frame rates thanks to the addition of DLSS 3. With DLSS 3 enabled, 4K performance with a GeForce RTX 4090 will be boosted by 2.8X to 186 FPS, and with a GeForce RTX 4080 increased by 2.9X to 135 FPS.

If I hadn't been hyper-conscious of frame numbers and hiccups, I could have been tricked into thinking the remote 4080 rig was local. Ultimate streaming can also be \"better than local,\" such as when it lets you stream a AAA, ray-traced game on a low-powered laptop, tablet, or TV with no console attached.\nArs had previously described our GeForce Now 3080 experience as \"dreamy\" and called the performance \"a white-hot stunner that rivals the computing power you can muster\" with the same RTX 3080 card in your PC. It's easy to lay at least the same kind of praise on the new Ultimate tier. It replaces the previous RTX 3080 option with the next generation's chipset for the same price ($20 per month, $99 for six months). That might be a steep price tag for a service that mostly makes you buy your games, but given the 4080's $1,200 price, the rent-versus-buy question is worth considering at this level.\nThat's especially true if you want the flexibility to bring your games to screens outside your main gaming system. I got to play Hitman 3 on a MacBook Air (through a monitor) at rates higher than 60 frames per second, at medium-to-high graphics. I logged a few impressive-looking battles in Marvel's Midnight Suns, sitting on a couch with an iPad and a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. I almost felt bad when Cyberpunk 2077 on an Nvidia Shield benchmarked 90 fps at 4K on my 60 Hz TV (save those extra frames for lean times!). When playing on these lower-res or lower-refresh screens, an Ultimate stream trades impressive fidelity for stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot everybody has the high-refresh monitor, or the interest in GeForce Now's particular games library, to need the Ultimate tier. But if you have wider bandwidth on your Internet connection than in budgeting for a single piece of a gaming PC, or want to test the waters of max-spec PC gaming, GeForce Now Ultimate is mighty intriguing.\nTest-driving a monster GPU across the Northeast\nWhat follows is a first impression of the service, more like a test drive than a full review covering every facet. That's for a few reasons. My monitor's refresh rate only (\"only\") goes to 144 Hz (i.e., 144 fps). I tend toward single-player games, not twitchy multiplayer shooters. I didn't dig much into Reflex mode, the latency-reducing setting aimed at competitive games like Apex Legends, Rainbow Six Siege, Destiny 2, and others (The Verge review leans into that aspect heavily). My personal graphics card is an RTX 3050, a budget-minded model that couldn't hope to hit 60 fps at 1440p on ultra or max settings on our test games.\nIn other words, I'm a PC gaming enthusiast living with a pedestrian mix of hardware\u2014potentially just the type GeForce Now is targeting.\nStill, I had some basis for comparison. I previously had a Founders Edition account that provided access to less-powerful card types (GTX 1080 and, on occasion, GTX 2060) and was familiar with the games' performance on my local RTX 3050. I mostly stuck to games in my library that worked on GeForce Now, though I briefly dipped into Destiny 2 multiplayer to see how remote multiplayer felt. And I've been a regular user of Nvidia's local-streaming GameStream, with the lowest latency you could hope for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      GeForce Now's latest server location and international partners.\n              \n                      Nvidia\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Now's latest server location and international partners.\n\n                      Nvidia\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      The Ultimate 4080 membership promises to be a big upgrade for those already subscribed to 3080\u2014especially, for some reason, for Warhammer fans.\n              \n                      Nvidia\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ultimate 4080 membership promises to be a big upgrade for those already subscribed to 3080\u2014especially, for some reason, for Warhammer fans.\n\n                      Nvidia\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Now's latest server location and international partners.\n\n                      Nvidia\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ultimate 4080 membership promises to be a big upgrade for those already subscribed to 3080\u2014especially, for some reason, for Warhammer fans.\n\n                      Nvidia\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Games supporting DLSS especially come out on top with the 4080 membership, something I can testify to.\n              \n                      Nvidia\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGames supporting DLSS especially come out on top with the 4080 membership, something I can testify to.\n\n                      Nvidia\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      If you're more about that speed and latency than looks, Reflex Mode offers some intriguing technology for whittling down the click-to-photon latency.\n              \n                      Nvidia\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're more about that speed and latency than looks, Reflex Mode offers some intriguing technology for whittling down the click-to-photon latency.\n\n                      Nvidia\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGames supporting DLSS especially come out on top with the 4080 membership, something I can testify to.\n\n                      Nvidia\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're more about that speed and latency than looks, Reflex Mode offers some intriguing technology for whittling down the click-to-photon latency.\n\n                      Nvidia\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you need to roll with Ultimate\nGeForce Now's Ultimate tier has the same basic network requirements as other GeForce Now plans, though, at this level (and price), they're even more important. You need to connect to one of their servers at a maximum of 80 ms latency, though below 40 is recommended. Nvidia recommends Ethernet wherever possible, or at least a 5 GHz router connection if you can't summon the cable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether you're ready for this high-end cloud experience depends on two main factors:\n\nYour connection\u2014type, speed, latency, and distance from a GeForce Now server.\nWhich games you have in your Steam/Epic/GOG/Ubisoft/EA libraries, whether GeForce Now supports them, and how optimized they are for both general performance and any Nvidia-specific graphics or streaming features.\n\nI tested the Ultimate tier on a 1Gbps Fios fiber-optic connection from Washington, DC, to GeForce Now's \"US Northeast\" servers (supposedly in Newark, New Jersey, mostly confirmed by the \"NWK\" label in diagnostics). I mainly used an Ethernet-connected Windows PC hooked up to a 4K/144 GHz monitor. I also tried out a MacBook Air and Windows laptop connected to Wi-Fi (Eero 6+ mesh routers), connected to that monitor and on their own screens, and an iPad. You obviously can't get higher frames-per-second on those laptops or portable devices if their screens can't support it, but you still benefit from the improved latency, graphical effects, and steadiness of the 4080-class cards.\nSpeed-wise, what you need depends on what fidelity you're after. Keep in mind these are dedicated speeds; you need to have this much bandwidth free even if someone else in the home is deep in a Zoom meeting or Netflix binge.\n\n45Mbps to stream at 4K quality (3840\u00d72160p) and 120 fps\n35Mbps for 2560\u00d71600p or 2560\u00d71440p at 120 fps\n35Mbps for 1080p at 240 fps (for games that support Reflex)\n\nIf you have an ultrawide monitor, Ultimate can meet you at 3840\u00d71600, 3440\u00d71440, or 2560\u00d71080 resolutions, generally with a 35Mbps minimum.\nAssuming you have a Mac or PC (there's no Linux option for GeForce Now unless you count Chrome/Edge browsers) and that strong connection, you're good to go. There is no trial period for Ultimate membership, though there is a free tier with which you can check your connection. AT&T 5G customers can also try the lower-powered Priority for six months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s play some games in Newark\nGeForce Now has a frames-per-second counter, which you'll see in most of my screenshots. It measures ping latency, the frames per second of the video stream sent out by your remote rig, and the game frames per second as you're experiencing it. I sometimes kept a separate frame counter running (whether from Steam or the game itself); they were largely concurrent, although they updated at different intervals, making it hard to compare.\nIn our review of the \"offline\" RTX 4080, Assassin's Creed Odyssey ran at an average of 92.1 frames per second at 4K resolution and ultra high settings. Playing it on GeForce Now Ultimate at the same settings, I saw my fps count occasionally dip to the 77-80 range during the most frenetic jump/kick/stab, but it mostly stayed above 100 and below 110. Fighting about a dozen bandits on a Mediterranean island felt fluid, and I didn't feel dropped frames.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Odyssey running on GeForce Now Ultimate at 4K and Ultra High settings.

Nvidia's third-generation Deep Learning Super Sampling tech (detailed in our 4090 review) majorly eases the frame pipeline for games. The most impressive example was Hitman 3, where even in the depth of Dubai's large crowds, surrounded by reflective puddles, ray-traced shadows, and lots of anxious bystander movement, my frame rate almost never dropped below 70. In our physical RTX 4080 tests, Hitman\u00a03 at 4K with maxed-out settings, on the same level, pushed the card to a limit of 44.3. I almost have to believe a setting or two is different between the two tests (or the performance has been improved in patches). But if I had to show somebody the potential of Ultimate tier, I'd let them parachute into a super-skyscraper and strangle some rich folk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHitman 3's Dubai level, with Agent 47's pleasant pate moving through the crowd.\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHitman 3's Dubai level, with Agent 47's pleasant pate moving through the crowd.\n\n          \n\n\n\nWe haven't tested Marvel's Midnight Suns yet on other hardware. It's not a third-person action game or first-person shooter, but a turn-based strategy game (from the makers of XCOM). It's less graphically intense than prior games mentioned. Still, it has some kinetic moments, including the epic moves you save up for over multiple turns, only to fire off in a colorized, camera-panning release. Midnight Suns held up well over a network, and I could push it nearly to 120 fps at 4K, with settings alternating between High and Epic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarvel's Midnight Suns held up well during overhead battle planning, but what about when Ghost Rider pulls off one of his school-notebook-drawing-like-a-demon moves?\n              \n                      Kevin Purdy / Firaxis\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarvel's Midnight Suns held up well during overhead battle planning, but what about when Ghost Rider pulls off one of his school-notebook-drawing-like-a-demon moves?\n\n                      Kevin Purdy / Firaxis\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Actually, not bad there, either.\n              \n                      Kevin Purdy / Firaxis\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nActually, not bad there, either.\n\n                      Kevin Purdy / Firaxis\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarvel's Midnight Suns held up well during overhead battle planning, but what about when Ghost Rider pulls off one of his school-notebook-drawing-like-a-demon moves?\n\n                      Kevin Purdy / Firaxis\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\nActually, not bad there, either.\n\n                      Kevin Purdy / Firaxis\n                  \n\n\n\n\nYou get it by now: I'm impressed with how well 4K gaming worked over a series of network hops between DC and Newark. Throughout my week of testing, my latency was almost always between 10-17 ms, and games didn't stutter when I noticed the latency jump for a single moment. When I lowered the resolution closer to 1440p or 1080p, such as when using a laptop or iPad over Wi-Fi, the stream was even more stable.\nIt's an understatement to say your mileage will likely vary. I had maybe five or six moments over the space of a week where I felt a game chugging and saw my latency rise, seemingly due to just normal network variations. You can do a lot to set yourself up for network success, but traffic happens. And I was playing on a server specifically set up for early access reviewers.\nGeForce Now never dropped entirely for me during a streamed game\u2014except for the Witcher 3 next-gen update, which stuttered, stopped, and generally seemed dehydrated and confused, though Nvidia is aware of the problems and working on a fix. It's an extreme example, but some games, even those with DLSS and other Nvidia-friendly features, are going to be easier to beam into your house than others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe catch: You can\u2019t play everything (though it\u2019s getting better)\nWith Stadia shut down, GeForce Now stands out even further from its major competition: Xbox Game Pass and Amazon's Luna service. Unlike those services, you don't pay for a Netflix-style subscription or content \"tiers\" from specific publishers. If you already bought a game from a major PC gaming store, and GeForce Now supports it, you can play it through GeForce Now, free or paid. (Tip: Download the free client and scan your game libraries, rather than searching one by one.)\nThat makes the $20/month cost of an Ultimate subscription, or even the $10/month Priority package, a tricky question for those without a huge library and backlog. GeForce Now is opt-in for publishers, so there's Horizon Zero Dawn or God of War (Sony), Overwatch or Call of Duty (Activision Blizzard), Elden Ring,\u00a0Skyrim, and some other notable titles, largely from firms that have their own stores or streaming ambitions.\nThere is, however, Cult of the Lamb and Tunic, most games from Ubisoft and EA, and about 1,500 others, including lots of high-res and indie-style games from non-giant developers and publishers. For the 4080 tier to pay off, specifically, you'd want to have a few games lined up that can really stretch your remote rig. That will certainly apply to some people, but uncertainty about future releases can skew the value.\nAnd yet, GeForce Now Ultimate, at $20 per month and hooked to a good line, is an impressive high-fidelity loan of $1,200 hardware. The service has RTX 4080 rigs live in San Jose, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Frankfurt; there's a map, regular \"GFN Thursday\" blog posts, and updates in the GeForce Experience app on Windows to see where the next locations will be announced. Ultimate subscribers who don't have 4080 servers within range will typically be connected to 3080 units instead, though you can manually choose your server in the GeForce Now app if you're willing to suffer the latency hit.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Listing image:\n    Kevin Purdy / Firaxis\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin Purdy\nSenior Technology Reporter\n\n\n\n\nKevin Purdy\nSenior Technology Reporter\n\n\n      Kevin is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering open-source software, PC gaming, home automation, repairability, e-bikes, and tech history.

As a result, Fisher said millions more gamers will have access to the NVIDIA Ada architecture with GeForce NOW\u2019s Ultimate membership.\nThe new tier will bring NVIDIA Reflex and 240 frames per second streaming to the cloud for the first time, along with full ray tracing and DLSS 3 in games like Portal With RTX.\nMomentum for NVIDIA RTX continues to build, Fisher said. \u201cCreating has grown beyond photos and videos to virtual worlds rendered with 3D cinematic graphics and true-to-life physics,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cThe RTX platform is powering this growth.\u201d\nRay tracing and AI are defining the next generation of content, and NVIDIA Studio is the platform for this new breed of content creators. The heartbeat of Studio is found in NVIDIA Omniverse, where creators can connect accelerated apps and collaborate in real time.\nNVIDIA\u2019s Stephanie Johnson, vice president of consumer marketing, introduced a new suite of generative AI tools and experimental plug-ins that harness the power of AI.\nBuilt with NVIDIA RTX, Omniverse is a platform enabling 3D artists to connect their favorite tools from Adobe, Autodesk, SideFX, Unreal Engine and more. And Omniverse now has a new Connector for Unity, said Stephanie Johnson, vice president of consumer marketing at NVIDIA.\nJohnson introduced a suite of new generative AI tools and experimental plug-ins using the power of AI as the ultimate creative assistant. Audio2Face and Audio2Gesture generate animations from an audio file. The AI ToyBox by NVIDIA Research lets users generate 3D meshes from 2D inputs.\nCompanies have used generative AI technology to build Omniverse Connectors and extensions. Move.AI\u2019s Omniverse extension, for example, enables video-to-animation. Lumirithmic generates 3D mesh for heads from facial scans. And Elevate3D generates photorealistic 3D visualizations of products from 360-degree video recordings.\nJohnson also announced that NVIDIA RTX Remix, which is built on Omniverse and is \u201cthe easiest way to mod classic games,\u201d will be entering early access soon. \u201cThe modding community can\u2019t wait to get their hands on Remix,\u201d she said.\nNVIDIA Isaac Sim Brings Significantly Improved Features, Tools for Developing Intelligent Robots\u00a0\nSimulation plays a vital role in the lifecycle of a robotics project, explained Deepu Talla, vice president of embedded and edge computing at NVIDIA. Partners are using NVIDIA Isaac Sim to create digital twins that help speed the training and deployment of intelligent robots.\nNVIDIA\u2019s Deepu Talla, vice president of embedded and edge computing, announced the next release of Isaac Sim, NVIDIA\u2019s robotics simulation application and synthetic data generation tool.\nTo revolutionize the way the robotics ecosystem develops the next generation of autonomous robots, Talla announced major updates to the next release of Isaac Sim. This includes improved sensor and lidar support to more accurately model real-world performance, a new conveyor-building tool, a new utility to add people to the simulation environment, a collection of new sim-ready warehouse assets and a host of new popular robots that come pre-integrated.\nFor the open-source ROS developer community, this release upgrades support for ROS 2 Humble and Windows, Talla added. And for robotics researchers, NVIDIA is introducing a new tool called Isaac ORBIT, which provides operating environments for manipulator robots. NVIDIA has also improved Isaac Gym for reinforcement learning and updated Isaac Cortex for collaborative robot programming.\n\u201cWe are committed to advancing robotics and arguably investing more than anyone else in the world,\u201d Talla said. \u201cWe are well on the way to having a thousand to million times more virtual robots for every physical robot deployed.\u201d\nMercedes-Benz to Create Digital Twins; Foxconn Building EVs on NVIDIA DRIVE; Geforce NOW Streams to Cars\n\nThe NVIDIA DRIVE platform is open and easy to program, said Ali Kani, vice president of automotive at NVIDIA.\nHundreds of partners across the automotive ecosystem are now developing software on NVIDIA DRIVE, including 20 of the top 30 manufacturers building new energy vehicles, many of the industry\u2019s top tier one manufacturers and software makers, plus eight of the largest 10 trucking and robotaxi companies.\nIt\u2019s a number that continues to grow, with Kani announcing a partnership with Foxconn, the world\u2019s largest technology manufacturer and service provider, to build electric vehicles based on NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion.\nNVIDIA\u2019s Ali Kani, vice president of automotive, announced a partnership with Foxconn, that GeForce NOW will be \u201ccoming to screens in your car\u201d and that Mercedes-Benz is using NVIDIA digital twin technology to plan and build more efficient production facilities.\n\u201cWith Hyperion adoption, Foxconn will manufacture vehicles with leading electric range as well as state-of-the-art AV technology while reducing time to market,\u201d Kani said.\nKani touched on how, as next-generation cars become autonomous and electric, interiors are transformed into mobile living spaces, complete with the same entertainment available at home. GeForce NOW will be \u201ccoming to screens in your car,\u201d Kani said.\nKani also announced several DRIVE partners are integrating GeForce NOW, including Hyundai Motor Group, BYD and Polestar.\nWhile gamers will enjoy virtual worlds from inside their cars, tools such as the metaverse are critical to the development and testing of new autonomous vehicles.\nKani announced that Mercedes-Benz is using digital twin technology to plan and build more efficient production facilities. \u201cThe applications for Omniverse in the automotive market are staggering,\u201d Kani said.\n\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Deep Learning | Driving | Gaming | Pro Graphics | RoboticsTags: CES 2023 | Embedded Computing | Events | GeForce | GeForce NOW | NVIDIA DLSS | NVIDIA DRIVE | NVIDIA Isaac Sim | NVIDIA RTX | NVIDIA Studio | Omniverse \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Cameras! Atoms! Scientist Peers Into the Quantum Future\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPioneering researcher illuminates molecular forces with a world-class instrument using AI and high performance computing at the edge.\t\t\t\n\n\nJanuary 4, 2023 by Rick Merritt \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Editor\u2019s note: This is part of a series profiling people advancing science with high performance computing.\nRyan Coffee makes movies of molecules. Their impacts are huge.\nThe senior scientist at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (above) says these visualizations could unlock the secrets of photosynthesis. They\u2019ve already shown how sunlight can cause skin cancer.\nLong term, they may help chemists engineer life-saving drugs and batteries that let electric cars go farther on a charge.\nTo make films that inspire that kind of work, Coffee\u2019s team needs high-performance computers, AI and an excellent projector.\nA Brighter Light\nThe projector is called the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). It uses a linear accelerator a kilometer long to pulse X-rays up to 120 times per second.\nThat\u2019s good enough for a Hollywood flick, but not fast enough for Coffee\u2019s movies.\n\u201cWe need to see how electron clouds move like soap bubbles around molecules, how you can squeeze them in certain ways and energy comes out,\u201d said Coffee, a specialist in the physics at the intersection of atoms, molecules and optics.\nSo, an upgrade next year will let the giant instrument take 100,000 frames per second. In two years, another enhancement, called LCLS II, will push that to a million frames a second.\nSorting the frames that flash by that fast \u2014 in random order \u2014 is a job for the combination of high performance computing (HPC) and AI.\nAIs in the Audience\nCoffee\u2019s goal is to sit an AI model in front of the LCLS II. It will watch the ultrafast movies to learn an atomic dance no human eyes could follow.\nThe work will require inference on the fastest GPUs available running next to the instrument in Menlo Park, Calif. Meanwhile, data streaming off LCLS II will be used to constantly retrain the model on a bank of NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs at the Argonne National Laboratory outside Chicago.\nIt\u2019s a textbook case for HPC at the edge, and one that\u2019s increasingly common in an era of giant scientific instruments that peer up at stars and down into atoms.\nA look at part of the LCLS instrument. (For more details, see this blog.)\nSo far, Coffee\u2019s team has been able to retrain an autoencoder model every 10-20 minutes while it makes inferences 100,000 times a second.\n\u201cWe\u2019re already in the realm of attosecond pulses where I can watch the electron bubbles slosh back and forth,\u201d said Coffee, a core member of SLAC\u2019s overall AI initiative.\nA Broader AI Collaboration\nThe next step is even bigger.\nData from Coffee\u2019s work on molecular movies will be securely shared with data from Argonne\u2019s Advanced Proton Source, a kind of ultra-high-resolution still camera.\n\u201cWe can use secure, federated machine learning to pull these two datasets together, creating a powerful, shared transformer model,\u201d said Coffee, who\u2019s collaborating with multiple organizations to make it happen.\nCoffee in the \u2018projection room\u2019 where the light in his next molecular movies will first appear.\nThe transformer will let scientists generate synthetic data for many data-starved applications such as research on fusion reactors.\nIt\u2019s an effort specific to science that parallels work in federated learning in healthcare. Both want to build powerful AI models for their fields while preserving data privacy and security.\n\u201cWe know people get the best results from large language models trained on many languages,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, we want to do that in science by taking diverse views of the same things to create better models,\u201d he said.\nThe Quantum Future\nThe atomic forces that Coffee studies may power tomorrow\u2019s computers, the scientist explains.\n\u201cImagine a stack of electron bubbles all in the same quantum state, so it\u2019s a superconductor,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I add one electron at the bottom, one pops to the top instantaneously because there\u2019s no resistance.\u201d\nThe concept, called entanglement in quantum computing, means two particles can switch states in lock step even if they\u2019re on opposite sides of the planet.\nThat would give researchers like Coffee instant connections between powerful instruments like LCLS II and remote HPC centers training powerful AI models in real time.\nSounds like science fiction? Maybe not.\nCoffee foresees a time when his experiments will outrun today\u2019s computers, a time that will require alternative architectures and AIs. It\u2019s the kind of big-picture thinking that excites him.\n\u201cI love the counterintuitiveness of quantum mechanics, especially when it has real, measurable results humans can apply \u2014 that\u2019s the fun stuff.\u201d\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | High-Performance Computing | HPC Stories | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA A100 | Quantum Computing | Science | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

An eminent GPU leaker has asserted that the upcoming Ada Lovelace architecture graphics card will perform on a very similar level as the existing Ampere architecture RTX 3070. We are also seeing reports that the RTX 4060 Ti will hit retail with a US$499 MSRP. So,\u00a0it looks like when the new RTX 4060 Ti arrives, consumers will be able to acquire a next-gen GPU with\u00a0RTX 3070 performance\u00a0for RTX 3070 prices.\n\n\nOn Wednesday we reported on the forthcoming GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, and its pleasingly low TDP. At a touted 160W, it would be 20% lower than the current gen RTX 3060 Ti. Naturally, the new generation graphics card, as a member of the RTX 40 series, is expected to improve upon the performance of its predecessor despite the lower power requirements (and narrower memory bus), but the scale of the uplift which might be on offer is making us apprehensive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\u2019s Kopite7kimi, a source with a good track record on this kind of pre-launch information, answered this performance question. In response to a query regarding RTX 4060 Ti performance, the Twitterer simply replied \u201c= RTX 3070.\u201d This is the level of generational performance increase we expected to see of the new RTX 4060, not the Ti version, so this equation is rather disappointing for us, as it will be for all the PC gamers, DIYers and enthusiasts out there.\n\r\nIn this case, we hope that Kopite7kimi\u2019s background info is somehow faulty or in error. With the RTX 40 series, NVIDIA may tout the benefits of technologies like DLSS 3 and Frame Generation, but it is likely to face backlash (again) if the RTX 4060 Ti is seen to be such a slight upgrade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoving onto the thorny issue of price, Chinese tech news sites like MyDrivers suggest that NVIDIA is going to launch the RTX 4060 Ti at $499 USD. This is a straight $100 increase from the launch price of its direct predecessor. It is, in fact, the same as the launch price for the RTX 3070 Founders Edition. Of course, there were lots of issues getting NVIDIA RTX 30 cards at anywhere near retail pricing due to factors such as the pandemic and the second crypto-boom. Even today, acquiring Ampere GPUs at MSRP or better can be a challenge, depending on what performance tier you are interested in. Lower budget buyers are disproportionately impacted as well.\n\n\r\nRemember, the above report is based on unofficial sources which may be erroneous for a multitude of reasons. Key product mix decisions may change by the time the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti is released, especially pricing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, Pricing, (nasdaq:nvda), ampere, geforce-rtx-3070, ada-lovelace, rtx-40, rtx 4060 ti\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To Supercharge...\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX Spark,...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's Dream...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing Watermarks...\nBeep-Beep!

Securely gripping and transferring fast-moving items on conveyor belts holds vast promise for businesses.\nSoft Robotics, a Bedford, Mass., startup, is harnessing NVIDIA Isaac Sim to help close the sim to real gap for a handful of robotic gripping applications. One area is perfecting gripping for pick and placement of foods for packaging.\nFood packaging and processing companies are using the startup\u2019s mGripAI system, which combines soft grasping with 3D vision and AI to grasp delicate foods such as proteins, produce and bakery items without damage.\n\u201cWe\u2019re selling the hands, the eyes and the brains of the picking solution,\u201d said David Weatherwax, senior director of software engineering at Soft Robotics.\nUnlike other industries that have adopted robotics, the $8 trillion food market has been slow to develop robots to handle variable items in unstructured environments, says Soft Robotics.\nThe company, founded in 2013, recently landed $26 million in Series C funding from Tyson Ventures, Marel and Johnsonville Ventures.\nCompanies such as Tyson Foods and Johnsonville are betting on adoption of robotic automation to help improve safety and increase production in their facilities. Both companies rely on Soft Robotics technologies.\nSoft Robotics is a member of the NVIDIA Inception program, which provides companies with GPU support and AI platforms guidance.\nGetting a Grip With Synthetic Data\nSoft Robotics develops unique models for every one of its gripping applications, each requiring specific datasets. And picking from piles of wet, slippery chicken and other foods can be a tricky challenge. We\u2019re all in on Omniverse and Isaac Sim, and that\u2019s been working great for us. \u2013 David Weatherwax. \n\nUtilizing Omniverse and Isaac Sim, the company can create 3D renderings of chicken parts with different backgrounds, like on conveyor belts or in bins, and with different lighting scenarios.\nThe company taps into Isaac Replicator to develop synthetic data, generating hundreds of thousands of images per model and distributing that among an array of instances in the cloud. Isaac Replicator is a set of tools, APIs and workflows for generating synthetic data using Isaac Sim.\nIt also runs pose estimation models to help its gripping system see the angle of the item to pick.\nNVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs on site enable Soft Robotics to run split-second inference with the unique models for each application in these food-processing facilities. Meanwhile, simulation and training in Isaac Sim offers access to NVIDIA A100 GPUs for scaling up workloads.\n\u201cOur current setup is fully synthetic, which allows us to rapidly deploy new applications,\u201d said Weatherwax. \u201cWe\u2019re all in on Omniverse and Isaac Sim, and that\u2019s been working great for us.\u201d\n\nSolving Issues With Occlusion, Lighting\u00a0\nA big challenge at Soft Robotics is solving issues with occlusion for an understanding of how different pieces of chicken stack up and overlap one another when dumped into a pile. \u201cHow those form can be pretty complex,\u201d he said.\n A key thing for us is the lighting, so the NVIDIA RTX-driven ray tracing is really important \u2013 David Weatherwax. \nGlares on wet chicken can potentially throw off detection models. \u201cA key thing for us is the lighting, so the NVIDIA RTX-driven ray tracing is really important,\u201d he added.\nBut where it really gets interesting is modeling it all in 3D and figuring out in a split second which item is the least obstructed in a pile and most accessible for a robot gripper to pick and place.\nBuilding synthetic data sets with physics-based accuracy, Omniverse enables Soft Robotics to create such environments. \u201cOne of the big challenges we have is how all these amorphous objects form into a pile.\u201d\nBoosting Production Line Pick Accuracy\nProduction lines in food processing plants can move fast. But robots deployed with application-specific models promise to handle as many as 100 picks per minute.\nStill a work in progress, success in such tasks hinges on accurate representations of piles of items, supported by training datasets that consider every possible way items can fall into a pile.\nThe objective is to provide the robot with the best available pick from a complex and dynamic environment. If food items fall off the conveyor belt or otherwise become damaged, then it is considered waste, which directly impacts yield.\nDriving Production Gains\u00a0\nMeat-packing companies rely on lines of people for processing chicken, but like so many other industries they have faced employee shortages. Some that are building new plants for food processing can\u2019t even attract enough workers at launch, said Weatherwax.\n\u201cThey are having a lot of staffing challenges, so there\u2019s a push to automate,\u201d he said.\nThe Omniverse-driven work for food processing companies has delivered a more than 10x increase in its simulation capacity, accelerating deployments times for AI picking systems from months to days.\nAnd that\u2019s enabling Soft Robotics customers to get a grip on more than just deploying automated chicken-picking lines \u2014 it\u2019s ensuring that they\u2019re covered for an employment challenge that has hit many industries, especially those with increased injury and health risks.\n\u201cHandling raw chicken is a job better suited for a robot,\u201d he said.\nDownload Isaac Sim here to use the\u00a0 Replicator features.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | RoboticsTags: GPU | Inception | NVIDIA Isaac Sim \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They aren\u2019t just for teaching AIs human languages, but for understanding proteins, writing software code, and much, much more.\nIn addition to accelerating natural language processing applications \u2014 like translation, chatbots and AI assistants \u2014 large language models are used in healthcare, software development and use cases in many other fields.\nWhat Are Large Language Models Used For?\nLanguage is used for more than human communication.\nCode is the language of computers. Protein and molecular sequences are the language of biology. Large language models can be applied to such languages or scenarios in which communication of different types is needed.\nThese models broaden AI\u2019s reach across industries and enterprises, and are expected to enable a new wave of research, creativity and productivity, as they can help to generate complex solutions for the world\u2019s toughest problems.\nFor example, an AI system using large language models can learn from a database of molecular and protein structures, then use that knowledge to provide viable chemical compounds that help scientists develop groundbreaking vaccines or treatments.\nLarge language models are also helping to create reimagined search engines, tutoring chatbots, composition tools for songs, poems, stories and marketing materials, and more.\nHow Do Large Language Models Work?\nLarge language models learn from huge volumes of data. As its name suggests, central to an LLM is the size of the dataset it\u2019s trained on. But the definition of \u201clarge\u201d is growing, along with AI.\nNow, large language models are typically trained on datasets large enough to include nearly everything that has been written on the internet over a large span of time.\nSuch massive amounts of text are fed into the AI algorithm using unsupervised learning \u2014 when a model is given a dataset without explicit instructions on what to do with it. Through this method, a large language model learns words, as well as the relationships between and concepts behind them. It could, for example, learn to differentiate the two meanings of the word \u201cbark\u201d based on its context.\nAnd just as a person who masters a language can guess what might come next in a sentence or paragraph \u2014 or even come up with new words or concepts themselves \u2014 a large language model can apply its knowledge to predict and generate content.\nLarge language models can also be customized for specific use cases, including through techniques like fine-tuning or prompt-tuning, which is the process of feeding the model small bits of data to focus on, to train it for a specific application.\nThanks to its computational efficiency in processing sequences in parallel, the transformer model architecture is the building block behind the largest and most powerful LLMs.\nTop Applications for Large Language Models\nLarge language models are unlocking new possibilities in areas such as search engines, natural language processing, healthcare, robotics and code generation.\nThe popular ChatGPT AI chatbot is one application of a large language model. It can be used for a myriad of natural language processing tasks.\nThe nearly infinite applications for LLMs also include:\n\nRetailers and other service providers can use large language models to provide improved customer experiences through dynamic chatbots, AI assistants and more.\nSearch engines can use large language models to provide more direct, human-like answers.\nLife science researchers can train large language models to understand proteins, molecules, DNA and RNA.\nDevelopers can write software and teach robots physical tasks with large language models.\nMarketers can train a large language model to organize customer feedback and requests into clusters, or segment products into categories based on product descriptions.\nFinancial advisors can summarize earnings calls and create transcripts of important meetings using large language models. And credit-card companies can use LLMs for anomaly detection and fraud analysis to protect consumers.\nLegal teams can use large language models to help with legal paraphrasing and scribing.\n\nRunning these massive models in production efficiently is resource-intensive and requires expertise, among other challenges, so enterprises turn to NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, software that helps standardize model deployment and deliver fast and scalable AI in production.\nWhen to Use Custom Large Language Models\nMany organizations are looking to use custom LLMs tailored to their use case and brand voice. These custom models built on domain-specific data unlock opportunities for enterprises to improve internal operations and offer new customer experiences. Custom models are smaller, more efficient and faster than general-purpose LLMs.\nCustom models offer the best solution for applications that involve a lot of proprietary data. One example of a custom LLM is BloombergGPT, homegrown by Bloomberg. It has 50 billion parameters and is targeted at financial applications.\u00a0 \nWhere to Find Large Language Models\nIn June 2020, OpenAI released GPT-3 as a service, powered by a 175-billion-parameter model that can generate text and code with short written prompts.\nIn 2021, NVIDIA and Microsoft developed Megatron-Turing Natural Language Generation 530B, one of the world\u2019s largest models for reading comprehension and natural language inference, which eases tasks like summarization and content generation.\nAnd HuggingFace last year introduced BLOOM, an open large language model that\u2019s able to generate text in 46 natural languages and over a dozen programming languages.\nAnother LLM, Codex, turns text to code for software engineers and other developers.\nNVIDIA offers tools to ease the building and deployment of large language models:\n\nNVIDIA NeMo LLM Service provides a fast path to customizing large language models and deploying them at scale using NVIDIA\u2019s managed cloud API, or through private and public clouds.\nNVIDIA NeMo framework, part of the NVIDIA AI platform, enables easy, efficient, cost-effective training and deployment of large language models. Designed for enterprise application development, NeMo provides an end-to-end workflow for automated distributed data processing; training large-scale, customized model types including GPT-3 and T5; and deploying these models for inference at scale.\nNVIDIA BioNeMo is a domain-specific managed service and framework for large language models in proteomics, small molecules, DNA and RNA. It\u2019s built on NVIDIA NeMo for training and deploying large biomolecular transformer AI models at supercomputing scale.\n\nChallenges of Large Language Models\nScaling and maintaining large language models can be difficult and expensive.\nBuilding a foundational large language model often requires months of training time and millions of dollars.\nAnd because LLMs require a significant amount of training data, developers and enterprises can find it a challenge to access large-enough datasets.\nDue to the scale of large language models, deploying them requires technical expertise, including a strong understanding of deep learning, transformer models and distributed software and hardware.\nMany leaders in tech are working to advance development and build resources that can expand access to large language models, allowing consumers and enterprises of all sizes to reap their benefits.\nLearn more about large language models.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | ExplainerTags: Artificial Intelligence | Conversational AI | Data Science | Inference | NVIDIA NeMo | Open Source \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And a whopping 80% of all web application breaches involved credential abuse.\n\u201cCredentials are the favorite data type of criminal actors because they are so useful for masquerading as legitimate users on the system,\u201d the report said.\nIn today\u2019s age of zero trust, security experts say it\u2019s not a matter of if but when they\u2019ll experience an identity attack.\nA Response From R&D\nThe director of cybersecurity engineering and R&D at NVIDIA, Bartley Richardson, articulates the challenge simply.\n\u201cWe need to look for when Bartley is not acting like Bartley,\u201d he said.\nLast year, his team described a concept called digital fingerprinting. In the wake of highly publicized attacks in February, he came up with a simple but ambitious idea for implementing it.\nA Big Ask\nHe called a quick meeting with his two tech leads to share the idea. Richardson told them he wanted to create a deep learning model for every account, server, application and device on the network.\nThe models would learn individual behavior patterns and alert security staff when an account was acting in an uncharacteristic way. That\u2019s how they would deter attacks.\nThe tech leads thought it was a crazy idea. It was computationally impossible, they told him, and no one was even using GPUs for security yet.\nRichardson listened to their concerns and slowly convinced them it was worth a try. They would start with just a model for every account.\nEverybody\u2019s Problem\nSecurity managers know it\u2019s a big-data problem.\nCompanies collect terabytes of data on network events every day. That\u2019s just a fraction of the petabytes of events a day companies could log if they had the resources, according to Daniel Rohrer, NVIDIA\u2019s vice president of software product security.\nThe fact that it\u2019s a big-data problem is also good news, Rohrer said in a talk at GTC in September (watch free with registration). \u201cWe\u2019re already well on the way to combining our cybersecurity and AI efforts,\u201d he said.\nStarting With a Proof of Concept\nBy mid-March, Richardson\u2019s team was focused on ways to run thousands of AI models in tandem. They used NVIDIA Morpheus, an AI security software library announced a year earlier, to build a proof of concept in two months.\nOnce an entire, albeit crude, product was done, they spent another two months optimizing each portion.\nThen they reached out to about 50 NVIDIANs to review their work \u2014 security operations and product security teams, and IT folks who would be alpha users.\nAn Initial Deployment\nThree months later, in early October, they had a solution NVIDIA could deploy on its global networks \u2014 security software for AI-powered digital fingerprinting.\nThe software is a kind of LEGO kit, an AI framework anyone can use to create a custom cybersecurity solution.\nVersion 2.0 is running across NVIDIA\u2019s networks today on just four NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. IT staff can create their own models, changing aspects of them to create specific alerts.\nTested and Released\nNVIDIA is making these capabilities available in a digital fingerprinting AI workflow included with NVIDIA AI Enterprise 3.0 announced in December.\nFor identity attackers, \u201cthe models Bartley\u2019s team built have anomaly scores that are off the charts, and we\u2019re able to visualize events so we can see things in new ways,\u201d said Jason Recla, NVIDIA\u2019s senior director of information security.\nAs a result, instead of facing a tsunami of 100 million network events a week, an IT team may have just 8-10 incidents to investigate daily. That cuts the time to detect certain attack patterns from weeks to minutes.\nTailoring AI for Small Events\nThe team already has big ideas for future versions.\n\u201cOur software works well on major identity attacks, but it\u2019s not every day you have an incident like that,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cSo, now we\u2019re tuning it with other models to make it more applicable to everyday vanilla security incidents.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Richardson\u2019s team used the software to create a proof of concept for a large consulting firm.\n\u201cThey wanted it to handle a million records in a tenth of a second. We did it in a millionth of a second, so they\u2019re fully on board,\u201d Richardson said.\nThe Outlook for AI Security\nLooking ahead, the team has ideas for applying AI and accelerated computing to secure digital identities and generate hard-to-find training data.\nRichardson imagines passwords and multi-factor authentication will be replaced by models that know how fast a person types, with how many typos, what services they use and when they use them. Such detailed digital identities will prevent attackers from hijacking accounts and pretending they are legitimate users.\nData on network events is gold for building AI models that harden networks, but no one wants to share details of real users and break-ins. Synthetic data, generated by a variant of digital fingerprinting, could fill the gap, letting users create what they need to fit their use case.\nIn the meantime, Recla has advice security managers can act on now.\n\u201cGet up to speed on AI,\u201d he said. \u201cStart investing in AI engineering and data science skills \u2014 that\u2019s the biggest thing.\u201d\nDigital fingerprinting is not a panacea. It\u2019s one more brick in an ever-evolving digital wall that a community of security specialists is building against the next big attack.\nYou can try this AI-powered security workflow live on NVIDIA LaunchPad starting Jan. 23.

And many retailers\u00a0are reporting theft has more than doubled recently, driven by rising prices of food and other essentials.\nTo make it easier for developers to quickly build and roll out applications designed to prevent theft, NVIDIA today announced three Retail AI Workflows, built on its Metropolis microservices. They can be used as no-code or low-code building blocks for loss-prevention applications because they come pretrained with images of the most-stolen products as well as software to plug into existing store applications for point-of-sale machines and object and product tracking across entire stores.\n\u201cRetail theft is growing due to macro-dynamics, and threatens to overwhelm the industry,\u201d said Read Hayes, director of the Loss Prevention Research Council. \u201cBusinesses are now facing the reality that investment in loss-prevention solutions is a critical requirement.\u201d\nThe NVIDIA Retail AI Workflows, which are available through the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite, include:\n\nRetail Loss Prevention AI Workflow: The AI models within this workflow come pretrained to recognize hundreds of products most frequently lost to theft \u2014 including meat, alcohol and laundry detergent \u2014 and to recognize them in the varying sizes and shapes they\u2019re offered. With synthetic data generation from NVIDIA Omniverse, retailers and independent software vendors can customize and further train the models to hundreds of thousands of store products. The workflow is based on a state-of-the-art few-shot learning technique developed by NVIDIA Research which, combined with active learning, identifies and captures any new products scanned by customers and sales associates during checkout to ultimately improve model accuracy.\nMulti-Camera Tracking AI Workflow: Delivers multi-target, multi-camera (MTMC) capabilities that allow application developers to more easily create systems that track objects across multiple cameras throughout the store. The workflow tracks objects and store associates across cameras and maintains a unique ID for each object. Objects are tracked through visual embeddings or appearance, rather than personal biometric information, to maintain full shopper privacy.\nRetail Store Analytics Workflow: Uses computer vision to provide insights for store analytics, such as store traffic trends, counts of customers with shopping baskets, aisle occupancy and more via custom dashboards.\n\nThe workflows are built on NVIDIA Metropolis microservices, a low- or no-code way of building AI applications. The microservices provide the building blocks for developing complex AI workflows and allow them to rapidly scale into production-ready AI apps.\nDevelopers can easily customize and extend these AI workflows, including by integrating their own models. The microservices also make it easier to integrate new offerings with legacy systems, such as point-of-sale systems.\n\u201cNVIDIA\u2019s new Retail AI Workflows built on Metropolis microservices allow us to customize our product, scale rapidly to fit our ever-growing customers\u2019 needs better and continue to drive innovation in the retail space,\u201d said Bobby Chowdary, chief technology officer at Radius.ai.\n\u201cAs part of our applied AI offerings, Infosys is developing state-of-the-art loss prevention systems leveraging NVIDIA\u2019s new workflows comprising pretrained models for retail SKU recognition and microservices architecture,\u201d said Balakrishna D R, executive vice president and head of AI and Automation at Infosys. \u201cIt will enable us to deploy these solutions faster and rapidly scale across stores and product lines while also getting much higher levels of accuracy than before.\u201d\nNVIDIA will unveil additional details of its Retail AI Workflows at the National Retail Federation Conference in New York, Jan. 15-17.\nSign up for early access to the new NVIDIA Retail AI Workflows for developers and learn more in the NVIDIA Technical Blog.

These are some of the world\u2019s most pressing energy issues \u2014 6,000 U.S. pipeline incidents from 2002-2021 resulted in over $11 billion in damages.\n\u201cPrevious industry-standard ways of detecting such issues were unreliable as they used small aircraft and pilots looking out the window for leaks, depending on the trained eye rather than sensors or other technologies,\u201d said Bangalore.\nOSK operates a constellation of satellites that collect hyperspectral imagery from space. That data is processed and analyzed in real time using the NVIDIA Jetson edge AI platform. Then, insights \u2014 like the type of leak at a GPS point, its size and its urgency \u2014 can be viewed on a screen by users of OSK\u2019s SIGMA Monitor platform.\nThe technology accomplishes what a pilot would, but much more quickly, objectively and with higher accuracy, Bangalore said.\nA methane leak detected by OSK technology.\nSustainable Operations\nOSK technologies have so far monitored more than 20,000 kilometers of pipelines for various customers, according to Tushar Prabhakar, its founder and chief operating officer.\nThe platform has detected nearly 100 suspected methane leaks, 200 suspected liquid hydrocarbon leaks or contamination issues, and more than 300 intrusive events related to digging or construction activities, Prabhakar added. OSK helped eliminate the potential for these events to become serious energy crises.\nOSK\u2019s SIGMA Monitor platform dashboard.\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking hyperspectral intelligence to the finest commercial resolution that the world has ever seen to make the Earth a more sustainable place,\u201d Bangalore said. \u201cThe biggest challenge with hyperspectral imagery is dealing with huge amounts of data, which can be up to 400x the size of 2D visual data. NVIDIA technology helps process this data in real time.\u201d\nOSK uses the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier module as an AI engine at the satellites\u2019 edge to process the hyperspectral data collected from various sensors and crunch algorithms for leak detection.\nThe module, along with the NVIDIA CV-CUDA and CUDA Python software toolkits, have sped up OSK\u2019s analysis by 5x, according to Bangalore. This acceleration enhances the platform\u2019s ability to detect and recognize anomalies from space \u2014 then project the data back to Earth.\n\u201cThere are around 15 sun-synchronous orbits per day,\u201d Bangalore said. \u201cWith NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier, we can process all the data taken onboard a satellite in an orbit within that same orbit, enabling continuous data capture.\u201d\nIn 2018, OSK\u2019s previous-generation system was launched on the International Space Station. Its data was analyzed using the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 module.\nIn addition, OSK uses the next-generation NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin module for an aerial version of the platform that collects hyperspectral imagery from airplanes. Compared to the previous-generation module, the Jetson AGX Orin \u2014 with upgraded memory and speed \u2014 can run larger amounts of map data streamed in real time to pilots, Bangalore said.\n\u201cWe chose the NVIDIA Jetson platform because it offers off-the-shelf products for industrial applications with extended shock, vibration and temperature, and software that has been optimized for the NVIDIA GPU architecture,\u201d Bangalore said.\nAnd as a member of NVIDIA Inception, a free, global program for cutting-edge startups, OSK received technical support to optimize the team\u2019s use of such safety features and SDK acceleration.\nVersatile Use Cases\nHyperspectral intelligence offers a multitude of applications. For this reason, the OSK platform is deployed across a broad range of customers, including the U.S. Department of Defense and energy sector.\nOSK\u2019s GHOSt constellation of satellites.\nEnergy Transfer, a major pipeline operator, will use OSK\u2019s GHOSt constellation for asset monitoring.\nFor the commercial oil and gas industry, OSK technology helps detect gas and hydrocarbon leaks, allowing pipeline operators to quickly halt work and fix issues.\nTo accelerate the energy transition, the platform can enhance exploration of lithium, cobalt and more, display a hyperspectral index of areas on a map that have signals of the elements, and differentiate between these materials and soil.\nCreating sustainable supply chains for battery materials like lithium is key to advancing the global energy transition and scaling electric vehicle adoption, as lithium-ion batteries power the majority of EVs. The EV battery market is projected to reach over $218 billion in 2027, and EV sales are estimated to reach up to 50 million units by 2030.\n\u201cOur tech can help discover lithium, and prevent methane or greenhouse gasses from being let out into the atmosphere,\u201d Bangalore said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very direct impact, and it\u2019s what the planet needs.\u201d\nRead more about innovative energy startups, including MinervaCQ, which is using speech AI to coach contact-center agents in retail energy, and Skycatch, which is building digital twins to make mining and construction sites safer, more efficient and sustainable.\nLearn more about NVIDIA\u2019s work in energy and apply to join NVIDIA Inception.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Aerospace | Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Customer Stories | Energy | Inception | Jetson | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The recently introduced NVIDIA DRIVE Thor platform unifies traditionally distributed functions in vehicles\u00a0 \u2014 including digital cluster, infotainment, parking and assisted driving \u2014 for greater efficiency in development and faster software iteration.\nNVIDIA DRIVE Concierge, built on the DRIVE IX software stack, runs an array of safety and convenience features, including driver and occupant monitoring, digital assistants and autonomous-vehicle visualization.\nAutomakers can benefit from NVIDIA data center solutions even if they aren\u2019t using the NVIDIA DRIVE platform. With cloud technology, vehicles can stream the NVIDIA GeForce NOW cloud-gaming service without any special equipment. Plus, developers can train, test and validate in-vehicle AI models on NVIDIA DGX servers.\nThe same data center technology that\u2019s accelerating AI development \u2014 in combination with the NVIDIA Omniverse platform for creating and operating metaverse applications \u2014 is also revolutionizing the automotive product cycle. Using NVIDIA DRIVE Sim built on Omniverse, automakers can design vehicle interiors and retail experiences entirely in the virtual world.\n\nEasing Pain Points From Concept to Customer\nDesigning and selling vehicles requires the highest levels of organization and orchestration. The cockpit alone has dozens of components \u2014 such as steering wheel, cluster and infotainment \u2014 that developers must create and integrate with the rest of the car.\n\nThese processes are incredibly time- and resource-intensive \u2014 there are countless configurations, and chosen designs must be built out and tested prior to production. Vehicle designers must collaborate on various layouts, which must then be validated and approved. Customers must travel to dealerships to experience various options, and the ability to test features depends on a store\u2019s inventory at any given time.\nIn the virtual world, developers can easily design vehicles, and car buyers can seamlessly test them, leading to an optimal experience on both ends of the production pipeline.\nDesign and Collaboration\nAutomakers operate design centers around the world, tapping into expertise from North America, Europe, Asia and other automotive hubs. Working on user experience concepts across these locations requires frequent international travel and close coordination.\nWith DRIVE Sim, designers and engineers anywhere in the world can work together to develop the cockpit experience, without having to leave their desks.\n\nDesign teams can also save time and valuable resources by testing concepts in the virtual world, without having to wait for physical prototypes. Decision-makers can review designs and ensure they meet relevant safety standards in DRIVE Sim before sending them to production.\nTransforming the Customer Experience\nThe benefits of in-vehicle simulation extend far beyond the design phase.\nConsumers are increasingly expecting full-service digital retail experiences. More than 60% of shoppers want to conduct more of the car-buying process online compared to the last time they bought a vehicle, while more than 75% are open to buying a car entirely online, according to an Autotrader survey.\nThe same tools used to design the vehicle can help meet these rising consumer expectations.\nWith DRIVE Sim, car buyers can configure and test the car from the comfort of their homes. Customers can see all potential options and combinations of vehicle features at the push of a button and take their dream car for a virtual spin \u2014 no lengthy trips to the dealership required.\nFrom concept design to customer experience, DRIVE Sim is easing the process and opening up new ways to design and enjoy intelligent vehicles.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: CES 2023 | NVIDIA DRIVE | Omniverse | Simulation and Design | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Powered by the latest NVIDIA GPU technology, Ultimate members can play their favorite PC games at performance never before available from the cloud.\nPlus, with a new year comes new games. GeForce NOW brings 24 more titles to the cloud in January, starting with five this week.\nUltimate Performance, Now in the Cloud\nGet ready for cloud gaming that\u2019s \u201cbeyond fast.\u201d GeForce NOW is bringing RTX 4080 performance to the cloud with the new high-performance Ultimate membership.\nSupercomputer power streamed to you, fueling your every Victory Royale.\nThe GeForce NOW Ultimate membership raises the bar on cloud gaming, bringing it closer than ever to a local gaming experience. It\u2019s powered by the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture in upgraded GeForce NOW RTX 4080 SuperPODs.\nGeForce NOW Ultimate members receive three major streaming upgrades. First, the new SuperPODs are capable of rendering and streaming at up to 240 frames per second for the lowest latency ever from the cloud. Paired with NVIDIA Reflex, members\u2019 game play will feel almost indistinguishable from a local desktop PC.\n\nSecond, supported streaming resolutions get an upgrade: Ultimate members can play their favorite PC games at up to 4K 120 fps on the native PC and Mac apps.\nAnd third, for the first time, cloud gamers can play at native ultrawide resolutions, a long-requested feature from the GeForce NOW community. Experience your favorite adventures like A Plague Tale: Requiem, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Shadow of the Tomb Raider and more at up to 3840\u00d71600 resolutions for a truly immersive experience.\nThe Ultimate upgrade also brings support for the latest NVIDIA RTX technologies, like full ray tracing and DLSS 3 \u2014 introduced with the GeForce RTX 40 Series launch. They deliver beautiful, cinematic-quality graphics and use AI to keep frame rates smooth in supported games.\nWith support for NVIDIA G-SYNC-enabled monitors, GeForce NOW will vary the streaming rate to the client for the first time, delivering smooth and instantaneous frame updates to client screens on Reflex-enabled games \u2014 further driving down total latency.\nUltimate members will also continue to enjoy longer streaming sessions, fastest access to the highest-performance cloud gaming servers and game settings that persist from session to session.\nThe Ultimate Library Keeps Growing\nThere are more than 1,500 games supported in the GeForce NOW library, with more than 400 titles joining last year. Members can stream mega-hits from top publishers like Electronic Arts and Ubisoft, popular PC indie titles like Valheim and Rust, and over 100 of the biggest free-to-play games like Fortnite and Genshin Impact.\nThe new year also brings some of the biggest upcoming PC game launches on the service, starting with Portal with RTX later this week. Relive the critically acclaimed and award-winning Portal reimagined with full ray tracing and higher frame rates with DLSS 3 for those streaming from the cloud from an RTX 4080 SuperPOD.\n\nFull ray tracing transforms each scene of Portal with RTX, enabling light to bounce and be affected by each area\u2019s new high-resolution, physically based textures and enhanced high-poly models. Every light is ray traced and casts shadows for a new sense of realism. Global illumination indirect lighting naturally illuminates and darkens rooms, volumetric ray-traced lighting scatters through fog and smoke, and shadows are pixel perfect.\nThis ray-traced reimagining of Valve\u2019s classic game was built using a revolutionary modding tool called NVIDIA RTX Remix, which brings the test chambers of Portal\u2019s \u201cAperture Science\u201d to new life.\nMore big titles are on the way. As announced at CES 2023 this week, members can expect to see Atomic Heart, The Day Before and Party Animals join GeForce NOW when they release later this year.

Growth is occurring in vehicle deployment plans as well as AI solutions integrating further into the car.\nFoxconn joined the NVIDIA DRIVE ecosystem. The world\u2019s largest technology manufacturer will produce electronic control units based on the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin systems-on-a-chip and build its electric vehicles using the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion platform.\nThe Polestar 3, which is powered by NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, made its U.S. debut, showcasing its new driver-monitoring system. Working with intelligent sensing company Smart Eye, the automaker is using AI to improve in-cabin safety and convenience.\nThe Polestar 3 makes its U.S. debut in the Smart Eye CES booth.\nAlso appearing stateside for the first time was the Volvo EX90 fully electric SUV. Volvo Cars\u2019 new flagship vehicle features centralized, software-defined compute powered by DRIVE Orin and NVIDIA DRIVE Xavier, and will begin deliveries in early 2024.\nThe Volvo EX90 was on display at the automotive technology company, Luminar\u2019s booth (CES LVCC West Hall booth 5324). Luminar, an NVIDIA DRIVE ecosystem member, is providing its lidar technology to enable next-generation safety and, in the future, highway autonomy.\nThe Volvo EX90 in the Luminar booth at CES.\nElsewhere on the show floor, NVIDIA DRIVE ecosystem members such as Aeva with Plus, Imagry, Infineon with Lucid, u-blox and Valeo showcased the latest innovations in intelligent transportation.\nThese announcements mark a shift in the autonomous vehicle industry, from early stages to global deployment.\nFoxconn Enters the AV Arena\nBuilding safe, intelligent vehicles with highly automated and fully autonomous driving capabilities is a massive endeavor.\nNVIDIA DRIVE offers an open, AI-enabled AV development platform for the industry to build upon. By adding Foxconn as a tier-one platform scaling partner, NVIDIA can greatly extend its efforts to meet growing demand.\nIn addition, Foxconn\u2019s selection of DRIVE Hyperion will speed time to market for its state-of-the-art EVs with autonomous driving capabilities and lower its time-to-cost strategy.\nThe DRIVE Hyperion sensor suite is already qualified to ensure diverse, redundant real-time processing, which increases overall safety.\nInside AI\nSmart Eye driver monitoring software helps keep attention on the road.\nThe industry is placing greater focus on interior safety and convenience features as AI takes over more driving tasks.\nDriver monitoring is a key part of Polestar\u2019s broader driver-understanding system, which includes features such as adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist and pilot assist as standard. These coordinated systems run simultaneously on the centralized DRIVE Orin AI compute platform.\nThe Polestar 3, launched in October, features two closed-loop driver-monitoring cameras and software from Smart Eye (booth 6353) which track the driver\u2019s head, eye and eyelid movements, and can trigger warning messages, sounds or an emergency-stop function if a distracted, drowsy or disconnected driver is detected.\nEnd-to-End Innovation\nThe rest of the CES show floor was brimming with new vehicle technologies poised to deliver more convenient and safer transportation.\nLucid showcased its flagship sedan, the Air, in partner Infineon\u2019s booth (booth 3829), breaking down the technologies that make up the award-winning EV. At its core is the NVIDIA DRIVE centralized compute platform, which powers its software-defined DreamDrive advanced driver assistance system.\nThe award-winning Lucid Air electric sedan.\nIn addition to personal transportation, NVIDIA DRIVE is powering safer, more efficient public transit, as well as delivery and logistics.\nIsraeli startup Imagry (booth 5874), a developer of mapless autonomous driving solutions, announced that its DRIVE Orin-based platform will power two autonomous bus pilots in its home country in 2023. Lidar maker Aeva (booth 6001)\u00a0showcased the latest vehicle from autonomous trucking company Plus, built on DRIVE Orin.\nAV sensing and localization technology also exhibited significant advances. Global tier-one supplier Valeo (booth CP-17) demonstrated how it\u2019s using the high-fidelity NVIDIA DRIVE Sim platform to develop intelligent active lighting solutions for low-light conditions. U-blox (booth 10963), which specializes in global satellite navigation satellite system solutions, showed the latest in AV localization, integrated into the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion architecture.\nWith every corner of the AV industry firing on all cylinders, CES 2023 is signaling the start to the widespread deployment of intelligent transportation.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Having a key instrument, like Berzelius, would be a fundamental instrument of future science,\u201d Huang told the audience. \u201cThe work that is done on this instrument would make tremendous impacts to life sciences, material sciences, physical sciences and computer science.\u201d\nMaximum Efficiency, Minimal Impact\nThe rising use of electricity is one of the causes of global warming, and powerful, energy-efficient computers are crucial to fighting climate change through green computing.\nHuang explained that whether for data centers or the latest smartphone, computer chips, systems and software must be designed and used to maximize energy efficiency and minimize environmental impact.\n\u201cCompanies large and small have to sign up for the carbon footprint that we use to build the work that we do,\u201d said Huang. \u201cIf there\u2019s an opportunity for us to help accelerate workloads and reduce energy use and improve energy efficiency, we will.\u201d\nSweden\u2019s Role in AI\nThe upgrade comes as AI is powering change in every industry across the globe, with leaders from across the Nordics accelerating the growth of some of the world\u2019s most powerful AI solutions, explained Wallenberg.\n\u201cFrom the perspective of the foundations, we\u2019re trying to work for the betterment of Sweden by promoting the areas of research, technology and medicine,\u201d said Wallenberg, whose family has for generations been deeply involved across the nation\u2019s economy. \u201cWe are working together as a team to create possibilities and the foundations for more work to be done.\u201d\nThe Berzelius system was used for training the first Swedish large language model. Increasing in size 10x every year for the last few years, large language models are just one state-of-the-art AI technology that promises transformation through learned knowledge.\nNeural networks trained with massive datasets on powerful systems, LLMs are accelerating discoveries across industries such as healthcare and climate science with software frameworks like NVIDIA BioNeMo. Models like ChatGPT are making a name for themselves as a new way to use AI.\n\u201cYou can connect models together to retrieve new information so that models like ChatGPT could report on the news today, who won that game, or the latest weather,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThe combination of these capabilities means not only the ability to respond and answer questions and write stories, but it can also write programs and solve problems.\u201d\nKnowledge From Data\nSolving problems requires reliable, physically accurate data. The industrial metaverse, where digital twins of real factories, rail networks or retail stores can be created, is already being used by large companies like Amazon, BMW, Ericsson and Siemens.\nFollowing the conversation between Huang and Wallenberg, Staffan Truv\u00e9, CTO and co-founder of cybersecurity company Recorded Future, talked about how data can be used to model intelligence as a digital twin to get an end-to-end view of threats and targets.\n\u201cToday, there are three major converging threat areas. Physical, cyber and influence, which is the threat to our brains,\u201d Truv\u00e9 explained. \u201cBy creating an intelligence graph, we\u2019re building a full picture of a threat.\u201d\nDigital twins are not the only way to gather valuable insights when developing for the future. Sara Mazur, vice executive director of the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and chair of the Wallenberg AI Autonomous Systems and Software Program, highlighted the importance of collaboration between academia and industry.\n\n\nCategories: CorporateTags: Events | NVIDIA NeMo \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

His signature blue suit, black spectacles and gentle voice act as calm camouflage for a pioneering spirit.\nEarly on, he showed a deep interest in space, but his career took a different direction. He established the country\u2019s first network of supercomputing centers and went on to pioneer scientific visualization technologies used in hospitals and museums around the world.\nToday, he leads Sweden\u2019s largest research effort, WASP \u2014 the Wallenberg Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Systems and Software Program \u2014 focused on AI innovation.\nThe Big Picture\n\u201cThis is a year when people are turning their focus to sustainability challenges we face as a planet,\u201d said the Link\u00f6ping University professor. \u201cWithout advances in AI and other innovations, we won\u2019t have a sustainable future.\u201d\nTo supercharge environmental efforts and more, Sweden will upgrade its Berzelius supercomputer. Based on the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, it will deliver nearly half an exaflop of AI performance, placing it among the world\u2019s 100 fastest AI supercomputers.\n\u201cA machine like Berzelius is fundamental not only for the results it delivers, but the way it catalyzes expertise in Sweden,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re a knowledge-driven nation, so our researchers and companies need access to the latest technology to compete.\u201d\nAI Learns Swedish\nIn June, the system trained GPT-SW3, a family of large language models capable of drafting a speech or answering questions in Swedish.\nToday, a more powerful version sports 20 billion parameters, a popular measure of a neural network\u2019s smarts. It can help developers write software and handle other complex tasks.\nLong term, researchers aim to train a version with a whopping 175 billion parameters that\u2019s also fluent in Nordic languages like Danish and Norwegian.\nOne of Sweden\u2019s largest banks is already exploring use of the latest GPT-SW3 variant for a chatbot and other applications.\nA Memory Boost\nTo build big AIs, Berzelius will add 34 NVIDIA DGX A100 systems to its cluster of 60 that makeup the SuperPOD. The new units will sport GPUs with 80GB of memory each.\nYnnerman with Berzelius at the system\u2019s March 2021 launch.\n\u201cHaving really fat nodes with large memory is important for some of these models,\u201d Ynnerman said. Atos, the system integrator, is providing \u201ca very smooth ride getting the whole process set up,\u201d he added.\nSeeking a Cure for Cancer\nIn healthcare, a data-driven life sciences program, funded by the Wallenberg Foundation, will be a major Berzelius user. The program spans 10 universities and will, among other applications, employ AI to understand protein folding, fundamentally important to understanding diseases like cancer.\nOthers will use Berzelius to improve detection of cancer cells and navigate the massive mounds of data in human genomes.\nSome researchers are exploring tools such as NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine and NVIDIA BotMaker to create animated patients. Powered by GPT-SW3, they could help doctors practice telemedicine skills.\nRobots in Zero Gravity\nSweden\u2019s work in image and video recognition will get a boost from Berzelius. Such algorithms advance work on the autonomous systems used in modern factories and warehouses.\nOne project is exploring how autonomous systems act in space and undersea. It\u2019s a topic close to the heart of a recent addition to WASP, researcher Christer Fuglesang, who was named Sweden\u2019s first astronaut in 1992.\nFuglesang went to the International Space Station in 2006 and 2008. Later, as a professor of physics at Sweden\u2019s Royal Institute of Technology, he collaborated with Ynnerman on live shows about life in space, presented in the WISDOME dome theater at the Visualization Center C Ynnerman founded and directs.\nThanks to his expertise in visualization, \u201cI can go to Mars whenever I want,\u201d Ynnerman quipped.\nHe took NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang and Marcus Wallenberg \u2014 scion of Sweden\u2019s leading industrial family \u2014 on a tour of outer space at the dome to mark the Berzelius upgrade. The dome can show the Martian surface in 8K resolution at 120 frames per second, thanks to its use of 12 NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 GPUs.\nInspiring the Next Generation\nYnnerman\u2019s algorithms have touched millions who\u2019ve seen visualizations of Egyptian mummies at the British Museum.\n\u201cThat makes me even more proud than some of my research papers because many are young people we can inspire with a love for science and technology,\u201d he said.\nA passion for science and technology has attracted more than 400 active Ph.D. candidates so far to WASP, which is on the way to exceeding its goal of 600 grads by 2031.\nBut even a visualization specialist can\u2019t be everywhere. So Ynnerman\u2019s pet project will use AI to create a vibrant, virtual museum guide.\n\u201cI think we can provide more people a \u2018wow\u2019 experience \u2014 I want a copilot when I\u2019m navigating the universe,\u201d he said.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Robotics | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | Hardware | Healthcare and Life Sciences | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA DGX | NVIDIA RTX | Omniverse | Quadro | Rendering | Scientific Visualization | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Academic papers. Ph.D. programs. There are a lot of places you can go to get a glimpse of the future. But the best place might just be El Coyote Cojo, a whiskey-soaked dive bar that doesn\u2019t exist in real life.\nFire up Cyberpunk 2077 and you\u2019ll see much more than the watering hole\u2019s colorful clientele. You\u2019ll see refractions and reflections, shadows and smoke, all in the service of creating more than just eye candy \u2014 each element works in tandem with the game\u2019s expansive and engaging story.\nPatching In: Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s DLSS 3 Upgrade\nIt\u2019s a tale that gets more mesmerizing with every patch \u2014 the updates game developers periodically release to keep their games at the cutting edge. Today\u2019s addition brings NVIDIA DLSS 3, the latest in neural graphics.\nDLSS 3 is a package that includes a number of sophisticated technologies. Combining DLSS Super Resolution, all-new DLSS Frame Generation, and NVIDIA Reflex, running on the new hardware capabilities of GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, DLSS 3 multiplies performance while maintaining great image quality and responsiveness.\nThe performance uplift this delivers lets PC gamers experience more of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s gritty glory. And it sets the stage for the pending Ray Tracing Overdrive Mode, an update that will escalate the game\u2019s ray tracing, a technique long used to create blockbuster films and enhance the game\u2019s already-incredible visuals.\nThe gaming press \u2014 perhaps the most brutal critics of the visual arts \u2014 are already raving about DLSS 3.\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply in love with DLSS with Frame Generation,\u201d gushes PC Gamer. \u201cDLSS 3 is incredible, and NVIDIA\u2019s tech is undeniably a selling point for the [GeForce RTX] 4080,\u201d asserts PCGamesN. \u201c[I]t\u2019s a phenomenal achievement in graphics performance,\u201d states Digital Foundry.\n\nTwenty-one games now support DLSS 3, including Dying Light 2 Stay Human, Hitman 3, Marvel\u2019s Midnight Suns, Microsoft Flight Simulator, Portal with RTX, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Warhammer 40,000: Darktide. More are coming, including Atomic Heart, ILL SPACE and Warhaven.\n\nPlaying with the Future\nThere are many tales on the increasingly immersive streets of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Night City, but the one even non-gamers should pay attention to the story behind these stories: gaming as a proving ground for the technologies that will shape the future Cyberpunk 2077 is simulating right before our eyes.\nThis is the best of the best. CD PROJEKT RED is known for supporting its flagship titles like Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt for extended periods of time with a variety of patches that take advantage of modern hardware. It has earned a reputation as a game development studio that embraces emerging technologies.\nThat makes its games more than a cultural phenomenon. They\u2019re a technology-proving ground, a position held over the past two decades by a string of titles revered by gamers, such as Crysis, Metro and Far Cry.\nPC Games Unleash Global Innovation\nBuilding digital worlds such as these is the hard computing problem \u2014 the meanest streets in our increasingly digital world \u2014 out of which the parallel computing engines that are GPUs emerged.\nA decade ago, GPUs sparked the deep-learning revolution that has upended trillion-dollar industries around the world, one that continues with the latest advancements in generative AI such as ChatGPT and Dall-E that have erupted over the past month into a global cultural sensation.\nIt\u2019s a case study in the disruptive innovations Harvard Business School Professor Clayton Christensen identified as lurking in unexpected places.\nDLSS brings that revolution full circle, using the same deep-learning techniques harnessed for everything from cutting-edge science to self-driving cars to advance the visual quality of games.\nTrained on NVIDIA\u2019s supercomputers, DLSS enhances a new generation of games that demand ever more performance. And the use of DLSS 3 is just one example of this benchmark game\u2019s innovations \u2014 innovations woven into the texture of the game\u2019s storytelling.\nCD PROJEKT RED uses DirectX Ray Tracing, for example, a lighting technique that emulates the way light reflects and refracts in the real world to provide a more believable environment than what\u2019s typically seen using static lighting in more traditional games.\nThe game uses several ray-tracing techniques to render a massive future city at incredible levels of detail. The current version of the game uses ray-traced shadows, reflections, diffuse illumination and ambient occlusion.\nAnd if you turn on \u201cPsycho mode\u201d in the game\u2019s ray-traced lighting settings, you\u2019ll even see ray-traced global illumination as sunlight bounces realistically around the scene.\nCyberpunk 2077\u2019s Visual Storytelling Packs a Punch\u00a0\nThe result of all these features is a visually stunning experience that complements the world\u2019s story and tone: sprawling cityscapes that use subtle shadows to define depth, districts are bathed in neon lights, and windows, mirrors and puddles glistening with accurate reflections.\n\nWith realistic shadows and lighting and the added performance of NVIDIA DLSS 3, no other platform will compare to the Cyberpunk 2077 experience on a GeForce RTX-powered PC.\nBut that\u2019s just part of the bigger story.\nGames like these offer a window into the kind of visual capabilities now at the fingertips of architects and designers. It\u2019s a taste of the simulation capabilities being put to work by engineers at NASA and Lawrence Livermore Labs. And it shows what\u2019s possible in the next-generation environments for digital collaboration and simulation now being harnessed at scale by manufacturers such as BMW.\nSo muscle the geek in your life aside from the PC for an evening, grab the latest patch for Cyberpunk 2077 and a GeForce 40 Series GPU and gawk at the game\u2019s abundance of power and potential, put on display right in front of your face.\nIt\u2019s where we\u2019ll see the future first, and that future is looking better than ever.\nFind out more on GeForce.com.\nDevelopers looking to integrate future DLSS updates, including DLSS 3, can sign up to be notified when they become available here.\n\n\nCategories: GamingTags: GeForce | NVIDIA DLSS | Ray Tracing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

A new panel lets Blender users easily transfer shape keys and rigged characters.\u00a0 The challenge of reattaching a rigged character\u2019s head can now be solved with a one-button operation from Omniverse Audio2Face \u2014 an AI-enabled tool that automatically generates realistic facial expressions from an audio file.\nAnother new panel for scene optimization lets users create USD scenes within their multi-app 3D workflows more easily and in real time.\nIn addition, Audio2Face, Audio2Gesture and Audio2Emotion \u2014 generative AI tools that enable instant 3D character animation \u2014 are getting performance updates that make it easier for developers and creators to integrate into their current 3D pipelines.\nCreators can generate facial expressions from an audio file using Audio2Face; realistic emotions ranging from happy and excited to sad and regretful with Audio2Emotion; and realistic upper-body movement using Audio2Gesture. These audio-to-animation tools are game-changers for 3D artists, eliminating the need to perform tedious, manual tasks.\nAI-assisted creator tools are expanding to even more communities of creative and technical professionals. When NVIDIA Canvas was introduced, it empowered artists to seamlessly generate landscapes and iterate on them with simple brushstrokes and AI. Coming soon, all RTX users will be able to download an update to Canvas that introduces 360 surround images to create and conceptualize panoramic environments and beautiful images. The AI ToyBox, which features extensions derived from NVIDIA Research, enables creators to generate 3D meshes from 2D inputs.\nOmniverse\u2019s powerful AI tools simplify complex tasks. Creators of all levels can tap into these resources to produce high-quality outputs that meet the growing demands for content and virtual worlds in the metaverse.\n\u201cThe demand for 3D skills is skyrocketing, but learning 3D can be pretty scary to some, and definitely time consuming,\u201d said Jae Solina, aka JSFilmz. \u201cBut these new platform developments not only let creatives and technical professionals continue to work in their favorite 3D tools, but also supercharge their craft and even use AI to assist them in their workflows.\u201d\nOmniverse Launcher, the portal to download Omniverse content and reference applications, has also been made available to system builders so they can preinstall it, enabling optimized, out-of-the-box experiences for 3D creators on NVIDIA Studio-validated laptops. GIGABYTE and AORUS will be the first laptops launching in 2023 with Omniverse Launcher preinstalled, expanding platform access to a growing number of 3D content creators.\nNVIDIA RTX Remix is a free modding platform, built on Omniverse, that enables modders to quickly create and share #RTXON mods for classic games, each with full ray tracing, enhanced materials, NVIDIA DLSS 3 and NVIDIA Reflex. Its release in early access is coming soon. The jaw-dropping Portal with RTX was built with RTX Remix, and to demonstrate how easy it is for modders to turn RTX ON in their mods, we shared RTX Remix with the original creator of Portal: Prelude, an unofficial Portal prequel released in 2008.\nOmniverse users can also access thousands of new, free USD assets, including a USD-based NVIDIA RTX Winter World Minecraft experience, and learn to create their own NVIDIA SimReady assets for complex simulation building. Using Omniverse, creators can supercharge their existing workflows using familiar tools such as Autodesk Maya, Autodesk 3ds Max, Blender, Adobe Substance 3D Painter, and more with AI, simulation tools and real-time RTX-accelerated rendering.\nAll types of 3D creators can take advantage of these new tools to push the boundaries of 3D simulation and virtual world-building.

One aims to cure a congenital disease, another is designed to consume carbon dioxide to reduce global warming.\nInitial results show a new way to accelerate drug discovery and more.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really encouraging that even in this first round the AI model has produced synthetic proteins as good as naturally occurring ones,\u201d said Andrew Ferguson, Evozyne\u2019s co-founder and a co-author of the paper. \u201cThat tells us it\u2019s learned nature\u2019s design rules correctly.\u201d\nA Transformational AI Model\nEvozyne used NVIDIA\u2019s implementation of ProtT5, a transformer model that\u2019s part of NVIDIA BioNeMo, a software framework and service for creating AI models for healthcare.\n\u201cBioNeMo really gave us everything we needed to support model training and then run jobs with the model very inexpensively \u2014 we could generate millions of sequences in just a few seconds,\u201d said Ferguson, a molecular engineer working at the intersection of chemistry and machine learning.\nThe model lies at the heart of Evovyne\u2019s process called ProT-VAE. It\u2019s a workflow that combines BioNeMo with a variational autoencoder that acts as a filter.\n\u201cUsing large language models combined with variational autoencoders to design proteins was not on anybody\u2019s radar just a few years ago,\u201d he said.\nModel Learns Nature\u2019s Ways\nLike a student reading a book, NVIDIA\u2019s transformer model reads sequences of amino acids in millions of proteins. Using the same techniques neural networks employ to understand text, it learned how nature assembles these powerful building blocks of biology.\nThe model then predicted how to assemble new proteins suited for functions Evozyne wants to address.\n\u201cThe technology is enabling us to do things that were pipe dreams 10 years ago,\u201d he said.\nA Sea of Possibilities\nMachine learning helps navigate the astronomical number of possible protein sequences, then efficiently identifies the most useful ones.\nThe traditional method of engineering proteins, called directed evolution, uses a slow, hit-or-miss approach. It typically only changes a few amino acids in sequence at a time.\nEvozyne\u2019s ProT-VAE process uses a powerful transformer model in NVIDIA BioNeMo to generate useful proteins for drug discovery and energy sustainability.\nBy contrast, Evozyne\u2019s approach can alter half or more of the amino acids in a protein in a single round. That\u2019s the equivalent of making hundreds of mutations.\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking huge jumps which allows us to explore proteins never seen before that have new and useful functions,\u201d he said.\nUsing the new process, Evozyne plans to build a range of proteins to fight diseases and climate change.\nSlashing Training Time, Scaling Models\n\u201cNVIDIA\u2019s been an incredible partner on this work,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThey scaled jobs to multiple GPUs to speed up training,\u201d said Joshua Moller, a data scientist at Evozyne. \u201cWe were getting through entire datasets every minute.\u201d\nThat reduced the time to train large AI models from months to a week. \u201cIt allowed us to train models \u2014 some with billions of trainable parameters \u2014 that just would not be possible otherwise,\u201d Ferguson said.\nMuch More to Come\nThe horizon for AI-accelerated protein engineering is wide.\n\u201cThe field is moving incredibly quickly, and I\u2019m really excited to see what comes next,\u201d he said, noting the recent rise of diffusion models.\n\u201cWho knows where we will be in five years\u2019 time.\u201d\nSign up for early access to the NVIDIA BioNeMo to see how it can accelerate your applications.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA A100 | NVIDIA NeMo | Science | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

See our ethics statement.The effect is very impressive in stills, but wait until you see it in motion. Image: NvidiaNvidia\u2019s streaming software now has an option to make it appear like you\u2019re making eye contact with the camera, even if you\u2019re looking somewhere else in real life. Using AI, the \u201cEye Contact\u201d feature added to Nvidia Broadcast 1.4 will replace your eyes with \u201csimulated\u201d ones that are aligned with your camera \u2014 an effect that worked really well when we tested it ourselves, except for all the times it didn\u2019t.In an announcement post, the company writes the feature is meant for \u201ccontent creators seeking to record themselves while reading their notes or a script\u201d without having to look directly at a camera. Pitching it as something you\u2019d use during a public performance, instead of something you\u2019d use socially, does kind of sidestep the dilemmas that come with this sort of tech. Is it rude to use AI to trick my mom into thinking I\u2019m engaged in our video call when I\u2019m actually looking at my phone? Or, to make my boss think I\u2019m not writing an article on my other monitor during a meeting? (I\u2019m going to say yes, given that getting caught in either scenario would land me in hot water.)Nvidia suggests that Eye Contact will try to make your simulated eyes match the color of your real ones, and there\u2019s \u201ceven a disconnect feature in case you look too far away.\u201dHere\u2019s a demo side by side with an unedited stream, so you can compare how my eyes are actually moving to how Nvidia\u2019s software renders them:Looking at the results I got, I\u2019m not a huge fan of Eye Contact \u2014 I think it makes things just look a little off. Part of that is the animated eye movement. While it\u2019s very cool that it\u2019s even possible, it sometimes ends up making it look like my eyes are darting around at superhuman speeds. There\u2019s also the odd, very distracting pop-ins that you can see near the end of the video.There were definitely a few times when the feature got it right, and when it did, it was very impressive. Still, the misses were too frequent and noticeable for me to use this the next time I show up to a meeting (though, in theory, I could).Nvidia does label the feature as a beta and is soliciting feedback from community members to help it improve. \u201cThere are millions of eye colors and lighting combinations,\u201d the company says. \u201cIf you test it and find any issues, or just want to help us develop this AI effect further, please send us a quick video here, we would really appreciate it!\u201dNvidia has been leaning heavily into this sort of AI generation in recent years \u2014 a major selling point of its graphics cards is DLSS, a feature that uses machine learning to intelligently upscale images, adding information that\u2019s not there when you go to a lower (but easier to run) resolution. The latest version, DLSS 3, generates and inserts entirely new frames into your gameplay, like how Broadcast generates and adds a new pair of eyes to your face.Broadcast also has other AI-powered features, such as background replacement that works as a virtual green screen and the ability to clean up background noises that your microphone picks up.This isn\u2019t the first eye contact feature we\u2019ve seen. Apple started testing a similar feature called \u201cAttention Correction\u201d for FaceTime in 2018. In current versions of iOS, it\u2019s labeled as \u201cEye Contact\u201d in Settings > FaceTime. Microsoft also has a version of the feature in Windows 11 for devices with a neural processing unit.Eye Contact isn\u2019t the only feature Nvidia added to Broadcast version 1.4. The latest update also brings a vignette effect that Nvidia says is similar to Instagram\u2019s and improves the Blur, Replacement, and Removal Virtual Background effects. The update is currently available to download for anyone with an RTX graphics card.See More: AINewsNvidiaTechMore in this streamSee allSpotify says it\u2019s recovered after an outageRichard LawlerJan 14, 2023CommentsComment Icon BubbleWhat can we expect if Apple adds touchscreens to the MacBook Pro?Richard Lawler, Dan Seifert and 1 moreJan 13, 2023CommentsComment Icon BubbleMicrosoft\u2019s fix for disappearing Windows application shortcuts doesn\u2019t bring them backTom WarrenJan 13, 2023CommentsComment Icon BubbleMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

These AI assistants can be designed for organizations across industries, enabling organizations to enhance existing workflows and unlock new business opportunities.\nACE is one of several generative AI applications that will help creators accelerate the development of 3D worlds and the metaverse. Members who join the program will receive access to the prerelease versions of NVIDIA\u2019s AI microservices, as well as the tooling and documentation needed to develop cloud-native AI workflows for interactive avatar applications.\n\nBring Interactive AI Avatars to Life With Omniverse ACE\nMethods for developing avatars often require expertise, specialized equipment and manually intensive workflows. To ease avatar creation, Omniverse ACE enables seamless integration of NVIDIA\u2019s AI technologies \u2014 including pre-built models, toolsets and domain-specific reference applications \u2014 into avatar applications built on most engines and deployed on public or private clouds.\nSince it was unveiled in September, Omniverse ACE has been shared with select partners to capture early feedback. Now, NVIDIA is looking for partners who will provide feedback on the microservices, collaborate to improve the product, and push the limits of what\u2019s possible with lifelike, interactive digital humans.\nThe early-access program includes access to the prerelease versions of ACE animation AI and conversational AI microservices, including:\n\n3D animation AI microservice for third-party avatars, which uses Omniverse Audio2Face generative AI to bring to life characters in Unreal Engine and other rendering tools by creating realistic facial animation from just an audio file.\n2D animation AI microservice, called Live Portrait, enables easy animation of 2D portraits or stylized human faces using live video feeds.\nText-to-speech microservice uses NVIDIA Riva TTS to synthesize natural-sounding speech from raw transcripts without any additional information, such as patterns or rhythms of speech.\n\nProgram members will also get access to tooling, sample reference applications and supporting resources to help get started.\nAvatars Make Their Mark Across Industries\nOmniverse ACE can help teams build interactive, digital humans that elevate experiences across industries, providing:\n\nEasy animation of characters, so users can bring them to life with minimal expertise.\nThe ability to deploy on cloud, which means avatars will be usable virtually anywhere, such as a quick-service restaurant kiosk, a tablet or a virtual-reality headset.\nA plug-and-play suite, built on NVIDIA Unified Compute Framework (UCF), which enables interoperability between NVIDIA AI and other solutions, ensuring state-of-the-art AI that fits each use case.\n\nPartners such as Ready Player Me and Epic Games have experienced how Omniverse ACE can enhance workflows for AI avatars.\nThe Omniverse ACE animation AI microservice supports 3D characters from Ready Player Me, a platform for building cross-game avatars.\n\u201cDigital avatars are becoming a significant part of our daily lives. People are using avatars in games, virtual events and social apps, and even as a way to enter the metaverse,\u201d said Timmu T\u00f5ke, CEO and co-founder of Ready Player Me. \u201cWe spent seven years building the perfect avatar system, making it easy for developers to integrate in their apps and games and for users to create one avatar to explore various worlds \u2014 with NVIDIA Omniverse ACE, teams can now more easily bring these characters to life.\u201d\n\nEpic Games\u2019 advanced MetaHuman technology transformed the creation of realistic, high-fidelity digital humans. Omniverse ACE, combined with the MetaHuman framework, will make it even easier for users to design and deploy engaging 3D avatars.\nDigital humans don\u2019t just have to be conversational. They can be singers, as well \u2014 just like the AI avatar Toy Jensen. NVIDIA\u2019s creative team quickly created a holiday performance by TJ, using Omniverse ACE to extract the voice of a singer and turn it into TJ\u2019s voice. This enabled the avatar to sing at the same pitch and with the same rhythm as the original artist.\n\nMany creators are venturing into VTubing, a new way of livestreaming. Users embody a 2D avatar and interact with viewers. With Omniverse ACE, creators can move their avatars into 3D from 2D animation, including photos and stylistic faces. Users can render the avatars from the cloud and animate the characters from anywhere.\nAdditionally, the NVIDIA Tokkio reference application is expanding, with early partners building cloud-native customer service avatars for industries such as telco, banking and more.\nJoin the Early-Access Program\nEarly access to Omniverse ACE is available to developers and teams building avatars and virtual assistants.\nWatch the NVIDIA special address at CES on demand.\u00a0Learn more about NVIDIA Omniverse ACE and register to join the early-access program.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AI | Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | Artificial Intelligence | CES 2023 | Omniverse \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

To avoid placing unsustainable demands on electricity generation to run this computing infrastructure, the underlying technology must be as efficient as possible.\nAccelerated computing powered by NVIDIA GPUs and the NVIDIA AI platform offer the efficiency that enables data centers to sustainably drive the next generation of breakthroughs.\nAnd now, timed with the launch of 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors, NVIDIA and its partners have kicked off a new generation of accelerated computing systems that are built for energy-efficient AI. When combined with NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs, these systems can deliver dramatically higher performance, greater scale and higher efficiency than the prior generation, providing more computation and problem-solving per watt.\nThe new Intel CPUs will be used in NVIDIA DGX H100 systems, as well as in more than 60 servers featuring H100 GPUs from NVIDIA partners around the world.\nSupercharging Speed, Efficiency and Savings for Enterprise AI\nThe coming NVIDIA and Intel-powered systems will help enterprises run workloads an average of 25x more efficiently than traditional CPU-only data center servers. This incredible performance per watt means less power is needed to get jobs done, which helps ensure the power available to data centers is used as efficiently as possible to supercharge the most important work.\nCompared to prior-generation accelerated systems, this new generation of NVIDIA-accelerated servers speed training and inference to boost energy efficiency by 3.5x \u2013 which translates into real cost savings, with AI data centers delivering over 3x lower total cost of ownership.\nNew 4th Gen Intel Xeon CPUs Move More Data to Accelerate NVIDIA AI\nAmong the features of the new 4th Gen Intel Xeon CPU is support for PCIe Gen 5, which can double the data transfer rates from CPU to NVIDIA GPUs and networking. Increased PCIe lanes allow for a greater density of GPUs and high-speed networking within each server.\nFaster memory bandwidth also improves the performance of data-intensive workloads such as AI, while networking speeds \u2014 up to 400 gigabits per second (Gbps) per connection \u2014 support faster data transfers between servers and storage.\nNVIDIA DGX H100 systems and servers from NVIDIA partners with H100 PCIe GPUs come with a license for NVIDIA AI Enterprise, an end-to-end, secure, cloud-native suite of AI development and deployment software, providing a complete platform for excellence in efficient enterprise AI.\nNVIDIA DGX H100 Systems Supercharge Efficiency for Supersize AI\nAs the fourth generation of the world\u2019s premier purpose-built AI infrastructure, NVIDIA DGX H100 systems provide a fully optimized platform powered by the operating system of the accelerated data center, NVIDIA Base Command software.\nEach DGX H100 system features eight NVIDIA H100 GPUs, 10 NVIDIA ConnectX-7 network adapters and dual 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors to deliver the performance required to build large generative AI models, large language models, recommender systems and more.\nCombined with NVIDIA networking, this architecture supercharges efficient computing at scale by delivering up to 9x more performance than the previous generation and 20x to 40x more performance than unaccelerated X86 dual-socket servers for AI training and HPC workloads. If a language model previously required 40 days to train on a cluster of X86-only servers, the NVIDIA DGX H100 using Intel Xeon CPUs and ConnectX-7 powered networking could complete the same work in as little as 1-2 days.\nNVIDIA DGX H100 systems are the building blocks of an enterprise-ready, turnkey NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, which delivers up to one exaflop of AI performance, providing a leap in efficiency for large-scale enterprise AI deployment.\nNVIDIA Partners Boost Data Center Efficiency\u00a0\nFor AI data center workloads, NVIDIA H100 GPUs enable enterprises to build and deploy applications more efficiently.\nBringing a new generation of performance and energy efficiency to enterprises worldwide, a broad portfolio of systems with H100 GPUs and 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable CPUs are coming soon from NVIDIA partners, including ASUS, Atos, Cisco, Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, QCT and Supermicro.\nAs the bellwether of the efficiency gains to come, the Flatiron Institute\u2019s Lenovo ThinkSystem with NVIDIA H100 GPUs tops the latest Green500 list \u2014 and NVIDIA technologies power 23 of the top 30 systems on the list.

NVIDIA will provide its DRIVE Orin system-on-a-chip and DRIVE software, with intelligent driving capabilities tested and validated in the NVIDIA DRIVE Sim platform, which is also built on Omniverse.\nThe automaker\u2019s latest announcement infuses AI and metaverse technologies even further into the Mercedes-Benz development process with smarter, more efficient manufacturing.\nElectric-First Platform Built on Digital-First Process\nVehicle production is a colossal undertaking that requires thousands of parts and workers moving in harmony. Any supply chain or production issues can lead to costly delays.\nOn top of that, when automakers roll out a new model, they must reconfigure the layout of production plants to account for the new vehicle design. This process can take significant portions of the factory offline, pausing manufacturing for existing vehicles.\nMercedes-Benz plans to start production of its new dedicated platform for electric vehicles at its plant in Rastatt, Germany. The site currently manufactures the automaker\u2019s A- and B-Class as well as the compact SUV GLA and the all-electric Mercedes-Benz EQA.\nMercedes-Benz plant in Rastatt, Germany, where the all-electric EQA is manufactured.\nExperts from NVIDIA and Mercedes-Benz operations are setting up a \u201cdigital first\u201d \u2013 planning process for the plant that won\u2019t disrupt the current production of compact car models at the site. This blueprint will be rolled out to other parts of the global Mercedes-Benz production network for more agile vehicle manufacturing.\nDeveloping With Digital Twins\nNVIDIA Omniverse is an open 3D development platform enabling enterprises and institutions across all industries to build and operate digital twins for industrial and scientific use cases. It\u2019s based on Universal Scene Description (USD), allowing enterprises and developers to construct custom 3D pipelines to break down data silos and interact with a single-source-of-truth view of their aggregated simulations.\nWith Omniverse, Mercedes-Benz planners can access the digital twin of the factory, reviewing and optimizing the plant as needed. Every change can be quickly evaluated and validated in the virtual world, then implemented in the real world to ensure maximum efficiency and ergonomics for factory workers.\nAdditionally, Mercedes-Benz can synchronize plant locations anywhere in the world by connecting Omniverse with its in-house MO360 Data Platform.\nThis capability streamlines operations across the global production network and enables over-the-air software updates to manufacturing equipment.\nBy planning production on NVIDIA Omniverse, Mercedes-Benz is implementing a manufacturing system as intelligent as its vehicles.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: CES 2023 | Industrial and Manufacturing | NVIDIA DRIVE | Omniverse | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It\u2019s a wildly diverse collection of nearly 26 petabytes of data, ideal for training state-of-the-art AI.\n\u201cWe can build state-of-the-art AI models for the Swedish language since we have the best data,\u201d said Love B\u00f6rjeson, director of KBLab, the library\u2019s data lab.\n\nUsing NVIDIA DGX systems, the group has developed more than two dozen open-source transformer models, available on Hugging Face. The models, downloaded by up to 200,000 developers per month, enable research at the library and other academic institutions.\n\u201cBefore our lab was created, researchers couldn\u2019t access a dataset at the library \u2014 they\u2019d have to look at a single object at a time,\u201d B\u00f6rjeson said. \u201cThere was a need for the library to create datasets that enabled researchers to conduct quantity-oriented research.\u201d\nWith this, researchers will soon be able to create hyper-specialized datasets \u2014 for example, pulling up every Swedish postcard that depicts a church, every text written in a particular style or every mention of a historical figure across books, newspaper articles and TV broadcasts.\nTurning Library Archives Into AI Training Data\nThe library\u2019s datasets represent the full diversity of the Swedish language \u2014 including its formal and informal variations, regional dialects and changes over time.\n\u201cOur inflow is continuous and growing \u2014 every month, we see more than 50 terabytes of new data,\u201d said B\u00f6rjeson. \u201cBetween the exponential growth of digital data and ongoing work digitizing physical collections that date back hundreds of years, we\u2019ll never be finished adding to our collections.\u201d\nThe library\u2019s archives include audio, text and video.\nSoon after KBLab was established in 2019, B\u00f6rjeson saw the potential for training transformer language models on the library\u2019s vast archives. He was inspired by an early, multilingual, natural language processing model by Google that included 5GB of Swedish text.\nKBLab\u2019s first model used 4x as much \u2014 and the team now aims to train its models on at least a terabyte of Swedish text. The lab began experimenting by adding Dutch, German and Norwegian content to its datasets after finding that a multilingual dataset may improve the AI\u2019s performance.\nNVIDIA AI, GPUs Accelerate Model Development\u00a0\nThe lab started out using consumer-grade NVIDIA GPUs, but B\u00f6rjeson soon discovered his team needed data-center-scale compute to train larger models.\n\u201cWe realized we can\u2019t keep up if we try to do this on small workstations,\u201d said B\u00f6rjeson. \u201cIt was a no-brainer to go for NVIDIA DGX. There\u2019s a lot we wouldn\u2019t be able to do at all without the DGX systems.\u201d\nThe lab has two NVIDIA DGX systems from Swedish provider AddPro for on-premises AI development. The systems are used to handle sensitive data, conduct large-scale experiments and fine-tune models. They\u2019re also used to prepare for even larger runs on massive, GPU-based supercomputers across the European Union \u2014 including the MeluXina system in Luxembourg.\n\u201cOur work on the DGX systems is critically important, because once we\u2019re in a high-performance computing environment, we want to hit the ground running,\u201d said B\u00f6rjeson. \u201cWe have to use the supercomputer to its fullest extent.\u201d\nThe team has also adopted NVIDIA NeMo Megatron, a PyTorch-based framework for training large language models, with NVIDIA CUDA and the NVIDIA NCCL library under the hood to optimize GPU usage in multi-node systems.\n\u201cWe rely to a large extent on the NVIDIA frameworks,\u201d B\u00f6rjeson said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the big advantages of NVIDIA for us, as a small lab that doesn\u2019t have 50 engineers available to optimize AI training for every project.\u201d\nHarnessing Multimodal Data for Humanities Research\nIn addition to transformer models that understand Swedish text, KBLab has an AI tool that transcribes sound to text, enabling the library to transcribe its vast collection of radio broadcasts so that researchers can search the audio records for specific content.\nAI-enhanced databases are the latest evolution of library records, which were long stored in physical card catalogs.\nKBLab is also starting to develop generative text models and is working on an AI model that could process videos and create automatic descriptions of their content.\n\u201cWe also want to link all the different modalities,\u201d B\u00f6rjeson said. \u201cWhen you search the library\u2019s databases for a specific term, we should be able to return results that include text, audio and video.\u201d\nKBLab has partnered with researchers at the University of Gothenburg, who are developing downstream apps using the lab\u2019s models to conduct linguistic research \u2014 including a project supporting the Swedish Academy\u2019s work to modernize its data-driven techniques for creating Swedish dictionaries.\n\u201cThe societal benefits of these models are much larger than we initially expected,\u201d B\u00f6rjeson said.\nImages courtesy of Kungliga biblioteket\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | ResearchTags: Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA DGX | NVIDIA in Europe | NVIDIA NeMo | Open Source | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

For gamers, RTX 40 Series laptops deliver up to 4x the performance in AAA games like full ray-traced Cyberpunk 2077 with new RT Overdrive Mode, and, for creators, they offer blazing-fast acceleration in top creative apps such as Blender.\n\u201cWith the Ada architecture, we set out to transform the performance and power efficiency of gaming and creator laptops,\u201d said Jeff Fisher, senior vice president of the GeForce business at NVIDIA. \u201cThe new RTX 40 Series delivers enthusiast-class performance in laptops as slim as 14 inches, a new milestone.\u201d\nRTX 4090 and RTX 4080: A New Class of Flagship Laptops\r\nThe Ada architecture has also enabled a new class of enthusiast laptops that are the world\u2019s fastest. Gamers can play on three 4K monitors for surround gaming at 60 frames per second \u2014 enough to power a professional-grade driving simulator. Creators can use the NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122 platform for photorealistic, 3D virtual world building at 4K with fully simulated physics, lighting and materials. Streamers can livestream games at 4K 60 fps with AV1 encoding to Discord, and Ada\u2019s new dual encoders cut video export time in half. RTX 40 Series flagship laptops start at $1,999 and will be available beginning Feb. 8.\nRTX 4070, 4060, 4050 Laptops: Faster Than Last-Generation Flagship at One-Third the Power\r\nThe new RTX 4070, 4060 and 4050 laptops are faster than the previous-generation flagship model, using as little as one-third the GPU power. They deliver 80 fps, 1440p ultra-gaming and transform creation processes like rendering scenes in Blender, which used to take two and a half hours, to just 10 minutes. RTX 4050 laptops start at $999 and will be available beginning Feb. 22.\nFifth-Generation Max-Q Technologies Improve Laptop Efficiency\r\nWith each new GPU generation since 2017, advancements in Max-Q technology have improved laptop design. Today, alongside the launch of the GeForce RTX 40 Series laptops, NVIDIA is introducing its fifth-generation Max-Q technologies, which radically enhance efficiency and accelerate gaming performance using the following upgrades:\n\nNVIDIA\u00ae DLSS 3 has been optimized for laptops and built into Max-Q technologies, including Whispermode and BatteryBoost, which improve performance, acoustics and battery life by up to 2x.\nThe lowest voltage GDDR6 memory ever, shipped in partnership with leading manufacturers.\nTri-speed memory control enables the GPU to switch to newer, lower-power memory states dynamically.\nAda\u2019s on-chip memory has been optimized for Max-Q, doubling the bandwidth, increasing the size by 16x and improving clock gating.\n\n14-Inch Laptops More Powerful Than Ever\r\nBefore the introduction of the Ada architecture, 95% of this fastest-growing laptop segment was limited to basic tasks and apps. Equipped with GeForce RTX 40 Series Laptop GPUs, 14-inch laptops can take on tasks that were previously impossible, such as ultra-fast 3D rendering in Blender and cutting-edge AI tools in popular apps like Adobe Photoshop or Premiere Pro.\nPowered by RTX 40 Series Laptop GPUs, 14-inch laptops are also gaming powerhouses, up to twice as fast as a PlayStation 5 but one-sixth the size. Gamers can play graphically intense AAA games, like Cyberpunk 2077, with ray tracing and DLSS. Connecting the ultra-portable laptops to external monitors turns them into desktop-class gaming rigs or creator studios.\nPurpose-Built for 110 Million Creators\r\nThe creator market continues to grow rapidly, surpassing more than 110 million professional and hobbyist PC creators. And 3D creation on NVIDIA hardware, specifically, is showing staggering growth \u2014 with a 42 percent increase since last year.\nLaptops with GeForce RTX 40 Series Laptop GPUs take advantage of the NVIDIA Studio ecosystem with RTX and Max-Q technologies to offer the ideal combination of efficiency and performance. The improved efficiency accelerates even the most demanding workflows with up to 3x longer battery life.\nGeForce RTX laptop users benefit from NVIDIA Studio accelerations in over 110 of the most popular creative apps \u2014 plus exclusive access to AI-powered apps like NVIDIA Omniverse, Canvas and Broadcast. 3D artists can collaborate with one another in Omniverse from anywhere in the world, while video editors can produce on location faster with AI tools and cut export times in half with dual encoders.\nAvailability \r\nGeForce RTX 40 Series laptops will be available starting Feb. 8 from the world\u2019s top manufacturers, including Acer, Alienware, ASUS, Dell, GIGABYTE, HP, Lenovo, MSI, Razer and Samsung. They will also be available from local makers and system builders, including CyberPower PC, Eluktronics, Hasee, PC Specialist 3XS by Scan and Schenker, with more coming in Q1.\nPricing, configurations and availability will vary among regions and partners. Press assets, including product photographs, specifications, chip and die shots and other materials, are available on the NVIDIA press site at www.nvidia-press.com.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

With GeForce RTX 4080 performance, Ultimate members will be the first to experience true PC gaming \u2014 streaming at up to 240 frames per second from the cloud with full ray tracing and DLSS 3, in hit games like Portal With RTX. With the addition of NVIDIA Reflex, GeForce NOW achieves click-to-pixel latency below 40 milliseconds \u2014 another first in cloud gaming.\n\u201cNVIDIA\u2019s Ada architecture is a big leap in graphics quality, and through GeForce NOW we\u2019re streaming an RTX 4080 experience to more devices and more gamers than ever,\u201d said Jeff Fisher, senior vice president of GeForce at NVIDIA. \u201cGeForce NOW Ultimate members will have the technology and the performance to experience even the most demanding games in their full ray-traced glory.\u201d\nCurrent GeForce NOW RTX 3080 members will be upgraded immediately to Ultimate memberships and be among the first to experience the full benefits of GeForce RTX 4080 performance in the cloud when the servers start rolling out later this month.\nRTX Technologies to the Cloud\r\nNVIDIA RTX technologies introduced with the Ultimate membership are lifting cloud gaming to new heights. NVIDIA Reflex 240-fps mode brings frame-pacing technology to the cloud, which helps streamline the execution of game simulation, rendering and encoding on the server. When paired with an NVIDIA G-SYNC\u00ae monitor, GeForce NOW will vary the streaming rate to the client for the first time, delivering smooth and instantaneous frame updates to client screens on Reflex-enabled games \u2014 further driving down total latency.\nNext-generation RTX technologies coming to GeForce NOW include full ray tracing and DLSS 3 \u2014 introduced with the GeForce RTX 40 Series launch. They deliver beautiful, cinematic-quality graphics and use AI to keep frame rates smooth.\nThe Ultimate Benefits\r\nGeForce NOW Ultimate members are set to receive three major streaming upgrades. The new SuperPODs are capable of rendering and streaming at up to 240 fps. Paired with NVIDIA Reflex, members\u2019 game play will feel as if it is on a desktop PC.\n4K gaming goes from fast to beyond fast with an upgrade from 60 fps to 120 fps, while ultrawide monitors will be supported for the first time, at up to 3,840 x 1,600 resolution, including many popular variants such as 3440 x 1440 and 2560 x 1080.\nUltimate members can enjoy longer streaming sessions, fastest access to the highest-performance cloud gaming servers and game settings that persist from session to session.\nIt\u2019s Time to Play the Game\r\nGeForce NOW recently eclipsed the 1,500 game milestone \u2014 with mega-hits from top publishers like Electronic Arts and Ubisoft, popular PC indie titles like Valheim and Rust, and over 100 of the biggest free-to-play games like Fortnite and Genshin Impact. New games are released every GFN Thursday, and new features like Ubisoft account syncing bring members into their games instantly. Games are available from the biggest PC game stores, including Steam, Epic, Ubisoft and Electronic Arts.\nMembers will be able to stream some of the biggest upcoming PC game launches on the service, starting with Portal With RTX later this week. Relive the critically acclaimed and award-winning Portal reimagined with full ray tracing and higher frame rates with DLSS 3, streaming from the cloud.\nUltimate members will see performance multiply with DLSS 3 for Atomic Heart, from Mundfish and Focus Entertainment. FNTASTIC and MyTona\u2019s The Day Before launches later this year, accelerated by DLSS 3, and with a detailed world enhanced with ray-traced reflections. Stream with, or against, friends with the realistic physics engine in Party Animals from Recreate Games and Source Technology.\nThe GeForce NOW catalog features many of the most popular PC games, including recent day-and-date releases of Marvel\u2019s Midnight Suns, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Next-Gen Update, as well as massive, free-to-play titles like Destiny 2, Lost Ark and Apex Legends.\nPricing and Availability\r\nThe GeForce NOW Ultimate membership is available for new user sign-ups today, at $19.99 per month or $99.99 for six months. GeForce RTX 3080 members\u2019 accounts have already been converted to the new membership at their current pricing. Upgraded GeForce RTX 4080 performance streaming from the new SuperPODs will be available in North America and Europe starting later this month, with continued rollout over the months to follow.

We know buying a car in Singapore is one of the most expensive purchases you can make. On top of that, thousands of dollars go towards car maintenance, petrol, insurance, and other car-related expenses. If you live in an HDB flat or want to park in an HDB estate near your workplace, then you will probably need to apply for an HDB season parking pass. Whether you\u2019re looking for information on how to do a season parking transfer or season parking renewal, this article has got you covered. Season Parking Application, Transfer, and Renewal Overview  What is HDB season parking\u00a0A monthly subscription that allows you to park your vehicle(s) at HDB car parks How to apply\u00a0Using Singpass via Application for New HDB e-service Season Parking or Mobile@HDB app Payment methods\u00a0Credit or debit card only. Renew via GIRO for a 2% rebate.

With a valid subscription, you can park your car or motorcycle within a certain HDB car park group at any time. Plus, you no longer have to display parking coupons when you have a season pass. You\u2019re also eligible to apply for season parking even if you don\u2019t live in an HDB flat, provided that the car park you\u2019re applying for is close to where to live or work.  For example, if your workplace is near an HDB estate, but you don\u2019t want to fork out a fortune for your office car park, you can apply for one at a nearby HDB parking lot. But do note many drivers probably have the same idea, so be prepared to face stiff competition! If you\u2019re thinking \u201ccan I have 2 HDB season parking?\u201d you actually can! However, do note that prices will vary due to the different tiers. Season Parking Payment Methods Like everything else in life these days, you can apply for your HDB season parking online. There are two ways you can do this, via HDB\u2019s e-Service, or through HDB\u2019s mobile app. HDB e-Service: You can submit your season parking application via HDB\u2019s e-Service. You\u2019ll need to log in using your SingPass and follow the instructions given on the portal. HDB mobile app: Alternatively, you can download the Mobile@HDB App from the App Store (for iOS) or Google Play Store (for Android) to submit your application.    Story continues Whichever method you choose, you\u2019ll need to pay for your season parking either by credit card or direct debit:Credit card: Only Visa and Mastercard are accepted. Direct debit: DBS, UOB, OCBC, Citibank, and Standard Chartered. Before applying, be sure to run a search for available lots near you using the HDB Season Parking Information portal.Some HDB parking areas are more popular than others and are prioritised for specific groups of people (e.g. residents or tenants with their first car).If you\u2019re thinking of applying for one of these HDB parking lots, you will need to submit the following documents for verification: Business Registration CertificateYou are a registered shop tenant of an HDB commercial/industrial premise Letter from your companyYou drive a company-registered vehicle home OR a company car home and are an employee of a car rental company Letter from a taxi organisationYou drive a taxi home Season Parking: How Are HDB Parking Lots Allocated?As mentioned, parking slots and allocation are prioritised for residents or tenants with one vehicle, as well as those who work around the vicinity.Slots are also allocated based on a first-come, first-served basis every month, so in order to boost your chances of securing a slot, you should apply as soon as the booking period opens.There are two types of HDB season parking: high occupancy car parks and low occupancy car parks.If you\u2019re applying for HDB car parks with low demand, you can start booking from the first month onwards. But if you\u2019ve applied for a popular car park, you can only start booking on your assigned date. This will be based on the priority group that you\u2019re in.As the HDB car parks are meant for HDB residents, you\u2019ll be one of the first people to book a lot every month if you\u2019re a resident.HDB Season Parking Priority and Booking Dates Priority groupWho\u2019s eligible?Booking date First priorityFirst vehicle owned by HDB flat owners, tenants, authorised occupiers, approved sub-tenants of whole flats, commercial tenants, and\u00a0HDB\u2019s shops/offices employeesFrom the 1st of every month Second prioritySecond and subsequent vehicles owned by flat owners/ tenants/ authorised occupiers/ registered shop tenantsFrom the 18th of every month Third priorityResidents who do not own the vehicle, sub-tenants of flats, non-residentsFrom the 21st of every month First PriorityFirst priority booking date starts from the 1st of the month.Who Is Eligible for First Priority Booking?First vehicle owned byHDB flat owners, tenants, authorised occupiers and approved sub-tenants of whole flats Registered tenants of HDB commercial and industrial premises Market and hawker stallholders Employees of HDB\u2019s shops/offices, or first company-registered vehicle of HDB flat owners, tenants, and authorised occupiers  Second PrioritySecond priority booking date starts from the 18th of the monthWho Is Eligible for Second Priority Booking?Second and subsequent vehicles owned by flat owners/ tenants/ authorised occupiers/ registered shop tenants Third PriorityThird priority booking date starts from the 21st of the month.Who Is Eligible for Third Priority Booking?Residents who do not own the vehicle Sub-tenants of rooms of flat, and/or non-residents In essence, these arrangements are in place to help prioritise season parking allocation for HDB residents. After all, no one wants to come home after a long, hard day at work and have to struggle to find a place to park.HDB Parking Rates for Season Parking Holders Location/type of car parkTier 1 carsTier 2 carsCommercial VehiclesMotorcycle Restricted zone (surface/kerbside)$80$165$185$15 Restricted zone (sheltered)$110$190$185$17 Designated area (surface/kerbside)$80$150$185$15 Designated area (sheltered)$110$170$185$17 Rest of island (surface/kerbside)$80$90$185$15 Rest of island (sheltered)$110$120$185$17 Special precinct$95$105\u2013\u2013 Industrial park (multi-storey car park)$110$120$130$17 Industrial park (night parking)\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 Centralised lorry park$80$90$85$15 Tier 1 HDB parking rates apply to the first car of an HDB resident\u2019s household.

FSP costs half the price of \u2018normal\u2019 season parking charges: Type of HDB car park\u00a0Passenger CarMotorcycleCommercial Vehicle Surface$40$7.50$92.50 Sheltered (e.g. multi-storey car park)$55$8.50$92.50 Special precinct\u00a0$47.50\u00a0$8.50$92.50 According to HDB, you must fulfil the following criteria to be eligible to apply for FSP:You must be the owner, authorised occupier, approved subtenant of an HDB flat/ room, or an owner/ tenant of an HDB shop with living quarters You must have valid HDB season parking for your HDB flat/shop with living quarters You must be able to prove your relationship with your family member (i.e. parents/children/ siblings/grandparents/in-laws) You must be able to prove that your family member is living in the HDB flat/shop You may apply online through the HDB e-service season parking or Mobile@HDB app, or physically at the HDB branch office.HDB Season Parking Renewal1. Automatic RenewalSeason parking renewal can be renewed using the following methods:GIRO scheme Recurring Payment by Credit Card (RPCC) These methods let you automatically pay your fees every month, so you don\u2019t have to worry about forgetting to renew your season parking. Plus, if you renew it with the GIRO scheme, you\u2019ll receive a 2% rebate for every successful transaction.2. Manual RenewalIf you prefer to renew your season parking manually every month, you can do so by one of the 3 methods below:Renewal of Season Parking e-Service Mobile@HDB app AXS machines The payment method for the renewal via the e-Service and mobile app is the same as the application. You can pay either by credit card or direct debit.Do take note that you\u2019ll be charged a full month\u2019s rate. So if you renew your season parking later in the month, say on 15 June, you\u2019ll have to pay the monthly rate even though you can only use it from 15 to 30 June.HDB Season Parking Transfer1. Permanent TransferYou can do a permanent transfer for HDB season parking when you\u2019re changing:Car park groups (e.g. you\u2019re moving to a new house) Vehicles (e.g. you bought a new car) Vehicle type (e.g. you\u2019re upgrading from a motorcycle to a car) You can apply for the transfer via the Permanent Transfer of Season Parking (PTSP) service or the Mobile@HDB app.If the vehicle is a company vehicle, you\u2019ll also need to submit a letter of authorisation from the company. Additionally, you\u2019ll have to pay for the transfer if you\u2019re changing the type of vehicle or the HDB car park.2. Temporary TransferOn the other hand, you can apply for a temporary transfer of season parking, which is valid for a maximum of 31 days. This isn\u2019t meant for long-term or frequent use of season parking.A temporary transfer will be applicable if you are in one of the following situations:You\u2019re driving a temporary replacement vehicle while your vehicle is being serviced or repaired You need to park your vehicle elsewhere temporarily (e.g. your house is being renovated, so you\u2019re staying with another family member) You can apply for a temporary transfer via the Temporary Transfer of Season Parking (TTSP) e-Service or the Mobile@HDB app. You may also be required to submit supporting documents.If you need to make any changes to your current temporary season parking, you\u2019ll have to cancel it first via the Cancellation of Temporary Transfer of Season Parking service. After that, you can re-apply through the e-Service with the changes.You may be required to make a top-up if you are changing to a car park with a higher season parking rate (e.g. a surface car park to a multi-storey car park).Note that if you\u2019re changing to a car park with a lower rate or do not utilise the full temporary season parking subscription, there won\u2019t be any refunds given.Season Parking HDB CancellationUpgrading from an HDB flat to private property?

REITs are almost akin to bonds as you can count on the regularity of their distributions. Here\u2019s where the difference ends, though. Unlike bonds, well-managed REITs can grow their distributions over time as they boost their asset base and earn higher rental income.  REITs can do this through a combination of methods such as acquisitions, asset enhancement initiatives (AEIs) and organic rental growth. If these methods are pulled off successfully, unitholders can enjoy a steady increase in the distribution per unit (DPU) they receive. Over time, buying into such\u00a0 REITs is an effective way to build up a growing stream of passive income that will serve you well for your retirement. Here are three REITs that are tapping on a mix of catalysts to grow their DPU. ARA US Hospitality Trust (SGX: XZL) ARA US Hospitality Trust, or ARAHT, has a portfolio of 36 select-service hotels with a total of 4,707 rooms across 19 states in the US as of 4 January 2023. The hospitality trust reported a strong recovery for the first nine months of 2022 (9M2022), with gross revenue jumping 38% year on year to US$130 million and net property income (NPI) surging by 80% year on year to US$33 million. Just last week, ARAHT announced the proposed acquisition of Home2 Suites by Hilton Colorado Springs South Hotel for a consideration of US$29 million.  Home2 Suites is a select-service hotel with 119 rooms and is located within a popular tourist attraction. The manager of the property is Chartwell Hospitality, LLC, founded in 2003, which manages a diverse portfolio of 27 Marriott (NASDAQ: MAR) and Hilton (NYSE: HLT) branded hotels across nine US states. Home2 Suites generated a revenue per available room (RevPAR) of around US$129 for its trailing 12-month performance through to October 2022, higher than the 9M2022 RevPAR of US$85 for ARAHT. This property has an NPI yield of approximately 9% and is projected to strongly boost ARAHT\u2019s DPU. Assuming the acquisition was completed on 1 January 2021, along with the disposal of five Hyatt Place properties in the third quarter of 2022 (3Q2022), the distribution per stapled security (DPSS) for the trust would have more than doubled from US$0.00355 to US$0.00784. This acquisition not only increases DPSS substantially but also allows the trust to expand its brand portfolio to include Hilton in addition to Hyatt (NYSE: H) and Marriott. CapitaLand India Trust (SGX: CY6U) CapitaLand India Trust, or CLINT, owns a portfolio of eight IT business parks, one logistics park, one industrial facility and one data centre development, all located in India.   Story continues As of 30 June 2022, CLINT\u2019s assets under management (AUM) stood at S$2.5 billion.Late last month, the REIT proposed the acquisition of International Tech Park Pune.The property is an IT Special Economic Zone (SEZ) with a total floor area of around 2.3 million square feet spread across four buildings.The buildings are 100%-leased to prominent tenants such as Infosys (NSE: INFY) and Tata Consultancy Services (NSE: TCS).CLINT will purchase the property, which is majority-owned by its sponsor CapitaLand Investment Limited (SGX: 9CI), for approximately S$221.9 million.This transaction is DPU-accretive and needs to be approved by unitholders in an extraordinary general meeting to be held soon.OUE Commercial REIT (SGX: TS0U)OUE Commercial REIT, or OUECR, has a property portfolio comprising 2.2 million square feet of prime office and retail space along with 1,643 upscale hotel rooms.Its AUM stood at S$5.8 billion as of 30 June 2022.Earlier this month, OUECR announced the reopening of its 446-room Orchard Wing at the Hilton Singapore Orchard.The refurbished rooms and suites were reopened after an extensive 10-month rejuvenation that was part of an AEI announced back in March 2020.With this reopening, Hilton Singapore Orchard is now operating at its full capacity of 1,080 rooms and is in time to capture rising demand from travellers in line with border reopenings.Demand for refurbished rooms has been strong with a good mix of corporate and leisure guests after the hotel was repositioned as one of the top luxury hotels in Singapore.The RevPAR for the hotel for 3Q2022 increased by 10.2% quarter on quarter to S$332, hitting a record high for the property post-re-branding.CEO Mr Han Khim Siew is confident that Hilton Singapore Orchard will surpass the minimum rent of S$45 million per annum with the recent reopening.Should this happen, OUECR will see higher NPI and distributable income, which should then result in a higher DPU moving forward.Not sure which REIT to put your money in?

Blogshops such as Carrislabelle and MGP Label offer free normal mail, while Fash Mob offer free standard courier delivery \u2013 which helps you to save around $1.50 \u2013 $3.50.Besides blogshops, there are also popular online retailers in Singapore such as Zalora, that offer free delivery for orders above $40 as well as 30 days free return.Things To Take Note Of\u00a0When\u00a0Shopping Online In Blogshops1) Most blogshops do not do cash refunds. Instead, they\u00a0would refund store credits into your account while others which do give cash refunds only do so on a case-by-case basis.2) The delivery days stated did not include the days needed for blogshops to dispatch items. Hence, it is not conclusive of the total time needed to reach you.3) Some blogshops charge administrative fees for returns and exchanges. Hence, it is important to check your size measurement and preferred coloured for your apparels before carting out.Given the heavy competition in the industry, it seems probable that these established blogshops compete based on product differentiation rather than engage in cut-throat price competition with each other. For example, more blogshops are self-manufacturing their labels to provide unique offerings to consumers.*Update: Some shops have closed and the list has been updated to reflect the changes.Read Also:\u00a05 Financial Traps Of Online Shopping: How You\u2019re Being Made To Spend More And How You Can Avoid ItThis article was first published on 29 May 2019 and updated with additional information.

Palm oil price has room to recover after dipping in 3QFY2022, says DBS Group Research analyst William Simadiputra. This is due to its affordability versus other edible oils, as well as China\u2019s low soybean crushing volumes that prevent soybean oil oversupplies.  In his Jan 11 report, Simadiputra says the limited room for output expansion will prevent major price reversal. Amid the demand recovery trend, the analyst believes that palm oil supplies have little room to grow and aid peaking crops yield performance due to a lesser number of young trees among the Indonesian and Malaysian estates. \u201cParticularly in Indonesia, palm oil yield seems difficult to expand further amid limited replanting and new planting programs,\u201d he adds. That said, RHB Group Research analysts Hoe Lee Leng and Syahril Hanafiah have maintained a \u201cneutral\u201d rating on the plantation sector, expecting Indonesia\u2019s policies to continue playing a big part in 2023\u2019s price direction. The analysts note that from the start of the year, Indonesia has reduced its domestic export quota to 1:6 from 1:8 as a preventive measure against the potential increase in domestic cooking oil prices. Demand generally rises during Ramadan and Eid, which will fall in March and April this year. While this should be positive for prices, the analysts do not expect actual export volumes to be impacted significantly, as it will be a low crop season in the first quarter of the year.  Indonesia has also delayed its B35 biodiesel mandate start date to Feb 1, from the previously announced January. However, the total allocation for 2023 remains at 13.15 million kiloliters (m kL), up 20% from 2022\u2019s 11m kL. Simadiputra highlights that palm oil companies performed well in 2022, despite tapering off in 2HFY2022. With the absence of unusually high prices, the analyst expects earnings to generally trend lower y-o-y moving forward, albeit much better than 2019 to 2022 levels. \u201cWe believe production expansion will help offset the still high fertiliser cost and provide good earnings and cash flows at our selling price assumption of US$850 ($1,130) per metric tonne in 2023,\u201d he adds. Within his coverage in the region, Simadiputra likes First Resources and Bumitama Agri due to their younger age profile coupled with strong profitability performance, which helps them to strive during CPO downturn and reap the benefit the most during bull price cycle. He notes that First Resources and Bumitama Agri\u2019s profitability performance outperform its upstream plantation peers, despite both also trading below their five years average PE multiple. His target price for First Resources and Bumitama Agri are $2.50 and $1 respectively.   Story continues Meanwhile, DBS also likes Wilmar due to its significance on the Asian vegetable oil supply chain. However, Wilmar is trading at -2 standard deviation of its five years average PE multiple, a multiple around its upstream plantation companies\u2019 peers traded, which in DBS\u2019 view is unfair considering its integrated business platform.\u201cWe believe Wilmar\u2019s investments in midstream edible oil refining facilities, as well as downstream to consumer products, are largely not priced in for now,\u201d adds Simadiputra, with a target price of $6.67.RHB continues to favour integrated players like Wilmar, while also seeing value in players like Bumitama Agri and Golden Agri-Resources. Their target prices for Wilmar, Bumitama Agri and Golden Agri are $5.40, 80 cents and 33 cents respectively.As at 11.15am, shares in Wilmar, Golden Agri, Bumitama Agri and First Resources are trading at $4.12, 24.5 cents, 61 cents and $1.43 respectively.\u00a0See Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore DBS \u2018optimistic\u2019 about \u2018buoyant growth\u2019 in 1H2023, but sees \u2018potential slowdown\u2019 in \u2018uncertain\u2019 2H2023 DBS upgrades Netlink to 'buy' with higher TP of 98 cents RHB downgrades Suntec REIT to 'neutral' with lower TP of $1.47 Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

Ltd (QSI). Singapore Post\u2019s (SingPost) associate, Shenzhen 4PX Information and Technology Co., Limited, (4PX) announced that it entered into various agreements with its existing shareholder, Zhejiang Cainiao Supply Chain Management Co., Limited (Cainiao) on Jan 19.  SingPost\u2019s 19.75% stake in 4PX is held by its subsidiary, Quantium Solutions International Pte. Ltd (QSI). Under the various agreements entered into between 4PX and Cainiao, the former will issue new shares in its capital to Cainiao. This is for the full and final settlement of all outstanding amounts under an existing RMB400 million ($78.6 million) loan extended by Cainiao to 4PX in 2018. Upon completion of the loan capitalisation, QSI\u2019s shares will remain unchanged although its equity interest in 4PX will be reduced to 17.61% in the latter\u2019s enlarged share capital. In connection with the loan capitalisation, QSI, Cainiao and the rest of 4PX\u2019s shareholders have agreed to amend certain terms of the existing shareholders\u2019 agreement. Such amendments include a revision of the terms of a put option granted by Cainiao to QSI for the latter to sell any part of its equity interest in 4PX exceeding 10%, which is approximately 7.6% of QSI\u2019s equity interest in 4PX. The amendments also include the grant of a new put option by Cainiao to QSI for the latter to sell the remaining 10% of its equity interest in 4PX to Cainiao, after the capitalisation of the existing Cainiao shareholder loan.  Under the revised shareholders\u2019 agreement, QSI may exercise the 7.6% option at its discretion. The exercise of the option is also conditional upon the completion of the loan capitalisation. Cainiao will pay a cash consideration of RMB251.3 million for QSI\u2019s 7.6% stake. The amount was determined based on 4PX\u2019s total valuation of RMB3.3 billion. QSI has further agreed to grant Cainiao a corresponding call option to acquire QSI\u2019s 7.6% equity interest in 4PX on the same terms. Based on SingPost\u2019s unaudited financial statements for the 1HFY2022 ended Sept 30, 2022, the book value attributable to QSI\u2019s 19.75% stake is $85.3 million. In addition to the 7.6% option, Cainiao has also granted to QSI the 10% option which may be exercised by QSI at its discretion and again conditional upon completion of the loan capitalisation. The consideration payable by Cainiao for the 10% equity interest in 4PX is around RMB264.0 million. The consideration may be paid either in cash or via a transfer of shares held by Cainiao\u2019s related companies in QSI to SingPost. QSI has also agreed to grant Cainiao a corresponding call option to acquire QSI\u2019s 10% equity interest in 4PX on the same terms.   Story continues The QSI 4PX options may be exercised together or individually within six months from the completion of the loan capitalisation.If all the options are exercised, QSI will dispose of its entire stake in 4PX. Accordingly, the SingPost Group will no longer hold any interest in 4PX.According to SingPost, the proposed disposal provides an opportunity for the group to realise and unlock value in its equity interest in 4PX held through QSI.\u201cThe [group] will review and determine the use of the proceeds from the proposed disposal in the event it decides to exercise the QSI 4PX options or if Cainiao decides to exercise its call options on QSI\u2019s equity interests in 4PX,\u201d says SingPost in its Jan 20 statement.Shares in SingPost closed at 56.5 cents on Jan 19.See Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore FMH acquisition 'positive'; transaction to generate 8% operating profit accretion for SingPost: CGS-CIMB SingPost acquires additional 37% total stake in Freight Management Holdings for A$175.4 mil The Edge Singapore's lifestyle team Options publishes its third issue of HAVEN Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Performing S&P 500 Stocks in the Last 10 Years.  While it is important for investors to have a long-term perspective and not get caught up in short-term fluctuations, it is equally important to consider historical context and not base investment decisions solely on recent performance or market headlines. A diversified portfolio and a well thought out investment strategy can help individuals stay focused on their long-term goals and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market movements.  Investors selling off their equities are displaying short sightedness, since latest Morgan Stanley data suggests that the operating margin of the S&P 500 Index stands at 11.6%, which is still close to the record high of 13.1% achieved in late 2021. The present operating margin is also meaningfully higher than pre-pandemic levels of 10.2% and the rolling 10-year average of 9.4%. 2022 nominal revenues for S&P 500 constituents were also 8% greater than the 10-year trend. Similarly, the real inflation-adjusted consumption in 2022 was approximately 7% ahead of its long-term trend.  To build a portfolio that has a chance to beat market volatility and offer stable returns, investors should look out for the top performing S&P 500 stocks over the years. Although past performance is not a measure for future performance, it is helpful to pick up companies that have shown resilience over time and will likely continue to perform well. While some investors choose income stocks to weather a harsh market environment (see 11 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats to Buy), others seek out defensive equities instead. (see 14 Best Stocks To Buy Before A Recession) Some of the best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last 10 years include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA).\u00a0   Our Methodology We used a stock screener to scan the S&P 500 index and picked 11 of the best-performing stocks over the past 10 years with most significant gains, as of January 18. However, some of these companies were not operational during the entire ten year period. We scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 920 hedge funds to assess the hedge fund sentiment around these equities. The list is arranged according to the share price returns of each firm.\u00a0   11 Best Performing S&P 500 Stocks in the Last 10 Years   Photo by Adam Nowakowski on Unsplash Best Performing S&P 500 Stocks in the Last 10 Years 11. Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44 10-Year Share Price Gains as of January 18: 925.2% Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) is an American biotechnology company that discovers, develops, and sells messenger RNA therapeutics and vaccines for the treatment of infectious diseases, immuno-oncology diseases, rare diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and auto-immune diseases worldwide. On January 17, Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) announced results from a late-stage trial of its investigational respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine candidate, noting that it met its core efficacy goals. The vaccine candidate, mRNA-1345, indicated an efficacy of 83.7% against RSV lower respiratory tract disease in older adults, the company reported.\u00a0   Story Continues   On January 11, Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Papadakis raised Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA)\u2019s price target from $185 to $225 and maintained a \"Buy\" rating on the shares. Despite trimming the company's fiscal 2024 revenue estimates, the analyst believes that recent news updates have been positive and have contributed to the boost in the price target. However, the analyst also believes that Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) will incur a loss this year due to planned research and development expenses. According to Insider Monkey\u2019s data, 44 hedge funds were long Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 45 funds in the last quarter. Philippe Laffont\u2019s Coatue Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 5.70 million shares worth $674.7 million.\u00a0 In addition to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) is one of the best performing stocks over the last decade.\u00a0 Here is what Baron Funds said about Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter: \u201cWithin biotechnology, underperformance of Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) and lower exposure to this better performing sub-industry weighed the most on relative performance. Shares of Moderna, a leader in the emerging field of mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics, declined due to increasing uncertainty around what a booster market could look like as COVID shifts away from pandemic status and becomes an increasingly commercial market rather than government funded.\u201d  10. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 269 10-Year Share Price Gains as of January 18: 969.5% Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the best performing S&P 500 stocks, with shares exhibiting 10-year price gains of 969.5% as of January 18. On January 17, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares rose marginally after the company announced that it was expanding access to ChatGPT through its Azure cloud service. The tech giant disclosed that ChatGPT would be available \"soon\" via a program called Azure OpenAI Service. Microsoft already has a $1 billion stake in OpenAI, and is in talks to grow its investment in the company by perhaps as much as $10 billion.   On January 18, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss maintained an Overweight rating and a $307 price target on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares ahead of the FQ2 earnings report. In a research note, the analyst told investors that Microsoft's alignment with primary secular trends and benefits from vendor consolidation are likely to result in continued share gains for the company. Weiss also believes that Microsoft's technology, scale, and distribution advantages contribute to a positive outlook on the company.\u00a0 According to Insider Monkey\u2019s Q3 data, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was part of 269 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 258 funds in the prior quarter. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 39.2 million shares worth $9.14 billion.\u00a0 Fundsmith made the following comment about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its yearly 2022 investor letter: \u201cTake the example of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intuit. Microsoft shares are currently being valued at a P/E ratio of 25.0 times the consensus EPS estimate for the fiscal year ending June 2023. Meanwhile, Intuit is being valued at 28.4 times the non-GAAP consensus estimate for the fiscal year ending July 2023. Many investors and analysts may accept that Intuit is trading at a higher multiple given expectations of greater growth potential. However, Intuit removes share-based compensation from their non-GAAP EPS whereas Microsoft does not. Given that Intuit\u2019s GAAP EPS guidance for the year ending 31st July 2023 is $6.92\u2013$7.22, its non-GAAP guidance is $13.59\u2013$13.89, and the consensus estimate for 2023 EPS is at $13.69, it seems clear that most sell-side analysts are accepting the company\u2019s non-GAAP adjustments, which includes the removal of some $1.8bn of share-based compensation, in their estimates. If we include the impact of share-based compensation in Intuit\u2019s 2023 EPS to make a more apples-to-apples comparison with Microsoft based upon GAAP EPS, Intuit\u2019s 2023 EPS would be closer to $9, meaning that the shares would be trading at a multiple of about 43 times. I think investors and analysts may find a premium of 14% for Intuit over Microsoft (28.4 times versus 25.0 times) to be reasonable. I\u2019m not so sure they are fully aware that Intuit shares are actually trading at a premium of 73% if share-based compensation is treated in the same manner between the two companies.\u201d  9. T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 100 10-Year Share Price Gains as of January 18: 1,060% T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) provides mobile communications services in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. The company offers voice, messaging, and data services to customers in the postpaid, prepaid, and wholesale markets. As of January 18, the 10-year share price gains of T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) came in at 1,060%, making it one of the best performing S&P 500 constituents.\u00a0   On January 4, T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) reported that it added 6.4 million total postpaid customers in 2022, which topped forecasts, and also welcomed 2 million new high speed Internet customers during the year. The company disclosed that it added more high speed Internet customers than competitors like AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) combined.\u00a0 T-Mobile has announced resilient customer results for Q4, driven by very low customer churn despite some weakness in gross ads, according to JPMorgan analyst Philip Cusick in a research note dated January 5. T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) is the analyst\u2019s top long-term idea and favorite communications services stock, he reiterated an Overweight rating on the shares with a $200 price target. According to Insider Monkey\u2019s data, 100 hedge funds held long positions in T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) at the end of September 2022, compared to 96 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 5.2 million shares worth $703.3 million.\u00a0 In its Q4 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments shared its stance on T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS): \u201cAs mentioned, the communication services sector has come under some pressure, and irrational pricing competition has negatively impacted wireless industry growth and profitability of late, weighing on T-Mobile. Faced with these headwinds, and with pressure from other wireless carriers and cable companies that could cause the company to cede share in subscriber growth in 2022, we exited our position in the fourth quarter.\u201d  8. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110 10-Year Share Price Gains as of January 18: 1,170% UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) operates as a diversified healthcare company in the United States. On January 13, after posting market-beating Q4 2022 results, UnitedHealth Group reaffirmed its 2023 outlook. The company expects revenues between $357 billion and $360 billion, and adjusted net earnings are forecasted between $24.40 and $24.90 per share, while the consensus came in at $356.17 billion and $24.95, respectively. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is one of the best performing stocks over the last ten years.\u00a0   Loop Capital analyst Joseph France on January 17 raised UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)\u2019s price target from $575 to $590 and maintained a \"Buy\" rating on the shares. The increase in the price target is due to the company's \"strong\" Q4 results and 2023 outlook.\u00a0 According to Insider Monkey\u2019s third quarter data, 110 hedge funds were bullish on UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 91 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain\u2019s GQG Partners is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 3.2 million shares worth $1.6 billion.\u00a0 Here is what Stewart Asset Management has to say about UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its Q3 2022 investor letter: \u201cLooking at the Great Recession which began at year-end 2007 and lasted to mid-year 2009 is helpful too. Our four largest current holdings in the portfolio weathered that period well. UnitedHealth\u2019s (NYSE:UNH) earnings were resilient. While it reported modestly down earnings in 2008, its earnings rebounded quickly to record highs in 2010 and the shares responded strongly in anticipation of this.\u201d  7. Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63 10-Year Share Price Gains as of January 18: 1,240% Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) designs, manufactures, refurbishes, and services semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) was incorporated in 1980 and is headquartered in Fremont, California. The company distributed a $1.725 per share quarterly dividend to shareholders on January 4. It is one of the best performing S&P 500 members over the last decade, with 10-year share price gains of 1,240% as of January 18.\u00a0   On January 18, Stifel analyst Brian Chin resumed coverage of Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) with a Hold rating and a $495 price target. The analyst cited that fundamentals, particularly in the memory market, have rapidly declined, and he expects investments to contract sharply next year, resulting in a drop in overall spending on fab equipment. He believes that Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX)\u2019s leadership position in the memory market will likely become a drag on the business in 2023.\u00a0 According to Insider Monkey\u2019s Q3 data, 63 hedge funds were long Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX), compared to 56 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain\u2019s GQG Partners is the biggest position holder in the company, with 3.7 million shares worth $1.37 billion.\u00a0 Renaissance Investment made the following comment about Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter: \u201cConversely, we sold our positions in Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) and Zoetis (ZTS) following a sustained deterioration in fundamental factors. After a qualitative review of Lam Research, we believe the company will face a number of headwinds that could make for an unfavorable risk-reward position, given the highly cyclical nature of its business in a slowing global economy. We are also expecting fundamentals to turn negative as sales and operating profits are poised to decelerate, resulting in negative earnings revisions. While the stock trades at an attractive valuation multiple, we believe that this is more a sign that earnings will decline meaningfully.\u201d  6. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 103 10-Year Share Price Gains as of January 18: 1,420% ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a California-based company that provides enterprise cloud computing solutions worldwide. It is one of the top S&P 500 performers over the last decade, with 10-year share price gains of 1,420% as of January 18.\u00a0 On January 12, Wolfe Research analyst Alex Zukin raised the price target on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) to $500 from $440 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. His checks were \"so strong on an absolute and relative basis\" that he sees ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) having the \"best setup\" for Q4 earnings among the software stocks he covers, the analyst told investors. The analyst said he would buy the stock given its current valuation.\u00a0   According to Insider Monkey\u2019s data, 103 hedge funds were bullish on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 99 funds in the last quarter. Chase Coleman\u2019s Tiger Global Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 1.7 million shares worth nearly $640 million.\u00a0 Like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is one of the most popular S&P 500 stocks among elite hedge funds.\u00a0 Aristotle Atlantic made the following comment about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q3 2022 investor letter: \u201cUnderperformance in the third quarter can be attributed to ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\u2019s slight miss on the second quarter earnings and guidance that was lower than expected for its third quarter outlook. The company is facing headwinds from the weaker macroeconomic conditions and a tempered outlook resulting from elongated sales cycles and an overall slowing software spending environment. These worsening conditions were highlighted by many software companies during the second quarter earnings season. We expect this to be temporary for ServiceNow where the long-term thesis of the company\u2019s platform strategy and relevance to digital transformation strategies remains intact. The stock was also likely impacted by the rapid increase in interest rates during the third quarter and the resulting contraction of multiples on high-growth software stocks.\u201d  Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Performing S&P 500 Stocks in the Last 10 Years.\u00a0  Suggested articles:  13 Best Communication Services Stocks To Invest In  12 Best DRIP Stocks To Own  13 Cash Rich Penny Stocks That Hedge Funds Are Buying   \u00a0 Disclosure: None.\u00a011 Best Performing S&P 500 Stocks in the Last 10 Years\u00a0is originally published on Insider Monkey.

This figure was down from 147 members in 2021. The report tracked\u00a0$788 million in trades from more than\u00a012,700 transactions. The number of transactions was similar to 2021, with around $189 million less traded in 2022 than the previous year.\nThe report found House Republicans had more than\u00a01,000 fewer trades in 2022. House Democrats had over 1,000 more trades in 2022 compared to the previous year.\nDemocrats saw an average return of -1.76% and Republicans saw an average return of 0.4%, both beating the -18% return of the S&P 500 in 2022.\nOver the past 10 years, about 10% of fund managers outperformed the S&P 500, according\u00a0to SPIVA data, while in 2022, about 5% of total Congress outperformed.\nWhen just comparing the Congressional members who traded \u2014\u00a0just 131 of the possible 535 \u2014\u00a026 beat the market. That equates to 20%, a much higher rate than professional money managers over time.\n\t\t\n\n\nHere were the top 10 members of Congress by 2022 return, according to the report:\nRep. Patrick Fallon, (R-Texas): +51.6%\nRep. Debbie Schultz, (D-Fla.): +50.8%\nRep. Susie Lee,\u00a0(D-Nev.): +21.4%\nRep. David Joyce\u00a0(R-Ohio): +13.6%\nSen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.): +11.7%\nRep. William Keating (D-Mass.): +9.6%\nRep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas): +8.9%\nRep Michael Guest\u00a0(R-Miss.): +8.9%\nRep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.): +7.1%\nRep. Mark Green (R-Tenn.): +6.5%\nRanking just outside the top 10\u00a0was Rep.\u00a0Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.)\u00a0in 12th place at a return of 6.2%. Greene was recently profiled by Benzinga for her losing position in Digital World Acquisition Corporation (NASDAQ:DWAC).\nRep. Dingell appeared on the list for a second straight year, ranking in 10th\u00a0place by return in 2021.\nRanking outside of the top 10\u00a0and also failing to beat the market was former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Well known for her stock trading disclosures between herself and her husband, Pelosi had a return of -19.8% in 2022 according to the report.\nThe report tracked\u00a0trades and returns of transactions in 2022 and unrealized returns.\nRelated Link: Members Of Congress Buy Energy, Defense Stocks Prior To Russian Invasion Of Ukraine: Who They Are, What They Bought\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhy It\u2019s Important: Along with highlighting the top trading members of Congress, the report also showed unusual trading activity and some of the most popular stocks bought and sold by members of Congress.\nThe most popular sectors for stock trades in 2022 were technology services, electronic technology, finance, consumer services\u00a0and health technology for Democrats. Republicans had\u00a0technology services, industry services, finance\u00a0and electronic technology as their most popular sectors in 2022.\nThe report also illustrated\u00a0unusual trading activity including members of committees trading within sectors they represent and members of Congress buying oil and defense stocks prior to the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.\nRep. Green, who ranked\u00a010th on the list, bought several oil and gas stocks throughout the year, including $6 million worth the night before Russia invaded Ukraine.\nThe report also focused on some of the most popular stocks for members of both houses of Congress. The most popular stocks that were bought in 2022 were:\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL)\nWalt Disney Co\u00a0(NYSE:DIS)\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\t\t\n\n\nThe most popular stocks that were sold in 2022 were:\nVisa Inc (NYSE:V)\nNVIDIA Corporation\nExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM)\nEli Lilly And Co\u00a0(NYSE:LLY)\nMicrosoft Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT)\nOne trend highlighted in the report was fewer options trading in 2022. Pelosi had\u00a0been known for many options purchases including ones in the money with long-term expiration dates.\nAmong the best trades of the year were two by Rep. Fallon with purchases of Twitter stock in January that saw gains of more than\u00a040% after the transaction by Tesla CEO Elon Musk was completed.\nThe best trade of the year was a 140% gain by Rep.\u00a0Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) from the sale of ChemoCentryx, which was acquired by Amgen, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMGN).\nWhile the report centered\u00a0on transactions made in 2022, it also took\u00a0into account trades made in 2020 that were still being held as unrealized gains. \n\n\n\nThe five largest unrealized gains in the report are:\nRep.\u00a0Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.):\u00a0Apollo Endosurgery Inc (NASDAQ:APEN), up 497% since Oct. 2020\nRep.\u00a0Tom Malinowski:\u00a0Apollo Endosurgery, up 454% since Oct. 2020 (second transaction)\nRep.\u00a0Dean Phillips (D-Minn.):\u00a0Quanta Services Inc (NYSE:PWR), up 391% since April 2020\nRep.\u00a0Ro Khanna (D-Calif.):\u00a0ON Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ:ON), up 351% since May 2020\nRep. Dean Phillips:\u00a0Mosaic Co\u00a0(NYSE:MOS), up 349% since April 2020\nIn 2022, only three members of Congress bought cryptocurrency or related funds in 2022, compared to eight members who bought in 2021.\nThe report from Unusual Whales came\u00a0as there were increasing calls from the public and several members of Congress to ban the trading of stocks and options by members of Congress and their families.\nWhat's Next: Could Nancy Pelosi And Husband Be Banned From Stock Trading?\nPhoto:\u00a0VideoFlow\u00a0via Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\n\n\n FACEBOOK\n\n\n\n\n

Twitter Inc. is scheduled to release earnings figures on April 23. Photographer: Gabby Jones/Bloomberg  \u00b7 Bloomberg By Yoolim Lee and Sing Yee Ong (Bloomberg) \u2014 Workers at Twitter Inc.\u2019s Singapore office were told to empty out their desks and vacate the premises, said people familiar with the situation, as Elon Musk continues to pare expenses around the globe. Twitter staff were informed via email Wednesday that they had until 5 p.m. to leave the CapitaGreen building and resume their duties remotely from Thursday, one of the people said, asking not to be named discussing private information. Singapore-based staffers have now been reassigned as remote workers in Twitter\u2019s internal system until further notice, the person added. Singapore serves as Twitter\u2019s Asia-Pacific headquarters, a region that was hit hard by deep and abrupt job cuts when new owner Musk took over the San Francisco-based firm. The company this month also let go of Nur Azhar Bin Ayob, who had been the head of site integrity for the region and a relatively recent hire. Representatives for Twitter and CapitaLand, the owner of its Singapore offices, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Musk\u2019s cost-cutting efforts have included not paying rent on its global headquarters, and it was sued over that issue last month by the landlord of its San Francisco offices. Casey Newton of Platformer first tweeted about the Singapore office clearout, adding that the reason for it was failure to pay rent on the facility. \u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.

PVR had logged losses in 10 of the 11 previous quarters.  It reported a net profit of 161.5 million rupees ($1.59 million) for the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of 101.8 million rupees a year ago. Revenue jumped 53% to 9.41 billion rupees, helped by a recovery in advertisement revenues and a 29% increase in theatre occupancy levels. \"Black Panther \u2013 Wakanda Forever\" and domestic hits like \"Kantara\" drew crowds in the quarter. The company opened 20 screens in the quarter. Its average ticket price grew 16% from the pre-pandemic third quarter of 2020, while average food and beverage spend per head jumped 33%. The multiplex chain last week got approval from the Mumbai National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to merge the operations of rival INOX Leisure in an all-stock deal, which will make it the country's largest exhibition company. \"We intend to complete all the formalities within the current financial year,\u201d Ajay Bijli, chairman and managing director of PVR, said in a statement. The company said it is on track to open a total of 100-110 new screens by the end of this fiscal year.

Ethan Feller   Fri, Jan 27, 2023, 4:53 AM 5 min read                 In This Article:    AAPL          As one of the most popular and successful stocks in recent history, Apple\u00a0AAPL\u00a0is always top of mind when it comes to the stock market. The world\u2019s largest public company will be reporting Q1 FY23 earnings Thursday, February 2 after the market closes. What AAPL does, the stock market follows, so how the tech giant fairs will be a major factor on the stock market as a whole.   With iPhone sales showing early signs of slowing, and supply chain issues slowing production it makes you wonder what the future holds for Apple. On the flip side, Apple is as good as they get when it comes to engineering new products. Being able to diversify the product suite like Apple has done, is an amazing feat, and the culture of innovation is something that should stay with the company for a long time to come. The last year has been mixed for Apple, down about -10% on the year, but still outperforming the market. Additionally, AAPL stock has fared better than all the other mega cap technology companies, including Amazon\u00a0AMZN, Google\u00a0GOOGL, Microsoft\u00a0MSFT, Meta Platforms\u00a0META, and Nvidia\u00a0NVDA.   Zacks Investment Research   Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Expanding Portfolio Apple's flagship product, the iPhone, has played a critical role in establishing the company as a leader in the tech industry and continues to drive its revenue growth. But Apple\u2019s other products play a major role and have helped it transform into far more than just an iPhone maker.\u00a0 Apple\u2019s Services offerings including, cloud, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay and Apple Tv have become a major contributor, especially to the bottom line, as these are high margin products.\u00a0As the new cash cow, Apple Services is becoming increasingly important to Apple\u2019s business model.\u00a0   Furthermore, products like the Apple Watch, and AirPods are highly successful, and dominant businesses in their own right.\u00a0 Apple generated $394.33 billion in total revenue in fiscal 2022, with 52.1% coming from iPhone sales. Services contributed 19.8%, Mac contributed 10.2%, iPad contributed 7.4%, and the combined category of Wearables, Home, and Accessories products pulled in 10.5%.   Zacks Investment Research   Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Earnings Expectations After growing revenues 33% in FY21 and 8% in FY22, current year sales are projected by Zacks to grow just 2% to $402 billion, as Apple faces a decelerating economy. Apple\u2019s first quarter sales are expected to shrink -2.2% to $121 billion. Earnings are challenged as well, with FY23 expected to be up 1.1% to $6.18 per share, while Q1 earnings are forecasted to be down -7.6% to $1.94 per share.   Story Continues   Apple looks poised to return to a more substantial expansion with FY24 sales estimated to climb 5.6% to $425 billion, and earnings to climb 8.5% to $6.70 per share. With these mixed earnings expectations it is no surprise Apple currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Earnings revisions, Zacks primary input for the ranking methodology, are trending downward as well. Over the last 90 days Q1 earnings expectations have been lowered from $2.10 per share to $1.94 per share. On a positive note, Apple has been able to avoid the mass layoffs of the other tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta Platforms. Alphabet has cut 12,000 jobs, Microsoft 10,000, Amazon 18,000, and Meta 11,000. Additionally, Apples sales growth over the last few years need to be highlighted. Sales for Apple have grown from $275 billion in 2020 to $400 billion today, which for such a massive and mature company is incredibly impressive.   Zacks Investment Research   Image Source: Zacks Investment Research China Risk Something I don\u2019t think gets enough attention is the geopolitical risk Apple faces with so much of its production based in China. There is no denying that tensions between the US and China are continuing to grow, and Apple seems it could be a valuable bargaining chip for the world\u2019s second largest economy. The Covid-19 pandemic shook supply chains and made everyone realize how fragile a globalized production line can be. As the trend towards onshoring production gains momentum, it's worth considering how companies like Apple may mitigate the potential risks, particularly given the significant proportion of their production currently taking place in China.   Valuation Considering the praise Apple receives today as a business it\u2019s hard to imagine that between 2013 and 2019, investors could buy the stock relatively cheaper than the S&P 500. In 2013 Apple traded with a forward P/E of just 8x. Today AAPL\u2019s one year forward P/E is 22x earnings, above the index and its ten-year median of 14x. The reasoning is that Apple stock is practically considered as sure an investment as a Treasury bond, and maybe for good reason. Imagine owning the real estate of the little screen we all look at every day, quite powerful. Also worth noting is Apple\u2019s large cash balance. With nearly $50 billion on hand, and some of the greatest engineering talent in the world, Apple can venture into any vertical they choose. Whether it be cars, healthcare, VR or AR this optionality allows AAPL stock to always have something new to surprise consumers and investors with. It seems unlikely investors will get an opportunity to buy AAPL stock as cheap as it was in the 2010s. Now well off its all-time highs, a near 20x multiple seems almost reasonable. But the key to this notion is how badly sales will be affected in a recession. What about a bad recession?   Zacks Investment Research   Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Conclusion Apple is without a doubt an unbelievable business. The iPhone has become a critical part of our lives, and maybe the most influential consumer technology ever. Even more impressive is how Apple has managed to engineer a number of other highly successful hardware and software products, diversifying its income streams. Apple will likely be around for many years to come, but whether it is a buy today is debatable. With slowing sales from a wavering economy, to geographical, and supply chain risk it is up to investors to decide what they are comfortable with. The earnings report will provide a great deal of insight into the future. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Antony reviews and covers the latest PC hardware and laptop technologyFollow AuthorJan 04, 2023, 09:00am ESTShareSaveCommentThis article is more than 2 years old.Today Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has lifted the veil on its latest graphics card - the RTX 4070 Ti and we'll be looking at whether it's worth its $800 price tag or whether you should opt for AMD's RX 7900 XT instead.\nNvidia's RTX 4070 TiAntony Leather\n\nIt comes at a time of high graphics card prices, although the RTX 4070 Ti's launch price is a whopping $400 below that of the RTX 4080 and maybe a little lower than some were expecting. It also undercuts the RX 7900 XT from AMD by $100 too, at least on paper. You can see a YouTube video below.\n\n\n\n\nIt's also worth noting the price of the RTX 3080 too. At launch it cost $700 so it's a $100 mark up for the RTX 4070 Ti. The latter has to offer signigificantly better performance than that card as a result, seeing as it costs less than that now, but the new card having a similar launch price.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nTest system\nThe test system uses the Nvidia release driver for the RTX 4070 and the latest drivers as of December 27th for other Nvidia and AMD cards along with a fully up to date version of Windows 11. I used an Intel Core i9-12900K, Asus ROG Strix Z690 Apex motherboard, Kingston 6,000MHz Fury DDR5 memory, a Kingston Fury Renegade SSD and Thermaltake Toughpower GF3 1350W PSU.\n\nBenchmarks\nBelow we can see a mixed result for the RTX 4070 Ti, with a higher average frame rate over the RX 7900 XT, but the latter offering a higher minimum 99th percentile. You'd maybe go with the Nvidia card here given it costs $100 less but its a close call.\n\n \nAt 4K it's the same situation again with a higher average frame rate for the RTX 4070 Ti and even with FSR enabled the RX 7900 XT isn't able to better it, but is faster on the minimin 99th percenile. AMD maybe has more of a lead here, just edging out the Nvidia card overall. I'll be updating these results with DLSS figures for Nvidia soon.\nRainbow Six Extraction below at 1440p is an easy game to run smoothly and here, the RX 7900 XT generally justifies the extra outlay, especially on the minimum 99th percentile frame rate.\nThe same is true at 4K, with the AMD card offering a decent lead over the RTX 4070 Ti, but so far the RTX 4070 Ti has also shown big leads over the RTX 3080 too.\n \nBelow this time with DLSS enabled, the RTX 4070 Ti gains a massive improvement here, nearly doubling both frame rates and comfortably leapfrogging the RX 7900 XT. However, it wasn't able to offer much more performance than the RTX 3080 Ti with or without DLSS.\nMetro Exodus at 1440p with ray tracing enabled was another mixed result with a slower minimum 99th percentile than the RX 7900 XT but faster average frame rate. You'd probably just about opt for the RX 7900 XT here so long as you weren't paying much more than $100 extra.\nAt 4K, though, the situation changes and the RTX 4070 Ti was the better option by far, outstripping the pricier RX 7900 XT overall.\nWith DLSS enabled, the TX 4070 Ti was significantly faster than the RX 7900 XT and here there's no FSR coming to the rescue for AMD either. The RTX 4070 Ti was also quicker than the RTX 3090 Ti.\nWatch Dogs: Legion at 1440p looks like a win for Nvidia with the RTX 4070 Ti able to keep pace with the more expensive RX 7900 XT and also offered decent gains over the RTX 4080 and even matched the RTX 3090.\nAt 4K the situation was the same - you'd pick the cheaper RTX 4070 Ti and this time it even managed to beat the RTX 3090 Ti which is a big scalp, offering a sizeable upgrade from an RTX 3080 too.\nWith DLSS enabled, the RTX 4070 Ti added a decent amount to its frame rates, although here it slipped back against its 3000-series siblings.\nFar Cry 6 is very much an AMD-favoring game so it was no suprise to see the RX 7900 XT retake the lead. However, it mostly sat where you'd expect a card that costs $100 more to sit in terms of performance.\nAt 4K it extended this lead giving it a clear win over the RTX 4070 Ti given the modest price difference and with FSR enabled, the AMD card extended its lead.\nWith DXR enabled at 4K, AMD still has the advantage over the RTX 4070 Ti although the latter was able to better the RTX 3090 Ti.\nThe tables were turned in Halo, though, with the campaign mode seeing the RTX 4070 Ti offer much higher frame rates than the pricier RX 7900 XT and also good gains over the RTX 3080, while offering a higher average frame rate than the RTX 3090 Ti.\nAt 4K it was still a win for the RTX 4070 Ti over the RX 7900 XT and the Nvidia card even managed to beat the RTX 3090 Ti here too, weirdly also matching the minimim 99th percentile of the RTX 4080.\nFlight Simulator is a tough game to get high frame rates in some situations but the RTX 4070 Ti was a little faster than the RX 7900 XT here and sat within the bottlenecked area at the top of the graph, limited by other areas of the system.\nThere was more scaling at 4K, although here it wasn't able to better the RX 7900 XT's average frame rate. You'd still pick the Nvidia card though as it was much higher on the minimum 99th percentile.\nWith DLSS enabled, the bottleneck reapears and again the RTX 4070 Ti manages to beat the more expensive RX 7900 XT\nBelow is the latest version of the game in beta form so previous results are comparable (DLSS 3.0 is now a default option, but I've used the same version of the game for consistency). Here we can compare standard, DLSS 3.0 and FSR results for the cards and again DLSS 3.0 offers a signficiant advantage in Flight Simulator, getting around those system bottlenecks with frame generation. The RX 7900 XT put in a decent effort with FSR but with DLSS 3.0 the RTX 4070 Ti was signficiantly quicker still.\nEfficiency seems to trail off with the RX 7900 XT and RTX 4070 Ti, with both much slower than the likes of the RTX 4080, but not drawing much less power. Still, at least with the RTX 4070 Ti, most models only resuire two 8-pin power connectors and the Gigabyte RTX 4070 Ti Gaming OC 12GB proved to be very quiet in games and was quick to drop its fan speeds to zero RPM to reduce noise.\nConclusions\nOverall Nvidia has done enough to make the RTX 4070 Ti a better buy than the RX 7900 XT, although there are, as usual, exceptions so you'll do well to look at benchmarks for the games you play to work out which is best for you.\nIn addition to sitiuations where it was faster at standard settings, DLSS and especially DLSS 3.0 with frame generation can offer a huge boost to performance - again not all games support it but Flight Simulator fans need look no further than the RTX 4070 Ti for the most affordable GPU to tap into the power of DLSS 3.0.Gigabyte's RTX 4070 Ti Gaming OC 12GBAntony Leather\nThe RX 7900 XTX is faster in a lot of tests, but its $200 pricier, at least with its launch price and while the RTX 4080 is quicker still, the $400 gulf between it and the card we're lookin at today makes it a whole other level in terms of budgets. It's not the affordable mid-range king that the RTX 3070 was, but for now, this is the cheapest RTX 4000 series card and is your best option for below $900 if you want a current generation GPU, especially if you're looking to dabble with DLSS or ray tracing, or both.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Artificial Intelligence is set to disrupt several industries and healthcare is one of the primary industries that are expected to see the positive effects of the AI revolution. A 2022 report by Data Bridge Market Research said that the AI healthcare market is expected to grow at a CAGR of a whopping 51.37% from 2022 to 2029 to reach a value of $175.22 billion. The report also said that the major players operating in this lucrative market include NVIDIA Corporation, Alphabet, Microsoft, Medtronic, among many others.  Similarly, another report published in October by MarketsandMarkets said that AI in the Medical Diagnostics market is expected to grow from $1 billion 2022 to $5.5 billion by 2027. The report said that the AI-based medical devices market is growing amid government-based initiatives and the rise in adoption of AI solutions by radiologists to reduce work load. As you will see in this article, drug discovery is the biggest area where AI is showing its effects. There are several important drug discovery startups in the world that are using artificial intelligence to come up with innovative drugs. According to a report by European Parliament, AI uses data modeling and machine learning to generate several drug combinations very quickly.\u00a0 These models expand the genetic pool of drugs and help experts understand their possible outcomes. The report gives an example where researchers trained a deep learning algorithm to predict molecules' potential antimicrobial activity. The AI-based algorithm was able to process billions of molecules and also tested over 107 million, identifying eight antibacterial compounds that were structurally distant from known antibiotics. Without AI, this massive processing would take a lot of time and human effort.

Olam predicts cocoa market conditions will stabilize this half after volatile prices hit earnings for another quarter. Photographer: Nicky Loh/Bloomberg  \u00b7 Bloomberg By Vinicy Chan, Swetha Gopinath, Pei Li and Isis Almeida (Bloomberg) \u2014 Olam Group Ltd. has picked banks to lead a planned Singapore listing of its agribusiness unit that could raise as much as US$1 billion, people familiar with the matter said. The company selected Citigroup Inc., DBS Group Holdings Ltd., HSBC Holdings Plc and Morgan Stanley to arrange the planned initial public offering of Olam Agri Holdings Pte, according to the people. It\u2019s aiming to complete the share sale later this year, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.  The deliberations are ongoing and details of the listing could change, the people said. A representative for Olam said the company continues to focus on executing its reorganisation plan and will make a public announcement about any material developments. Spokespeople for the banks declined to comment. Olam Group shares jumped as much as 3.4% on Friday, touching their highest intraday level in nearly six months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It has a market value of about US$4.3 billion. The group said in December it completed the sale of a 35% stake in Olam Agri to state-owned Saudi Agricultural & Livestock Investment Co., a subsidiary of the oil-rich country\u2019s Public Investment Fund. The deal valued the business at about $3.5 billion. Olam Agri sells grains and seeds and makes everything from edible oils to pasta, according to its website. It has over 9,000 employees and operations in more than 30 countries. The business is one of Olam Group\u2019s main operating units, formed in a reorganisation announced in early 2020. The group delayed a planned London IPO last year for another unit, Olam Food Ingredients, citing the war in Ukraine. \u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.

In fact, the company noted, \u201cAs humans and machines collaborate more closely, and AI innovations come out of the research lab and into the mainstream, the transformational possibilities are staggering.\u201d Thus, there are myriad AI stocks worth considering for those with a long-term investing time horizon.\nIn the healthcare sector, AI could support diagnoses with small variations in patient health data, help identify potential pandemics, assist in imaging diagnostics, and even help with choosing medications. All could help pave the way for substantial medical breakthroughs. AI stocks could also benefit from the transformation underway in the auto industry toward autonomous cars. It could help personalize learning in schools. AI could advance video games, and much more.\nIn financial services, artificial intelligence is being used to detect fraud. Insurance companies are relying on AI for claims. Supply chains are using AI to power the entire supply chain and logistics process. Advertisers are using AI to predict consumer demand, and even help handle the entire shopping experience. It may be able to help pick stocks far better than humans.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella once noted that AI is the \u201cdefining technology of our times,\u201d as quoted by CNBC, with a capability of changing the way we drive our cars, automate our factories, create jobs, and even help improve our healthcare.\nPoint is, AI stocks provide investors with exposure to this game-changing industry. For those looking to profit from the growth that will undoubtedly unfold, here are three AI stocks worth buying right now.\n\n\n\nNVDA\nNvidia\n$168.99\n\n\nBOTZ\nGlobal X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF\n$22.49\n\n\nAI\nC3.ai\n$12.65\n\n\n\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\nSource: Shutterstock\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the most essential pieces of the AI puzzle. After all, this is the company providing the processing power needed to run AI applications. And because of that, Nvidia should see continue to benefit from the massive growth of the AI market.\nEven Morgan Stanley\u00a0(NYSE:MS) analysts will tell you, \u201cNVIDIA is the leader in accelerated compute and the key enabler for AI across vertical industries \u2013 full stop,\u201d said the firm, as quoted by Barron\u2019s. Cowen analysts note NVDA is a key enabler for AI across various verticals in other industries.\nEven better, Nvidia just partnered with Microsoft to build one of the most powerful AI supercomputers in the world. These computers will be powered by Azure\u2019s supercomputing infrastructure, as well as Nvidia\u2019s GPUs. According to Manuvir Das, vice president of enterprise computing at NVIDIA, \u201cOur collaboration with Microsoft will provide researchers and companies with state-of-the-art AI infrastructure and software to capitalize on the transformative power of AI.\u201d\n\nGlobal X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\nAn AI ETF is another great idea. Instead of buying a group of individual AI stocks, why not own the entire sector?\nWith the Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (NASDAQ:BOTZ), for example, investors can gain a good deal of exposure to AI, diversifying their portfolio at a relatively low cost.\nWith an expense ratio of 0.68%, The Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) seeks to invest in companies that potentially stand to benefit from increased adoption and utilization of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI), including those involved with industrial robotics and automation, non-industrial robots, and autonomous vehicles, according to Global X.\nSome of its top holdings include Nvidia, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG), SMC Corporation (OTCMKTS:SMCAY), iRobot Corporation (NASDAQ;IRBT), and Accuray (NASDAQ:ARAY). While the BOTZ chart has seen better days, give it time. Much of the recent tech rout and negativity has already been priced in. Now, as this ETF starts to perk back up, I\u2019d like to see the ETF break above resistance around $24 and test the $30 level.\n\nC3.ai (AI)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\nC3.ai (NYSE:AI) is the Enterprise AI application software company.\u00a0At the moment, the company delivers fully integrated products. These include the C3 AI Suite, an end-to-end platform for developing, deploying, and operating enterprise AI applications. Additionally the company offers a range of other C3 AI Applications, a portfolio of industry-specific SaaS enterprise AI applications that enable the digital transformation of organizations globally, as noted by the company.\nBooz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) just announced a new alliance with C3.ai to help federal clients solve their most complex problems using enterprise AI. The two could help accelerate the digital transformation of mission readiness, logistics, and intelligence.\nThe company\u2019s earnings have been solid, too. In the second quarter of 2023, C3.ai reported total revenue of $62.4 million \u2013 an increase of 7% year over year. Subscription revenue for the quarter was\u00a0$59.5 million, an increase of 26% compared to\u00a0$47.4 million \u00a0in the same quarter last year. Also, GAAP gross profit for the quarter was\u00a0$41.7 million, representing a 67% gross margin, compared to GAAP gross profit of\u00a0$42.3 million\u00a0one year ago.\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTechnology, Artificial Intelligence\n\n\nGrowth Stocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2023/01/3-ai-stocks-that-will-make-you-amazingly-rich-in-10-years/.\n\u00a92025 InvestorPlace Media, LLC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored Headlines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMore from InvestorPlace\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHot Stocks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Top Stocks to Buy Under Trump Come From Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018BRAIN\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Luke Lango, InvestorPlace Senior Investment Analyst\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Danger that Could Derail Our Economy\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Jeff Remsburg, Contributing Editor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy Prediction Came True: Where to Find Opportunity Despite Market Unpredictability\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Eric Fry, Editor, Fry's Investment Report\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMost Popular\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 10, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBig Tech\u2019s Quantum War Has Begun \u2014 and One Tiny Stock Could Win It\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 5, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat to Make of the Weakening Economy and Trade War\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInvestors Applaud a Cool Inflation Print\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow to Escape the \u2018Tyranny of the Immediate\u2019 in Investing\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExpert Stock Picks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe System Flagging a Potential 50X Opportunity\u2026 Even in This Ugly Market\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAbout InvestorPlace\nProducts\nContact Us\nHelp\nCareers\nAdvertise With Us\nDisclosures & Disclaimers\nPrivacy Policy\nAd Choices\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\nCookie Policy\nCookie Preferences\nTerms of Use\nDMCA Policy\n All rights reserved.

Massive research and development costs, upfront expenses to expand manufacturing capacity, and the constant push for innovation make it expensive to stay relevant. But for many companies, the risk is worth the reward because of the rapid growth in chip demand and applications.\nFortune Business Insights estimates that the global semiconductor market will grow at a compound annual rate of 12.2% between 2022 to 2029, more than doubling from $573 billion to nearly 1.4 trillion.\nNvidia (NVDA -2.56%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -1.15%) are two industry-leading companies at the forefront of the chip industry. But both stocks are down over 40% from their all-time highs due to a downturn in the industry. Here's why each company may be worth a look now.\u00a0\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nA bet on the future\nHoward Smith\u00a0(Nvidia): There's no doubt that Nvidia stock was given too much of a premium valuation based on the growth investors expected. That helps explain the more-than-50% drop from its highs in late 2021. That became especially clear when revenue growth in its largest segment sharply reversed course in the current fiscal year.\nBut the promise and potential that drove Nvidia shares to its unsustainable valuation weren't about the gaming segment, which was thriving at the time. And a transition has already begun that will see the data center, automotive, and artificial intelligence (AI) segments driving the company.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData source: Nvidia financial filings. Chart by author.\n\nWhile revenue from gaming chips was only half of what it was a year ago, Nvidia's data center business grew 31% year over year in the fiscal 2023 third-quarter period ended Oct. 30, 2022. An investment in Nvidia now is a bet on growing contributions from automotive and AI customers, who have increasing needs in autonomy, robotics, and data analysis.\u00a0\nAnd though Nvidia's dividend is minuscule compared to that of Taiwan Semi, the company has returned $9.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases over the first nine months of fiscal 2023. That represented just over half of what has been authorized for buybacks through Dec. 2023.\u00a0\nNvidia and Taiwan Semi may not deserve the same share of a portfolio. A bet on Nvidia carries added risks that industries like autonomous vehicles and AI will mature and thrive. But for those willing to include a speculative investment with a lot of potential long-term upside, Nvidia's share price correction has now provided an opportunity.\u00a0\n\nTaiwan Semi is a layup for long-term growth\nDaniel Foelber\u00a0(Taiwan Semiconductor): Few companies hold a candle to Nvidia when it comes to dazzling growth and glamorous products. But what Taiwan Semi lacks in flare it more than makes up for with a lower valuation, a wider moat, and a higher dividend yield.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaiwan Semi has a dirt-cheap forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 13.4, a dividend yield of 2.3%, and a 47% operating margin -- beating Nvidia in all three categories.\n\nTSM PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\nNvidia is one of the most innovative companies in the semiconductor industry. But it's a far riskier business model than Taiwan Semi.\u00a0\nTaiwan Semi is the world's largest pure-play chip foundry. You may be surprised to learn that a fabless chip maker like Nvidia doesn't actually make its own chips, much like Apple isn't actually making its iPhones. It relies on suppliers for that step.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia -- like basically every major player in the game -- relies on Taiwan Semi to make a sizable chunk of its products. So Taiwan Semi isn't really a competitor with Nvidia. In fact, Nivida is one of its main customers.\nInstead, Taiwan Semi is competing with other chip foundries. The name of the game is providing services for the changing needs of customers at a low cost and a fast turnaround. Taiwan Semi isn't immune to competition. But no company comes close to its size and efficiency.\u00a0\nIn this vein, Taiwan Semi is a far safer bet on the growth of the industry than any other chip maker. With Taiwan Semi, you're investing in the growth of chip production and usage, whereas with Nvidia, you're investing in a company that you think will spearhead technological breakthroughs.\nFor comparison, investing in a stock like Home Depot is a way to indirectly bet on the housing market instead of investing directly in a home builder. Or investing in Caterpillar is a good way to bet on construction, oil and gas, or mining instead of directly buying an exploration and production oil and gas stock.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia stock could outperform Taiwan Semi if it continues to out-innovate its competitors. But that is a relatively riskier proposition than just going with Taiwan Semi, which has a far better risk/reward profile than Nvidia.\n\nTwo good options worth considering now\nNvidia and Taiwan Semi operate on different sides of the semiconductor industry. Nvidia has done a masterful job of diversifying its business to include gaming, datacenter, AI, and autonomous vehicles. But for now, the AI and autonomous vehicle side of its business remains a sideshow, while data center and gaming performance are highly cyclical. That being said, Nvidia is positioned to outlast downturns while still being able to invest in multi-decade trends.\nMeanwhile, Taiwan Semi is poised to continue outspending its competitors to retain its industry-leading manufacturing profile. As the industry evolves and becomes more complex, Taiwan Semi has the margins and cash flow necessary to make necessary improvements.\nAside from being different companies, both stocks have contrasting investment theses. Nvidia offers arguably more upside with its potential to be a leader in industries that could unlock untold value. But it's also a more expensive stock that lacks a meaningful dividend yield. By contrast, Taiwan Semi should enjoy steady growth in lockstep with the overall industry.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Foelber has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Furthermore, NVIDIA shared that additional automakers like Foxconn and Mercedes-Benz intend to implement its computing technology into EV design and automated production.\n\nNVIDIA ($NVDA) is a global leader in accelerated computing technology that has been pushing the limits of gaming, AI, and computer graphics for 30 years. Over time, the company has expanded beyond PC gaming into full-stack computing, which includes the automotive industry and EVs.\nAs automakers veer away from traditional combustion models into a carbon-free embrace of EVs, the need for top tier computing power has become absolutely vital to a given vehicle\u2019s performance. Additionally, NVIDIA has been developing technology for years that helps enable autonomous driving in EVs.\nThe company has had a long running relationship with Tesla, but other automakers like Jaguar, Lucid Motors, and BYD have begun adopting the technology into their own self-driving platforms. BYD specifically has now announced that it also will implement NVIDIA\u2019s new cloud gaming service into its future EVs.

If the EV comes with rear monitors, passengers in the back can also join in on the fun up front (see video below). During the event, NVIDIA\u2019s vice president of automotive Ali Kani spoke:\n\nAccelerated computing, AI and connectivity are delivering new levels of automation, safety, convenience and enjoyment to the car. The ability to stream popular titles from gamers\u2019 libraries along with dozens of free-to-play games will bring the in-vehicle infotainment experience to new heights.\n\nGeForce NOW\u2019s low-latency cloud server streaming technology delivers real-time gameplay from Steam, EA, Ubisoft and more. EV drivers of the automakers mentioned above will soon be able to push their gaming to the next level with titles like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Fortnite, and the \u201crenowned masterpiece\u201d known as Cyberpunk 2077. Let\u2019s not forget Destiny 2 \u2013 a true work of art in my opinion.\nNVIDIA states that GeForce NOW is currently available in North America and Europe and the advanced gaming will be included in EVs from HMG, Polestar, and BYD going forward.

And over 20 partners have integrated Broadcast effects directly into their apps. Broadcast is also preinstalled in select laptops from Acer, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, Lenovo and Razer providing users superior, AI-powered experiences with their microphone, webcam and speakers.\nThe updated Virtual Background effects are also available directly in your favorite apps including OBS, Streamlabs and Elgato Camera Hub. Get the enhanced effects by updating to the latest version of the redistributables in the NVIDIA Broadcast Download Center.\nGet started and download NVIDIA Broadcast today, free for all NVIDIA and GeForce RTX GPU owners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEye on the Prize - Introducing Eye Contact\nThe new Eye Contact effect moves the eyes of the speaker to simulate eye contact with the camera \u2014 achieved by estimating and aligning gaze. The eyes retain their natural color and blinks, and there\u2019s even a disconnect feature in case you look too far away, to transition smoothly between simulated and real eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEye Contact is ideal for content creators seeking to record themselves while reading their notes or a script, or avoiding having to stare directly at the camera. Video conference presenters will look at the eyes of the person they\u2019re speaking with, improving engagement with their audiences.\nCurrently in beta, we want to work with you, the community, to help improve Eye Contact. There are millions of eye colors and lighting combinations. If you test it and find any issues, or just want to help us develop this AI effect further, please send us a quick video here, we would really appreciate it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVignette, a Better Virtual Background, and More\nA Vignette effect - similar to those seen in apps like Instagram - has been integrated into Broadcast. Combine it with a subtle Background Blur effect to get an AI-simulated bokeh visual on your webcam, instantly improving visual quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Blur, Replacement, and Removal Virtual Background effects - have been enhanced with temporal information to achieve better segmentation and stability, enabling the AI to make better decisions. In cases where the network makes a mistake, you will not see parts of the background popping in and out as much. \u00a0\nAny Virtual Background issues? Please send us a video (link) so we can improve the effect for you.\nBroadcast has also integrated two of the most popular community requested features: the option to mirror your camera, and to take a screenshot of your webcam! Check out the two new icons under the camera preview labeled Camera Mirroring and Selfies.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant more features and effects?

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Barry Collins is a tech journalist writing about  PCs, Macs and games.Follow AuthorJan 04, 2023, 05:35pm ESTShareSaveCommentThis article is more than 2 years old.GeForce Now will deliver performance to rival a dedicated games PCgetty\nAn upgrade to Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now service puts streaming games performance on a par with that of a dedicated games PC, the company claims.\n\nThe new Ultimate Membership for GeForce Now will deliver 120fps at 4K and offers support for ultrawide screens (3,840 x 1,600). It also offers support for a host of gaming technologies, such as ray tracing, DLSS3 and Nvidia Reflex, which erodes the latency problem that has previously made hardcore gamers reluctant to embrace streaming.\n\n\nIn demonstrations at CES 2023 in Las Vegas, Nvidia showed an Ultimate Membership streaming session running alongside a PC fitted with a RTX 30 Series graphics card and the performance was indistinguishable. Even more impressively, the streaming session was running on The Cosmopolitan Hotel\u2019s public internet network, which was under heavy load from visitors during the world\u2019s biggest tech conference.\n\nSmashing Xbox performance\nNvidia claims the performance of GeForce Now\u2019s Ultimate Membership - which is based on the company\u2019s new RTX 4080 graphics chips - will outperform an Xbox Series X and some dedicated gaming PCs. GeForce Now running in 240Hz mode can deliver a total system latency of 35ms, Nvidia claimed, whereas the Xbox Series X in only 120Hz will have a total latency of 63ms.\n\n\nIn a demonstration running No Man\u2019s Sky on a 4K ultrawide monitor, GeForce Now was delivering faultless performance at 120 frames per second, with latency of only 9ms. The game was being streamed using a Mac mini.\nThe increased resolution and frame rates will put a heavier demand on customer\u2019s broadband connections. Nvidia representatives said the No Man\u2019s Sky demo required around 75Mbits/sec of bandwidth at peak, with an average of around 45Mbits/sec. The demos were being run on wired connections, although Nvidia claims it has worked with router manufacturers to improve the performance of the service over Wi-Fi.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nJanuary launch date\nNvidia said the new Ultimate Membership tier will start rolling out in some geographies later this month. Customers who already subscribe to the RTX 3080 tier will get a free upgrade to the new hardware.\n\nIt will be priced at $19.99/\u20ac19.99/\u00a317.99.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Omniverse is a dynamic collaborative platform that allows artists, engineers, creators and others to collaborate remotely on virtual worlds at scale. \nThe recently updated 3D graphics platform \u201cbrings increased performance, generational leaps in real-time RTX ray and path tracing, and streamlined workflows to help teams build connected 3D pipelines, and develop and operate large-scale, physically accurate, virtual 3D worlds like never before\u201d, Nvidia described. \nThe company added that artists, designers, engineers and developers can benefit from various enhancements across common Omniverse use cases. This includes breaking down 3D data silos through aggregation, building custom 3D pipeline tools and generating synthetic 3D data.\nAI-powered services\nThe new release adds support for the Nvidia Ada Lovelace architecture found in modern GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 graphics cards and the latest datacenter-scale OVX graphics computing systems for digital twins. \nThe platform also supports third-generation RTX technology and DLSS 3. Nvidia claims the new release delivers up to three times more performance when powered by \u201cthe latest GPU technology\u201d, such as NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Generation or the NVIDIA L40.\nThe update also delivers new Omniverse Connectors, layer-based live workflows, an improved user experience and customization options, including multi-view ports, editable hotkeys and lighting presets. The new Omniverse Connectors allow artists and designers to connect more software such as Adobe Substance 3D Painter, Autodesk Alias, PTC Creo and Kitware\u2019s Paraview.\nNvidia also announced the general availability of Omniverse DeepSearch, an AI-powered service that helps dev teams sift quickly through large, untagged databases of 3D models using natural language or 2D reference images. The company says the tool makes it easier to discover the models that a team needs without having to spend hours poring over a catalogue using text searches.\n\n\n\nTags:\n3D / AI / DeepSearch / GeForce RTX / nvidia omniverse \n\n\n\n\n\n\"*\" indicates required fields\n\nStay tuned, subscribe!\nE-mailadres*\n\nNieuwsbrieven*\n\nMorning Bytes\n\n\nWeekly Advisor\nNameThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nRelated                                \n\n\n\nJFrog makes big splash on Nvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree suspects arrested who may have supplied Nvidia chips to DeepSeek\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Cloud now offers Nvidia Blackwell-supported instances\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia challenger Groq receives 1.5 billion from Saudi Arabia\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor picks    \n\n\n\nOracle launches Java 24 with enhanced AI support and post-quantum cryptography\n\nSecurity and AI take center stage in Java 24\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to build a chip that\u2019s as efficient as the human brain\n\nIs neuromorphic computing the future?\n\n\n\n\n\nA storm has formed around CoreWeave\n\nOpenAI steps in, Microsoft pulls back\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is Lip-Bu Tan, the new Intel CEO?\n\nChange is afoot at Chipzilla\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsight: NIS2\n\n\n\n\nDutch government starts consultation for NIS2 bill\n\n\nEffective immediately, it is possible for anyone to submit suggestion...\n\n\n\n\n\nEU presents final text of NIS2 directive\n\n\nThe European Union recently published the final text of the updated N...\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNIS2 leads to better basic hygiene\n\nCouple of measures can really make a difference\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNIS2: law lacks future-proof ideas, challenging ambitions and recovery\n\nThe strengths and weaknesses of NIS2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more on Collaboration\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nZoom AI Companion embraces agentic AI capabilities\n\nNew repository for documents: Zoom Drive\n\nLaura Herijgers \n1 day ago\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe end is nigh for Skype: Microsoft to pull the plug in May\n\n\nSkype's days are probably numbered.

From high prices to potential scalping problems to confusing names, Nvidia has had to jump multiple hoops just to get these cards on the market. \nHowever, the problem that's arguably the most annoying is the power draw issues affecting these behemoth GPUs. Monstrous power demands are why some people are questioning the 40-Series GPUs, the new ATX 3.0 PSU standard, and whether you really need to upgrade your PSU to run the new Nvidia GPUs. \n                        Do Nvidia's RTX 40-Series GPUs Draw More Power?\n               \nFirst up, Nvidia's RTX 40-Series GPUs don't consume as much power as you think. So while you might see high TGP (Total Graphics Power) numbers on these GPUs, they perform relatively efficiently as compared to their last-generation counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Credit: NVIDIA\n\n\n\nFor example, when tested on 22 games at 4K, 1440p and 1080p, the RTX 4080 consumed less power on average, coming in at 251 watts as compared to the previous generation's RTX 3080, which was drawing 320 watts\u2014its maximum rated TGP. Keep in mind that both cards are rated at a 320W TGP.\nThe difference wasn't as notable when the GPUs were idle or playing video, but the RTX 4080 still consumed less power than the 3080. Even in 4K, the 3080's maximum power draw was 297W when running Control in the aforementioned test run by Nvidia.\nSo despite what you might hear, Nvidia has attempted to optimize these GPUs and lower the power draw.\nYou'll also get similar results when comparing the RTX 4090 with the RTX 3090. While both cards are rated at the same TDP of 450W, the 4090 performs significantly better at a similar power draw, if not less. \n                        What Is ATX 3.0?\n               \nATX 3.0 is the new specification standard for Power Supply Units (PSUs). The new design adds a new PCIe 5.0 12VHPWR connector with 12 + 4 pins alongside the usual six or eight-pin connection to supply GPUs with up to 600W of power.\nWhile that might not sound like a lot, this new addition allows ATX 3.0 PSUs to handle power spikes of up to 1,800W, although only for about 100 microseconds. However, those 100 microseconds might just be enough to save your $1,500 GPU from turning into a paperweight.\nAdditionally, this new connector also carries signals indicating its power capabilities to PCIe-connected devices. This enables power limitations to be set on components using PCIe, including GPUs and SSDs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Credit: NVIDIA\n\n\n\nThe RTX 40-Series cards have suffered power spikes periodically, but new ATX 3.0 PSUs can handle those spikes instead of just giving up and bricking expensive parts inside your PC. Knowing how much power your PC needs is crucial to having a stable machine that makes the most out of its hardware.\nOther notable changes in the ATX 3.0 specification include: \n\n                                        It can handle GPU excursions (power spikes) three times the card's power rating.\n                        \n\n                                        The 12V rail can go as high as 12.2V allowing for lower voltage drops.\n                        \n\n                                        Up to 60% efficiency on a 10W load, or 70% efficiency for 2% load of max rated capacity.\n                        \n\n                                        Faster system wake up and power on signal.\n                        \n\nATX 3.0 is the first time PSUs have seen a major change since 2003, at least in terms of ATX standards. The GPU power spike problem is one of the most common GPU issues and has finally been officially recognized by Intel and PCI-SIG alike. \n                        Do You Need to Upgrade to ATX 3.0?\n               \nAs long as your PSU meets Nvidia's minimum power recommendations for the RTX 40-Series, your existing PSU will work just fine with the new GPUs. While the cards have five slots, they come with a power adapter to make them compatible with existing six or eight-pin PSUs.\nThe PSU recommendations for RTX 40-Series cards are as follows, according to Nvidia: \n\nRTX 4090 (450W TGP): 850W minimum\n                        \n\nRTX 4080 (320W TGP): 750W minimum\n                        \n\nRTX 4070 Ti (285W TGP): 700W minimum\n                        \n\nThe most power-hungry GPU in the 30-Series was the 3090 Ti, which required a minimum 850W PSU. As you can see, the 4090 has the same minimum PSU power requirement, except you get more performance per watt.\nIn case your power supply isn't up to the mark, or if you're looking for signs to upgrade your PSU, we strongly recommend you get a new and preferably ATX 3.0 compatible one. It's never a bad idea to dish out extra cash on your PSU to protect your other components.\nBesides, leaving a healthy amount of headroom on your PSU will give you peace of mind and room for overclocking. However, you'll likely hit a CPU or memory bottleneck before you're able to get the GPU to its limits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat said, if the specifications listed above didn't change your mind, another reason you might want to upgrade your PSU is fewer cables. The 40-Series GPUs use the PCIe Gen 5 connector that allows you to power the GPUs with just one cable. So when accounting for the total cable management you'll have to deal with, this becomes an important factor. \n            Debunking Power Adapter Myths\n    \nFinally, if you're concerned about the power adapters provided with the GPUs to adapt them to ATX 2.0 or other PSUs, don't be. Nvidia has confirmed that the adapters carry active internal circuitry that translates the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the ATX 3.0 (or PCIe Gen 5) specifications.\nThe 30-cycle lifetime on the new PCIe Gen 5 connectors is also nothing to worry about. It has basically remained the same for over two decades and hasn't changed with PCIe Gen 5, either.\nAnother fun fact about these connectors is that the internal circuitry can detect the number of connectors plugged in, meaning if you're connecting four connectors instead of the usual three, it'll allow the RTX 4090 to draw more power up to 600W. \n                        Power Efficiency Improvements in Nvidia's RTX 40-Series GPUs\n               \nThe Ada Lovelace architecture that the 40-Series GPUs are based on brings major performance and power efficiency improvements. As a result, these GPUs perform better than their predecessors while using far less power. The power requirements were ramped up, but they weren't as big as compared to the performance enhancements.\nWhile 30-Series GPUs were limited in terms of boost clock speed by their overall power consumption, on 40-Series GPUs maximum clock speeds or voltage limits are being hit first. This allows Nvidia to further tune the cards and lower power levels for better efficiency.\nAt the end of the day, power efficiency enhancements do matter when it comes to your PC's overall performance. Not to mention a slightly cheaper electricity bill. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology Explained\n\n\n\n\nGaming\n\n\n\n\nPSU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support MakeUseOf.

It is not intended to be used for gaming though one can still game on it if they want since NVIDIA's drivers are very flexible. One might easily get confused with the naming scheme of the new card but one should remember that the Ampere generation had an 'A' at the beginning of the model name whereas the Ada generation doesn't feature any alphabets in the beginning. The card is simply called the RTX 6000 instead of the RTX A6000 (Last-gen).\nRelated Story NVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe specifications of the NVIDIA RTX 6000 are also better than the GeForce RTX 4090. It has just 2 SMs disabled at 142 which offer up to 18,176 CUDA cores. That's 11% more cores & SMs than the RTX 4090 GPU. But NVIDIA surely has some room left for an even higher-end variant that will use those 2 remaining SM units. The card comes with a similar boost clock of 2.5 GHz and has double the VRAM capacity at 48 GB (EEC) versus the 24 GB featured on the RTX 4090. The card does use slower 20 Gbps GDDR6X memory dies versus the 21 Gbps dies featured on the gaming graphics card.\n\n\n\nArchitecture\nNVIDIA Ada Lovelace Architecture\n\n\nProcess Size\n4nm NVIDIA Custom Process | TSMC\n\n\nDie Size\n608.4 mm\n\n\nTransistors\n76.3 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n18176\n\n\nTensor Cores\n568 Gen-4\n\n\nRT Cores\n142 Gen-3\n\n\nGPU Memory\n48 GB GDDR6 with ECC\n\n\nMemory Interface\n384-bit\n\n\nGraphics Bus\nPCI Express Gen 4.0 x16\n\n\nDisplay Connectors\nDP 1.4 (4)\n\n\nForm Factor\n4.4\" H x 10.5\" L, Dual-Slot\n\n\nThermal Solution\nActive Fansink\n\n\nAR/MR/VR/XR Capable\nYes\n\n\nNVIDIA 3D Vision and 3D Vision Pro\nSupport via Optional 3-pin mini-DIN\n\n\nFrame Lock\nCompatible with NVIDIA Quadro Sync II\n\n\nMaximum Power Consumption\n300 W\n\n\nAuxiliary Power Connector\n1x PCIe CEMS 16-pin\n\n\nNVENC | NVDEC\n3x | 3x + AV1 Encode and Decode\n\n\n\nAs for performance, the NVIDIA RTX 6000 'Ada' graphics card offers 91.1 TFLOPs of FP32, 210.6 TFLOPs of RT, and 1457 TFLOPs of Tensor core performance. While the RTX 4090 requires 450W TBP, the RTX 6000 is rated at just 300W, making it quite the efficiency powerhouse. But all of that extra prowess and workstation goodness comes at a cost.\n\nThe NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada is now available through NVIDIA and its partners for a price of $6800 US which is also its official MSRP. That's almost 50% higher than the RTX A6000, its Ampere GPU-based predecessor, and 4.25x higher than the RTX 4090's MSRP. The price may be entirely worth it as this card has workstation capabilities and performance that are second to none. Ada has some insane compute capabilities and a lot of creation/AI prowess under its hood and with proper workstation drivers, this beast would fly.\nNVIDIA Workstation Graphics Card Lineup:\n\n\n\nGraphics CardRTX PRO 6000RTX 6000 AdaRTX A6000Quadro RTX 8000Quadro RTX 6000Quadro GV100\n\n\n\n\nGPUBlackwell GPUAda Lovelace GPUAmpere GPUTuring GPUTuring GPUVolta GPU\n\n\nGPU SKUGB202AD102GA102TU102TU102GV100\n\n\nGPU Process5nm5nm8nm12nm12nm12nm\n\n\nDie Size750mm2608mm2628mm\u00b2754mm\u00b2754mm\u00b2815mm\u00b2\n\n\nGPU Cores24064 Cores18176 Cores10752 Cores4608 Cores4608 Cores5120 Cores\n\n\nTensor Cores752 Cores568 Cores656 Cores576 Cores576 Cores640 Cores\n\n\nBoost ClockTBD2.50 GHz1.80 GHz1.77 GHz1.77 GHz1.62 GHz\n\n\nSingle Precision125.0 TFLOPs91.1 TFLOPs38.7 TFLOPs16.31 TFLOPs16.31 TFLOPs16.66 TFLOPs\n\n\nRay Tracing SpecTBD210.6 TFLOPs75.4 TFLOPs10 GigaRays/Sec10 GigaRays/SecN/A\n\n\nVRAM96 GB GDDR748 GB GDDR648 GB GDDR648 GB GDDR624 GB GDDR632 GB HBM2\n\n\nNVLINK VRAMN/AN/A96 GB With NVLINK96 GB With NVLINK48 GB With NVLINKN/A\n\n\nMemory Bus512-bit384-bit384-bit384-bit384-bit4096-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth1.8 TB/s960 GB/s768 GB/s672 GB/s672 GB/s870 GB/s\n\n\nTDP600W\n300W (Max-Q)300W300W~225W~200W250W\n\n\nLaunch PriceTBD$6800 US$4650 US$10000 US$6300 US$9000 US\n\n\nLaunch Date2025Q1 2023Q4 2020Q4 2018Q4 20182018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n153\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n108\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n73\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n73\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n59\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

To avoid placing unsustainable demands on electricity generation to run this computing infrastructure, the underlying technology must be as efficient as possible.\nAccelerated computing powered by NVIDIA GPUs and the AI platform offers the efficiency that enables data centers to sustainably drive the next generation of breakthroughs.\nAnd now, timed with the launch of 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors, NVIDIA and its partners have kicked off a new generation of accelerated computing systems that are built for energy-efficient AI. When combined with H100 Tensor Core GPUs, these systems can deliver dramatically higher performance, greater scale, and higher efficiency than the prior generation, providing more computation and problem-solving per watt.\nThe new Intel CPUs will be used in DGX H100 systems, as well as in more than 60 servers featuring H100 GPUs from NVIDIA partners around the world.\nSupercharging Speed, Efficiency, and Savings for Enterprise AI\nThe coming NVIDIA and Intel-powered systems will help enterprises run workloads an average of 25x more efficiently than traditional CPU-only data center servers. This incredible performance per watt means less power is needed to get jobs are done, which helps ensure the power available to data centers is used as efficiently as possible to supercharge the most important work.\nCompared to prior-generation accelerated systems, this new generation of NVIDIA-accelerated servers speeds training and inference to boost energy efficiency\u00a0by 3.5x \u2013 which translates into real cost savings, with AI data centers delivering over 3x lower total cost of ownership.\nNew 4th Gen Intel Xeon CPUs Move More Data to Accelerate NVIDIA AI\nAmong the features of the new 4th Gen Intel Xeon CPU is support for PCIe Gen 5, which can double the data transfer rates from CPU to NVIDIA GPUs and networking. Increased PCIe lanes allow for a greater density of GPUs and high-speed networking within each server.\n\nFaster memory bandwidth also improves the performance of data-intensive workloads such as AI, while networking speeds \u2014 up to 400 gigabits per second (Gbps) per connection \u2014 support faster data transfers between servers and storage.\nDGX H100 systems and servers from NVIDIA partners with H100 PCIe GPUs come with a license for NVIDIA AI Enterprise, an end-to-end, secure, cloud-native suite of AI development and deployment software, providing a complete platform for excellence in efficient enterprise AI.\nNVIDIA DGX H100 Systems Supercharge Efficiency for Supersize AI\nAs the fourth generation of the world\u2019s premier purpose-built AI infrastructure, DGX H100 systems provide a fully optimized platform powered by the operating system of the accelerated data center, NVIDIA Base Command\u00a0software.\nEach DGX H100 system features eight NVIDIA H100 GPUs, 10\u00a0NVIDIA ConnectX-7 network adapters, and dual 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors to deliver the performance required to build large generative AI models,\u00a0large language models,\u00a0recommender systems,\u00a0and more.\n\nCombined with NVIDIA networking, this architecture supercharges efficient computing at scale by delivering up to 9x more performance than the previous generation and 20x to 40x more performance than unaccelerated X86 dual-socket servers for AI training and HPC workloads. If a language model previously required 40 days to train on a cluster of X86-only servers, the NVIDIA DGX H100 using Intel Xeon CPUs and ConnectX-7 powered networking could complete the same work in as little as 1-2 days.\nNVIDIA DGX H100 systems are the building blocks of an enterprise-ready, turnkey\u00a0NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, which delivers up to\u00a0one exaflop\u00a0of AI performance, providing a leap in efficiency for large-scale enterprise AI deployment.\nNVIDIA Partners Boost Data Center Efficiency\u00a0\nFor AI data center workloads, NVIDIA H100 GPUs enable enterprises to build and deploy applications more efficiently.\nBringing a new generation of performance and energy efficiency to enterprises worldwide, a broad portfolio of systems with H100 GPUs and 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable CPUs are coming soon from NVIDIA partners, including ASUS, Atos, Cisco, Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, QCT, and Supermicro.\n\nAs the bellwether of the efficiency gains to come, the\u00a0Flatiron Institute\u2019s Lenovo ThinkSystem with NVIDIA H100 GPUs\u00a0tops the latest Green500 list \u2014 and NVIDIA technologies power 23 of the top 30 systems on the list. The Flatiron system uses prior-generation Intel CPUs, so even more efficiency is expected from the systems now coming to market.\nAdditionally, connecting servers with NVIDIA ConnectX-7 networking and Intel 4th Gen Xeon Scalable processors will increase efficiency and reduce infrastructure and power consumption.\nNVIDIA ConnectX-7 adapters support PCIe Gen 5 and 400 Gbps per connection using Ethernet or InfiniBand, doubling networking throughput between servers and storage. The adapters support advanced networking, storage, and security offloads. ConnectX-7 reduces the number of cables and switch ports needed, saving 17% or more on electricity needed for the networking of large GPU-accelerated HPC and AI clusters and contributing to the better energy efficiency of these new servers.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise Software Delivers Full-Stack AI Solution\nThese next-generation systems also deliver a leap forward in operational efficiency as they\u2019re optimized for the\u00a0NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite.\nRunning on NVIDIA H100, NVIDIA AI Enterprise accelerates the data science pipeline and streamlines the development and deployment of predictive AI models to automate essential processes and gain rapid insights from data.\nWith an extensive library of full-stack software, including AI workflows of reference applications, frameworks, pre-trained models, and infrastructure optimization, the software provides an ideal foundation for scaling enterprise AI success.\nTo try out NVIDIA H100 running AI workflows and frameworks supported in NVIDIA AI Enterprise, sign up for\u00a0NVIDIA LaunchPad\u00a0free of charge.

The Ada GPU is built upon the foundation set by Turing. NVIDIA terms the Ada Lovelace GPUs as a quantum leap over Ampere, and the GeForce RTX 4080 Founders Edition based on NVIDIA Ampere GPU excels at everything versus the previous gen.\nThe Ada GPU architecture has a lot to be talked about in this review, but so does the new RTX lineup. The Ada lineup offers faster shader performance, faster ray tracing performance, and faster AI performance. Built on a brand new process node and featuring an architecture designed from the ground up, Ada is a killer product with lots of numbers to talk about.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total CostThe fundamental of Ada was to take everything NVIDIA learned with its Turing & Ampere architectures and not only refine it but to use its DNA to form a product in a completely new performance category. Tall claims were made by NVIDIA when they introduced its Ada lineup last month with up to 4x performance claims & we will be finding out whether NVIDIA hit all the ticks with its Ada architecture as this review will be your guiding path to see what makes Ada and how it performs against its predecessors.\n\nToday, we will be taking a look at the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti graphics card. We will be looking at various AIB models since the 4070 Ti doesn't feature a Founders Edition model.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series Gaming Graphics Cards - The Biggest GPU Performance Leap in Recent History\nTuring wasn't just any graphics core, it was the graphics core that was to become the foundation of future GPUs. The future is realized now with next-generation consoles going deep in talks about ray tracing and AI-assisted super-sampling techniques. NVIDIA had a head start with Turing & Ampere and its Ada generation will only do things infinitely times better.\n\nThe Ada GPU does many traditional things which we would expect from a GPU, but at the same time, also breaks the barrier when it comes to untraditional GPU operations. Just to sum up some features:\n\nNew Streaming Multiprocessor (SM)\nNew Turing Tensor Cores\nNew Real-Time Ray Tracing Acceleration\nNew Shading Enhancements\nNew Deep Learning Features For Graphics & Inference\nNew GDDR6X High-Performance Memory Subsystem\nNew HDMI 2.1 Display Engine & Next-Gen NVENC/NVDEC\n\n\nThe technologies mentioned above are some of the main building blocks of the Ada GPU, but there's more within the graphics core itself which we will talk about in detail so let's get started.\n\n\nContents\n\n1.

However, there's one budding niche within the gaming business where the company is doubling down despite the headwinds in this segment.\nThe chipmaker recently announced\u00a0that it is bringing its RTX 4080 graphics cards to GeForce Now -- Nvidia's cloud gaming service. Let's see why this could be a big deal for the company in the long run.\n\nNvidia is pushing the envelope in cloud gaming\nThe RTX 4080\u00a0is one of Nvidia's top-of-the-line graphics cards that brings about a huge improvement over its predecessor, the RTX 3080. Gamers can now stream titles powered by the RTX 4080 to their devices and play high-end games without having to invest in expensive hardware. That's because cloud gaming enables gamers to simply stream games to their local device -- which could be a PC, smartphone, or a television (TV) -- over the internet while the processing is done by remotely located data centers.\nNow that Nvidia is equipping its cloud gaming servers with RTX 4080 graphics cards, gamers can stream and play resource-intensive games even on their underpowered devices. The company is promising that its RTX 4080 class cloud gaming servers can deliver five times the graphics performance of Microsoft's Xbox Series X console and 1.75x the performance of its previous generation\u00a0RTX 3080 class cloud gaming servers.\nWhat's more, Nvidia says that GeForce Now customers opting for the RTX 4080-class membership will be able to experience \"true PC gaming -- streaming at up to 240 frames per second from the cloud with full ray tracing and DLSS 3.\" That would be a big bump over the RTX 3080-class GeForce Now membership tier that delivered games at 120 frames per second on PCs and MacBooks.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is offering RTX 4080 class cloud gaming with the GeForce Now Ultimate membership tier, priced at $19.99 for a monthly subscription and $99.99 for a six-month subscription. Given that an RTX 4080 graphics card alone starts\u00a0at $1,199, gamers looking to play high-end titles without breaking the bank are getting a good deal.\nSo, it won't be surprising to see more cloud gamers flock toward GeForce Now after Nvidia's latest move, especially at a time when high inflation\u00a0and the possibility of a recession could hurt sales of physical graphics cards further. A cloud gaming subscription is substantially cheaper, and this could play in Nvidia's favor.\nIt is also worth noting that the company had 12 million GeForce Now subscribers before it launched its previous generation RTX 3080-class cloud gaming subscription in Oct. 2021. That number grew to 20 million -- a jump of 66% -- within a year of the launch of the RTX 3080 membership tier in August 2022. And now that Nvidia is pushing the envelope further by upgrading its cloud gaming performance, it won't be surprising to see the company maintain terrific growth in this fast-growing niche that could supercharge its long-term growth.\nInvestors should also note that gamers can subscribe to GeForce Now starting at $9.99 per month or $49.99 for six months for the Priority membership tier. There are limitations, however, as the Priority tier limits\u00a0game streaming to a 1080p resolution and a frame rate of 60 frames per second. Moreover, Nvidia is offering a huge library\u00a0of 1,500 games on GeForce Now, which gives gamers another big reason to go for this service.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis could become a huge business\nIt is estimated that the global cloud gaming market generated just $2.4 billion in revenue last year. That's a massive increase of 74% over 2021, according to estimates from video games and esports analytics and market research provider Newzoo. The firm also points out that the cloud gaming market had an estimated 31.7 million paying subscribers at the end of 2022.\nIf that's indeed the case, Nvidia has already cornered a nice chunk of the market since it had 20 million GeForce Now subscribers in August last year. More specifically, Nvidia may already be controlling over two-thirds of the cloud gaming space based on the size of the paying subscriber base, as estimated by Newzoo.\nThis puts the company in a terrific position to capitalize on cloud gaming, a space that's expected\u00a0to clock a healthy annual growth rate of 47.5% through 2028 and generate almost $14 billion in revenue at the end of the forecast period. Nvidia's sustained dominance of this market could help the company mint billions of dollars from cloud gaming.\nTo put things in perspective, Nvidia has generated $7.2 billion in revenue from the gaming segment in the first three months of fiscal 2023, which points toward an annual revenue run rate of $9.6 billion. So, cloud gaming could turn out to be a substantial growth driver for Nvidia, given the potential end market opportunity on offer and the dominant position that the company has built for itself already.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn all, it can be said that cloud gaming could bring a much-needed boost for Nvidia following a terrible year of graphics card sales. And it could ultimately help bring this beaten-down tech stock back on track.\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

It feels phenomenal in some games, but there\u2019s still work to be done.by  Tom Warren and  Sean HollisterJan 19, 2023, 2:00 PM UTCLinkFacebookThreads Image: NvidiaEntertainment /Gaming /PC GamingTesting Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now RTX 4080, the most advanced cloud gaming platform yetFor $20 a month, Nvidia will rent you an RTX 4080 gaming PC in the cloud. It feels phenomenal in some games, but there\u2019s still work to be done.by  Tom Warren and  Sean HollisterJan 19, 2023, 2:00 PM UTCLinkFacebookThreadsGoogle Stadia shut down overnight, but it\u2019s hardly the end of cloud gaming. Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now streaming service already leapfrogged Stadia and many other rivals with its RTX 3080 tier, and now, it\u2019s delivering an upgrade to RTX 4080 graphics alongside HDR and ultrawide resolution support.That means all the usual performance upgrades you\u2019d expect to find with a modern GPU you\u2019d purchase for a PC and an important advancement for latency: 240fps. While the old RTX 3080 tier could output at 120fps, doubling the frame rate is noticeable both in terms of performance and latency. It makes GeForce Now the most advanced cloud gaming platform yet and even close to feeling like you\u2019re running games on your own PC.I\u2019ve been testing this new GeForce Now Ultimate competitive 240Hz mode on a 32-inch Samsung Odyssey G7 (1440p, 240Hz) monitor, and my colleague Sean Hollister has been testing on a similar 240Hz monitor as well as a 1440p screen. You\u2019ll need a 240Hz display to really take advantage of the new mode, but you\u2019ll still get some of the latency benefits even on 120Hz and 144Hz panels thanks to Nvidia\u2019s Reflex technology that evaluates and decreases system latency in games.Fortnite running at 240Hz on Nvidia\u2019s new RTX 4080 servers. Image: Tom Warren / The VergeNew 240Hz competitive modeI\u2019ve been a critic of Stadia\u2019s lagginess for mouse and keyboard, but GeForce Now Ultimate delivers the kind of latency improvements that almost trick my mind into thinking I\u2019m playing the game on my own gaming PC.I mostly play shooters like Destiny 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and Apex Legends, and I\u2019ve found they\u2019re the biggest test point for cloud gaming latency. I\u2019ve been playing Apex Legends, CS:GO, and Fortnite on Nvidia\u2019s RTX 4080 servers over the past week. The 240Hz mode only works at 1080p right now, and it only delivers up to 240fps in supported games. The list of games that support the 240Hz mode isn\u2019t very long:Apex LegendsCounter Strike: Global OffensiveDota 2FortniteLeague of LegendsRocket LeagueTom Clancy\u2019s Rainbow Six SiegeWarfaceWarframeWorld of TanksNvidia says it\u2019s planning to add more games over time and that it can even add Reflex and the ability to support its 240Hz mode in games that developers haven\u2019t implemented it in.That said, Fortnite was the most impressive of the bunch of 240Hz games I tested, particularly because it supports all of Nvidia\u2019s ray-tracing options, DLSS, and the Reflex latency improvements. The game also lends itself well to streaming thanks to its cartoon-like art style. The latency improvements are huge for keyboard and mouse players, and I found it difficult to notice any lag most of the time.It didn\u2019t run at 240fps reliably, though. In the creative mode, it was buttery smooth, but it was easy to notice the frame rate drops when you jump out of the battle bus and glide into the battle royale mode. Once I was on the ground, I rarely saw frame rate drops, and the input latency felt super impressive most of the time.CS:GO is mostly locked to 240fps on GeForce Now Ultimate. GIF: Tom Warren / The VergeIn Apex Legends, the latency can be more noticeable during a lot of action where you have to make quick decisions, but it still feels more impressive than when I tested the RTX 3080 tier servers more than a year ago. And in CS:GO, it was a lock at 240fps most of the time and felt super smooth.Nvidia\u2019s RTX 4080 servers include 64 teraflops of performance (around five times an Xbox Series X), full ray tracing, and DLSS 3. The competitive 240Hz mode can deliver end-to-end latency of less than 40ms in some games, which beats playing an Xbox Series X at 60Hz.I could tab between a Fortnite session running on my own PC with an RTX 4090 and one in this RTX 4080 cloud world, and the only noticeable difference was the quality of what I could see on-screen. I\u2019ll let my colleague Sean Hollister explain the visual differences.Visual qualityHey, I\u2019m Sean. You may remember me from such previous cloud gaming stories as why GeForce Now just kicked Google Stadia\u2019s butt. I totally agree with Tom that the latency is superb; I\u2019m genuinely not sure I can tell the difference in responsiveness between GeForce Now and a desktop gaming PC anymore. I definitely appreciate nearly 30 percent performance gains in my Cyberpunk 2077, too.I just wish Nvidia had made as large a leap in image quality \u2014 because there\u2019s one dead giveaway that lets me spot a cloud game every time. Tom and I are calling it \u201cthe haze\u201d because that\u2019s how it manifests in GeForce Now. It feels like there\u2019s a haze between you and what you\u2019re looking at, almost every time you move.Let\u2019s illustrate: here are two cropped screenshots of CS:GO at 1080p and 240fps. In the first, I\u2019m standing still. In the second, I\u2019ve begun moving, like I will be doing constantly in most games. Blow up these images, zoom in, and peep the wall textures: very different, no?At 1080p and 240fps, moving an inch can feel like switching to potato graphics.If you want to get more technical, this is image compression artifacting, and it\u2019s not unique to GeForce Now \u2014 every cloud gaming service suffers from it because all of them need to shrink their images small enough so that they can send 60, 120, or even 240 of them per second across your internet connection, all while nigh-instantly reacting to your movements.In some games, like Fortnite, the haze is simply not as noticeable. I suspect it\u2019s because Fortnite\u2019s a very colorful game; grays and blacks are often where you see compression artifacting at its worst. But it\u2019s also particularly bad at 1080p resolution, the only resolution you can use for GeForce Now\u2019s new 240fps mode. Thankfully, there are ways to reduce the haze.Playing at 4K resolution reduces it dramatically \u2014 even if you don\u2019t have a 4K screen. Here are two more full-size images of CS:GO streaming at 4K to a 1080p monitor. Cropped, you can see it\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s quite a bit better, and I think it\u2019s wonderful that GeForce Now lets you choose.Left: standing still. Right: moving.Unfortunately, 4K isn\u2019t available on all GeForce Now clients yet. You can\u2019t get it on the web, which means you can\u2019t get it on Chromebooks or the Steam Deck. You\u2019ll need a Mac, Windows PC, Nvidia Shield TV, or certain recent smart TV sets. But I\u2019m happy it\u2019s an option on PC at all \u2014 Nvidia didn\u2019t add that until last May, and it\u2019s my favorite way to stream games now. It\u2019s definitely a jump from the old 1440p streaming, as you can see in my Control comparison images below, now on a 1440p monitor:Click here to blow this up for closer inspection. Image: Sean Hollister / The VergeAt 4K 120, even the darkest jungle regions in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, which looked almost unintelligible the last time I wrote about GeForce Now, are reasonably clear now on my 1440p screen. I could see myself playing the whole game that way.Things to consider with game streamingTom here again, and it\u2019s time to talk about the biggest drawbacks to Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now service: game availability, pricing, and internet connectivity. Nvidia supports Steam and the Epic Games Store, but many games still aren\u2019t available. Publishers like Bethesda and Activision Blizzard pulled their games from GeForce Now, meaning none of the Fallout, The Elder Scrolls, Doom, and Call of Duty titles are available. That\u2019s a huge drawback for GeForce Now Ultimate, even if it\u2019s the most impressive cloud gaming platform so far.Pricing is also a block to experiencing whether GeForce Now Ultimate is for you. Google let you easily test Stadia out free of charge (with a brief 4K test period), but there\u2019s no way to try out Nvidia\u2019s best RTX 4080 experience without signing up for the $19.99 monthly subscription. That\u2019s disappointing because I think a lot of people will be impressed with this new 240Hz mode or even running games at 120fps in 1440p or 4K resolution.I suspect a lot of people will balk at $19.99 per month for game streaming, but I think there\u2019s a lot of value here. If you built an equivalent PC, then you\u2019re looking at $2,000 or more and then the energy costs for playing. A $2,000 PC over five years works out to around $33 a month, with electricity charges on top. It\u2019s certainly an enticing prospect if you\u2019re thinking about upgrading your PC, especially when any games you purchase through Steam or the Epic Games Store on GeForce Now will always be yours regardless of whether you subscribe.GeForce Now Ultimate won\u2019t convince the most competitive and hardcore PC gamers to switch, but that\u2019s not really the point of it. For everyone else, this feels like a compelling option if your games are there and you\u2019re temporarily without a gaming PC or you don\u2019t want to shell out thousands of dollars right now to upgrade.Nvidia is launching its new RTX 4080 servers just as Google shuts down Stadia. Image: Tom Warren / The VergeThere\u2019s also the matter of connectivity and data usage to consider.You\u2019ll need to be close to Nvidia\u2019s servers and hope that they\u2019ve been upgraded. Ultimate subscribers in and around San Jose, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Frankfurt, Germany, will be the first to get the RTX 4080 tier, with upgrades happening weekly.This new competitive mode will also eat up around 13GB of data an hour, so if you have an internet connection with data caps, then this probably isn\u2019t the service for you. I tested GeForce Now Ultimate using a 1Gbps fiber connection with less than 5ms of latency to Nvidia\u2019s EU West servers. It\u2019s the perfect connection for game streaming, but a lot of people won\u2019t have such luck with connectivity, so your mileage may well vary.Correction, January 20th 7:50AM ET: Nvidia provided a list of Reflex games prior to launch, and we\u2019ve corrected the list to include all titles now available with Reflex.See More: EntertainmentGamingHands-onNewsNvidiaPC GamingReviewsTechMore in this streamSee allReed Hastings is stepping down as Netflix\u2019s co-CEORichard LawlerJan 19, 2023CommentsComment Icon BubbleThe United States Navy is doing an AMA right now with some of its \u201cCyber Warfare Engineers\u201d and that\u2019s pretty weird.Sarah JeongJan 19, 2023CommentsComment Icon BubbleMicrosoft starts testing tabs in Notepad for Windows 11Tom WarrenJan 19, 2023CommentsComment Icon BubbleMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Although not as wide-ranging as Nvidia's laptop GPU announcements earlier in the week, all of these graphics chips target low-end-to-mid-range gaming laptops and mobile workstations, which data suggests is what most people are buying when they shop for those kinds of PCs.\nAMD announced seven GPUs, four of which are new RDNA 3-based models in the mid-range 7600 and 7700 series (the other three are spec tweaks for existing low-end RDNA 2 laptop GPUs). The 7600 and 7700 series support the same core features of other RDNA 3 GPUs, including improved ray-tracing performance and hardware-accelerated encoding and decoding of the AV1 video codec. All four GPUs will be available in laptops beginning in February.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                The full range of new (and new-ish) GPUs.\n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                          AMD\n                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      The full range of new (and new-ish) GPUs.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          AMD\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nThere are two new GPUs here, available in four configurations. One GPU has 32 of AMD's compute units (CUs), 2,048 shaders, and an 18Gbps memory speed. The second GPU drops to 28 CUs, 1,792 shaders, and a 16Gbps memory speed. Both GPUs share an 8GB pool of GDDR6 memory, a 128-bit memory interface, and 32MB of AMD's Infinity Cache.\nThe 32 CU chip will be sold as both the RX 7600M XT and the RX 7700S. The 28 CU chip will be sold as the RX 7600M and RX 7600S. The difference between the M and the S series is that the S GPUs have a slightly lower maximum power range than the M chips, meaning that they can fit into smaller laptops with less-capable coolers but also indicating that they may run at lower peak and sustained clock speeds to compensate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      AMD's advertised performance figures for the RX 7600M XT compare it to the desktop version of Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3060, for some reason.\n              \n                      AMD\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\nAMD's advertised performance figures for the RX 7600M XT compare it to the desktop version of Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3060, for some reason.\n\n                      AMD\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      The 7600M XT also beats the older 6600M.\n              \n                      AMD\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 7600M XT also beats the older 6600M.\n\n                      AMD\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      And the RX 7700S beats the last-gen 6700S.\n              \n                      AMD\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the RX 7700S beats the last-gen 6700S.\n\n                      AMD\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 7600M XT also beats the older 6600M.\n\n                      AMD\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the RX 7700S beats the last-gen 6700S.\n\n                      AMD\n                  \n\n\n\n\nAMD compared the 7600M XT favorably to the desktop version of Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3060, showing it beating the 3060 (as well as the old RX 6600M) by a decent margin in a wide range of games. That's all well and good, though one could argue that comparing a laptop GPU to\u00a0other laptop GPUs might be more relevant for potential buyers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for the S-series, AMD showed the 7700S beating the previous-generation 6700S\u00a0but offered no direct comparisons to any Nvidia GPUs. AMD also showed results for a mostly different set of games, making comparisons between the 7700S and 7600M XT difficult\u2014the handful of games that were run on both GPUs showed nearly identical results at the same 1080p graphics settings, though.\nThe dedicated RDNA 3 GPUs will also be joined by an as-yet-unnamed RDNA 3-based integrated GPU in Ryzen 7040 processors. With up to 12 CUs and its reliance on shared system memory, it will fall far short of the 7600S or 7600M, but it should still be a solid step up from older AMD integrated GPUs or Intel's aging Iris Xe integrated GPU.\nAMD hasn't announced any high-end laptop GPU to compete with the RTX 4080 and 4090-series laptop GPUs that Nvidia announced earlier this week.\nNvidia may also be able to press the power efficiency advantage that the RTX 4000 series has over the RDNA 3-based GPUs in our testing of the desktop versions. Nvidia teased a 40 W RTX 4000 laptop GPU with the same performance as a laptop RTX 3070, while AMD is talking about mid-range GPUs with power figures in the 50 to 120 W range. That said, we'll need to wait and see how these GPUs compare in actual laptop designs, where performance can differ quite a bit between laptops with the same components based on how the laptops are designed.\nOf the three RDNA 2-based GPUs AMD introduced, the RX 6550M and RX 6450M are barely improved versions of the existing RX 6500 and RX 6400, respectively. The CU counts, 4GB memory size, 64-bit memory interface, and all the other most important hardware specs are the same. Both serve as low-end, better-than-integrated GPUs for budget gaming laptops.\nThe third RDNA 2 GPU is the RX 6550S, which like the other S-series GPUs is just a version of the RX 6550M with a lower minimum power limit (35 W, down from 50 W) that will help it fit into smaller designs.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Nvidia unveils a broad range of efficient new laptop GPUs, from RTX 4050 to 4090\n          \n\n            Mobile RTX 4050 can supposedly beat an RTX 3070 with just one-third the power use.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            AMD\u2019s Ryzen 7000 laptop CPU lineup is a bewildering patchwork of old and new\n          \n\n            Four CPU architectures and three GPU architectures get mixed-and-matched.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Listing image:\n    AMD\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Cunningham\nSenior Technology Reporter\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Cunningham\nSenior Technology Reporter\n\n\n      Andrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with a focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of operating systems like Windows and macOS.

Read more about how we evaluate products.\nNVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti review: 3090 Ti power for $799It\u2019s the first 40-series GPU you may actually afford some day.devindra hardawarSenior EditorWed, Jan 4, 2023, 10:00 PM0 Devindra Hardawar/EngadgetNVIDIA's new RTX 40-series GPUs are insanely powerful, but also wildly expensive. That's my big takeaway after reviewing the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 \u2014 sure, they're fast, but who can justify spending over $1,000 on a video card? With the RTX 4070 Ti, which debuted at CES 2023, NVIDIA is offering a slightly more reasonable alternative. Starting at $799, it's still fairly pricey, but at least it's under $1,000. And best of all, it's in many ways better than last year's 3090 Ti, which initially cost a whopping $2,000.After announcing two RTX 4080 cards a few months ago, NVIDIA surprised us all when it \"unlaunched\" the $899 12GB model. Given its much lower specs, there were plenty of complaints that it seemed a bit too expensive to be called a 4080. So now we've got the 4070 Ti at $100 less, with the same 7,680 CUDA cores and 12GB of GDDR6X memory that the 4080 was supposed to get. Sometimes, yelling at companies online gets results.ASUS90100Expert ScoreNVIDIA RTX 4070 TiIf you've got a 1440p monitor running at 120Hz or more, the 4070 Ti is clearly the more sensible purchase in NVIDIA's new family. ProsEnough speed for some 4K gamingPowerful enough to max out 1,440p 120Hz monitors$799 starting priceLow power requirementsDLSS 3 is incredibly useful with ray tracingConsStill far more expensive than GPUs used to be$1,098 at AmazonIf you've got a small case, the 4070 Ti may also be the first RTX 40-series GPU you can actually use. Both the 4080 and 4090 Ti were triple-slot behemoths \u2014 they took up a significant chunk of my fairly roomy mid-tower case \u2013 whereas the 4070 Ti just needs two. It also requires far less energy than either of those cards, since it can run with a 700-watt PSU and has a maximum power draw of 285W. (The 4080 requires a 750W PSU, while the demands an 850W unit.) NVIDIA says the 4070 Ti uses around 49 percent less power on average than the 3090 Ti.1 / 6NVIDIA RTX 4070 TiNVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti\nGiven where it sits alongside the RTX 4080, the 4070 Ti performed exactly as I expected. It clocked in around 20 percent slower in 3DMark's TimeSpy Extreme Benchmark, as well as the Geekbench 4 Compute test. It was also a full 30 fps slower while playing Halo Infinite in 4K with maxed out graphics settings. Now those numbers may sound disappointing, but I was ecstatic to see them. Sure, it's slower, but the 4070 Ti is actually keeping up fairly well with a card that's $400 more expensive (and in many cases, far more). That's something to celebrate!None3DMark TimeSpy ExtremePort Royal (Ray Tracing)CyberpunkBlenderNVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti10,62414,163/66fps4K RT DLSS : 78fps7,247AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX12,96914,696/68fps4K FSR RT: 57fps2,899AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT11,68813,247/61fps4K FSRT RT: 50fps3,516NVIDIA RTX 408012,87917,780/82fps4K DLSS RT: 84fps9,310NVIDIA RTX 409016,46425,405/117.62 fps4K DLSS RT: 135fps12,335NVIDIA's DLSS 3 upscaling technology also proved to be incredibly useful once again. I reached a smooth 78fps in Cyberpunk 2077 while playing in 4K with graphics ray tracing settings set to high. And if you need even more frames, you can always bump down to 1440p with DLSS 3, where I managed to reach 90 fps. The 4070 Ti also blew away the Radeon RX 7900 XT and XTX in Blender's benchmark, though that may have been due to unoptimized drivers on AMD's part.If you've got a 1,440p monitor running at 120Hz or more, the 4070 Ti is clearly the more sensible purchase in NVIDIA's new family. Halo Infinite hit 165 fps while maxed out in that resolution, and I saw 130 fps in Control with graphics and ray tracing settings cranked up. And, it's worth noting, I didn't encounter any of the odd driver instability that crashed my system multiple times with the Radeon RX 7900 cards. The 4070 Ti was also twice as fast as both of those AMD GPUs in Control while using DLSS 3 and ray tracing in 1440p and 4K.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementThe ASUS TUF 4070 Ti I reviewed retails for $849, but I ran it at the same stock speeds as other $799 cards. The GPU reached 76C after hours of benchmarking and gaming \u2014 that's not as low as the 70C and below temperatures I was seeing on the 4080 and 4090, but those cards also had far more elaborate cooling.As impressed as I was by the 4070 Ti, every prospective GPU buyer should know that NVIDIA's 30-series GPUs are still great! And while they don't have DLSS 3, they still have excellent DLSS 2 upscaling. Best of all, they're falling in price now that another generation of cards have arrived. You can snag 3060s easily for less than $400, while I've seen 3070s falling below $600 regularly. I'm sure we'll see a 4060 card later this year, but if you're in a rush, don't look down on older hardware. Devindra Hardawar/EngadgetIf anything, the RTX 4070 Ti is awful news for AMD. The Radeon RX 4700 XT and XTX are both faster GPUs in many benchmarks, but once you start enabling ray tracing, they practically crumble. And worst of all, they're $100 and $200 more, respectively. Personally, I'd rather the power of DLSS and the stability of NVIDIA's hardware and software, over the raw speed of those AMD cards.While I miss the days of \u201creasonable\u201d video card prices under $500, the 4070 Ti still feels like a dose of sanity. Unless you\u2019re a high-level streamer or pro gamer, there\u2019s little reason to spend four figures on a video card. $799, though? That\u2019s doable. And if anything, it pushes the prices of other hardware down considerably. Even if you don\u2019t buy the 4070 Ti, we should all be thankful it exists.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

Intel\u2019s 4th Gen Intel Xeon scalable processors, the Intel Xeon CPU Max Series and the Intel Data Center GPU Max Series, were announced today. Intel says they deliver a significant leap in data center performance and efficiency, with enhanced security and new capabilities for artificial intelligence the cloud, the network and edge, and the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputers.\nThe new CPUs offer workload-first acceleration and highly optimized software tuned for specific workloads, enabling users to squeeze the right performance at the right power in order to optimize the total cost of ownership. In addition, the 4th Gen Xeon processors are said to deliver customers a range of features for managing power and performance, making the optimal use of CPU resources to help achieve their sustainability goals.\nOne of the key new capabilities of Intel\u2019s 4th Gen Intel Xeon scalable processors is their support for PCIe Gen 5, which is able to double the data transfer rates from CPU to GPU. These increased PCIe landes allow for a greater density of GPUs and high speed networking within each server. It also improves the performance of data-intensive workloads such as AI, while boosting network speeds to up to 400 gigabits per second per connection, meaning faster data transfer between servers and storage arrays.\nIntel\u2019s CPUs will be combined with eight Nvidia H100 GPUs in the new DGX systems, Nvidia said. The Nvidia H100 GPU is the most powerful chip the company has ever made, containing more than 80 billion transistors, making it an ideal companion for Intel\u2019s new chips. It boasts some unique features that make it ideal for high-performance computing workloads, including a built-in Transformer Engine and a highly scalable NVLink interconnect that enable it to power large artificial intelligence models, recommendation systems and more.\n\u201cModern AI workloads require a mix of computing platforms with both CPUs and GPUs,\u201d said Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. \u201cSo Nvidia clearly wants to partner with Intel and use its latest Xeon platform, it\u2019s most powerful yet. AI also depends on the speed at which data is processed, so it makes sense the new DGX appliance is using PCIe Gen5. Now it\u2019s all about the first customers and their use cases.\u201d\nPatrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said he was impressed with Nvidia\u2019s newest DGX systems, but he pointed out that they\u2019re not the first to support PCIe 5, as Advanced Micro Devices Inc.\u2019s latest processors also come with that feature. \u201cI don\u2019t think PCIe 5 is the deciding factor,\u201d he added. \u201cI think it will likely come down to lower pricing, as I am hearing that Intel is providing deep discounts these days.\u201d\nThe new Nvidia DGX H100 systems will be joined by more than 60 new servers featuring a combination of Nvdia\u2019s GPUs and Intel\u2019s CPUs, from companies including ASUSTek Computer Inc., Atos Inc., Cisco Systems Inc., Dell Technologies Inc., Fujitsu Ltd., GIGA-BYTE Technology Co. Ltd., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., Lenovo Group Ltd., Quanta Computer Inc. and Super Micro Computer Inc.\nThese forthcoming systems from Nvidia and others will leverage the latest GPU and CPU hardware to run workloads with 25 times the efficiency afforded by traditional, CPU-only servers, Nvidia said. They offer an \u201cincredible performance per watt\u201d that results in far less power consumption, it claims. Further, compared with the previous-generation Nvidia DGX systems, the latest hardware boosts the efficiency of AI training and inference workloads by 3.5-times, resulting in around three times lower costs of ownership.\nThe software powering Nvidia\u2019s new systems comes in handy too. The new DGX H100 systems all come with a free license for Nvidia Enterprise AI. That\u2019s a cloud-native suite of AI development tools and deployment software, providing users with a complete platform for their AI initiatives, Nvidia said.\nCustomers can alternatively buy multiple DGX H100 systems in the shape of the Nvidia DGX SuperPod platform, which is essentially a small supercomputing platform that provides up to one exaflop of AI performance, Nvidia said.\nPhoto: Nvidia\n\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content. \u00a0\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\n\n\n\u201cTheCUBE\u00a0is an important partner to the industry.

We\u2019re also deep diving on new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.\n3D and animation extraordinaire CG Geek completed an ambitious design challenge this week In the NVIDIA Studio \u2014 building a massive, sci-fi-inspired 3D world in only three days. The creation of the world, dubbed The Fullness of Time, was fast-tracked by his GeForce RTX 4090 GPU.\n\n72 Hours to Build a Sci-Fi World\nAnimator and visual effects artist CG Geek teaches aspiring artists how to get started on his popular YouTube channel. He also shares tutorials on Blender, his favorite 3D app because \u201cit\u2019s open source, and the community is always challenging one another to push limits even further,\u201d he said.\nTo see how far those limits could be pushed, CG Geek kicked off a timed design challenge last week as part of CES, putting together a fully rendered and animated project in only three days \u2014 powered by NVIDIA Studio technologies and his GeForce RTX 4090 GPU.\nThe artist polled his community on Instagram, Twitter and YouTube for a genre to use as a starting point for the project.\nSci-fi was the clear winner, so he envisioned what a far-future city skyline would look like. The first step was to populate the space with futuristic 3D buildings and skyscrapers.\nCG Geek formed simple shapes in Blender, scaling them to match the sizes of real-world buildings. He then added materials and reflections to create beautifully textured structures before adding geometry, or geo nodes, a recently added feature in Blender and a crucial aspect of 3D modeling.\nGeo nodes virtually eliminate procedural workflows. The traditional process of constructing objects follows a linear pattern, with one tool used after the next and each step only reversible by manual undo operations. Geo nodes allow for non-linear, non-destructive workflows and the instancing of objects to create incredibly detailed scenes using small amounts of data.\nSculpting of the 3D world is nearly complete.\nCG Geek scanned objects using his iPhone to create realistic 3D models from photos. He then used Adobe Photoshop to apply detailed textures, one of 30 GPU-accelerated features made possible by his GeForce RTX 4090 GPU. The RTX-accelerated Super Resolution feature, which uses AI to upscale images with higher quality, was especially useful for exporting textures across the entire piece, CG Geek said.\nCG Geek added fine details like ivy and realistic wear and tear to his sci-fi buildings until he reached the desired look.\nHis process used during the challenge is covered in a tutorial on building detailed, low-poly sci-fi buildings in a matter of minutes:\n\nCG Geek\u2019s RTX 4090 GPU enables him to use Blender Cycle\u2019s RTX-accelerated, AI-powered OptiX ray tracing in the viewport for interactive, photorealistic movement within such a detailed environment. This virtually eliminates wait times, allowing him to create at the speed of his imagination.\nCG Geek can play back the entire animation in real time without exporting, thanks to the power of the RTX 4090 GPU.\nThe artist quickly and easily applied realistic textures for the sand and water as well as animations. Final renders were delivered quickly with RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in Blender Cycles.\nIt took CG Geek just 21 hours to build the futuristic metropolis and 10 hours to render it at 4K resolution.\n\u201cCurrently, NVIDIA stands alone at the top of high-performance GPUs for 3D tasks like Blender,\u201d he said. \u201dFor real-time editing workflows, nothing comes close to beating the RTX 4090 GPU in speed.\u201d\n3D artist CG Geek.\nView more of CG Geek\u2019s work and tutorials.\nFive-to-Nine Hustle, Powered by NVIDIA Studio\nNine to five o\u2019clock is when people typically have a job, classes or other responsibilities.

But if you were, then PNY's XLR8 Verto is an MSRP version that delivers all the performance and efficiency of the Ada architecture without the extra fiscal demands of a needless factory overclocked card.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor\n\n\n\nGreat RTX 4080 performance\n\n\nFrame generation is magic\n\n\nCool and efficient\n\n\n\n\n\nAgainst\n\n\n\nEven at MSRP it's overpriced\n\n\nHUUUUUUUGE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPC Gamer's got your back\n\n\n\n\nOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you. Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware.\n\n\n\nEven by the portly standards of Nvidia's RTX 4080 Founders Edition, the PNY RTX 4080 XLR8 is a damned unit. He chomnk. He's also a supremely powerful graphics card capable of regularly outpacing the best of both Nvidia's last generation of GPUs, the RTX 3090 Ti, as well as AMD's latest RDNA 3 flagship chiplet card, the Radeon RX 7900 XTX.But seriously guys, $1,200? The current sky-high pricing of modern graphics cards has become endlessly fatiguing. No longer is it just the scalpers, scarcity, and crypto miners driving up pricing, it's being driven directly by the manufacturers themselves.I'm not laying the blame for that at PNY's door, however, it all stems from the MSRP Nvidia has slapped on the RTX 4080 from the outset. Thankfully this RTX 4080 XLR8 Verto card is at least sticking around at that original retail price and hasn't spiked.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5070 Ti review (MSI Ventus 3X)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5080 Founders Edition review\n\n\n\nThough it is worth noting were there serious demand for the RTX 4080, and every card was being sold the moment it hit the shelves, then you can bet retailers would be slapping higher sticker prices on them. Just take a look at the nominally competing RX 7900 XTX from AMD. That's a card with a $999 MSRP and yet there's no hope of finding one at that price right now\u2014$1,300 is the cheapest I've found the top Radeon card going for.RTX 4080 XLR8 Verto specs(Image credit: Future)GPU: Nvidia AD103\nCUDA cores: 9,728\nLithography: TSMC 4N\nBoost clock: 2,505MHz\nMemory: 16GB GDDR6X\nMemory speed: 22.4 Gbps\nTGP: 320W\nPrice: $1,199And the real-world pricing of the latest AMD card is supremely relevant when we're talking about the RTX 4080 in any guise. The RX 7900 XTX was meant to be AMD's riposte to Nvidia's second-tier GPU, with Dr. Su's gang knowing the RTX 4090 was out of its reach. And yet our testing finds the RTX 4080 and RX 7900 XTX trading blows, and the former coming with the might of DLSS 3 and the magical majesty of Frame Generation to bolster its banked potential performance.You can forgive the Radeon card in that situation if it remained $200 cheaper, as the two MSRPs originally laid it out. But right now, where it's at least $100 more than this PNY RTX 4080, why would you opt for the AMD card unless you really signed into all that brand tribalism?In base terms the RTX 4080 XLR8 Verto is a completely reference version of the Ada Lovelace GPU, sporting the AD103 chip running with a standard boost clock speed of 2,505MHz. Which, in relation to the previous generation of Ampere graphics silicon is a serious increase in GPU operating frequency. It's practically a whole 1GHz faster when you look at the real-world clock speeds, which are inevitably higher than Nvidia's rated numbers.I've gone into depth about the new Ada Lovelace GPU architecture in my RTX 4090 review, but essentially we're not a million miles away from a die shrunk Ampere design. The make up of the GPUs is mostly the same, but the TSMC 4N lithography allows for an efficient core that is able to be tuned to impressively high clock speeds. Alongside that you have a massively increased L2 cache component that's around ten times the level you'll find in the GA102 chips of the previous generation.(Image credit: Future)It's really this combination that gives the RTX 4080 its performance lead over Ampere when it comes to pure rasterised gaming performance.Aside from that, the RTX 4080 also gets 16GB of 22.4Gbps GDDR6X memory and a 320W TGP. That may still sound like a lot (and if you have any pretentions to green gaming credentials it absolutely will) but if you're talking about performance per watt, the card is actually one of the most efficient GPUs of modern times.4K gaming performanceImage 1 of 9(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)1440p gaming performanceImage 1 of 9(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)System performanceImage 1 of 4(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)In straight performance terms, the RTX 4080 is second only to the RTX 4090. But how does this PNY version stack up against the other third-party cards we've tested? It's cheaper, for one, where both the Zotac RTX 4080 Amp Extreme Airo and MSI RTX 4080 Suprim-X are significantly higher than the already prohibitive reference price. But it's also a little behind in performance terms to either of those overclocked cards.The PNY card is also a little behind the Founders Edition in some benchmarks, too, because its GPU isn't clocking as high as any of the other RTX 4080 cards we've tested. But, honestly, not in any way that would tangibly affect the gaming experience by comparison.\u00a0Such is the minimal difference factory overclocked cards make that you're only ever seeing a handful of frames per second in it between reference and OC GPUs.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)The benefits of factory overclocked cards are ephemeral, at best.Which means I just cannot get excited about such overpriced options when the starting price is so damned high. Maybe the MSI card looks prettier, with its shiny shroud, but I couldn't care less about that when I'm going to be spending my time looking at the game frames it's spitting out on my screen rather than gazing lovingly at it through my chassis' see-through side panel.\u00a0Ideally, I'd want the Founders Edition card. Despite the super chonk aesthetic I'm a fan of its brushed metal looks, and it's an MSRP card that punches above its weight against the factory OC crowd.\u00a0But, all that said, if you can't grab an RTX 4080 FE card (they are actually still available in both US and UK) then I would absolutely suggest picking a reference price card such as this PNY RTX 4080 XLR8 Verto. The benefits of factory overclocked cards are ephemeral, at best.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)But would I recommend the RTX 4080 at all? Personally I find it difficult to recommend such an expensive card when it's a) not the fastest GPU out there, b) isn't even just a cut-down version of the fastest GPU, and c) isn't even the the full version of its own second-tier GPU. Where the new RTX 4070 Ti has launched with a substantial delta in price compared to the drop in performance against the RTX 4080, that's more of a value proposition\u2014crazy as that might sound for an $800 card\u2014and if I'm hell bent on spending over a grand on a GPU then I'm holding out for an RTX 4090 with its genuine generational performance leap.Nvidia's going to need to cap the RTX 4080 at $999 for me to start recommending you buy one.PNY RTX 4080 XLR8 Verto: Price Comparison \u00a31,864.52ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by \n\n\n\nThe Verdict\n\n\n\n\n\n\n79\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead our review policy \n\n\nPNY RTX 4080 XLR8 Verto\n\nThe RTX 4080 is probably the best graphics card you shouldn't be spending your money on.

They have been making major strives with the service year after year and they are looking to take it one step further with what they are calling GeForce NOW Ultimate.\nUltimate will be taking the place of the RTX 3080 Members tier but bringing so much more behind it. For starters an auto upgrade to RTX 4080 servers (rolling out in Q1 2023). This brings along features such as streams up to 4K 120fps with DLSS3 and RTX ON and ultrawide support up to 3,840 x 1,600 resolution and 120fps.\n\nLuckily me and my fellow G Style member Mike were able to test out the Ultimate membership with its RTX 4080 SuperPODs before release to get a feel of what the public was getting. We each played different games, so our experiences are quite unique.\n\nJason:\n\n\n\nFor my testing I utilized games that I have on my Epic Game Store account which were \u201cControl\u201d, \u201cShadow of the Tomb Raider\u201d and \u201cFortnite\u201d to name a few. These games I tried on both my PC and via my TV(with a NVIDIA Shield TV attached). On my PC I would stream resolutions of 2560\u00d71440 based on my monitor via all three games I played. I would also get a consistent 60fps all through without much lag while hardwired via Ethernet. I was also able to toggle on options such as full ray tracing and DLSS.\nControl in QHD\nOn my TV I was getting 4K with 120fps (HDR on Fortnite and Tomb Raider) with those same titles. I would experience some drops during Shadow of the Tomb Raider from 4K to 1440 to 1080p at times when it got chaotic, but this is also utilizing a wireless connection as you have to maintain at least a 45Mbps connection. \nUsing a NVIDIA Shield TV that\u2019s running at 4K HDR 60fps wirelessly. \nUnfortunately, as I don\u2019t have a 240Hz monitor I was unable to test out the Reflex modes.\nI used the Ultimate Tier with a 300\u00d7300 Verizon Fios wired/wireless connection in New York City.\nMike:\nAs a PC gamer I have a particular preference for playing all of my games in the 1080p resolution. Why? It\u2019s simple consistency and overhead rules above all else for me so I\u2019ll take the hit in fidelity if it means I can play my games without hiccup.\u00a0\nWith the GeForce NOW Ultimate upgrade I didn\u2019t necessarily get ridiculous framerates but I did get a consistent experience with literally no frame drops or skips. This for me was a big deal because I don\u2019t have the greatest internet connection and I\u2019m doing this over WiFi.\u00a0I mostly played Destiny 2, Elden Ring, The Division 2, and Evil West. \nIt\u2019s also a plus for me because as of the moment an RTX 4080 isn\u2019t in my budget so to be able to use one and experience the capability even if it\u2019s only at 1080p is super important to me as an everyday PC gamer. While I may not be physically using a 4080 GPU, even the simulated experience is top tier quality.\u00a0\nI\u2019d be lying however if I didn\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t try to game in higher resolutions. I did. I\u2019ll say this, for anyone who can\u2019t get their hands on an RTX 4080 and you have a library of PC games at your disposal, this is an awesome investment if you wanna swing it. Just my opinion.\nI used the Ultimate Tier with a 300\u00d7300 Verizon Fios wireless connection in New York City.\n\nUltimate Tier Requirements:\nInternet connection speed of:\n\nat least 45Mbps for streaming up to 3840x2160p at 120fps.\nat least 35Mbps for 2560x1440p at 120 FPS for most iMacs or 2560x1600p at 120 FPS for most MacBooks.\nat least 35Mbps for 1920\u00d71080 at 240fps.\n\n240Hz monitor if you want to use Reflex\nAn account with games on either Epic Games, Ubisoft, or Steam\n\nNow it comes down to if $20/month for this service is worth it. This realistically depends on your gaming library and what titles can ultimately take full advantage of the service. If you don\u2019t have the strongest gaming rig or decidedly chokes on you at times, it maybe something to try out. Honestly gaming on it for a few hours I forgot I was even on a streaming service for the most part. \nThere is other services such as Xbox Game Pass Ultimate that has a multitude of titles and cost $14.99. But I don\u2019t think I have experienced the quality of streaming I have with them like with NVIDIA GeForce NOW Ultimate(so far). Also Stadia has just closed its doors completely leaving those users to venture elsewhere for streaming goodness. \nWith the Ultimate now rolling out to the public it will first tap into areas such as San Jose, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Frankfurt Germany with more cities to be posted in the upcoming weeks on its server map. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tYou May Also Like\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG Style Gaming\nGaming Hardware & Accessories\nReviews \n\n\n\n\n\nBenQ\u2019s EX381U Gaming Monitor [Review] \n\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen it comes to delivering a high-quality 4K gaming monitor, BenQ rarely\u2026\n\t\t\t\t\nChristian RiveraJanuary 21, 20253 minute read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG Style Gaming \n\n\n\n\n\nRoman Reigns Leads the Bloodline for WWE 2K25 \n\n\t\t\t\t\tAs WWE always says its Wrestlemania Season, now we can say its\u2026\n\t\t\t\t\nJason MillionJanuary 28, 20253 minute read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently On YouTubeTeam G Style \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlberto Lima\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI\u2019m a die-hard Brooklynite with the swagger and snark to match.

Wilson \u2022\nJan 8, 2023 at 12:16pm EST\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA is rumored to incorporate AI optimizations within its future graphics drivers which will release this year for enhanced GPU utilization amongst a list of things.\nNVIDIA Incorporating AI-Optimizations Within Its Graphics Drivers For Tensor Core 'RTX' GPUs\nArtificial intelligence, or AI, has become the popular buzzword for technological advancements, especially in discovering new scientific discoveries and medicines to software and PC components. It is very little surprising that PC\u00a0 components could lay the groundwork for more involvement in graphics, namely with NVIDIA's Game Ready Drivers. Please remember that this article is strictly a rumor and that no claims have been confirmed through NVIDIA.\nThe NVIDIA Game Ready Drivers library has helped enhance performance and quality in hundreds of next-gen games and even some older titles (Quake RTX and Portal RTX), which has shown that NVIDIA is backing its claims made last year about their direction with artificial intelligence. In this aspect, AI could help with performance and other related instructions and tasks, allowing games to run more smoothly with less graphical interference, take some if not all of the load off the CPU, and process that information better or more.\nWork it harder, make it better. Do it faster, makes us stronger. More than ever, hour after hour, Work is never over.\n\u2014 Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger by Daft Punk\nCapFrameX tweeted this morning about upcoming drivers that would launch this year, possibly sooner than expected, that would optimize the NVIDIA Game Ready Drivers with AI enhancements. Note that the Twitter leaker has posted this as a rumor and should be handled as a future possibility. Whether these enhancements will come through a separate suite or be added within the current RTX technologies such as DLSS which rely heavily on AI Tensor cores remains to be seen. NVIDIA did promise that they will be adding a range of improvements and deliver a major update to DLSS by the end of this quarter.\n\n[Rumor] Nvidia is working on AI optimized drivers. Release maybe this year (Q1). \n\u25b6\ufe0f Up to 30% more performance\u25b6\ufe0f Average improvement ~10%\u25b6\ufe0f No info about specific gen\nTake this with a grain of salt. If true Nvidia drivers will be real \"fine wine\". pic.twitter.com/QGTUL9iK7N\n\u2014 CapFrameX (@CapFrameX) January 8, 2023\n\nAMD is also working to begin taking assistance from AI in its upcoming FSR 3 technology while their recent Ryzen 7040 'Phoenix' APUs leverage Xilinx-based AI technology for faster ML and DNN capabilities. This new driver advancement would utilize the AMD Radeon Super Resolution, which enhances specific latency enhancements and upscaling through the entire system, not just having the overhead specified to one section of the computer.\nNVIDIA has been at the forefront of AI innovation with the advent of its tensor core design and these cores are likely to play a crucial role if this news is indeed true. Again, since this is highly speculative, it is unknown how any of this would work and what hardware is needed.\nNews Sources: CapFrameX, Daft Punk\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n122\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n33\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n33\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve Rumored To Launch SteamOS For Desktop PCs Soon; Is Time For A Bloatware-Free OS Near?\n\n\n\n31\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\n\n\n783\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The combination of Intel's CPUs, working in tandem with Nvidia's Tensor Core GPUs, delivers higher performance as well as more computation and problem solving per watt than its predecessors.\nThe Nvidia and Intel chips will be housed in Nvidia's DGX H100 servers as well as in 60 other servers that contain H100 GPUs sold by Nvidia's business partners.\nWhat inspired the collaboration is the widespread adoption of AI across major markets the past few years, along with the growing complexity of neural networks, Nvidia said. Enterprises have had to acquire more compute power to drive AI-powered workloads more efficiently. These workloads have also placed significantly higher demands on electricity.\nSome were surprised by two tooth-and-nail competitors entering into a co-opetition agreement, although one analyst believes the deal will benefit both.\n\"This is an interesting dynamic here,\" said Jack Gold, an analyst with J. Gold Associates. \"On one hand, Intel and Nvidia are fierce competitors. But on the other hand, Nvidia really needs Intel's high-end CPU that can really drive [Nvidia's] GPUs.\"\nNvidia is working on its own arm-based CPU. But that chip does that compete with Intel's Scalable Xeon Processor, he said.\n\n\n\n   Probably the single largest cost for data centers these days is energy. Even if you save a data center 10%, you are talking real money.\n  \n\nJack GoldAnalyst, J. Gold Associates\n  \n\n\n\nIn the perpetual game of performance leapfrog, the Nvidia-Intel collaboration figures to put some distance between the two companies and rival AMD's current offerings, Gold added.\nAnother analyst echoed that sentiment, saying working cooperatively to improve the performance of systems driving a key technology like AI is the preferred way to go.\n\"It's encouraging to see competitors like Intel and NVIDIA collaborating to improve such vital technology, especially when it drives powerful and efficient\u00a0outcomes that help lower carbon footprints created by datacenters,\" said Dan Newman, an analyst with Futurum Research. \"This is going to remain a central challenge for corporate users for the foreseeable future.\"\nAnother reason the cooperative effort is good for each party \u2013 and, more importantly, their users -- is the resulting energy cost savings.\n\"Probably the single largest cost for data centers these days is energy,\" Gold said. \"Even if you save a data center 10%, you are talking real money.\"\nThe upcoming systems will run typical enterprise workloads on average about 25 times more efficiently than more traditional CPU-only data center-class servers, according to Nvidia. It uses available power to data centers more efficiently, while processing workloads faster.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nExplaining the need for added compute power and energy savings, Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO, said data center energy consumption is growing at a rate that is no longer sustainable.\n\"To change this trajectory, we must accelerate every application possible,\" Huang said in a video blog. \"Just one [of the upcoming servers] can reduce the processing time, energy and cost by X factors.\"\nCompared to the previous generation of Nvidia servers, the new systems can speed up training and inference to raise energy efficiency. The added performance could lower the total cost of ownership by a factor of 3X, the company claims.\nContained in the 4th new Intel Xeon chips is support for PCIe Gen 5, capable of doubling the data transfer rates from the CPU to Nvidia's GPUs. The increased number of PCIe lanes in the chip provide greater density of GPUs along with high-speed networking within each server.\nThe Intel chip also has faster bandwidth improving the performance of data-intensive workloads, including AI-based workloads, along with network speeds up to 400 gigabits per second.\nAs Editor At Large with TechTarget's News Group, Ed Scannell is responsible for writing and reporting breaking news, news analysis and features focused on technology issues and trends affecting corporate IT professionals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRelated Resources\n\n\nDeepSeek Deep Dive: Uncovering the Opportunities and Risks\n\u2013Talk\n\n\nAI-powered audit, risk, and compliance: Keys to implementing the latest ...\n\u2013Replay\n\n\nAI-powered devices: The cornerstone of tomorrow\u2019s digital workspace\n\u2013Replay\n\n\nSecurity Risks to Consider with AI Integration: AI in DevOps\n\u2013Replay\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDig Deeper on AI technologies\n\n\n\nWhat is Nvidia?\n\n\n\n\nBy: Gavin\u00a0Wright\n\n\n\n\n10 top AI hardware and chip-making companies in 2025\n\n\n\n\nBy: Devin\u00a0Partida\n\n\n\n\nNvidia Blackwell GPU production ramps up amid revenue surge\n\n\n\n\nBy: Antone\u00a0Gonsalves\n\n\n\n\nNvidia drives forward accelerated computing advantage\n\n\n\n\nBy: Cliff\u00a0Saran\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored News\n\n\nHow AI and the Data Center Streamlines Business Processes\n\u2013HPE & Intel\n\n\nFlexible IT: When Performance and Security Can\u2019t Be Compromised\n\u2013Dell Technologies\n\n\n3 Transformative VDI Use Cases for Hybrid Work\n\u2013Dell Technologies\n\nSee More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRelated Content\n\n\nNvidia beefs up its line of AI supercomputers, chips\n\u2013 Search Data Center\n\n\nGoogle touts AI supercomputer; Nvidia tops MLPerf 3.0...\n\u2013 Search Enterprise AI\n\n\nInterview: Michael Kagan, chief technology officer, ...\n\u2013 ComputerWeekly.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest TechTarget resources\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness Analytics\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCIO\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Management\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tERP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch Business Analytics\n\n\n\n\nData preparation in machine learning: 4 key steps\nData preparation for ML is key to accurate model results.

It\u2019s only natural that the newest, most powerful two options from Team Green pique the interests of gamers across the realm.\u00a0\nSure, the GeForce RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 share the same Ada Lovelace DNA, DLSS 3, and even the chunky cooler size. If we dig deeper, however, the two GPUs are more different than you might think. \n\n\nWe\u2019ll go over what you need to know if you\u2019re comparing these graphical powerhouses, including price, availability, and performance. Whichever route you take, we\u2019re sure you\u2019re going to be seeing some of the highest (and prettiest!) frames ever.\nNvidia RTX 4090 vs. RTX 4080: Price and availability\n\n\n\n\nThe big and beautiful RTX 4090.\nThiago Trevisan\nWhile the GeForce RTX 4090\u2019s MSRP of $1,599 is $400 more than the $1,199 RTX 4080 on paper, the real world tells us a different story. Here\u2019s the kicker: GPU availability is much improved in 2022, but it\u2019s still a serious issue for the RTX 4090.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe RTX 4090 has been perpetually sold out since its launch, a familiar scenario to anyone who tried to buy a GPU in 2021. Thus, its street price is often higher on the secondary market. It\u2019s the most expensive GPU out now, but it also sold out the fastest\u2014Nvidia has its cake and is eating it too!\u00a0\nThe RTX 4080, on the other hand, has been shipped in less volume, but it\u2019s more available, ironically. This is because it presents tremendously poor value for the performance you\u2019re getting, as PCWorld executive editor Brad Chacos pointed out in his GeForce RTX 4080 summary. (Nvidia asking for $500 over the RTX 3080\u2019s MSRP is a bit much to stomach!)\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThus, the RTX 4090 loses on availability specifically because it wins out on price-to-performance. Yes, even at $1,599. That\u2019s the weird 2022 GPU universe we\u2019ve landed in! To be fair, it does pack a serious punch that no other GPU can top currently, by a wide margin.\nNvidia RTX 4090 vs. RTX 4080: Performance\nThe GeForce RTX 4090 is brutally, futuristically powerful. Ray tracing, content creation, whatever you throw at it\u2014it chews up. No-compromises high refresh-rate 4K gaming allows it to put us truly on the next plane of performance.\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s a tough act to follow, and the RTX 4080 has an uphill battle. Starting with its 16GB of VRAM versus the 4090\u2019s 24GB of VRAM, the specs tell a lot of the story. In practice, most gamers will do just fine with 16GB of VRAM, especially since it\u2019s still the very fast GDDR6X variety like the RTX 4090 has. Content creators, though, could make better use of 24GB of VRAM, with one\u2019s use case being the determining factor when it comes to memory capacity.\n\n\n\n\nCombined FPS at 4K/Ultra for Nvidia GPUs.Brad Chacos\nThe synopsis presented in Brad Chacos\u2019s review of the RTX 4080 shows how big of an averaged-out lead the RTX 4090 has in 4K rasterized performance. Now all the \u201cPrice to Performance\u201d talk starts to make sense in favor of the RTX 4090!\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos\nLet\u2019s look at some specific examples, starting with the newest Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. The RTX 4090 has a significant lead at all resolutions, even 4K\u2014by a whopping 34fps! If you\u2019re gaming on a 4K 144Hz monitor, the RTX 4090 will come closest to taking advantage of it. Truth be told, however, 98fps on the RTX 4080 is still impressive and you\u2019re not likely to notice the difference in most practical situations.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos\nLooking at Gears Tactics, we find a potential problem with the RTX 4090: CPU bottlenecks. Past GPUs, even high-end ones, only used to encounter significant CPU bottlenecking issues at 1080p resolution, and rarely at 1440p. Here, we see the RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 with similar 1440p frame rates due to the CPU\u2019s raw might becoming an issue. While 4K typically focuses heavily on GPU only, the RTX 4090 pushes so hard that the CPU can become a problem!\u00a0In Gears, while the 4090 breezes past the 4080, we found it CPU-bound seven percent of the time even at lofty 4K resolution.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s one to do? Well, if you\u2019re opting for the RTX 4090, you should be playing at 4K or at least very high-refresh 1440p at a minimum. If the latter, you\u2019ll need a top-of-the-line, ultra-fast gaming CPU like the Intel Core i9-13900K, AMD Ryzen 9 7950X, or Ryzen 7 5800X3D to circumvent potential performance bottlenecks. The GeForce RTX 4080 can still have these issues in some cases at 1440p, but they\u2019re much less noticeable.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos\nOne of the biggest draws to RTX 40-series performance will be in Nvidia\u2019s DLSS flavors, primarily DLSS 3 and its killer Frame Generation feature. While not every game supports this, the ones that do, such as Flight Simulator 2020, have great uplifts in performance. The RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 both have very powerful hardware built in to do this, but the RTX 4090 has a big spec advantage that gives it the outright lead when pushed hard.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhy is DLSS important? Ray tracing is a big reason\u2014which traditionally gives GPUs a performance penalty. With DLSS, you can have both awesome visuals and higher frames. (The stuff dreams are made of!)\u00a0\nLooking at Cyberpunk 2077, we can go from 42.3 frames at 4K with ray tracing, to a whopping 83.9 with DLSS on the RTX 4090\u2014and that\u2019s not even with DLSS 3 Frame Gen on, which sent performance skyrocketing to 138fps in our testing. The RTX 4080 brings its 29.1fps to 47.9fps. Sure, it\u2019s under 60fps, but it\u2019s still playable compared to under 30fps without DLSS. (It\u2019s worth noting our tests also set ray tracing settings to ultra, and reducing those to High can improve performance greatly.)\u00a0\n\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that here the RTX 4090 is very far ahead with ray tracing over the RTX 4080, partly thanks to its hardware advantage. 83fps compared to 47fps is a big difference that you can certainly feel, putting the RTX 4090 truly in a class of its own.\n\n\n\n\nRTX 4090 vs. 4080 scores in the PugentBench Resolve bechmark test.Adam Taylor\nIn content creation both the RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 prove to be very powerful. There may be a slightly different \u201cprice-to-performance\u201d mindset if you\u2019re a content creator, since the RTX 4080 can be excellent even when compared to the RTX 4090 depending on your use case. In gaming, however, the RTX 4090 still takes the cake by a much wider margin\u2014especially if you need its blazing-fast 24GB of GDDR6X memory for high-resolution video exports.\n\nNvidia RTX 4090 vs. RTX 4080: Power and other things to know\nWhen you think of power-efficient GPUs, the last thing that pops into your mind is a four-slot RTX 4090, right? Well, what if I told you it has the same 450W TDP as the RTX 3090 Ti, but with oodles more performance? Likewise, the RTX 4080 has a TDP of 320W but is considerably more powerful than its predecessors. More performance, same power. If that\u2019s not efficiency, I don\u2019t know what is!\u00a0\nOf course, we need to mention the RTX 4090 12VHPWR adapter and its well-publicized melt down issues. To sum it up, don\u2019t worry about it. There was a very low incidence rate, and the cause came down to mostly user error in connecting the adapter. (Make sure you push it all the way in!) There are other things to keep in mind, such as not bending the cable too much\u2014which can be a problem on the very thick RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 in many PC cases. Since they often share similar coolers, they\u2019re about the same in terms of case requirements, too.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThiago Trevisan\nThe good thing about these oversized monsters is that both typically have excellent thermals due to the coolers, and quiet operation. Coil whine can still be an issue on both GPUS, however, if you\u2019re unlucky.\u00a0\nNvidia RTX 4090 vs RTX 4080: The verdict\nIn the end, it\u2019s hard to say, \u201cJust get the $1,599 GPU!\u201d like it\u2019s a casual decision. We can talk about how and why we got here\u2014but it\u2019s the reality of the situation.\nIf you have a big GPU budget that can cover a GeForce RTX 4090, and if you can find one, it\u2019s the obvious choice. The performance is simply unmatched. It will open up new gaming experiences for you that have never before been possible. 4K 144Hz? Ray tracing? We\u2019re here!\nThe RTX 4080, price aside, is not a bad GPU. It has great performance,\u00a0thermals, and next-gen DLSS 3 with the second-best ray tracing performance. Not too shabby. It\u2019s also not particularly power hungry either. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t put \u201cprice aside\u201d permanently, and its wildly expensive for what you\u2019re getting as far as gaming goes. Content creators may find the RTX 4080 fits them well on their use case, however, so their \u201cmath\u201d may be slightly more positive than for just gaming purposes. For gaming, the RTX 4090 is it, though!\u00a0\n\n\nThe RTX 4080\u2019s atrocious price makes the RTX 4090 truly seem like a much better option, with the least compromises.

It is of course the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti, which was announced yesterday. We received an ASUS card in advance, and can share performance numbers with you today.\nNVIDIA has given the new GPU a $799 MSRP, and it fits into the product lineup just where the \u201cunlaunched\u201d RTX 4080 12GB would have been. This $799 MSRP is $100 less than the product it replaces, as the RTX 4080 12GB had been announced at $899.\nLet\u2019s get on with the review.\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\nSpecifications\nHere\u2019s a look at the current RTX 40 Series family \u2013 plus the RTX 3090 Ti that this new GPU apparently outperforms:\n \n\n\n\n\nRTX 4090\nRTX 4080\nRTX 4070 Ti\nRTX 3090 Ti\n\n\nGPU\nAD102\nAD103\nAD104\nGA102\n\n\nArchitecture\nAda Lovelace\nAda Lovelace\nAda Lovelace\nAmpere\n\n\nSMs\n128\n76\n60\n84\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n16384\n9728\n7680\n10752\n\n\nTensor Cores\n512 (4th Gen)\n304 (4th Gen)\n240 (4th Gen)\n336 (3rd Gen)\n\n\nRT Cores\n128 (3rd Gen)\n76 (3rd Gen)\n60 (3rd Gen)\n84 (2nd Gen)\n\n\nBase Clock\n2235 MHz\n2205 MHz\n2310 MHz\n1670 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock\n2520 MHz\n2505 MHz\n2610 MHz\n1860 MHz\n\n\nTexture Units\n512\n304\n240\n336\n\n\nROPs\n176\n112\n80\n112\n\n\nMemory\n24GB GDDR6X\n16GB GDDR6X\n12GB GDDR6X\n24GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Data Rate\n21 Gbps\n22.4 Gbps\n21 Gbps\n21 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Interface\n384-bit\n256-bit\n192-bit\n384-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n1 TB/s\n716 GB/s\n504 GB/s\n716 GB/s\n\n\nTransistor Count\n76.3B\n45.9B\n35.8B\n28.3B\n\n\nDie Size\n608 mm^2\n379 mm^2\n295 mm^2\n628 mm^2\n\n\nProcess Tech\nTSMC 4N NV Custom\nTSMC 4N NV Custom\nTSMC 4N NV Custom\nSamsung 8nm NV Custom\n\n\nTGP\n450W\n320W\n285W\n450W\n\n\nLaunch Price\n$1599\n$1199\n$799\n$1999\n\n\n\n \nThe RTX 4070 Ti offers 7680 CUDA Cores, with 240 TUs and 80 ROPs. The TU and ROP count are repeated in the ray tracing hardware, as there are 240 (4th Gen) Tensor Cores and 80 (3rd Gen) RT cores.\nReally, memory bandwidth should be the only thing holding this card back, as it offers just a 192-bit interface \u2013 though the memory is 21 Gbps GDDR6X. Thus, the 12GB of video memory offers up to 504 GB/s in total bandwidth. Helping matters is the large L2 cache, which is ~48MB with this GPU.\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\nThe ASUS TUF Gaming Card\nASUS introduced GeForce RTX 4070 Ti models from both their Strix and TUF Gaming lineups yesterday, with our TUF Gaming sample offering a slightly more case-friendly design of the two given its shorter length.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile shorter than the new Strix design (336 mm), the card is still 305 mm / 12 inches in length, so you will need to check your enclosure\u2019s GPU clearance. This is a 3.25 slot, triple-fan cooler design, featuring ASUS\u2019s new 11-blade Axial-Tech fans. \nVia ASUS:\n\nThe unibody die-cast shroud shares the same structural strength as our TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 4080 and 4090 cards, while a wide vent on the backplate improves airflow compared to previous generation models. The TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti also offers the same Dual BIOS switch and a redesigned ARGB TUF logo along the shroud for a touch of flair, alongside the military-grade capacitors and Auto-Extreme manufacturing quality all TUF cards are known for. If you want a durable card that\u2019ll prove its worth time and time again, the TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti stands firm in its commitment to long-lasting gaming performance.\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPerformance Testing\nI have fired up the AMD X670E platform once again, powered by a Ryzen 9 7950X processor and 32GB of DDR5-6000 CL30 memory. As always, each benchmark result on the charts is the average of three identical runs.\n \n\n\n\nPC Perspective GPU Test Platform\n\n\nProcessor\nAMD Ryzen 9 7950X (Stock)\n\n\nMotherboard\nMSI MEG X670E ACEBIOS v1.25 BetaAGESA ComboPI 1.0.0.3 Patch AResizable BAR Enabled\n\n\nMemory\n32GB (16GBx2) G.Skill Trident Z NEO DDR5-6000 CL30\n\n\nStorage\nSK Hynix Platinum P41 2TB NVMe SSD\n\n\nPower Supply\nbe quiet!

If we stopped here, it would be obvious by NVIDIA is offering this GPU with an MSRP which is currently $100 lower than AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 7900 XT. Will this result hold up? Well, let\u2019s see what happens when we move up to DirectX 12 Ultimate:\n \n\n\n\n\nThe performance story between the RX 7900 XT and the RTX 4070 Ti is going to completely depend on the presence of DXR. And this isn\u2019t limited to synthetic tests.\n \n3440\u00d71440 Ultrawide Game Benchmarks\nFirst, let\u2019s look at results from Metro Exodus \u2013 the original version (no ray tracing is enabled):\n \n\n\nA victory for the Radeon RX 7900 XT here, with an average 3 FPS advantage over the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti in this test. Comparing the 4070 Ti to other NVIDIA cards, we find that it is almost identical in performance to our RTX 3090 \u2013 though it is a factory-overclocked MSI SUPRIM model. It is possible that the 4070 Ti is equal to the 3090 Ti as NVIDIA indicated, but this will probably be title-dependent.\nAnd now we look at the Enhanced Edition of Metro Exodus, at the same resolution/preset:\n \n\n\nSure enough, in Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition the RTX 4070 Ti leapfrogs up the chart to lead the RX 7900 XT, and is very much at the \u201cfaster than a 3090 Ti\u201d performance level here. Or at least I assume so, as I have to estimate this relative to the performance of our RTX 3090 SUPRIM X, as we were not sampled a GeForce RTX 3090 Ti.\nNext we will look at results from a very AMD-friendly title, DiRT 5. This is my best-case test for the Radeon RX 7900 Series, and obviously they have an excellent showing here:\n \n\n\nIn DiRT 5 the Radeon RX 7900 XT was 12% faster than the RTX 4070 Ti (and the RX 7900 XTX is roughtly 4% faster than the RTX 4080). Not a massive victory, but another example of AMD\u2019s advantage in a primarily raster-based title (there are RT shadows, for whatever that\u2019s worth).\nSticking with racing games, let\u2019s check out F1 22. This time the settings will favor NVIDIA, as this has quite a few ray traced effects enabled at its highest detail level:\n \n\n\nI expected the RTX 4070 Ti to out-perform the RX 7900 XT in this test, but it didn\u2019t manage to match the performance of the RTX 3090 SUPRIM X this time.\nFor a final look at a raster-based game benchmark, here\u2019s Cyberpunk 2077, version 1.61, at its Ultra preset with no RT or resolution scaling:\n \n\n\nThis is a solid victory for AMD \u2013 until you look at 1% lows. Not every outlet reports this issue with this particular title from these Radeon cards, but not every outlet re-tested all of their Radeon cards on version 1.61 of this game on an X670E platform running this version of Windows (etc. etc.). Take this for what you will, but I re-tested the heck out of this game and these are the results.\nAnyhow, here\u2019s how things look for the RTX 4070 Ti in a dedicated RTX benchmark:\n \n\n\nWe are back into that faster-than-a-3090-but-maybe-not-a-3090Ti territory with this test, but I\u2019m assuming it would be tied with the Ti at best here. This benchmark uses the older DLSS 2.0, however, and I have access to the latest version of this game which supports DLSS 3.0.\nI performed some initial testing to see how the game runs on this new GPU, first using TAA and then with DLSS 3.0 + Frame Generation. Now, FG is not a topic that seems to endear people to NVIDIA, but it did raise my average FPS in this game up to very high levels \u2013 while incurring a modest latency penalty:\n \n\n\nUp to this point I have ignored the marketing claim NVIDIA made during their announcement, that this RTX 4070 Ti could be up to 3x the speed of the RTX 3090 Ti. That is clearly factoring in the 40 Series exclusive DLSS 3.0 Frame Generation, and as you can see from the above result it was possible to get well over 2x the framerate in this game by enabling it (NVIDIA cited 3x perf with Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s \u201cRT Overdrive\u201d mode in their chart).\nI will have to re-visit Bright Memory Infinite with the rest of the RTX family in the future, as I was able to come up with a repeatable in-game run that yielded similar enough results to mostly satisfy my obsessive need for precision benchmarking.\n \nPower Draw\nContrary to some rumors, the RTX 4070 Ti is only a 285W TGP GPU. When comparing the direct power measurements we find that this card is very well behaved, and consumes considerably less power than the RX 7900 XT. The chart below shows logging during a run of 3DMark Speed Way:\n \n\n\nPower was generally below NVIDIA\u2019s rated TGP of 285 watts for this GPU, though our ASUS sample did spike slightly above this, but only hit a max of 294 watts. The AMD reference RX 7900 XT draws quite a bit more; even if we ignore the single spike up to 389W it still hit 340 \u2013 350 watts for much of the test, with spikes up to 360 watts.\nAda continues to be an impressively efficient architecture, so you can safely ignore the hype about power draw this generation. Sure, the RTX 4090 is a 450W card, but the R9 295\u00d72 was a 500W card a decade ago. I think it\u2019s time to find a new narrative.\n \n \n \n\n\nPricing \u2013 Let\u2019s Stop Complaining About It\nWhile it ended up being $100 lower than we anticipated, the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti\u2019s $799 price will still anger a lot of people. We have a xx70 card with a higher price tag than the last-gen xx80 card, and it doesn\u2019t matter what the performance is (apparently); people will still be outraged by this.\nI could theorize that once an RTX 4060/4060 Ti cards is available (in what I hope will be the under-$500 segment), we may finally see the RTX 30 Series put to bed \u2013 and with it the price pressure on these higher-performing new parts. Having a $699+ RTX 3080 does not help, but if the market votes against the status quo then who knows what might happen with pricing.\nI am, however, growing increasingly tired of the current-gen pricing complaints. AMD was selling their flagship Radeon RX 5700 XT for just $399 a few years ago, and the GTX 1080 Ti was $699. I remember those days, too. However, I don\u2019t think prices are coming down any time soon, unless Intel\u2019s next GPU kicks major ass or AMD decides to start a price war.\nMaybe, just maybe, we can accept that high-end GPUs are expensive niche products right now (as they once were), and the era of $699 flagships is over. Things cost more than they used to now, as I keep learning every time I go shopping for anything. If expensive computer add-in boards don\u2019t sell then decisions will have to be made about their price, and the economic viability of continuing to produce them.\nEnough about pricing. It\u2019s annoying to pay more for things. Every single thing at the hardware store is double what I last paid for it whenever I need to fix something around the house. No one wants to hear me complain about the cost of PVC pipe or electrical wire, but I have started to accept that the buying power of a dollar is about half of what it used to be. \n \n \n \n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIf you haven\u2019t stopped reading in outrage over my refusal to join the angry pricing mob, welcome! Readers will vote with their wallets, and if you think NVIDIA \u2013 or AMD \u2013 is charging too much for this level of performance this generation, then don\u2019t buy one of those products.\nLooking only at the current competitive landscape, this card is closest in performance to AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 7900 XT. Our reference RX 7900 XT offers higher traditional raster performance, but If you play games that use real-time ray tracing, the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti is generally faster (and I\u2019m not talking about when DLSS or any other resolution scaling in effect). AMD\u2019s card is \u2013 currently \u2013 $100 more, which makes this choice a lot easier.\nSimply put, NVIDIA is offering a better overall product at $799 than AMD is currently offering at $899, once ray tracing is factored in. And if you don\u2019t care about ray tracing, NVIDIA is still competing on value. The $799 MSRP was a smart move, and will probably nudge AMD into lowering the 7900 XT\u2019s price (to the level they probably intended all along, #jebaited).\n \n\n\nThe ASUS TUF card we tested performs well, and is very cool and quiet thanks to the large cooler design\nThe exact ASUS TUF card we reviewed is model TUF-RTX4070TI-12G-GAMING, and it carries a $50 premium over the baseline $799 MSRP, retailing at $849.99 USD. So does this slim $50 disparity change the comparison with a RX 7900 XT at $899? Slightly. But after testing both I would still take the ASUS TUF card over a reference RX 7900 XT, unless AMD lowers their price.\nBottom line, NVIDIA\u2019s RTX 4070 Ti is a compelling alternative to AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 7900 XT, with faster performance in DXR titles even without DLSS. If you still don\u2019t care about real-time ray tracing, the Radeon card provides higher performance in games without RT, but costs more and draws quite a bit more power.\n \n \n \n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nReview Disclosures\n\n\n\n\nThis is what we consider the responsible disclosure of our review policies and procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Product Was Obtained\nThe product was provided by NVIDIA for the purpose of this review.\n\n\nWhat Happens To Product After Review\nThe product remains the property of NVIDIA but is on extended loan for future testing and product comparisons.\n\n\nCompany Involvement\nNVIDIA had no control over the content of the review and was not consulted prior to publication.\n\n\nPC Perspective Compensation\nNeither PC Perspective nor any of its staff were paid or compensated in any way by NVIDIA for this review.\n\n\nAdvertising Disclosure\nNVIDIA has not purchased advertising at PC Perspective during the past twelve months.\n\n\nAffiliate Links\nIf this article contains affiliate links to online retailers, PC Perspective may receive compensation for purchases through those links.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVideo News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviousPhison First, The PS5026-E26 PCIe 5.0 SSD \n\nNextCES 2023: Intel Adds Non-K CPUs to 13th Gen Core Desktop Family \n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\n\n\n \n\nSebastian Peak\nEditor-in-Chief at PC Perspective.

CPUs and GPUs continue to get more powerful, solid state storage gets faster and cheaper, but innovation and design have kinda stagnated over the past several years.  Things have just become more power hungry and difficult to cool.  The price of hardware (fair or unfair) dosn\u2019t help anything but I think its time the industry throws off the shackles of ATX takes some steps revision what a enthusiast PC looks like.\nReply  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\nBigTed \n\t\t\t\t\ton January 4, 2023 at 8:47 pm\t\t\t\t\n \n\n\nMeh, the world is messed up and talking about prices is getting boring.

Yes, benchmark it and compare it to its peers on its merit.  But talking about the actual value proposition is still important.\nA 70 class card with 60 class memory specs and > 80 class pricing is a weird combination, and a problem.\nAnd yes, everything costs more, but the price increases of these cards compared to what the MSRP was supposed to be in the previous generation is still much higher than the actual rate of inflation.\nIf the 4080\u2019s price was calculated by taking the 3080\u2019s $700 MSRP and adjusting for inflation, you arrive somewhere around $850-$900.  Not $1200.  I can understand needing to account for inflation.  Not an additional 20% on top of inflation.\nReply  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\npsuedonymous \n\t\t\t\t\ton January 5, 2023 at 1:16 pm\t\t\t\t\n \n\n\nJudging cards by an arbitrary \u2018class\u2019 is frankly ludicrous.

These GPUs are designed to offer discrete graphics capabilities on laptops where there is demand for such tasks. A discrete GPU definitely helps with its extra display and encoding/decoding capabilities that integrated GPUs lacked however since 2020 that has changed.\nRelated Story Watch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For UnveilingCurrent-day integrated GPUs from Intel and AMD are more than capable of advanced features and more. Intel's Xe architecture and AMD's RDNA integrated GPUs have shown that integrated GPUs are here to stay and can deliver some impressive performance results. AMD's RDNA 2 on existing Ryzen 6000 CPUs and RDNA 3 on the upcoming Ryzen 7000 mobility CPUs are going to offer a big boost in integrated graphics performance while Intel's tGPU (Tile-GPU) design will be pushing its own integrated graphics performance and efficiency to new heights.\n\nOver the past few years, we have seen that NVIDIA's GeForce MX series lineup, while offering good gen-to-gen increases, has not been a popular choice for an entry or mainstream consumers. The main issue stems from the fact that a discrete GPU will always require extra power and that extra power will mean lower battery timings than what could now be achieved with a more efficient chip that's already featured on the CPU. That's not all, integrated GPUs (iGPUs) are also becoming far more powerful than ever.\n\nIt is reported by ITHome that the upcoming Radeon 780M which will feature the RDNA 3 graphics architecture and featured on the Ryzen 7040 'Phoenix' CPUs, will easily outperform the MX570 by NVIDIA. That's a pretty big leap and we expect the performance of the Phoenix APU might end up close to the RTX 2060 or even exceed that. We have previous reports where we expect that these integrated GPUs might end up as fast as some of the most popular discrete mobility GPUs as we reported here.\n\n\nFP32 Compute Horsepower Comparisons (Higher is Better)\n\nFP32 TFLOPs\n\n\n024681012\n\n\n\n\n\n024681012\n\n\n\n\n\nSony PS5\n\n10\n\n\nRadeon 780M\n\n8\n\n\nRadeon RX 6500 XT\n\n5\n\n\nGeForce MX570\n\n4\n\n\nSony PS4 Pro\n\n4\n\n\nXbox Series S\n\n4\n\n\nRadeon 680M\n\n4\n\n\nRadeon RX 6400\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should be remembered that the three most popular GPUs on Steam's Hardware Survey are the GeForce GTX 1650, GTX 1060, and the RTX 2060 and if users are getting better performance than those on an integrated GPU, then why would there be a need for a discrete GPU?\n\n\n\nWould you prefer a modern day:\n\n\n Laptop with integrated GPU\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Laptop with entry-level discrete GPU\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews Source: Videocardz\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n232\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n113\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n105\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n59\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n54\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1151\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

And after testing out some of the service\u2019s improved capabilities, the addition of expanded support for high refresh rates and ultrawide resolutions is really turning GeForce Now into a truly high-end cloud gaming app.For those that missed the initial announcement back at CES, GeForce Now\u2019s recently renamed Ultimate plan (formerly the RTX 3080 tier) is getting a number of new features including support for refresh rates of up to 240Hz at full HD or 4K at 120 fps and an expanded set of usable wide-screen resolutions (3840x1600, 3440x1440 and 2560x1080). On top of that NVIDIA is also adding better support for HDR on both Macs and PCs along with the ability to use full ray tracing with DLSS3 in supported games. Right away, this elevates GeForce Now above rivals like Xbox Cloud Gaming, which is capped at 1080p/60fps. But in practice, the service\u2019s new features have an even bigger impact as they make it easier to get the most out of a wider range of games and gaming setups.Take for example my current gaming PC, which is centered around an aging RTX 2080 card (GPUs ain\u2019t cheap y\u2019all) and a 4K/120Hz display. In more recent AAA games, my graphics card simply doesn\u2019t have enough oomph to hit 120 fps at higher graphics settings, which means I always have to fiddle around a bit before I get a game\u2019s performance dialed in just right. But with the new resolution support in GeForce Now Ultimate, suddenly I can play a game with all the bells and whistles turned on while still taking full advantage of my monitor\u2019s specs.With this much stuff happening on screen, you need all the performance you can get. (Sam Rutherford/Engadget)This effect was most evident when I played the demo Ghostrunner, which is a fast-paced first-person slasher set in a dystopian future. It\u2019s exactly the kind of game where you need fast reactions to dodge bullets while slicing apart your enemies. Unfortunately, at least on my desktop, in order to hit 120 fps, I had lower things like texture settings and anti-aliasing, which meant I couldn\u2019t fully enjoy the game\u2019s gorgeous cyberpunk aesthetic. But that wasn\u2019t an issue in GeForce Now, where I was able to max out the graphics and still hit 120 fps. And even though I ignored NVIDIA\u2019s directions and was connected to the internet over Wi-Fi, gameplay was so crisp and responsive that after just a few minutes, I completely forgot I was relying on servers in the cloud instead of the PC next to my feet.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementWhile I don\u2019t have the equipment at home to test it out properly, the addition of NVIDIA\u2019s Competitive Mode toggle in GeForce Now gives you more freedom to hit really high refresh rates (up to 240Hz at 1080p) regardless of how fast (or slow) your PC might be. And while I was only able to go up to 120 fps on my monitor while playing League of Legends and Apex Legends, I only encountered a single stutter over the course of multiple matches, which would be impressive even if I was relying on local hardware, let alone a server hundreds of miles away. And when you factor in that the service also works with the company\u2019s Reflex tech to reduce latency, the whole experience was shockingly smooth.Hitting CTRL + N in the GeForce Now app lets you see what type of server is powering your game along with stats like network info and streaming settings. (Sam Rutherford/Engadget)Now there are some important caveats. The first is that you need a speedy internet connection. NVIDIA\u2019s recommended minimum bandwidth for gaming at 1080p at 240 fps is 35 Mbps. If you\u2019re like me and you want to max out at 4K/120 fps, you\u2019ll need at least a 45 Mbps connection, not to mention additional overhead to handle anyone else who might be using the internet at your home. This also means that while the idea of gaming at 4K on the road sounds awesome, you\u2019ll still be at the whims of your hotel or Airbnb\u2019s network, which typically aren\u2019t very speedy or reliable.The other main thing to think about is that after the new Ultimate tier goes live today (January 19th), at least initially, the availability of the new SuperPODs may be limited. At launch, new servers with 4080 GPUs will be located in four places: San Jose, Los Angeles, Dallas and Frankfurt Germany. That means only people in the U.S. and Central Europe will have access to GeForce Now\u2019s Ultimate tier, and even then, if there are too many people online, you may get downgraded to a server still equipped with 3080 cards. (Tip: if you are using GeForce Now and want to see what hardware your cloud games are running on, you can hit CTRL + N to see stats including your server type, network specs and more). NVIDIAThe final hurdle is that at $20 a month compared to $12 for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (which includes cloud streaming), GeForce Now UItimate is a bit on the pricey side. But as the old saying goes: you get what you pay for. And for an extra $8 a month, NVIDIA\u2019s latest update to its game streaming services delivers better performance, more control over your resolution and refresh rate, and support for fancy features like ray tracing and Reflex. Granted, it\u2019s a bit weird to think about specs for hardware you don\u2019t really own, but for people who want their games to look as good as possible regardless of what hardware they\u2019re playing, GeForce Now\u2019s new Ultimate tier is positioning itself as the enthusiast\u2019s choice for cloud gaming.If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s RTX 4070 graphics card has been sighted, suggesting that maybe the vanilla sibling to the freshly released RTX 4070 Ti isn\u2019t too far off from arriving.VideoCardz spotted a bunch of Galax marketing materials relating to the RTX 4070 Ti GPU \u2013 which as we mentioned, has just gone on sale \u2013 but the interesting bit is that two of the graphics card boxes seen have \u2018RTX 4070\u2019 on the front.However, on the side and top of the box, it says \u2018RTX 4070 Ti\u2019, so it seems that whoever put together these marketing shots has mistakenly dropped an RTX 4070 logo on the front of the packaging.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nThe end of the Nvidia RTX 4000 series is nigh \u2013 with the RTX 4070 expected to sell out in weeks\n\n\n\n\nI can't tell if it's just a coincidence, but Nvidia's RTX 5070 is now reportedly set for March alongside AMD's RDNA 4 series launch\n\n\n\nThe fact that this box logo has been made and is ready to go, then, could be a hint that the RTX 4070 graphics card is close to appearing. But it is just that \u2013 a mere hint, and we should always bear in mind, as with any leaked images, that it could be faked.Analysis: Reinforcing existing rumors \u2013 but we definitely shouldn\u2019t get carried awayThis wouldn\u2019t be a particularly difficult fake to pull off either, in fairness, so we should be extra cautious to boot. But what makes this more likely is that the rumor mill is already claiming that the RTX 4070 is set to be released in early 2023, likely Q1. And so with seasoning firmly in hand, this latest leak reinforces the likelihood that the sibling graphics card for the 4070 Ti is indeed close to hitting the shelves. (As does a recent regulatory filing from Inno3D which listed not just its RTX 4070 Ti, but also the plain 4070).Of course, the RTX 4070 uses the same GPU chip as the 4070 Ti (AD104), and won\u2019t be all that different to the Ti version, meaning it\u2019s not going to be a big effort for Nvidia to get the ball rolling with this product. The real question is: does Nvidia want the RTX 4070 to come out yet?Even if the plan for a Q1 launch is correct, that could be subsequently delayed, as another likely factor to consider for Team Green will be whether enough RTX 3000 stock has sold through in a month or two. If not, then any launch plans might get pushed back to allow for the further diminishment of last-gen Ampere inventory that might otherwise be interfered with by the launch of the vanilla RTX 4070.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Whatever the case regarding launch timing, one thing\u2019s abundantly clear \u2013 Galax needs to take more care in preparing materials pertaining to its GPUs.This faux pas is just one of a bunch of mistakes the company has made lately, including the RTX 4090 HOF launch being littered with errors (like wrong info in the spec of the graphics card), and a banner errantly being put on the site linking to the firm\u2019s \u20184090 Ti\u2019 \u2013 a Lovelace card which doesn\u2019t exist (yet). And unlike the RTX 4070, we can be sure a 4090 Ti isn\u2019t coming any time soon (but will likely debut eventually, perhaps depending on what happens with AMD\u2019s RDNA 3 range at the high-end going forward).Today\u2019s best graphics card deals293 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $29View $38.99View $63ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

Not particularly well though.\nThis NVK driver is not from NVIDIA but is instead a new Mesa driver but is a serious effort to see if they can get it into a state where it's usable like\u00a0what the RADV is to AMD hardware.\nPosting on their Mastodon account, driver developer\u00a0Karol Herbst showed a screenshot of it now capable of loading up The Talos\u00a0Principle with a follow-up noting \"performance is terrible, but that's hopefully resolved with the GSP work which is still ongoing :)\".\nImage Credit -\u00a0Karol Herbst\nSeems like 2023 could be a really fun year for NVIDIA GPU owners on Linux, if this work continues to improve. Given the work involved, it will likely be a good while before performance is actually at a playable stage.\nArticle taken from GamingOnLinux.com.\n\n\n\tTags: Drivers, Misc, NVIDIA, Open Source\n\n\n28 Likes\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the author - Liam Dawe\n\n\n\n\nI am the owner of GamingOnLinux.

From what I've read it seems that proprietary Nvidia driver users avoided OBS' issue so that's... weird, and kinda funny, given how annoying Nvidia-Linux experience can be.\n\r\nYes, yes, I know it's a logistical issue that shouldn't happen often... but there's been a LOT of those last year, so I just wonder if it'll happen again and if that'll affect the people choosing to use the new open-source driver's users at that time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n0 Likes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsub 12 Jan 2023\n\n\n\nLink\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo they have enough docs from Nvidia in order to not rely on reversing stuff?It's mostly reverse engineered.

So that's time that I loose money, because I could have just worked in that time and get paid. And my job is a lot more fun than fixing proprietary shit, or trying the latest opensource drivers for hardware of a company that has no intention to help.\r\nSo I choose to do real work (that I like), getting paid real money, that I can spend on a Valve supported card and having fun time with it.\r\nThe last nvidia mistake I made was in 2016 when I bought a steam machine.\r\nThe last nvidia incident I got was a few years later, when I returned my refurbished thinkpad for repair and I got one with an unwanted nvidia power sink returned. The intel HD4000 performs better than the nvidia, because intel supports their stuff.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n0 Likes\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndrjoms 12 Jan 2023\n\n\n\nLink\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twould be curious to know if Zync can work with current implementation.

But the price that comes with more realistic graphics, ray tracing, and other fancy systems is more demanding hardware requirements.\nIt used to be that even the latest AAA titles would recommend a GTX 1060 or 1650, the top two most popular cards on the Steam survey. Several recent games, however, have started to recommend newer, more powerful GPUs like the RTX 2070 (Dead Space) or even the RTX 3070 (Plague Tale Requiem).\nBuying a new graphics card is more expensive than ever before, especially if you're aiming for a high-end GPU. But there may be another option, one that supposedly allows you to play games on an RTX 3080 (and eventually an RTX 4080) on a subscription model...\nGame streaming: How is GeForce Now different?\nGame streaming services are still relatively new, but in their short life you could say none have really exploded in popularity, and some have completely failed, like Google Stadia. However the concept itself is a compelling one in theory. Stream your games instantly to a device of your choice, no setup or download necessary.\nGeForce Now is Nvidia's take on game streaming that lets users play the games they own from the cloud with all processing taking place on their hardware. There are three tiers: a free one that uses a \"basic rig,\" a Priority level for $9.99 per month that offers hardware capable of 1080p resolution at 60 FPS, and the $19.99 per month Ultimate tier that offers RTX 3080-like hardware, up to 4K resolution, and up to 120 FPS.\nNvidia recently announced it would be upgrading the Ultimate tier to RTX 4080 GPUs for the same price.\n\nSubscribers have limited session lengths, too: 1 hour on Free, 6 hours on Priority, and 8 hours on Ultimate. Nvidia says there are no limits on how many times a member may start a new session in a day, though there might be a wait to restart a session if you're on a lower tier.\nThe limitation may not sound like much, but it's a paradigm shift from playing your games locally the old fashioned and trusted way.\nAs a side note, the GPUs Nvidia uses in the cloud are not standard desktop cards, but an A10G GPU based on the same GA102 silicon as the RTX 3080. It has more CUDA cores (9,216) and a massive 24GB of GDDR6, much more than the consumer version's 10GB/12GB. However, the cloud GPU has 600GB/s of bandwidth, less than the desktop's 760GB/s. Additionally, GeForce Now's servers are based on a Ryzen Threadripper Pro 3955WX CPU with 16 cores and 28GB of system memory\nIs an RTX 2070 Super outdated?\nHaving upgraded everything in my PC except for my GeForce RTX 2070 Super a year ago \u2013 you can read about that process here \u2013 I've started feeling like the Turing-era card has become a bottleneck in games and it certainly isn't making the most of my 1440p@165Hz Asus monitor.\nAn RTX 3080 or better would be a fine replacement. Sadly, I'm not willing to sell a kidney to buy one. So why not essentially rent the card from Nvidia? Moreover, my LG C1 TV has the GeForce Now smart TV app, meaning no more trailing a wire from my office into my living room to play games on a big set.\nA good internet connection helps, a lot\nAs with all game streaming services, a fast and stable internet connection is not only recommended but needed. Streaming up to 3840 x 2160 or playing at 120 FPS asks for 45 Mbps speeds and either a hardwired Ethernet connection or a 5GHz wireless router.\nI'm lucky enough to have a gigabit fiber line and an Asus RT-AX88U router that reliably hits 1 GB/s wirelessly from my PC. This, combined with a Core i7-12700K and 32GB of DDR4, means I'm expecting a fairly seamless experience.\nThe setup\nGetting started involves signing up and downloading the GeForce Now app (you can use your GeForce Experience credentials). Then you will want to sign in to the stores where you have your PC games like Ubisoft, Epic Games, and Steam, whenever you have your games and syncing your libraries.\n\nThe GeForce Now app's settings page has plenty of options, including resolution upscaling and streaming quality. I picked 'Custom' settings, set the resolution to 1440p @ 120fps, and pushed the max bit rate up to 75 Mbps.\nThere's also a handy 'test network' option that informs me my setup meets all the requirements: more than 75 Mbps bandwidth, 0 packet loss, and under 40ms latency.\nGaming at 1440p\nThe first title I wanted to try is the newly updated Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. I own the game on GOG, which works on GeForce Now, most of the time. My initial attempt sees the loading screen hang indefinitely, as does my second try \u2013 this is not a promising start \u2013 but it finally works on the third go. I turn ray tracing to Ultra, DLSS to quality, and start the game. It's not... great.\nBy pressing Ctrl+G, GeForce Now brings up a real-time stats page that shows the stream FPS, in-game FPS, and ping. While my stream is 120 FPS, the game averages between 40 - 50 FPS. Switching off ray tracing and moving to Ultra settings pushes it up to around 70 FPS, but my heavily overclocked RTX 2070 Super manages around 85 FPS on these exact settings.\nMy card even hits 35 FPS on RT Ultra, not too far from the GeForce Now's GPU. I knew the experience wouldn't exactly replicate having an RTX 3080 in my rig, but were my expectations too high?\n\n43 fps at 1440p! And for just $19.99 per month\nI also notice occasional hitching and stuttering during the GeForce Now gameplay. The stats show a ping of 32, which isn't great, along with some packet and frame loss. So, I decide to dig out my old 50-foot Cat 7 ethernet cable and try again. The ping drops to about 20, and the packet loss is gone, but the game's FPS doesn't improve, and I still notice some, albeit less, hitching.\nMaybe another game will yield better results: Cyberpunk 2077 on GOG. It doesn't load the first time, which is fast becoming a feature of this service.\nOur own testing shows the desktop RTX 3080 can hit 87 FPS @ 1440p at Ultra and 85 FPS with all RT on/DLSS Quality in the game, so I have high hopes. Again, the streaming effect means RT settings return around 60 FPS, and the Ultra setting is around 76 FPS. The very slight lag and hitching you don't get from using your own hardware remains, though it's much less noticeable than before.\n\nWhen you screengrab at an inappropriate moment\nNext is Watch Dogs: Legion on the Ubisoft Connect store.\nThe performance here is closer to desktop card performance, with RT Ultra reaching 60 FPS and the Ultra level with ray tracing off hitting 79 FPS. Again, though, this is with DLSS Quality enabled. Still, those results are certainly better than what the RTX 2070 Super manages.\n\nWho watches the Watch Dogs (with ray tracing off)?\nMoving to another Ubisoft Connect store game, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, returns the best result so far. Our testing of the RTX 3080 12GB showed this title averaging 94 FPS at 1440p @ Ultra High quality. GeForce Now manages 97 FPS at the same settings. There are some big frame dips, though they're likely due to my switching back to a wireless connection.\n\nCheck out that system info, and those lows\nTime for a Steam game.\nI've recently been enjoying Marvel's Midnight Suns, which has a ray tracing option that can make the outdoor Abbey sections quite demanding. On the overclocked RTX 2070 Super, pushing the quality up to Epic, setting DLSS to Quality, and turning on ray tracing gives an average of around 63 FPS.\nI'm expecting good things from GeForce Now with this one. Sadly, the exact same settings return around 55 FPS, with drops as low as 45 FPS.\n\nNot exactly impressive FPS numbers from an RTX 3080\nIt seems the keyword here is inconsistency. The majority of titles perform worse, either slightly or noticeably, than the RTX 3080 desktop card at 1440p, and at least one is worse than the RTX 2070 Super. On the flip side, some do offer similar performance, while a handful, like Assassin's Creed Valhalla, bring even higher frames-per-second while being streamed.\nI was hoping to try out Forza Horizon 5, Plague Tale Requiem, and Warhammer 40,000:Darktide, some other demanding favorites. Unfortunately, these are all titles I access via PC Game Pass.\nMicrosoft has its own cloud gaming streaming service, so it's not going to offer integration with a rival-- another reason people might prefer to buy their own graphics card.\nGaming at 1080p @ 120 FPS and 4K @ 60 FPS\nTwo of the big GeForce Now Ultimate features Nvidia promotes are support for 120 FPS and 4K. Testing the former requires some compromises, such as switching to 1080p and turning ray tracing off.\nAC: Valhalla keeps a pretty consistent 120 FPS framerate at this resolution with the graphics maxed. Both Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher 3 return around 100 FPS (DLSS Quality), and they look very nice and smooth, even with the rare stutter. Turning on all ray tracing effects in supported games tends to knock these frame rates down to around 70-80 FPS at this resolution.\nAccording to the latest Steam survey, almost 65% of participants use 1080p monitors, so the 120 FPS feature of GeForce Now could be a compelling selling point among those with high refresh-rate Full HD monitors.\n\nGeForce Now performs pretty well at 4K\nGeForce Now really shines at 4K. All the games I tested looked gorgeous at this resolution, especially the Witcher 3. They ran smoothly at 60 FPS with DLSS set to quality and the graphics settings maxed. However, turning on any form of ray tracing will kill performance, cutting the frame rate in half or worse, which seems to be a recurring theme at every resolution.\nMobile and TV\nBeing able to play anywhere on a multitude of devices is one of game streaming's promising advantages over buying a GPU for your PC.\nI was quite impressed by the Xbox cloud gaming service's Game Pass Ultimate mobile app \u2013 would GeForce Now be as good?\n\n\n\nPlaying on the 7.6-inch Galaxy Z Fold 4 and connecting an Xbox controller improves what is already an impressive mobile experience. Marvel's Midnight Suns is very good, while the Witcher 3 is surprisingly smooth and looks great (the video above doesn't do it justice). I can imagine people staying in hotels without a gaming laptop would get a lot of enjoyment out of this portability.\nThe GeForce Now app is also supported on newer LG and Samsung TVs, an appealing prospect for anyone with televisions located far from their PCs. Time to make the most of my LG C1's 4K screen and 120Hz refresh rate...\n\nIt looked good up until this point\nMore disappointment: the smart app is limited to 1080p and 60Hz, sigh. Nevertheless, it'll probably still look pretty good on the big screen.\nI start with the Witcher 3. Once it loads, which takes an achingly long time, I'm disturbed to find Geralt frantically running around in a circle as if someone had spiked his decoction with LSD. The horrible stuttering and lag make the effect even worse, as if I were the one who dropped acid. GeForce Now informs me that the problem is due to a \"spotty connection,\" which is strange as the TV is connected directly to the router below via ethernet. AC Valhalla is an equally awful experience.\nClosing Thoughts\nIt should be obvious by now that GeForce Now doesn't perfectly replicate the experience of owning an RTX 3080. Barring a handful of exceptions, games will perform worse when streaming compared to having the Ampere card in your rig, but such is the nature of the beast.\nThere's also a very slight degradation to picture quality, the occasional lagginess, hitching even with the best internet connections, some bugginess, and the fact ray tracing seems to kill framerates even more than it does on your local desktop GPU.\nNo PC Game Pass titles is also a pain. That's not even mentioning obvious issues such as not being able to play if your internet goes down and no access to Nvidia graphics card features such as the new AI-assisted upscaling of videos.\nHowever, tempering expectations doesn't mean GeForce Now is bad. It's still the best game streaming service available right now, and it's likely to be especially beneficial for specific use cases. If you're coming from an older/less-powerful GPU, want impressive performance without paying a fortune in one go, and like the freedom of accessing games on multiple devices in different locations, the service could be ideal. Moreover, playing at 1080p@120fps or 4K@60fps can be a great experience if you have a display that supports them.\nPersonally, the negative points combined with the small improvements over my RTX 2070 Super mean I'm unlikely to subscribe beyond this first month. Nvidia is in the process of upgrading its Ultimate tier to RTX 4080 cards, bringing upgraded performance that could make the subscription worth the money. At that point, I may reconsider my decision.\nPros\n\nA great way of enjoying 1080p@120Hz and 4K@60fps without buying an expensive GPU\nA small number of games perform better than the desktop RTX 3080\nPlay on many devices, access the service anywhere you have a good internet connection\nThe arrival of RTX 4080 cards could be a game changer, literally\nNo need to download or update games you've already bought\n\nCons\n\nMost titles' performance is inferior to equivalent local hardware, sometimes significantly\nA (very) decent internet connection via ethernet helps a lot\nHitching, stuttering, and lag is an occasional annoyance\nCan be buggy\nThat $20 per month price quickly adds up\nNot all games are supported\n\nFurther Testing\nSince we published this article about cloud gaming with GeForce Now, we have run additional tests you may be interested in:\n\nTesting GeForce Now Ultimate RTX 4080 Tier\nAMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX vs. Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080: The Re-Review\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 66\n\n\n Got something to say?

Its price puts it as the cheapest next-gen graphics card available (at least technically), and features like DLSS 3 offer even more ground-breaking gaming performance. It's not perfect though, and it's not as future-proof as I'd like it to be for the asking price, but if you've been waiting to upgrade to your next Nvidia graphics card, this should definitely be the one that the vast majority of buyers should go for. \n\n\nPros\n\n\n+Excellent gaming performance\n+An excellent \"budget\" creative workstation GPU\n+Cheapest next-gen graphics card on the market\n\n\n\n\nCons\n\n\n-No Founders Edition\n-Only DisplayPort 1.4a\n-12GB VRAM isn't great for 8K gaming\n\n\n\n\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\n\n\n\n\nWe spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you\u2019re buying the best.

It is without question the best Nvidia graphics card you can buy right now (by value) from this new generation of GPUs, and it represents a major leap forward for everyday, mainstream PC gaming. It's not without its flaws, but on balance, it's the Nvidia GPU that anyone looking to upgrade with Team Green ought to be buying unless they have a couple of thousand dollars to burn.With an MSRP of $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,469, it's cheaper than the cheapest RDNA 3 GPU, the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT, and half the price of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090. And while both of those cards outperform the RTX 4070 Ti in raw performance terms, there are a number of value adds for the RTX 4070 Ti that collectively make it worth major consideration regardless of its limitations.The Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti isn't an undisputed winner in the lower-premium GPU class, but this is where Nvidia really needed to shore up its flank after AMD crushed it in my AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX review and to that end it is exactly what Nvidia needed right now.Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti review: Price & availability(Image credit: Future)RTX 4070 Ti MSRP is the lowest of all the latest next-gen graphics cardsSome third-party cards can even be bought at MSRPAvailability is generally pretty goodThe Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti, available now in the US, UK, and Australia, comes in at the lowest MSRP of any of the next-gen cards to hit the market in recent months, and it's good to see that Nvidia took a lot of the criticism about price inflation directed toward it after the Lovelace announcement to heart.The RTX 4070 Ti, with an MSRP of $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,469, is $100 / \u00a3100 cheaper than the RX 7900 XT (though it is actually AU$60 more expensive in Australia), and even though there is no Nvidia Founders Edition card guaranteed to sell at MSRP, even some third-party cards can be found very close to or even matching Nvidia's MSRP.That said, this is also much more expensive than the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, which had a launch MSRP of $599 / \u00a3529 / AU$959. That makes the RTX 4070 Ti $200, \u00a3270, and AU$510 more expensive than the card it is technically replacing, so we can't go praising Nvidia too for relaunching the RTX 4080 12GB (originally slated for an $899 / \u00a3849 / AU$1,659 launch price) at a somewhat lower price point.And, of course, prices for other third-party cards may end up being substantially higher, especially for OC versions that squeeze a few hundred MHz more out of the GPU's clock speeds or special edition cards with premium design or water cooling.Still, there's no getting around the fact that this is the cheapest next-gen card we're going to have for a while, so the RTX 4070 Ti is going to score some major points here by default.Today's best Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti deals13 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $1,609.99View No price informationCheck WalmartWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesPrice score: 4 / 5Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti review: Features & chipset(Image credit: Future)Third-gen RT coresDLSS 3 with full frame generationLower TDPThe RTX 4070 Ti is built on Nvidia's new Lovelace GPU architecture, which features a significantly smaller TSMC process than the last-gen Nvidia Ampere architecture. At 4nm, as opposed to Ampere's 8nm process from Samsung, we're getting significantly faster clock speeds as well as more energy efficiency with this generation. The RTX 4070 Ti has just over twice as many transistors as the RTX 3070 Ti while packing them into a GPU die about 75% of the size of the RTX 3070 Ti's silicon, and you can see it in the RTX 4070 Ti's slightly lower TDP (285W to 290W for the RTX 3070 Ti).The RTX 4070 Ti we reviewed, the Asus Tuf GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Gaming OC 12GB, also features a higher boost clock (but not that much more than Nvidia's reference specs) but both the reference clocks and the actual clocks on our Asus card are nearly a full 1,000 MHz faster than those of the RTX 3070 Ti, so this card is seriously fast.Swipe to scroll horizontallyNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti review unit specs ComponentNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti (Base)Asus Tuf RTX 4070 Ti OCPrice$799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,479$849 / \u00a3859 / AU$1,669GPUAD104AD104TGP285W285WCUDA Cores7,6807,680RT Cores6060Tensor Cores240240Base Clock2,310MHz2,310MHzBoost Clock2,610MHz2,730MHzVRAM12GB GDDR6X12GB GDDR6XMemory Clock1,313MHz1,313MHzBus Size192-bit192-bitMemory Bandwidth504.2 GB/s504.2 GB/sAs I said before, this is essentially the unlaunched RTX 4080 12GB, and so it has the same specs as that unlaunched card did, including 7,680 CUDA cores, 60 ray tracing cores, and 240 Tensor cores for doing all those tricky machine learning calculations needed to power the new DLSS 3 with full frame generation, which is as big a deal today as DLSS 2.0 was when it launched with Nvidia Ampere and made fast 4K gaming a reality for gamers around the world.On the memory side, there is 12GB GDDR6X VRAM, the same as in the unlaunched RTX 4080, as is both the memory clock (1,313MHz) and 192-bit memory bus (for a total memory bandwidth of 504.2GB/s). If you're worried that 12GB might be a bit too low for a 4K graphics card, you don't need to worry about that with this card. There is more than enough to power a high-refresh 4K display, which is something that the RTX 3070 Ti could only do on the most restrictive of settings.That memory though is too little to really power 8K content at fast speeds, and even if you could get more than 60 fps at 8K in any given game, the RTX 4070 Ti is locked in at 60Hz for 8K video thanks to its lack of DisplayPort 2.1 output, so you'll never be able to game faster than 60 fps at 8K.\u00a0The RX 7900 XT, on the other hand, has both the memory and the output capacity to go as high as 165Hz at 8K, though it would only really be able to natively manage more than 60 fps on an 8K display with very low lift games like esports titles and the like.\u00a0Still, it's possible for the RX 7900 XT, and it's really not with the RTX 4070 Ti, which is a shame. 8K gaming isn't really here yet beyond a couple of titles like Spider-man: Miles Morales, but with higher refresh rate 8K displays set to hit the market in the next year or two, the RTX 4070 Ti feels less future-proof than a card this expensive should be.Features & chipset: 4 / 5Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti review: Design(Image credit: Future)No Founders EditionDesigns will vary, but none of them will be smallUSB Type-C outputThe Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti we reviewed is actually a third-party card, since there is no Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti Founders Edition, but there are definitely some things that I can generalize about the design of the RTX 4070 Ti. Namely, that this is going to be a honking-big card no matter who you buy it from.Image 1 of 3(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)Side by side with the RTX 4080, the RTX 4070 Ti takes up just as much space and will be just as challenging to wedge into all but the largest of tower cases. It's a triple-slot card, so a normal ATX motherboard will leave little room for anything else to slot in next to it.Then there's the matter of its 16-pin connector. Given the lower power requirements for the RTX 4070 Ti, the card only requires three 8-pin connectors to be plugged into the included adapter (as opposed to four 8-pins for the RTX 4090), but the adapter is still going to be clunky to deal with, so unless you have a new ATX 3.0 PSU that comes with a 16-pin connector cable, your cable management skills are going to really be put to the test.In terms of output, there is no DisplayPort 2.1, as I mentioned, but there's also no USB Type-C output either, something that would make a lot of sense on this card since it has very strong creative workload performance, so a lot of creatives on a budget would be tempted to give this card a look, but since the best USB-C monitors are also very popular among the creative professional crowd, they'll have to use an adapter, and no one likes having to use those if they can help it.There is also an included support bracket for the Asus card we received for testing, and I imagine that a lot of other manufacturers will be including them as well. This card weighs a good bit, so torque forces are not going to be kind to it (or any other RTX 4070 Ti) in the medium-to-long term, so make sure you use one if you aren't running the card upright.Finally, as for Asus's Tuf Gaming design, the open metal shroud exposes more of the heat sink while a triple-fan array will keep air moving through it. The cage-like shroud does look cool, and there is some RGB along the top of the card as well if you're into that.Design score: 3.5 / 5Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti review: Performance(Image credit: Future)4K gaming on a 1440p GPUGreat \"budget\" graphics card for creative prosCompetent ray tracing at 4K, especially with DLSSAs we move on to the RTX 4070 Ti's performance, the long and short of it is what it's been for two generations now: the RTX 4070 Ti is better at most creative workloads and ray tracing while AMD pulls ahead in rasterization, especially in gaming, though it is worth noting that the RX 7900 XT doesn't fall as far behind the RTX 4070 Ti in ray tracing as it would have a generation ago.Image 1 of 6(Image credit: Future / Infogram)(Image credit: Future / Infogram)(Image credit: Future / Infogram)(Image credit: Future / Infogram)(Image credit: Future / Infogram)(Image credit: Future / Infogram)Nvidia's edge in ray tracing performance can be seen in our 3DMark Speedway and Port Royal tests, both of which are ray tracing-heavy benchmarks. The RTX 4070 Ti pulls out a fairly close win here, edging out the RX 7900 XT by a few hundred points in each.Once we move onto Timespy and Firestrike though, both at 1440p and 4K, AMD's rasterization advantage really pulls ahead of Nvidia's RTX 4070 Ti with the RX 7900 XT blowing out the RTX 4070 Ti by a few thousand points at times.Image 1 of 5(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)Whatever gloating the RX 7900 XT might be doing gets quickly shut down in creative tests, especially in our Blender Benchmark tests. Admittedly, this isn't a fair fight, since Blender Cycles is highly optimized for the CUDA instruction set. Even the last-gen RTX 3070 Ti pushes AMD's RX 7900 XT aside in Blender Benchmark, and the RTX 4070 Ti fully laps its Team Red rival and then some.This extends to Adobe Premiere as well, where the RTX 4070 Ti outperforms the RX 7900 XT by about 17.5%. If it's any consolation for the RX 7900 XT, it's that it edges out the RTX 4070 Ti in Photoshop, which is the living definition of a rasterization workload, so this shouldn't be surprising. Still, the RTX 4070 Ti manages to only lose by about 1.5%, so it's enough to call it a wash.The key takeaway for me from these creative benchmark results though is that the RTX 4070 Ti is quite adept at creative work normally reserved for graphics cards twice as expensive, so any creatives out there looking for a more \"budget\" GPU option for their workstation actually have one now.Image 1 of 13(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)In gaming performance, we again see the RTX 4070 Ti besting the RX 7900 XT when it comes to ray tracing while often slipping into second when ray tracing isn't a factor. Ultimately, though, the difference here isn't too significant to go with one over the other on this basis alone.All games need rasterization performance while only a few games even implement ray tracing, so the RTX 4070 Ti's third-gen ray tracing cores are only really a factor when it comes to premium ray tracing experiences like Cyberpunk 2077 or Hitman 3, and even then, it's still at the point where you need to rely on DLSS 3 for a good frame rate.It also needs to be said that, technically, the RTX 4070 Ti is a 1440p graphics card. It's not supposed to really perform this well at 4K, as evidenced by the RTX 3070 Ti's rather pitiful showing in a number of 4K game benchmarks. Heck, the RTX 3070 Ti could barely get through the Hitman 3 Dubai benchmark at 4K without ray tracing and totally craps the bed when you turn ray tracing on to the point of crashing to the desktop.\u00a0The fact that the RTX 4070 Ti is competitive at 4K is a huge win for the RTX 4070 Ti here, especially given that the RX 7900 XT has a much more built-in hardware advantage at 4K owing to 66% more VRAM and 58.66% more memory bandwidth for pushing through 4K textures.AMD might have the edge in our gaming tests, but the raw number doesn't tell the whole picture. In our formal benchmark tests, we don't use DLSS or FSR to improve frame rates algorithmically, since updates can make or break their functionality, and this happens too often for any numbers gathered while using upscaling to really be valid after even a single update. As such, it's more important to get a baseline figure that can't change much over time when comparing hardware, and the non-assisted hardware rendering taking place in the PCIe slot can rarely, if ever, change.\u00a0That said, no one plays games nowadays without some form of upscaling. Even if you've got a GTX 1060, you can still use FSR and you undoubtedly will. With the RTX 4070 Ti, DLSS 2.0 is already phenomenal, but DLSS 3 with frame generation takes DLSS 2.0's performance gains and pretty much doubles it. In practice, with DLSS 3 you will almost always get more fps in-game than you will with the RX 7900 XT running FSR 2.2, so even though the RX 7900 XT barely pulls ahead on gaming performance, your actual experience of gaming on the RTX 4070 Ti probably won't reflect that at all.Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)In the end, the RTX 4070 Ti comes in very close behind the RX 7900 XT in overall performance, owing mostly to the RX 7900 XT's strong absolute performance in synthetic benchmarks. Normalize all of that mathematically, though, and the RTX 4070 Ti is going to be the better bet here even without DLSS 3. Throw that in on top of everything else, and the RTX 4070 Ti simply walks away with it in terms of performance against both its predecessor and its direct rival from AMD.Performance score: 4.5 / 5Should you buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti?Swipe to scroll horizontallyNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 TiAttributesNotesRatingPriceAs the cheapest next-gen graphics card on the market, the RTX 4070 Ti offers a good value for most gamers looking for a premium 4K card.4 / 5Features & chipsetBetween third-gen RT cores and DLSS 3, Nvidia's hardware and supporting software has definitely matured this gen.4 / 5DesignNo Founders Edition card, so designs will vary depending on which third-party card you buy.3.5 / 5PerformanceGreat 4K gaming performance and respectable creative performance as well, though still slightly behind the RX 7900 XT on average.4.5 / 5Buy it if...You want the cheapest next-gen card available\nAt MSRP, the RTX 4070 Ti is the cheapest next-gen GPU on the market right now.You want the best bang for your buck\nThe RTX 4070 Ti has the best performance for price of any of the newest graphics cards from Nvidia and AMD, so your money will go farther with the 4070 Ti than with anything else from this generation.You want next-gen features like DLSS 3\nNvidia's hardware is often on the bleeding edge of the industry, but things like DLSS 3 and Nvidia Reflex are Nvidia's not-so-secret force multiplier here.Don't buy it if...You plan on doing a lot of 8K gaming\nWith just 12GB VRAM and no DisplayPort 2.1, 8K gaming with modern AAA titles on the RTX 4070 Ti is going to be a challenge.You're on a very tight budget\nWhile the RTX 4070 Ti is the cheapest graphics card on the market right now, it won't be the cheapest for long, as more affordable cards from both Nvidia and AMD are set to drop in the next few months.Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti review: Also considerSwipe to scroll horizontally Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 TiAMD Radeon RX 7900 XTNvidia GeForce RTX 4080Price:$799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1479$899 / \u00a3899 / AU$1,619$1,199 / \u00a31,199 / AU$1,999Boost Clock2,610MHz2,394MHz2,505MHzVRAM12GB GDDR6X20GB GDDR616GB GDDR6XMemory Bandwidth504.2 GB/s800.0 GB/s716.8 GB/sStreaming Multiprocessors7,6805,3769,728Ray Tracing Cores608476Tensor Cores240N/A304Connector1 x 16-pin2 x 8-pin1 x 16-pinOutputs1 x HDMI 2.1 3 x DisplayPort 1.4a1 x HDMI 2.1a, 2 x DisplayPort 2.1, 1 x USB Type-C1 x HDMI 2.1, 3 x DisplayPort 1.4aIf our Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti review has you considering other options, here are two more graphics cards to consider...AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT\nWhile its bigger sibling gets a lot more attention, don't sleep on the RX 7900 XT.

I then run it through a series of synthetic benchmarking tools like 3DMark as well as in-game benchmarks in the most recent PC games I can access like Cyberpunk 2077 and F1 2022. I run everything on the maximum settings possible without upscaling tech, and I run all tests at the resolution a reader is most likely to use a given card at. In the case of the RTX 4070 Ti, this means nothing less than 2,560 x 1440p, with 3,840 x 2,160p wherever possible.I also make sure to install the latest relevant drivers and rerun tests on any competing graphics card that I might have already reviewed and tested, like the RTX 4080 and the RX 7900 XT, to make sure that I have the most current scores to account for any driver updates. All of these scores are recorded and compared against the card's predecessor, its most direct rival, and the card directly above and below it in the product stack, if those cards are available. I then average these scores to come to a final overall score and divide that by the card's MSRP to see how much performance every dollar or pound spent actually gets you to find how much value the card actually brings to the table.Finally, I actually use the card in my own personal computer for several days, playing games, using apps like Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator, and watching for any anomalies, crashes, glitches, or visual disruptions that may occur during my time with the card. Having extensively covered and tested many graphics cards over the years, I know what a graphics card should do and how it should perform, and can readily identify when something is not performing up to expectations and when it exceeds them.\u00a0Read more about how we testFirst reviewed January 2023\n\n\nJohn LoefflerSocial Links NavigationComponents EditorJohn (He/Him) is the Components Editor here at TechRadar and he is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY.

But you\u2019ll need an Nvidia 30 or 40-series GPU for it to work.by  Jon PorterJan 4, 2023, 12:29 PM UTCLinkFacebookThreadsJon Porter is a reporter with five years of experience covering consumer tech releases, EU tech policy, online platforms, and mechanical keyboards.Nvidia has turned its AI upscaling technology on a new target: blurry web video. Announced this week during its CES 2023 presentation, RTX Video Super Resolution is designed to upscale video watched through the Chrome or Edge browsers on a PC to the equivalent of 4K. The catch is that you\u2019ll need a relatively modern Nvidia GPU to benefit from the feature, with only its most recent 30 and 40-series GPUs listed as getting support when it releases next month.In practice, a video demonstration of the tech at work on Apex Legends footage shows edges being sharpened, and video artifacts reduced. Nvidia\u2019s demo shows RTX Video Super Resolution at work on a YouTube video, but its blog post notes that should work on \u201cany video watched in a browser,\u201d which should cover other streaming services like Netflix. PCGamer reports that it supports any video with a resolution of between 360p and 1440p (including typical 1080p video), up to a frame rate of 144Hz.It works on video as low resolution as 360pNvidia has previously made its video AI upscaling technology available on its dedicated Shield TV and Shield TV Pro streaming devices, but bringing it to the browser should make it available to a much larger audience. It\u2019s already impressed us on Shield TV devices, with my colleague Chris Welch remarking in 2019 that it resulted in a noticeable increase in clarity with the feature enabled.The only real downside is Nvidia limiting the technology to people with its most recent 30 or 40-series GPUs, which means anyone with an older 20 or 10-series card won\u2019t benefit when it launches in February. I\u2019m not going to pretend to understand the hardware requirements of an AI-based feature like this, but given Nvidia\u2019s 20-series launched with support for its game-focused DLSS AI upscaling technology, I\u2019m crossing my fingers that this new feature will eventually make its way to at least some older cards.

The work is for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which wants to blend, analyze and centralize the huge volumes of information it receives. (Rendering provided by NVIDIA)\t\t\n\nBy Judith Kohler | jkohler@denverpost.com | The Denver PostPUBLISHED: January 30, 2023 at 6:00 AM MSTAn environmental slogan says there is no planet \u201cB.\u201d But what if there were a planet \u201cD,\u201d as in a digital twin of Earth that would produce a real-time picture of the environment with data from around the globe and space, one that scientists could use to detect patterns and track climate change?That\u2019s what Lockheed Martin and NVIDIA, a high-tech company known for its work in artificial intelligence and graphics processing, have teamed up to do. The companies plan to build a digital replica of the Earth for scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Instead of trying to absorb gigabytes or terabytes of data streaming from satellites, weather stations and buoys and looking at different websites, the goal is to synthesize the information, use artificial intelligence to analyze it and create a digital replica of the Earth that can be accessed in one place.\u201cThey have all of this data coming in from all of these different sources and what they were really looking for was a kind of one-stop shop,\u201d said Lynn Montgomery, a senior research scientist with Lockheed Martin Space in Jefferson County and head of Lockheed\u2019s team on the project.NOAA asked for proposals to develop a centralized monitoring system. Lockheed won a $3 million contract to produce a prototype that fuses all the incoming data on sea surface, just one of the five major systems that NOAA monitors.The other systems are land, the atmosphere, space weather and the cryosphere, which includes sea and lake ice, glaciers and snow cover.Lockheed is working with NVIDIA, based in Santa Clara, Calif., to create a multidimensional image that will be updated continually with new data.\u201cWe\u2019re giving them a visual basis of all of that insane amount of data coming in,\u201d Montgomery said.\n\nNow, NOAA staffers have to look at a series of websites fed by different sources to get a holistic view of conditions, she added.The system should also flag anomalies in the information for scientists.\u201cWe have a huge increase in the volume and diversity of the environmental data and it\u2019s expected to be even more in the future,\u201d said Sid Boukabara, a principal scientist at NOAA in the Washington, D.C., area.For instance, more and more satellites that beam back data and images are being launched, Boukabara said. \u201cEven for each satellite, you have different sensors and for each sensor we have different products being generated.\u201cBy creating this digital replica of the Earth environment, we\u2019re hoping to be able to streamline the handling of the environmental observations and to include nontraditional observations, from citizens,\u201d Boukabara added.If the prototype is successful, Boukabara said NOAA hopes to eventually use the observations to make predictions, \u201cbe it a few weeks from now or a few decades from now.\u201d The accuracy of\u00a0 predictions relies on the accurate knowledge of current conditions, he said.\u201cOnce you do the monitoring and hook that to a predictive mechanism to project the state of the Earth into the future timescale,\u201d Boukabara continued, \u201cthen you can start doing the what-if scenarios: what would be the state of the fire situation or extreme weather events or hurricane intensity.\u201dLockheed Martin and NVIDIA are collaborating on a project to provide more timely information about weather and land conditions to agencies dealing with huge wildfires driven by drought and a warming climate. Lockheed Martin staffers have flown on planes used by the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control to see if the company\u2019s technology can speed up the analysis and transmission of data to crews on the ground.The work with NOAA is another case where the companies are building a real-time monitoring system to enable users to prevent or predict events, said Dion Harris, lead product manager of accelerated computing at NVIDIA.\u201cThe scale of what we\u2019re doing with NOAA is very unique and will require a new set of techniques and (data) pipelines to help develop this,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThis is really sort of groundbreaking in terms of building a digital twin on this scale.\u201dLockheed Martin and NVIDIA will use their existing systems and technologies to blend incoming data. They\u2019ll use artificial intelligence and machine learning to take in, fuse and format observations from multiple sources.The data will be converted into a visual image using a process called Universal Scene Description, which was originally developed by Pixar Animation Studios. Another tool is NVIDIA\u2019s Omniverse Nucleus, which will enable data-sharing between researchers.Harris said the information will be available in four dimensions:\u00a0height, depth, width and time. The model will show the sea-surface conditions over two weeks.The plan is to allow users to click on the image, zoom in and out and call up data, such as line graphs.Related Articles\nTechnology |  \n\n\t\t\tIs artificial intelligence the next tool to fight wildfires in the West?\t\t\n\n\nTechnology |  \n\n\t\t\tColorado-built advanced weather satellite to launch Tuesday\t\t\n\n\nTechnology |  \n\n\t\t\tColorado River conditions are worsening quicker than expected. Feds prepare to step in.\t\t\n\nWhile NVIDIA and Lockheed Martin have cutting-edge technology to build the Earth-monitoring system, Harris expects the companies to have to develop some tools along the way.\u201cWhat\u2019s an exciting part is that we\u2019re really sort of creating new technologies, new workflows,\u201d Harris said.Montgomery with Lockheed said creating an Earth replica using the sea-surface temperatures will take about a year.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's Ada Lovelace architecture ushers in a new level of performance at the top of the stack, with the RTX 4090 besting the previous generation RTX 3090 Ti by 52% on average in our rasterization benchmarks, and 70% in ray tracing benchmarks \u2014 both at 4K, naturally. The 4090 now sits comfortably atop our GPU benchmarks hierarchy and ranks as one of the best graphics cards around, at least if you have deep pockets.\n\nUnfortunately, the step down from the 4090 to the RTX 4080 is rather precipitous, dropping performance by 23% for rasterization and 30% for ray tracing. Dropping down another level to the new RTX 4070 Ti knocks an additional 22% off the performance relative to the 4080. If you're keeping track \u2014 and we definitely like to keep score \u2014 that means the third-string Ada card sporting the AD104 GPU is slower than the previous generation 3090 Ti, nevermind Nvidia's claims to the contrary that rely on benchmarks using DLSS 3's Frame Generation.\n\nPerhaps more alarming with the RTX 4070 Ti is that it only has a 192-bit memory interface. It still has 12GB of GDDR6X memory, and the large L2 cache in general means that the narrower bus isn't a deal killer, but things don't look so good as we eye future lower-tier RTX 40-series parts like the 4060 and 4050.\n\nNvidia recently announced the full line of RTX 40-series laptop GPUs, ranging from the RTX 4090 mobile that uses the AD103 GPU (basically a mobile 4080) down to the anemic-sounding RTX 4050. Here's the full list of specs for the mobile parts.Swipe to scroll horizontallyNvidia Ada Laptop GPU SpecificationsGraphics CardRTX 4090 for LaptopsRTX 4080 for LaptopsRTX 4070 for LaptopsRTX 4060 for LaptopsRTX 4050 for LaptopsArchitectureAD103AD104AD106?AD106?AD107?Process TechnologyTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTransistors (Billion)45.935.8???Die size (mm^2)378.6294.5???SMs7658362420GPU Shaders97287424460830722560Tensor Cores3042321449680Ray Tracing \"Cores\"7658362420Boost Clock (MHz)1455-20401350-22801230-21751470-23701605-2370VRAM Speed (Gbps)18?18?18?18?18?VRAM (GB)1612886VRAM Bus Width25619212812896L2 Cache6448323224ROPs11280483232TMUs3042321449680TFLOPS FP32 (Boost)28.3-39.720.0-33.911.3-20.09.0-14.68.2-12.1TFLOPS FP16 (FP8)226-318 (453-635)160-271 (321-542)91-160 (181-321)72-116 (145-233)66-97 (131-194)Bandwidth (GBps)576432288288216TDP (watts)80-15060-15035-11535-11535-115It's a reasonably safe bet that the desktop RTX 4070 will use the same AD104 as the RTX 4070 Ti, just with fewer SMs and shaders. Desktop RTX 4060 Ti, assuming we get that anytime soon, may or may not use AD104; the only other option would presumably be the AD106 GPU used in the mobile 4070/4060. And that's a problem.\n\nThe previous generation RTX 3060 Ti came with 8GB of GDDR6 on a 256-bit interface. We weren't particularly pleased with the lack of VRAM, especially when AMD started shipping RX 6700 XT (and later 6750 XT) with 12GB VRAM. Nvidia basically did a course correction with the RTX 3060 and gave it 12GB VRAM, making it a nice step up from the previous RTX 2060 \u2014 and even the 2060 eventually saw 12GB models, though prices made them mostly unattractive.\n\nNow we're talking about RTX 4060 most likely going back to 8GB, and that would suck. There are plenty of games now that can exceed 8GB of VRAM use, and that number will only grow in the next two years. But Nvidia doesn't have many other options, since GDDR6 and GDDR6X memory capacities top out at 2GB per 32-bit channel.\n\nThere's potential to do \"clamshell\" mode with two memory chips per channel, one on each side of the PCB, but that's pretty messy and not something we'd expect to see in a mainstream GPU. That could get the 128-bit interface up to 16GB of VRAM, which again would be odd as the higher-tier parts like the 4070 Ti only have 12GB. Still, that sounds better than an RTX 4060 8GB model to me!\n\nAnd what about the RTX 4050? Maybe Nvidia will stick with the 128-bit interface on the AD106 GPU and just skip using AD107 on a desktop part \u2014 that's basically what happened with GA107 that was almost exclusively used for laptop RTX 3050. But if it does try to use AD107 in a desktop, it would only have up to 6GB VRAM, again with clamshell VRAM being a potential out.The same AD104 GPU sits inside Nvidia's RTX 4070 Ti desktop card as well as the upcoming RTX 4080 laptop solution. (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)It's not just the memory capacities that raise some concern. We said in the RTX 4070 Ti review that performance wasn't bad, but it also wasn't amazing. It's basically a cheaper take on an RTX 3090, with half the VRAM and lower power use. The 4070 Ti gets by with 60 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) and 7680 CUDA cores (GPU shaders), slightly more than the outgoing RTX 3070 Ti. But AD106 could top out at just 40 SMs, maybe even 36 SMs, which would put it in similar territory to the RTX 3060 Ti on core counts, leaving only GPU clocks as a performance boost.\n\nPut those two things together \u2014 insufficient VRAM and relatively minor increases in GPU shader counts \u2014 and we're likely looking at modest performance improvements compared to the previous Ampere generation GPUs.\n\nNvidia will then trot out DLSS 3 performance improvements, which only apply to a subset of games and also don't offer true performance increases, and things start to sound even worse. Part of the benefit of having a GPU that can run games at 120 fps today is that, as games get more demanding, it will still be able to do 60 fps in most games a few years down the road. But what happens when those aren't real framerates?(Image credit: Nvidia)Let's assume a game running at 120 fps courtesy of DLSS 3's Frame Generation technology, with a base performance of 70 fps. All is well and good for now, but down the road the base performance will drop below 40 fps as games become more demanding, and eventually it will fall below 30 fps. What we've experienced is that Frame Generation with a base framerate of less than 30 fps still feels like sub-30 fps, even if the monitor is getting twice as many frame updates per second.\n\nThat same logic applies to higher framerates as well, so DLSS 3 at 120 fps with a 70 fps base will still feel like 70 fps, even if it looks a bit smoother to the eye. Most people won't be able to tell the difference between input rates at 70 samples per second and inputs at 120 samples per second. But when you start to fall below 40, even non-professional gamers will start to feel the difference.\n\nOr to put it more bluntly: DLSS 3 and Frame Generation are no panacea. They can help smooth out the visuals and maybe improve the feel of games a bit, but the benefit isn't going to be as noticeable as actual fully rendered frames with new user input factored in, particularly as performance drops below 60 fps.\n\nThat's not to say it's a bad technology \u2014 it's quite clever actually \u2014 and we don't mind that it exists. But Nvidia needs to stop comparing DLSS 3 scores against non-DLSS 3 results and acting like they're the same thing. Take the base framerate before Frame Generation and add maybe 10\u201320 percent and that's what a game feels like, not the 60\u2013100 percent higher fps that benchmarks will show.\n\nBack to the topic at hand, the future mainstream and budget RTX 40-series GPUs will no doubt beat the existing models in pure performance, and they'll offer DLSS 3 support as well. Hopefully Nvidia will return to prices closer to the previous generation, though, because if the RTX 4060 costs $499 and the RTX 4050 costs $399, they're going to end up being minor upgrades compared to the existing cards at those price points.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce RTX 4090\nrtx\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (31)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

I'm surprised how close together the laptop 4070, 4060, and 4050 are. The specs make it look like there won't be a meaningful difference in performance unless you step up to the 4080 -- a GPU that likely will only appear in the oversized, gaudy, overpriced gamer laptops.\n\nHopefully some manufacturer puts the 4070 in a 2-in-1 device, sells it in the USA, and prices it like other gaming laptops instead of putting it in some weird premium category. However, given what Nvidia has done on pricing, I'm not sure I want to know how expensive this year's systems are going to be.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaneInTheSky\n\n\nThere are plenty of games now that can exceed 8GB of VRAM use.\nIsn't this just because the memory is available. Many games just try to saturate the graphical memory with textures and shading code, because it's there so why no use it. A 12GB GPU might show 12GB in use, but that doesn't mean it can't run with 8GB.\n\nI haven't seen any games that need more than 8GB of VRAM at 1080p, and 1080p would be kind of the target resolution for a 4050 no.\n\nSteam shows 64% of Steam users are playing in 1080p, 11% plays in 1440p and only 2% at 4k.\n\nTo be honest, I could be wrong though, I don't follow every AAA game release. Needing more than 8GB VRAM at 1080p, just seems like...a lot.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaneInTheSky\n\n\nI looked up some of the VRAM requirements of 2022 PC games with \"demanding\" graphics (subjective).\n\nSlim pickings in 2022, I really had to dig to find any \"AAA\" 3D PC games from 2022.\n\nBut still, none of them required anything more than 8GB VRAM, even for recommended specs.\n\nThe 4050 having \"just\" 8GB VRAM seems like a non issue?\n\nVRAM requirements\n\nA Plague Tale: RequiemMinimum: 4GB VRAM\nRecommended: 8GB VRAM\n\nElden RingMinimum: 3GB VRAM\nRecommended: 8GB VRAM\n\nNeed for Speed UnboundMinimum: 4GB\nRecommended: 8GB\n\nStrayMinimum: 1GB\nRecommended: 3GB\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthestryker\n\n\nThe only game that leaps to mind which can use over 8GB (without mods etc) at 1080p is Doom Eternal. 8GB really needs to be the starting point on desktop though and the bus width that nvidia is playing with doesn't really leave them any options. Given that their charts still show the 30 series covering lower end I'm not sure nvidia is even planning lower desktop parts any time soon.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nravewulf\n\n\nAlternatively, the laptop 4060 and 4050 might both be using AD107 but the laptop 4050 gets its bus cut down to 96-bit from the full 128-bit. This would mean the desktop versions may have higher specs, as NVIDIA is already doing with the other models.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbigdragon\n\n\nPlaneInTheSky said:I haven't seen any games that need more than 8GB of VRAM at 1080p, and 1080p would be kind of the target resolution for a 4050 no.Have you considered the scenario of VR use? The 4050 is likely to be advertised as VR-ready just like the 3050 was. VR games can readily eat up tons of VRAM. While the user's primary display may be 1080p, there is a strong possibility of them plugging in a Quest headset or similar to experience VR with the power PC computing can provide.\n\nFurthermore, I don't trust big game studios to keep making games that fit within 8 GB VRAM. People said the same thing about 3 GB VRAM in the Radeon HD 7950 and 7970 being enough -- it wasn't!\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaneInTheSky\n\n\nFurthermore, I don't trust big game studios to keep making games that fit within 8 GB VRAM. \nGame developers will just target what the average user has, like they always do.\n\nOf the top 12 GPU in use by Steam users, only 1 out of those 12 has more than 8GB VRAM.\nThe average VRAM available is 6.2 GB.\n\nSteam's most popular user GPU:\nGTX 1650: 4 GB VRAM\nGTX 1060: 3 GB - 6 GB VRAM\nRTX 2060: 6 GB VRAM\nGTX 1050 Ti: 4 GB VRAM\nRTX 3060 (laptop): 6 GB VRAM\nRTX 3060: 12GB\nRTX 3070: 8 GB VRAM\nGTX 1660 SUPER: 6 GB VRAM\nRTX 3060 Ti: 8 GB VRAM\nGTX 1660 Ti: 6 GB VRAM\nGTX 1050: 4 GB VRAM\nRTX 3050: 8 GB VRAM\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJarredWaltonGPU\n\n\nthestryker said:The only game that leaps to mind which can use over 8GB (without mods etc) at 1080p is Doom Eternal. 8GB really needs to be the starting point on desktop though and the bus width that nvidia is playing with doesn't really leave them any options. Given that their charts still show the 30 series covering lower end I'm not sure nvidia is even planning lower desktop parts any time soon.From my test suite, I can assure you that Far Cry 6, Forza Horizon 5, Total War: Warhammer 3, and Watch Dogs Legion all have performance fall off at 4K with 8GB, sometimes badly. Those are just four games out of 15. At 1440p, I think most of them all do okay, but I know a few other games in the past year have pushed beyond 10GB. I think Resident Evil Village and Godfall did, for example. And yes, you can turn down some settings to get around this, but the point is that we've got 12GB on a 3060 right now, and that feels like it should be the minimum for a mainstream GPU going forward. Anything using AD106 will presumably be limited to 8GB... the same 8GB that we had standard on R9 290/290X and GTX 1070 over six years ago.\n\nAs far as Steam goes, it tracks a very large group of users, many of whom only play on older laptops, stuff like DOTA and CSGO that will run on old hardware. The fact that the top 12 is dominated by lower cost GPUs isn't at all surprising. Fortnite hardware stats would probably look the same. But there are also roughly 5% of gamers that do have GPUs with more than 8GB, and more critically, most GPUs don't have more than 8GB. Like, the list of hardware with more than 8GB currently consists of:\n\nRTX 4090\nRTX 4080\nRTX 4070 Ti\nRTX 3090 Ti\nRTX 3090\nRTX 3080 Ti\nRTX 3080 (both 12GB and 10GB)\nRTX 3060\nRTX 2080 Ti\nRTX 1080 Ti\nRX 7900 XTX\nRX 7900 XT\nRX 6950 XT\nRX 6900 XT\nRX 6800 XT\nRX 6800\nRX 6750 XT\nRX 6700 XT\nRX 6700\nRadeon VII\nArc A770 16GB\n\nOf those, only the 3060 and 6700 series are remotely mainstream, and Arc if we're gong to count that. But the point is we should be moving forward. Going from 8GB on a 256-bit interface to 8GB on a 128-bit interface will at times be a step back, or at best a step sideways.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaneInTheSky\n\n\nI strongly agree with the comment about DLS 3.0.\n\nThey're not real frames, and they introduce a delay. It adds half a frame of lag to delay the last frame and add in that interpolated frame in between.\n\nA lot of players with lower end GPU play at relatively low, or very low, framerates.\n\nFor someone with a 4080 playing at 120 fps, half a frame delay is not a big deal. It's 1/240th of a second. But for someone with a low-end GPU playing at 30 fps or below, it is a big deal. It is extra lag you simply don't really want if your FPS is already low.\n\nThe lower your framerates, the more milliseconds of lag DLSS 3.0 introduces. When a game temporarily drops to 10 fps, and you delay that latest frame even more, that just tanks response time. It's like putting the chains on an already struggling GPU.\n\nAt 30 fps DLSS 3.0 adds 1/60th of an input delay. At a struggling 10 fps DLSS 3.0 adds 1/20th of a second of delay, that's an extra 50 milliseconds of lag, and you're definitely going to notice that, stutters in games will seem much worse.\n\nI truly hope Nvidia is not going to pull out the \"DLSS 3.0\" fanfare if they make a desktop 4050 or 4060, because that extra bit of lag DLSS 3.0 introduces is negligeable at 120fps, but is a problem at 30fps and below.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthestryker\n\n\nJarredWaltonGPU said:From my test suite, I can assure you that Far Cry 6, Forza Horizon 5, Total War: Warhammer 3, and Watch Dogs Legion all have performance fall off at 4K with 8GB, sometimes badly.

We're probably still going to see 6GB desktop cards too which just shouldn't be happening anymore. I certainly agree it's a problem and it is only going to get worse as we move along.\n\nJarredWaltonGPU said:As far as Steam goes, it tracks a very large group of users, many of whom only play on older laptops, stuff like DOTA and CSGO that will run on old hardware.

Israel-based Mobileye may have won early credibility among automakers like BMW, Nissan, Volkswagen, and China's Zeekr, but it's not the only chipmaker eager to claim their share of the autonomous vehicle hype.\nAt GTC last fall, Nvidia unveiled its next-generation autonomous driving platform called Drive Thor. Based on the company's Hopper microarchitecture, the system will reportedly deliver 2,000 TOPS (trillion operations per second) of inferencing performance when it rolls out to automakers in 2025. That's about the time Mobileye plans to launch its sixth-gen EyeQ chips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm's Snapdragon Ride Flex SoC, announced at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Vegas this week, is expected to hit the road a year earlier. Much like Nvidia's Drive Thor, the chip integrates multiple vehicle domains, like infotainment, ADAS, and autonomous driving into a single platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a Gartner report from September, these autonomous vehicle AI chips, which ingest and process the streaming data from vehicle sensors, are among the more accessible technologies necessary to realize the dream of fully autonomous vehicles in the near term, but they're only part of the equation.\nQualcomm, Nvidia gain share, steal customers\nIn the six years since Intel acquired Mobileye for $15 billion, the division has gained steady traction, growing revenues quarter over quarter often by double-digit margins. After much anticipation, Intel spun off the division in an initial public offering (IPO) last October. However, the IPO mustered just $16 billion, a fraction of the nearly $50 billion valuation the division had hoped to fetch earlier in the year.\nDespite a somewhat lackluster entrance to the public market, the company still leads Nvidia and Qualcomm, at least when it comes to revenues. During Mobileye's first quarter as a publicly traded company, it posted revenues of $450 million. Including the three quarters leading up to the company's IPO, its 2022 revenues topped $1.66 billion. By comparison, Qualcomm's automotive business managed $1.4 billion, while Nvidia's netted just $566 million during the 2022 fiscal year.\n\nTesla driver blames full-self-driving software for eight-car Thanksgiving Day pile up\nWaymo self-driving robotaxi goes rogue with passenger inside, escapes support staff\nIntel's Mobileye unveils first 'production-grade fully electric self-driving vehicle,' partners with Sixt for Munich launch\nWhen the chips fall: Intel preps for $16b Mobileye IPO\n\nAnd while Shashua was quick to highlight the company's $17 billion in bookings, Qualcomm claims its order pipeline is nearly twice that with General Motors, Renault, Volkswagen, and BMW lining up to purchase its Snapdragon Ride Flex platform.\nIf some of those names sound familiar, that's because many of the same companies buying Mobileye's products today are also eyeing its competitors. Nvidia is also poised to steal customer share away from Mobileye. During his keynote Thursday, Shashua touted automaker Zeekr, which has already put 70,000 vehicles using its ADAS platform on the road. But, as we learned at GTC, Zeekr was also one of Nvidia's launch partners for Drive Thor.\nRobotaxis first, autonomous vehicles later\nInterest in autonomous vehicles is gaining momentum quickly, stoked by ever-improving ADAS systems, like Tesla's Autopilot or GM's Super Cruise.\nLooking ahead, Gartner predicts that by 2028, the number of assisted autonomous vehicles \u2013 think lane keeping, automatic cruise control, and braking \u2013 will increase to just under 75 percent, up from 60 percent in 2020.\nAnalysts expect more capable systems, which Gartner refers to as partially autonomous, will jump from 1.5 percent of vehicles in 2020 to a quarter of all vehicles by 2030. This class reflects the kinds of hands-off autonomous driving capabilities available in some premium vehicles today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere Gartner expects to see the most advanced, fully autonomous systems first isn't in a vehicle you'll be able to buy. Instead, analysts believe that the first fully autonomous vehicles will show up in the form of robotaxis. Today a handful of companies have fielded autonomous taxis, usually with a driver on board as a failsafe. Waymo and Sixt are just two examples. By 2025, Gartner expects robotaxis will be fairly common with services available in at least 25 cities in North America.\nBut just like autonomous vehicles, robotaxis face safety concerns. In 2021, a Waymo robotaxi went rogue, evading support staff, while Autopilot-related crashes continue to be a source of controversy for Tesla's Muskmobiles. \u00ae \nGet our Tech Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Automotive\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                CES\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Intel\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Automotive\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                CES\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Intel\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Qualcomm\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Alder Lake\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                BMW\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Electric vehicle\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Ford\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Mobileye\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Pat Gelsinger\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Snapdragon\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                vPro\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                x86\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Xen\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                FPGA\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n                    COMMENTS\n            \n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Automotive\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                CES\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Intel\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Automotive\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                CES\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Intel\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Qualcomm\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Alder Lake\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                BMW\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Electric vehicle\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Ford\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Mobileye\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Pat Gelsinger\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Snapdragon\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                vPro\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                x86\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Xen\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                FPGA\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP US OFF\nSend us news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther stories you might like\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIntel's new CEO: Chip world veteran Lip-Bu Tan\nRestoring x86 giant to its former glory, a job no one will envy\n\nSystems12 Mar 2025 | 18\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIntel cranks up accelerators in Xeon 6 blitz to outgun AMD\nBut you're probably not cool enough for Chipzilla's 288-core monster\n\nSystems24 Feb 2025 | 3\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWanna save Intel?

So, I went on a quest for a case capable of accepting the HUGE graphics card.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJose Antunes\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nJanuary 11, 2023\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nIf you thought the RTX 3080 from NVIDIA was big, then think again: the RTX 4090 is a monster. Even cases that housed the previous generation will not be enough for the RTX 4090.\nWith the previous generation of NVIDIA cards, buying a card, be it the RTX 3080 or RTX 3090, was a challenging task, as there was a shortage of both versions and some people had to wait months to get their hands on the card they wanted. I remember, then, that we first had a MSI Suprim 3080 card that would not fit inside my case, a model which I believed was fit for most of the modern graphics cards. At the time I had to set for another MSI RTX 3080, the Gaming Trio X, that was available and\u2026 would fit my case.\nThe Corsair Carbide 300R accepts 450mm graphics cards, but they can not be the size of the RTX 4090\u2026\nMy case for the RTX 3080 PC build, in case you\u2019re wondering, is the Corsair Carbide 300R, which Corsair sells with this: \u201cGreat systems start with a great case, and Carbide Series 300R provides a remarkable number of features in a compact chassis. Easy access, lots of room for expansion, and superior cooling make the 300R an excellent choice for building powerful PCs that don\u2019t take up a lot of room.\u201d\nI hate big computer cases and because of that the Carbide 300R was \u2013 and still is \u2013 a great solution. In fact, it has lasted long, as it was bought for a PC built before the RTX 3080, housing a RTX 2070 that fitted perfectly in the space available for graphics cards. I used to laugh at my son\u2019s Nox Hummer PC case, which I used to say was so big we could not invite his girlfriend to stay over\u2026 but when the MSI RTX 3080 Suprim arrived he was the one to laugh, as his case was big enough for the card and mine wasn\u2019t. I had to wait for the smaller MSI RTX 3080 Gaming Trio X to be available, as it was the only one I would be able to fit in my case.\nNo way would I be able to fit the new RTX 4090 inside the black Corsair Carbide 300R\nNot a problem of length\nAs a footnote, let me say that may son has changed recently to a more \u201cfriendly\u201d \u2013 in terms of footprint \u2013 solution, a white case from LIAN LI, provider of some interesting cases. He has the LANCOOL-II-Mesh-rgb, a medium case in white (also available in black) that I\u2019ve looked at with some envy, not because of the RGB lights but because of its design, inside space and cooling options. Still, when I think of it, I never cared much about cases, I always looked for a solution that would fit my needs, one of them being enough space to fit all I needed. Until now\u2026\nThis time there was no need to wait for graphics cards to be available: I ordered a RTX 4090 MSI Gaming Trio X \u2013 as I am happy with the RTX 3080 I bought from MSI \u2013 and was told delivery would take a matter of days. Having decided I would keep my previous build, using an Intel i7-9700K that continues to be a good all-rounder, I imagined that I would simply remove my RTX 3080 and fit the RTX 4090. The more I thought about it, the more I believed it would not work.\nThe LANCOOL III with the RTX 4090 (left) and with the RTX 3080 (right)\nCorsair does say that the Carbide 300R is designed to accept a maximum GPU length (mm) of 450mm, so the MSI RTX 4090 Gaming Trio X, which has 337mm, should fit well inside the case. But I had my doubts, as I already had trouble to fit the RTX 3080, not in terms of length, but height, inside the Corsair case. After a couple of days measuring everything, comparing specifications online, I decided I was not going to risk it and ordered a new PC case, that I would pick myself at my supplier.\nThe LIAN LI LANCOOL III is a mid-tower that will allow you to have a system with multiple disks, both HDD and SSD while still leaving the center space free for everything else. It\u2019s a dream case and not so much bigger than the Carbide 300R\nThe last case in town\nThat was the best decision I made. After looking around for a solution I opted for the LANCOOL-III-Mesh from LIAN LI, which is the version after the one my son has. The LANCOOL III, is, according to the company, \u201cthe premium mid-tower chassis, offers better thermal performance than LANCOOL II by including 4 pre-installed 140mm PWM fans, and featuring fine mesh panels designed to ensure ample airflow is delivered to the high-end components while the system runs at peak performance.\u201d\nMy version does not have any RGB fans\u2026 but my new RTX 4090 does have a rainbow of colors, which are more subtle that the disco-looking lights in my son\u2019s PC case\u2026 and are turned away from me. I carried the LANCOOL III \u2013 which was the last one available in the shop \u2013 home and started to transfer my PC build from the Corsair Carbide 300R into its new home.\nI\u2019ve decided to keep my previous build running until I choose which new Intel CPU from the 13th generation I will buy, so it made sense to move the previous build to the new case, also because I wanted to do some tests to see what I\u2019ve gained by simply moving from the RTX 3080 to the RTX 4090, as my results may interest others who want to keep their older CPUs running for a while more. That\u2019s for another article; right now, I want to share the experience of having to buy a new case.\nTwo problems with most PC cases: height and width\nRight when I was at the end of moving components between cases, the RTX 4090 arrived and it was tempting to install it\u2026 but I decided to wait, to go ahead with the Cinebench and other tests on the RTX 3080. When I unpacked the RTX 4090 just to look at it, I immediately found out that it would not fit in my Carbide 300R, and as I suspected, it\u2019s not a problem of length\u2026 but height. The RTX 4090 has 77mm, and the 56mm of the RTX 3080 left no free vertical space available inside the case.\nThat\u2019s a problem many people will face and there is another problem too: as the connection to the RTX 40 series needs an adapter, you need to have a case with a larger width that many of the slim cases people buy. The Corsair Carbide 300R has dimensions of 485mm x 210mm x 449mm and the LIAN LI LANCOOL III has 523mm x 238mm x 526 mm. The difference between 210mm and 238mm suggests that I would not be able to plug the cable in place, even if I could fit the RTX 4090 inside the Carbide 300R. The cable is almost touching the glass windowpane on the LANCOOL III\u2026\nThe images published here \u2013 captured with my Samsung S22 Ultra while working \u2013 \u00a0give you an idea of how the same build and components fits inside the Carbide 300R and the LANCOOL III. I also show how the LANCOOL III looks with the RTX 4090 inside. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the Carbide 300R is an excellent Corsair PC case \u2013 and I will continue to use it for a second PCVR I want to build in 2023, but no way would I be able to use it for the MONSTER that the RTX 4090 is. It\u2019s not just size, it\u2019s also power, but that\u2019s something for another article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSupport ProVideo Coalition\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShop with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilmtools\nFilmmakers go-to destination for pre-production, production & post production equipment!\nShop Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCorsair Carbide 300R\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGeForce\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGeForce RTX\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLANCOOL III\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIAN LI\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnvidia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNVIDIA RTX 4090\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRTX 3080\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRTX 40\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trtx 4090\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nWhat Do You Think?

No, it\u2019s not a long-forgotten memory\u2014this GPU launched in 2022. It has a new challenger in the freshly released Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti. Well, Sort of.\u00a0\nThe $1,999 MSRP of said RTX 3090 Ti dwarfs the $799 price tag of the RTX 4070 Ti, upon first glance. There\u2019s much more than meets the eye here, however, involving myriad GPU-market \u201cpricing woes.\u201d Furthermore, while Nvidia reckons that the RTX 4070 Ti can meet or beat the RTX 3090 Ti performance wise, there are some big caveats.\u00a0\n\n\nYou\u2019ll want to check out Brad Chacos\u2019s excellent review of the RTX 4070 Ti for an in depth look, too.\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll discuss the price, performance, and important things to know about these two GPUs. They were each launched to an entirely different market segment upon their initial release, but the new-generation tech on the RTX 4070 Ti brings them closer to parity. Let\u2019s find out if the newcomer is actually better!\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 4070 Ti vs. Nvidia RTX 3090 Ti: Price\n\n\n\n\nThiago Trevisan\nThe Nvidia RTX 3090 Ti will likely go down as one of the worst performance-to-value propositions in recent GPU history. $1,999 stings, even today\u2014especially with the doubly more performant RTX 4090 being $1,599 mere months later. Ouch.\u00a0\nIt also released in early 2022, at a time when the GPU demand was on decline, making it available when no one wanted to buy it. After a few price reductions, it ended up at around $1,099 MSRP. This was too little, too late.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEnter the Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti, priced at $799. Targeting a completely different market segment, it still shares some attributes with the RTX 3090 Ti. It has similar performance in certain areas\u2014but it remains unpopular due to it being priced higher than what you\u2019d expect from a \u201c70 class\u201d GPU. The 4070 Ti may get close to the 3090 Ti performance at much lower wattage, but the price is unfortunately a sticking point for both GPUs. It\u2019s a draw here!\nNvidia RTX 4070 Ti vs. 3090 Ti: Performance\n\n\n\n\nThiago Trevisan\nThis is the meat and potatoes of this discussion\u2014performance. At 1440p and using Nvidia\u2019s DLSS 3, the RTX 4070 Ti puts up impressive numbers against the RTX 3090 Ti. But when we consider that it only has 12GB of VRAM with memory bus width limitations at 4K, it\u2019s less enticing. It does have a significantly lower TDP power output than the RTX 3090 Ti, which helps its performance.\n\n\nThe following performance graphs were taken from Brad Chacos\u2019 4070 Ti review. The RTX 3090 Ti was not available for testing at that time, so we will reference the original RTX 3090. Know that the RTX 3090 Ti is on average about 8 to 10 percent faster, so keep that in mind when we\u2019re discussing the comparison so you can better understand how the performance stacks up. The original RTX 3090 is an apt starting point since it was the \u201coriginal\u201d top GPU before the Ti version came out.\n\n\n\n\nFrom Brad Chacos\u2019 4070 Ti review. Brad Chacos\nStarting with Cyberpunk 2077, the RTX 4070 Ti gets up to 102fps at 1440p, which beats the regular RTX 3090\u2019s 90fps. The RTX 3090 Ti being 8 to 10 percent better than the RTX 3090 would land it right around the 100fps mark\u2014so within the margin of error for the RTX 4070 Ti, an impressive showing. The 70-class GPU often does put up a good showing against the previous flagship. The much better priced Nvidia RTX 3070 at $499 put up a good fight against the $1,199 2080 Ti previous generation. While the 4070 Ti is more expensive, so is the RTX 3090 Ti\u2014and both show how much the pricing has increased in such a short amount of time.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos\nIt\u2019s a similar story with the new Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. The 4070 Ti maintains equal or better footing with both the RTX 3090, and the 3090 Ti. It beats the original RTX 3090 across all three resolutions.\u00a0The 3090 Ti, being 8 to 10 percent faster than the RTX 3090 almost precisely matches the RTX 4070 Ti performance here\u2014and in some cases, the RTX 4070 Ti even comes out slightly ahead. The 12GB limitation does not yet show to be much of an issue, especially with ray tracing off and 1440p. If this resolution is your targeted goal, you\u2019ll be able to achieve fairly high frame rates in most titles and with high or ultra settings on the RTX 4070 Ti. Of course, ray tracing varies by title, and it always manages to put the hurt on any GPU that dares attempt to showcase its beautiful lighting and shadows!\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos\nLooking at Cyberpunk 2077 again\u2014this time with ray tracing and DLSS\u2014the performance differences are fairly similar to the non-ray traced numbers, showing areas where the 4070 Ti certainly has the chops. 1440p is the sweet spot for this GPU\u2014and it can outperform the last generation\u2019s top end without an issue. DLSS further improves performance, and the gap would widen if this became DLSS 3.0 where RTX 40 GPUs have a big advantage.\u00a0\n\n\nYou would have to start pushing 4K, ray tracing, and ticking all the boxes to really start to see the 4070 Ti struggle\u2014especially with its more limited memory bus and 12GB of VRAM. The RTX 3090 Ti does not face these issues, but at 1440p, the RTX 4070 Ti puts up a valiant effort.\nThe important thing to keep an eye on is DLSS 3. As of right now, RTX 40-series GPUs such as the RTX 4070 Ti are the only ones that can take advantage of this technology. It combines DLSS with Nvidia\u2019s Frame Generation AI tech to potentially double on-screen frame rates, plus Nvidia Reflex to lower latency.\u00a0In single-player games such as Flight Simulator 2020, it\u2019s a huge benefit\u2014and one that will widen the performance gap as more titles are added and performance is improved.\u00a0\n\nLastly, and this is semi-sarcastic: You can\u2019t SLI/NVLink two RTX 4070 Ti GPUs. You can do that with the RTX 3090 Ti, for what it\u2019s worth. (And not much: SLI/NVLink is basically defunct for gaming uses.)\nFor content creation, the RTX 3090 Ti likely can still have a big performance advantage due to its 24GB of fast VRAM. This will vary by use case and particular application, but the RTX 4070 Ti is also no slouch in many creative uses (just don\u2019t tax its memory as much as with the RTX 3090 Ti\u2014it won\u2019t like it!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RTX 4070 Ti is much more efficient than the RTX 3090 Ti in terms of power consumption.\nThiago Trevisan\nNvidia RTX 4070 Ti vs. 3090 Ti: Power and other things to know\nRight off the bat, the RTX 4070 Ti crushes the RTX 3090 Ti when it comes to efficiency. You\u2019ll have to cool down a 450W TDP with the RTX 3090 Ti, versus a reasonable 285W TDP for the RTX 4070 Ti.\nThis translates to huge efficiency gains, and a much cooler-running GPU with the RTX 4070 Ti. Of course, part of this is due to having half the VRAM and reduced memory specs compared to the RTX 3090 Ti.\u00a0The chart below shows us the 350W TDP RTX 3090, which the RTX 4070 Ti beats in almost every gaming scenario. The RTX 3090 Ti is not on that graph, but it has a 450W TDP\u2014100W more than this RTX 3090. The RTX 4070 Ti still manages to often match this higher-power GPU, too! Truly impressive numbers with its efficiency gains over last generation.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos\nIn terms of physical cooler size, the RTX 3090 Ti was one of the biggest we had seen up to that point\u2014dwarfed only by the recent RTX 4090. The RTX 4070 Ti is also significantly large, since many models may share the same cooler design as their bigger siblings in the RTX 4000. This will result in GPUs that may be difficult to properly fit in smaller cases. As a bonus, the cooling performance will often be overkill on the RTX 4070 Ti.\n\n\n\n\nThiago Trevisan\nNvidia RTX 4070 Ti vs. RTX 3090 Ti: The verdict\nWhile these GPUs look very different on the surface, they share some important similarities. They both come during the decline of the GPU market, making their respective MSRPs bad values.\u00a0\n\n\nThe RTX 3090 Ti was the top dog at $1,999\u2014at a time when the RTX 4090 was just months away, at $1,599. This short-lived position resulted in plentiful stock on store shelves. The $799 RTX 4070 Ti is targeted at a different market segment\u2014but the results are similar: The GPUs have been abundantly in stock, and gamers feel that for a 1440p GPU with 12GB of VRAM, this price point is too high.\u00a0\nThey\u2019re both also very similar when it comes to many performance metrics\u2014with a steady back and forth in many games at 1440p. 4K is where the reduced memory specs of the RTX 4070 Ti can rear its ugly head, but it maintains some sanity with the inclusion of DLSS 3.0. It\u2019s much more efficient than the RTX 3090 Ti, too.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, neither of these GPUs can truly be crowned a winner in this matchup. While they perform reasonably well for their intended audience, their pricing has not been accepted by gamers. Due to this, any shortcomings they possess become glaring pitfalls\u2014and they\u2019re mostly staying on the shelves until prices come down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 4070 Ti\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Thiago Trevisan, Contributor, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\nThiago Trevisan is a Mac and PC enthusiast for over 20 years, and has written for PCWorld and Macworld since 2021.

Prices from both companies are still putting the hurt on gamer wallets and these are no exception.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe $899 MSRP of the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT did not fare well against its much faster $999 Radeon RX 7900 XTX big brother. Nvidia, for its part, had to \u201crelaunch\u201d the RTX 4080 12GB as the $100-cheaper $799 GeForce RTX 4070 Ti after a terrible reception to the original version. As you can see, both parties have an uphill battle to gain your gaming dollar.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe\u2019ll talk about the price, gaming performance, and vital things to be aware of. Both GPUs promise to give you excellent 1440p performance, together with next-gen tech such as ray tracing, FSR, and DLSS 3. Is the \u201csky high\u201d pricing too much to stomach, or can one of these graphics\u2019 powerhouses convince you to part ways with your hard-earned cash? Let\u2019s find out!\nNvidia RTX 4070 Ti vs. AMD RX 7900 XT: Price\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 4070 Ti.Thiago Trevisan\nGood news: You can readily find both the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti and Radeon 7900 XT in stock across most retailers. Bad news: You\u2019re not going to like the price.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe $899 AMD 7900 XT came out first, and its performance seems rather cut down in comparison to the much more powerful Radeon RX 7900 XTX at just $100 more. The 7900 XTX has been much more difficult to find in stock, leading many buyers with only the 7900 XT as an option.\u00a0\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti, priced at $799, is a $100 discount from its initial conception: a $899 RTX 4080 12GB. After Nvidia\u2019s unusual change of plans, we\u2019re left with the RTX 4070 Ti as the cheapest next-generation option. Keep in mind the RTX 3070 Ti was $599, so this is a hefty $200 bump in price after one generation (and the 3070 Ti was a terrible value in its own right).\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNvidia's cheapest next-gen option\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 4070 Ti\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s another key takeaway from MSRP pricing: There will be far more RTX 4070 Ti\u2019s available at $849 and above, rather than the base $799 MSRP. The Nvidia add-in board partners have historically lower margins, so they\u2019re happy to sell you an upgraded \u201cOverclocked\u201d model for an upcharge. There is also no \u201cFounders Edition\u201d version such as with the other RTX 40 series GPUs from Nvidia. Those have traditionally been priced at base MSRP.\u00a0\nAMD\u2019s 7900 XT can typically be found a little bit easier for its $899 MSRP, but the same market forces can lead to its partner models being more expensive.\u00a0\n\n\nOverall, gamers are not especially happy with the pricing on either product\u2014showcased by their ample availability on store shelves.\nNvidia RTX 4070 Ti vs. AMD RX 7900 XT: Performance\n\n\n\n\nThe 7900 XT (middle) is tiny compared to the RTX 4080!\nThiago Trevisan\nBoth GPUs make the most sense at 1440p, but they can certainly perform at 4K resolutions with some caveats.\u00a0Brad Chacos brought up a great point in his Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti review: The RTX 4070 Ti only has 12GB of VRAM with a much slower memory bus width\u2014which can bottleneck in some 4K titles. The Radeon RX 7900 XT, with its ample 20GB of VRAM, won\u2019t have this issue. That\u2019s certainly a nice advantage on the hardware side for AMD.\n\n\n\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077 results for RTX 4070 Ti and RX 7900 XT. Brad Chacos\nStarting with native Cyberpunk 2077 (ray tracing and DLSS/FSR off), the RTX 4070 Ti suffers a serious defeat against the RX 7900 XT. At 1440p, the 102fps of the former is blown out of the water by the 121fps of the 7900 XT. That\u2019s a whopping 17 percent frames-per-second difference, and the 7900 XT is only 11 percent more expensive. 4K also goes to the 7900 XT\u2014with 61fps beating 49fps. In other words, only the 7900 XT hits the magical 4K 60fps threshold in Cyberpunk 2077.\n\n\n\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 results for RTX 4070 Ti and RX 7900 XT. Brad Chacos\nNext up is the new Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. AMD GPUs have been doing great in this game, and the 7900 XT is no exception. The 4070 Ti has one of its worst defeats here, with massive fps chasms between them. 1440p shows us 178fps versus 130fps, with the 7900 XT taking a dominating lead. The other resolutions are similar\u2014it\u2019s not even close.\u00a0\n\n\nIf this is one of your favorite games, it\u2019s obvious that AMD does huge numbers here\u2014even the older 6900 XT isn\u2019t too far off the 4070 Ti\u2019s  pace! If the Call of Duty series is your forte, you\u2019ll likely skew towards AMD as the GPU of choice.\n\n\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077 results with ray tracing for RTX 4070 Ti and RX 7900 XT. Brad Chacos\nLet\u2019s go back to Cyberpunk 2077, and this time with ray tracing. Nvidia\u2019s hardware has a big advantage in ray tracing. Here, we finally see the RTX 4070 Ti score a victory. At 1440p, both GPUs dip below 60fps with ray tracing on. The RTX 4070 Ti maintains (kind of) playable 48fps, which is more than the 37fps the RX 7900 XT can muster.\u00a0\n\nWhether ray tracing is \u201cworth it\u201d to you is subjective\u2014but when implemented well, it does offer some beautiful effects. Other times, it\u2019s not as noticeable. One thing that isn\u2019t subjective: The performance penalty that it imposes on hardware.\nA big answer to that is Nvidia\u2019s DLSS, and AMD\u2019s FSR upscaling technologies. These promise higher frame rates, while allowing you to tick on more of the eye candy. In Cyberpunk 2077, this brings the RTX 4070 Ti to a more palpable 88fps. Likewise, the balanced setting also brings the RX 7900 XT to 70fps\u2014much more playable, but well behind Nvidia\u2019s GPU. Cyberpunk 2077 will also implement DLSS 3 in the future\u2014which should bring even more frames to the table with Nvidia\u2019s Ai frame generation tech. AMD also has FSR 3 in the pipeline, but currently only FSR 2.1 works with Cyberpunk.\u00a0\n\n\nTo sum up the performance on hand here: The AMD RX 7900 XT has a big lead over the RTX 4070 Ti in regular rasterized performance. This means when ray tracing and DLSS are switched off, the pure brute force of the 7900 XT will wipe the floor with the RTX 4070 Ti. The ray tracing performance of the 7900 XT isn\u2019t terrible, either\u2014it still lags behind, but has come a long way this generation.\nIf you factor in ray tracing and DLSS 3, especially if the game you play supports it, that may balance the conversation more. The $100 cheaper price of the Nvidia GPU is also a plus, but we can\u2019t ignore the performance of the 7900 XT\u2014it\u2019s the clear winner for this category.\n\n\n\n\n\nStand proud, 7900 XT. You\u2019re one fast GPU! Thiago Trevisan\nNvidia RTX 4070 Ti vs. AMD RX 7900 XT: Power and other things to know\nEfficiency matters when you\u2019re putting out several hundred watts of performance. The Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti takes the cake here, with a 285W TDP compared to the 300W TDP of the 7900 XT. Overall, both are fairly close, as per Brad Chacos\u2019s graph below. The 7900 XT does offer better performance in general, so it wins out on that front. The 4070 Ti does have DLSS 3 in some titles, where it can really perform well\u2014but that\u2019s a narrower use case. When looking at the 450W TDP of the RTX 3090 Ti, both GPUs certainly impress with their efficiency gains.\n\n\n\n\nPower draw results for RTX 4070 Ti and RX 7900 XT.\nBrad Chacos\nBetter efficiency means smaller GPU cooler designs, right? Sort of\u2014but not always. The reference AMD RX 7900 XT has a svelte cooler, with only double 8-pin PCIe power. Third-party add-in board (AIB) models can have much larger coolers, however. The RTX 4070 Ti does not have a \u201cFounders Edition\u201d version made by Nvidia, so you\u2019re stuck with the AIB coolers. Some have similar designs to the large RTX 4080-style versions, so you\u2019ll typically still be dealing with some big brawlers here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThiago Trevisan\nIf you\u2019re worried about any thermal issues, both GPUs typically run very cool. The reference 7900 XT was not affected by some of the quality-control issues that plagued the bigger 7900 XTX\u2019s reference-only coolers, so nothing to worry about here. Likewise, the power adapters on the RTX 4070 Ti are also fine. Just remember to plug them in carefully and thoroughly (the RTX 4090\u2019s issues were found to simply be users not fully inserting the adapter all the way in).\nNvidia RTX 4070 Ti vs. AMD RX 7900 XT: Verdict\nIt\u2019s hard to argue against some of the performance that both GPUs are putting out\u2014especially at 1440p and 4K.\u00a0 Efficiency is also impressive, putting last-generation top-dog GPUs to shame.\u00a0\nWhile the 7900 XT is certainly the performance favorite here for most titles without ray tracing, it\u2019s hard to crown a true winner. GPU pricing has rapidly reached prices that seem downright unreasonable. The RTX 4070 Ti does offer decent ray tracing goodies and DLSS 3 can be huge if the game you\u2019re playing supports it. At $799, it\u2019s cheaper than the 7900 XT, but we\u2019re starting off at an already exorbitant price level, which makes it unappealing. The $999 7900 XTX looks much better than either for your dollars, but it\u2019s also more expensive.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAMD's more powerful (and pricey) alternative\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nRadeon RX 7900 XTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$1,148.95 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\nSo there\u2019s no clear winner here. We\u2019d suggest waiting a bit for prices to stabilize, as it\u2019s been a tumultuous time. Nvidia and AMD are still reacting on-the-fly to the overabundance of previous-generation GPUs still needing to be cleared out of inventory. This clearly has had an impact on next-gen pricing. \n\n\nThis is an \u201cout of the ordinary\u201d transition period, and we know saying to just \u201cwait it out\u201d isn\u2019t always a viable option for those needing a GPU now\u2014but now you have the information you need to make a smart purchase if you do need a new GPU right now..\u00a0\nWith more GPU releases this year encompassing the rest of the lineup, we may also see better pricing to do more availability. You may want to hold on to your current GPU for just a little longer\u2014things should improve.\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Thiago Trevisan, Contributor, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\nThiago Trevisan is a Mac and PC enthusiast for over 20 years, and has written for PCWorld and Macworld since 2021.

The problem is to find the cable, which is \u201cout of stock\u201d.\nThe stories about power cables burning with the NVIDIA RTX 4090 graphics cards made September and October \u201chot\u201d months online, with people claiming NVIDIA was responsible, to which the company replied, in November, this: \u201cOur findings to date suggest that a common issue is that connectors are not fully plugged into the graphics card. To help ensure the connector is secure we recommend plugging the power dongle into the graphics card first to ensure it\u2019s firmly and evenly plugged in, before plugging the graphics card into the motherboard.\u201d\nWith so many news going round of burning, and melting of cables and cards, the website Gamers Nexus made an extensive investigation into the matter and reached a conclusion: there are three reasons for the failures documented. In fact, they do admit that there may be more but the three (or 2+1) most common were easy to pinpoint: potential design flaws, foreign object debris in manufacturing and user error. The appearance of debris, Gamers Nexus notes, \u201cseems uncommon\u201d but is a cause, and that was true for both adapter cables and unadapted ones.\nUser error seating the cable may be, it appears, a key reason. That\u2019s the reason why Gamers Nexus notes that on the user error front one thing should always be remembered: even if your cable doesn\u2019t start fully unseated and is only partly unseated, it can work its way loose over time if you move cables around, do some cleanup, move the system, and that may lead to a problem.\nUser error and small PC cases\nThis is true with the adapters that allow users to connect three different PCI-E cables from their PSU to the 12VHPWR / PCIe 5.0 power connector on the side of these graphics cards, which is part of the upcoming ATX 3.0 power supply specification and the reason why NVIDIA changed the connectors with this series. The final video from Gamers Nexus (November 16) about the problem, which we suggest ProVideo Coalition readers watch, shows what\u2019s really happening and points that failure can happen with any cable or adapter.\nThe adapter included with the NVIDIA RTX 40 series\nNow, one thing Gamers Nexus says is that users should also be aware of cables, or adapters that even if properly seated are at an angle, as that may create more problems. That\u2019s something I felt could happen when I built a recent machine around a RTX 4090. I wrote, then that owners of slim cases may have a problem, as connecting the cables to the RTX 4090 card with an adapter creates an extra length of the cable that needs larger space inside the case. Even if I could fit the RTX 4090 inside my Corsair Carbide 300R case, I would not be able to connect the cable as the width of the case is not enough to fit the cable and adapter. In fact, even on my new LIAN LI LANCOOL III case the cable is almost touching the glass windowpane.\n\nWhile the RTX 4090 uses a new 12+4 pin 12VHPWR power connector, all cards ship with a PCI-e 8-pin power to 12VHPWR adapter. I am using in my new PC build, about which I\u2019ve written here at PVC before, the adapter that came with my MSI RTX 4090, to which I connect three PCI-e cables coming from the PSU, but what I really would like to have is a cable that\u00a0 does not need any adapter, and because my PSU is from Corsair, I looked at the official CORSAIR 12VHPWR 600W cable compatible with all CORSAIR type-4 PSUs, that was announced last September.\nCORSAIR\u2019s official cable is MIA\nThis cable connects directly to the PSU via the existing PSU-side connectors for unfettered power straight for your new graphics card \u2013 no PCIe adapter required. With sense-wires configured to 600W, your graphics card will know it\u2019s able to draw its maximum power load, says Corsair, adding that \u201cthere\u2019s no need to wait for future PSUs to support Intel\u2019s new ATX 3.0 standard and CORSAIR\u2019s power supplies already provide the needed reliability and quality components to support the higher power needs of the next generation of PC hardware. Whether it\u2019s an RM1000 that\u2019s seen many builds, or a brand new HX1500i, you can depend on your CORSAIR PSU to power your graphics cards into the future.\u201d\n\n\nAccording to Corsair, a graphics card like the RTX 4090 requires an 850W CORSAIR PSU or higher. RTX 4080 graphics cards require a 750W CORSAIR PSU or higher. To confirm if your PSU is compatible with the CORSAIR 12VHPWR 600W PSU cable, check the compatibility chart available at Corsair\u2019s website. Be warned, though: the chart is not easy to decipher!\n\nMy problem, though, is that the official CORSAIR 12VHPWR 600W cable is nowhere to be seen. It\u2019s constantly \u201cout of stock\u201d,\u00a0 despite the company saying, early September, \u201cthat the cable is available to order immediately from the CORSAIR webstore. Orders will ship beginning September 29th.\u201d It\u2019s hard to find in USA and over here, in Europe, it\u2019s even more difficult than it was to buy a RTX 30-series a couple of years ago. A supplier I asked about the availability timing for the cable, because they\u2019ve a note \u201cout of stock\u201d on their website, told me that they expect to have the cable in March, hopefully. Why announce a cable if it\u2019s not going to be available?\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSupport ProVideo Coalition\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShop with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilmtools\nFilmmakers go-to destination for pre-production, production & post production equipment!\nShop Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIAN LI LANCOOL III\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSI RTX 4090\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnvidia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNVIDIA GPU\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNVIDIA RTX 3080\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNVIDIA RTX 4090\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nWhat Do You Think?

The RTX 4070 will be the fourth card in NVIDIA's RTX 4000 lineup which was announced last September. The company initially launched only the RTX 4090 and the RTX 4080 before making the RTX 4070 Ti available for purchase earlier this month. Following the RTX 4070 release, NVIDIA is also expected to announce the even more affordable RTX 4060. \nMarketing pictures related to the RTX 4070 Ti were posted online by GPU-maker Galax, with one of the images clearly showing an RTX 4070 retail box. The images have since been removed, but not before VideoCardz was able to grab a few screenshots. Curiously, the packages seem to mention the RTX 4070 Ti on the side and the top, suggesting the 4070 branding could be a mistake. Something else pointing to the fact that this could be a mistake is the design of the card itself. An image of the card next to the 'RTX 4070' box shows a triple-slot behemoth, which is a little surprising for what would essentially be a mid-range product.\nRelated: NVIDIA RTX 4060 Ti Leak Reveals 4,352 CUDA Cores & 8GB Memory \n                        NVIDIA's RTX 4070 Graphics Card\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Courtesy: Galax (Via VideoCardz)\n\n\n\nWhile things seem to indicate that the RTX 4070 branding at the front of the Galax retail boxes is an error, it shows that the company is preparing RTX 4070 marketing material along with the RTX 4070 Ti promos. If that is true, it would suggest that the RTX 4070 is in the pipeline and is likely launching soon. There are plenty of leaks and rumors that the RTX 4070 will be released in Q1, 2023, so the confusion is understandable.\nRumors suggest that the RTX 4070 will be based on the AD104 GPU like the 4070 Ti, but in a watered-down avatar, with only 46 out of 60 streaming multiprocessors (SM) enabled. The card is expected to have 5,888 CUDA cores, a significant drop from the 7,680 of the 4070Ti. It is also expected to have 46 RT cores and 184 Tensor cores. The RTX 4070 is also tipped to get the same 12GB of GDDR6X memory as the 4070 Ti, with a 192-bit memory bus, 21Gbps memory speed, and 504 GB/s bandwidth.\nApart from the desktop RTX 40 lineup, NVIDIA also recently unveiled the RTX 40-series GPUs for laptops. At CES 2023, the company said the entire range of RTX 4000 GPUs will come to laptops, starting with the entry-level RTX 4050 and going up to the top-of-the-line RTX 4090. Laptops featuring the new NVIDIA chips are expected to go on pre-order on Feb. 1 before being available for purchase from Feb. 8.\nMore: NVIDIA RTX 4090 Laptops Are Almost Here, But Be Prepared For Sticker Shock\nSource: VideoCardz \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nGPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tYou May Soon Be Able To Make Video Calls On Twitter\n\t\t\n\n\nTwitter\n\nTwitter is seemingly working on a video chat feature in line with Elon Musk's plans to turn the micro-blogging platform into an 'everything app.'\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nKishalaya Kundu\n\n\nJan 18, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHunger Games Novel Sequel Is Unlikely To Happen, Says Publisher\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nLiz Foster\n\n\n53 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tI'm Convinced Alexandra Daddario Is The Perfect Casting Choice To Play Wonder Woman In James Gunn's DCU\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nFelipe Rangel\n\n\n3 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhy Victoria Is So Opposed To Piper Staying In Thailand After The White Lotus Season 3\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nGreg MacArthur\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRusso Brothers\u2019 New Avengers: Secret Wars Comments Have Me Convinced The MCU Is Heading Towards A Reboot\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nKai Young\n\n\n34 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAs Anime Labor Issues Grow, Code Geass and One Piece Exec Worries for Japan: \"We Will Inevitably Fall Behind\"\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nLauren Kells\n\n\n29 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThe White Lotus Season 4 Refusing To Take Place In These Locations Is Actually A Good Thing\n\t\t\n\n\nThe White Lotus\n\nAccording to an executive producer on The White Lotus, there are several locations that can be ruled out from the HBO show's future outings.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 hour ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat Would Humans Do With Zombies In an Apocalypse?

But it may be about to get a little bit easier thanks to Gl\u00fcxkind Technologies and their smart stroller, Ella.\nThe company has just been named a CES 2023 Innovation Awards Honoree for their AI-powered stroller, which was designed to make life easier for new parents and caregivers.\n\u201cPeople love the rock-a-baby feature and the push and brake assist,\u201d said Gl\u00fcxkind co-founder and CEO Kevin Huang of a product that\u2019s become an instant sensation at the annual technology industry confab. \u201cWhen you\u2019re able to hold your child and have the stroller take care of itself, that\u2019s a pretty magical moment.\u201d\nThe story behind the product that\u2019s made headlines around the world began three years ago when Huang and his co-founder, Anne Hunger, had a baby daughter and went stroller shopping.\n\nAnd, like all parents, they learned about the challenges of wrangling a stroller packed with baby gear and the safety concerns that have new parents shopping for the safest vehicles they can afford.\n\u201cI realized, \u2018man, this stuff hasn\u2019t changed in the last 30 years,\u2019\u201d Huang said.\nModern cars, for example, are equipped with systems that ensure they don\u2019t roll backward when you\u2019re stopped on a hill, Huang explained.\n\u201cSo I thought maybe we can add some of the things already there for cars into this platform that actually carries our children, so we can have a safer and more convenient experience.\u201d\n\nThe AI Podcast \u00b7 How Gl\u00fcxKind Created Ella, the AI-Powered Smart Stroller\nThe response from parents at CES was overwhelmingly positive. No surprise, given the in-depth research Huang and his team conducted with new parents.\nBut it\u2019s also wowed tech enthusiasts worldwide, earning honors from the awards program produced by the Consumer Technology Association, the trade group behind the annual Las Vegas conference.\n\u201cWe came to CES with the idea of announcing the product and getting maybe three to five writeups about what we were doing,\u201d Huang said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect the overwhelming amount of exposure we received.\u201d\nThis year\u2019s CES Innovation Awards program \u2014 overseen by an elite panel of judges, including media members, designers and engineers \u2014 received a record-high number of over 2,100 submissions, making it no small feat for Ella to come out on top.\nAI-Powered Stroller Makes Parenting a Walk in the Park\nHuang reports that NVIDIA\u2019s Jetson edge AI platform powers the startup\u2019s entire AI stack.\nGl\u00fcxkind, based in Vancouver, Canada, is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a free program designed to help startups evolve faster through access to cutting-edge technology and NVIDIA experts, opportunities to connect with venture capitalists, and co-marketing support to heighten the company\u2019s visibility.\nWith Jetson, Huang explains that the stroller is able to use computer vision to map the stroller\u2019s surroundings, using Jetson\u2019s GPU and CPU to process and do pathfinding.\nAs a result, when the child isn\u2019t in the stroller, parents can activate Ella\u2019s intelligent hands-free strolling mode.\nThis advanced parent-assist technology helps parents focus on their kids rather than wrangling an empty stroller packed with diapers, snacks, and other supplies.\n\u201cIt stays out of the way when you don\u2019t need it, but it\u2019s there when you do need it,\u201d Huang said.\nBut while the stroller is intelligent \u2014 able to follow a caregiver as they hold a baby or help ensure the stroller doesn\u2019t roll away on its own \u2014 it\u2019s not designed to work independently.\nQuite the opposite. With Ella\u2019s adaptive push and brake assistance, caregivers can enjoy effortless walks no matter the terrain \u2014 uphill, downhill or even when fully loaded with groceries and toys.\nElla also has features that make parenting easier, such as Rock-My-Baby mode to help little ones get the sleep they need and built-in white noise playback.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make it so the technology we\u2019re building is augmentative to the parents\u2019 experience to make parenting easier and safer,\u201d Huang said.\nThe result: while parenting will never be a walk in the park, actually taking that newborn for an actual walk in the park will soon be a lot less of a hassle.\nImage credit: Gl\u00fcxkind Technologies\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: CES 2023 | Computer Vision | Embedded Computing | Events | Inception | NVIDIA Jetson \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

You can record instant replays of your gameplay, enable an always-on performance monitor, optimize your game settings in one click, and a lot more. Here are the features you should be using. \n                        Use GeForce Experience's ShadowPlay For Instant Replay\n               \nGaming is a pretty fast-paced hobby. Great moments can happen in the blink of an eye, even in leisurely games. ShadowPlay allows you to set up instant replay, so you don't have to worry about constantly recording your gameplay.\nPress Alt+Z, click \"Instant Replay,\" then click \"Turn On\" to enable Instant Replay. You can also press Alt+Shift+F10 to enable it instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Instant Replay has been enabled, tap Alt+F10 to save the last 5 minutes of gameplay.\nShadowPlay can be configured to save gameplay in increments as short as 15 seconds or as long as 20 minutes. Just keep in mind that your screen resolution and the duration of the recording have huge implications for the storage requirements. 5-minute replays are typically several gigabytes each, so your clips can very easily eat away at your hard drive space if you aren't careful.\nPress Alt+Z, click \"Instant Replay,\" then select \"Settings\" to change your Instant Replay length, and the video and audio fidelity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour recordings are limited to 30 frames per second (FPS) at 8k on 30-series GPUs, or 60 FPS at 8k on 40-series GPUs \n                        Use GeForce Experience's ShadowPlay to Record Gameplay\n               \nShadowPlay does more than just instant replay --- it can also be used to record longer sessions. Press Alt+F9 to enable recording. A message displaying \"Recording has started\" will briefly appear in the upper right corner of the screen when you've successfully started recording, and a small green indicator is present in the lower right corner while recording is active.\u00a0You can record as much gameplay footage as you like, then press Alt+F9 again to stop recording.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecording gameplay footage in full HD (1080p) or higher can easily consume a gigabyte of storage for every few minutes of footage, so be mindful of where you're saving your recordings.\nPress Alt+Z, then click Record > Settings to tweak the audio and video settings for your recording.\n\n\n\nRecording and Instant Replay use the same video and audio quality settings. You cannot change those settings while Instant Replay is enabled.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike instant replay, there are a few resolution and framerate (FPS) limits: you can record at up to 30 FPS at 8k on 30-series GPUs, or 60 FPS at 8k on 40-series GPUs. \n                        Take Screenshots with GeForce Experience\n               \nMost games allow you to take screenshots, and programs like Steam also offer that function. However, not every game has the same screenshot key bind, and not every game is run through Steam.\u00a0GeForce Experience offers an alternative that saves you the trouble of adding a game to Steam or manually changing the screenshot key.\nGeForce Experience can take screenshots in any program you have installed on your PC. The best part is that the key to take a screenshot is set in the GeForce Experience app, and it is the same in every single program.\nBy default, the screenshot hotkey is Alt+F1, but you can also trigger a screenshot by pressing Alt+Z and clicking \"Screenshot.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking screenshots with GeForce Experience isn't a game changer, but it is an extremely welcome convenience. By default, screenshots are saved to the Videos folder, with a sub-folder named for the specific game. Typically, the Videos folder is accessible under \"This PC\" in File Explorer, but if it isn't visible there, the folder is always accessible at \"C:\\Users\\(YourUsername)\\Videos\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Get Automatic Driver Updates Through GeForce Experience\n               \nGeForce Experience automatically checks for new graphics drivers and will notify you when they're available. Open GeForce Experience, then go to the \"Drivers\" tab. If an update is available, you'll see a big green \"Download\" button near the top of the window. You can also click \"Check for Updates\" to manually make GeForce Experience check for new drivers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may not be the splashiest feature, but it is extremely useful. Graphics drivers typically contain bug fixes and optimizations that'll improve your gaming performance.\nYou can always download NVIDIA drivers manually, if you prefer to handle it yourself.\nRelated: How to Download NVIDIA Drivers Without GeForce Experience \n                        Automatically Optimize Game Settings\n               \nGeForce Experience will automatically detect games (and some other programs) as soon as you install them. NVIDIA has put special effort into determining which settings are optimal for each program. Of course, like with anything, there is no guarantee it'll work perfectly --- updates to the game or drivers can always affect performance in unexpected ways.\nRelated: Why You Should Use GeForce Experience to Optimize Games\nThat said, it is a decent starting place if you're not sure what settings you should use. Just open GeForce Experience, and then select the game you want to optimize.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \"Optimize\" to apply the suggested settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe game's settings will be changed the next time you launch it. \n                        Use Ansel to Take Cinematic Screenshots\n               \nGeForce Experience can take regular screenshots, but it also has a special screenshot mode called Ansel in games that support it.\nAnsel, which gets its name from famed landscape photographer Ansel Adams, offers a few unique ways to take screenshots: \n\n                                        360-degree photospheres that you can view in VR\n                        \n\n                                        Super resolution images, essentially screenshots dozens of times larger than your desktop resolution\n                        \n\n                                        A \"Free Camera\" mode that lets you move the camera around before you take your screenshot\n                        \n\nYou can apply all sorts of filters to adjust colors, brightness, and contrast, as well.\nPress Alt+F2 while you're playing a game, then adjust the settings to your liking. If nothing happens, the game probably doesn't support Ansel --- many don't.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Ansel screenshots (or photospheres) will be saved to the Videos folder, just like regular screenshots.\nGeForce Experience also allows you to apply various filters to your game. Find an environment too dreary? Apply a warming filter! Want a black and white filter? Not a problem. Tap Alt+F3 to open the filter menu, then apply whichever filters you'd like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Check Your Performance with GeForce Experience\n               \nThere are an enormous number of variables that go into diagnosing performance problems, but good information about your performance is critical to getting started. GeForce Experience has a performance monitor that you can access at any time, and you can even pin it to your screen so that it is always visible.\nThe performance monitor is also great if you're simply curious about how stressed your card gets, or how much power it is consuming while you're gaming.\nPress Alt+Z, then click \"Performance.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe status of your GPU and CPU are displayed in a large window on the left-hand side of the screen. If you want to display a smaller, more concise performance monitor displayed all the time, press Alt+R or click the gear icon next to \"Performance Overlay.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you clicked the gear icon, you can customize how the Performance Overlay is displayed. Adjust the position by clicking one of the quadrants under \"Position,\" or change how much information is displayed by selecting one of the options from the list.\nBasic or advanced are the best options if you're trying to diagnose a problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the Advanced Performance overlay with no games running.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated: What Is a CPU or GPU Bottleneck in PC Gaming? (and How to Fix It) \n                        How to Change Hotkeys for GeForce Experience\n               \nThe default GeForce Experience hotkeys don't typically conflict with games, but if they do, or you just don't like them, changing them is simple. Press Alt+Z, then click the gear icon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \"Keyboard Shortcuts.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can change any of the hotkeys to something you like better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust be mindful that you avoid essential Windows shortcuts\u00a0and common shortcuts in games.

Should a temperature or power limit be reached,\u00a0GPU Boost will drop down to the previous boost frequency / voltage stepping, to bring power and temperatures down gradually and not cause any significant performance swings.\n\r\nWhen overclocking, the maximum boost clock and power limit can be tweaked and tuned to increase performance with most cards, however.\n\nASUS TUF GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Hardware Monitor - Default Settings\n\r\nLike previous-gen cards, the ASUS TUF GeForce RTX 4070 Ti is still voltage or power limited in most circumstances to prevent damage and ensure the card's longevity. It is those limits that will usually be the gating factor in any overclocking efforts.\n\r\nWith the ASUS TUF GeForce RTX 4070 Ti, the power target can be increased by up to 25% and the max temperature target from 84\u00b0C to 88\u00b0C. Though the latest version of MSI's Afterburner has the option to alter voltage as well, it was greyed out with the build we used with the RTX 4070 Ti. We were still able to increase the GPU clock significantly, however.\n\n\nASUS TUF GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Hardware Monitor - Overclocked\n\r\nWe used the frequency offsets with the power and temperature target sliders available in Afterburner to manually push the ASUS TUF GeForce RTX 4070 Ti's frequencies beyond its defaults. First, we turned up the temperature and power targets to their maximum values, and then increased the GPU and memory clock offsets until the test system was no longer stable, showed on-screen artifacts, or performance peaked due to hitting the power limit. We did not, however, alter fan speeds because this card ran so cool without any modification in that regard.\n\r\nWe were not able to get our hands on a spec sheet to see what ASUS lists the TUF GeForce RTX 4070 Ti OC Edition's expected boost clock, but in our tests it routinely boosted to over 2,800MHz while in its stock configuration (visible in the screenshot at the top of the page). While overclocked, we were able to take its GPU clock all the way up to an impressive 3,045MHz with a 21.5Gbps memory speed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nWith the card overclocked, we re-ran some tests and saw some decent performance gains, but they weren't enough to catch the next card up the rankings in either test. That said, we never hit the card's power limit and temperatures peaked at only 70C, so with some voltage modifications and additional tweaking, we expect to see GeForce RTX 4070 Ti cards hit higher clocks that we did here.\nTotal System Power Consumption\r\nThroughout all of our benchmarking and testing, we also monitored noise output and tracked how much power the GPUs were consuming in our test system.\u00a0Our goal here is to give you an idea as to how much power each GPU used while idle and also while under a heavy workload. These power numbers were captured during FarCry 6 testing, with ray-tracing enabled, and are representative of total system power consumption:\n\n\n\n\nThe ASUS TUF GeForce RTX 4070 Ti turned out to be a relatively power-friendly, at least in comparison to all of the higher-end graphics cards we tested. Idle power was nearly the lowest, and peak load power was the lowest of the bunch.\r\nNoise is not a concern with with the ASUS TUF GeForce RTX 4070 Ti, either. At idle or when under light loads, the ASUS TUF GeForce RTX 4070 Ti is effectively silent, because its fans spin down completely. When under a heavy, sustained workload, the card's fans do spin up, but it runs so cool and quiet they never produce anything more than a dull whir and are barely audible over the other fans in our test rig.\nASUS TUF GeForce RTX 4070 Ti OC Edition Review Summary\r\nThe MSRP for GeForce RTX 4070 Ti cards will start at $799. NVIDIA, however, will not be producing a Founders Edition card and all of NVIDIA\u2019s partners are bringing multiple versions to market, with very different price points. The ASUS TUF GeForce RTX 4070 Ti OC Edition we featured here will be priced at $849, and ASUS has ROG STRIX-branded 4070 Ti card coming priced as high at $1,049. Compare those prices to the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, which arrived at $599, and it\u2019s obvious this GPU generation is commanding a steep premium.\n\r\nIn all fairness, everything from the cardboard to the capacitors required to build graphics cards has gotten more expensive since the RTX 30 series launched, but that doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that gamers will have pony up big bucks to partake in some Ada action. In addition, AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XT is available for approximately another $50 - $100, and that card offers comparable performance in most circumstances, but with a much larger memory configuration (20GB vs. 12GB) and support for DisplayPort 2.1 \u2013 two things that may have implications down the line as more advanced games and high-res / high-DPI / high-refresh monitors arrive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Cards @ Amazon\n\r\nWe also have to caution users about these cards\u2019 physical requirements. Despite power requirements that are more manageable than previous-gen high-end cards, all of the air-cooled RTX 40 series cards we\u2019ve tested so far have been quite large and may not fit in every case. In fact, Dave\u2019s liquid-cooled Maingear rig can\u2019t accommodate any of the air-cooled RTX 40-series cards that we have in the lab currently, due to their form factor.\n\r\nThose caveats aside, the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti kicks some serious butt. The ASUS TUF GeForce RTX 4070 Ti we tested ran cool and quiet, performance typically matched or exceeded the previous-gen flagship GeForce RTX 3090 Ti, and power consumption was modest versus the other high-end cards we tested. We think many gamers or creators, looking for a new GPU in its price range, will be happy with the new GeForce RTX 4070 Ti. It brings NVIDIA\u2019s leading-edge GPU architecture, the latest features, and strong 4K performance down to the lowest price point yet for a GeForce RTX 40 series card.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrev\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, Asus, GeForce, GPU, (nasdaq:nvda), ada lovelace, geforce rtx 4070 ti, asus tuf\n\n\n\nRelated content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASUS TUF GeForce RTX 4070 Ti OC Review: NVIDIA\u2019s Ada Lights Up CES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhison E26 SSD Preview: PCIe 5 Storage Breaks Out For 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXFX MERC 310 Radeon RX 7900 XT Review: Bigger, Badder RDNA 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX & 7900 XT Review: RDNA 3 Brings Big Gains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolidigm P41 Plus SSD Review: Strong PCIe 4 Storage Value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT STUFF IN PC COMPONENTS\n\nASUS TUF GeForce RTX 4070 Ti OC Review:...\nPhison E26 SSD Preview: PCIe 5 Storage...\nXFX MERC 310 Radeon RX 7900 XT Review:...\nAMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX & 7900 XT Review:...\nSolidigm P41 Plus SSD Review: Strong...\nKioxia XG8 SSD Review: Fast PCIe 4...\nAMD Ryzen 5 7600X And Ryzen 7 7700X...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKEEP INFORMED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSITE\n\nHome\n\n\nReviews\n\n\nNews\n\n\nBlogs\n\nFull Site\n\nSitemap\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nPC Components\n\n\nSystems\n\n\nMobile\n\n\nIT Infrastructure\n\n\nLeisure\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nCOMPANY\n\nAbout\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\nNews Tips\n\n\nContact\n\n\nPrivacy And Terms\n\n\nHotTech\n\n\n\nMORE\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nShop\n\n\n\nSTAY CONNECTED\n\nTwitter\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n            As an Amazon and Howl Technologies Associate, HotHardware earns a commission from qualifying purchases made on this site.

At SC22, I told an unnamed NVIDIA executive that I was excited about it but wanted to see it, and this individual let me know they had chips working. That was November 2022, so now in 2023, we are starting to hear more about Grace, NVIDIA\u2019s push into completing its CPU-GPU-Interconnect trifecta.\nNVIDIA Grace Superchip Features 144 Cores, 960GB of RAM, and 128 PCIe Gen5 Lanes\nThe NVIDIA Grace line will have the ability to have both the NVIDIA CPU and GPU on the same package, but NVIDIA is aiming beyond that. Armed with Arm Neoverse-V2 cores, the NVIDIA Grace Superchip has two 72 cores, integrated memory, and a NVLINK C2C interconnect between them. Here is the diagram:\nNVIDIA Grace Superchip High-Level Diagram\nEach Arm Neoverse-V2 core gets:\n\n64 KB I-cache + 64 KB D-cache per core\nL2: 1 MB per core\nL3: 234 MB per superchip\n\nSince NVIDIA is saying \u201c234MB per superchip\u201d as its L3 spec, we assume that is for the full two Grace CPU chip putting L3 cache at 1.625 MB L3 cache/ core.\nNVIDIA GTC 2022 Grace CPU Superchip\nOnboard each Grace CPU gets 500GB/s of LPDDR5X memory bandwidth. Since the spec is now up to 960GB of LPDDR5X per Superchip, that is 480GB per Grace CPU. NVIDIA will have the ability to vary this capacity.\nNVIDIA is also saying that it has 8x PCIe Gen5 x16 roots in its chip putting it around the same as a single AMD EPYC 9004 processor.\nThe company has started to share benchmarks of the new processor beyond the 7.1 TFLOP FP64 peak performance:\nNVIDIA Grace Superchip 2023 01 Performance\nThis was noted as being relative to a dual-socket AMD EPYC 7763 processor, so NVIDIA is comparing its parts to previous-gen AMD. If you want to learn more about the new AMD EPYC Genoa, see that article or our video:\n\nIf you want to learn more about last week\u2019s Intel Xeon Sapphire Rapids, here is the video for that.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s Grace Superchip is a 500W part, but that includes the LPDDR5X memory. We have been seeing roughly 5W/ DDR5 RDIMM. So for AMD EPYC 9004 Genoa with 12 channels of memory, we would add ~60W to the CPU\u2019s TDP. That makes NVIDIA\u2019s chip slightly more powerful, but with what should be a bit over twice the memory bandwidth than a single Genoa CPU.\nThat single CPU comparison will become important. The AMD EPYC Genoa more than doubled memory bandwidth, and it has much higher compute performance due to adding more cores and a faster microarchitecture. Our sense is that in HPC workloads, Grace will compete with dual-socket Genoa. On the integer side, AMD should be ahead based on what we have seen with existing Arm architectures.\nFinal Words\nChalk this one up to excitement for a new part. NVIDIA GTC 2023 is coming up in March, and this is perhaps the part I am most excited to see. NVIDIA has not set a Grace or Grace Hopper release date, but this feels like a big enough product bringing NVIDIA into a new market that it should launch on stage at GTC, especially if we are starting to see benchmark results already.\nThe server world is starting to get more exciting! If you want to learn more about some of the exciting features of new servers, I recently did a video outside of Intel\u2019s HQ with Supermicro on why this new generation of servers is very exciting.\n\nIn the meantime, expect another Ampere Arm CPU plus NVIDIA GPU piece soon as well as a BlueField demo coming on STH.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n TAGSARMGraceNeoverse V2NVIDIA \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleThe 32TB Micron 9400 Pro is a Beast PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSDNext articleNext-gen Servers and Next-gen Features in Intel and Supermicro Servers Patrick Kennedyhttps://www.servethehome.comPatrick has been running STH since 2009 and covers a wide variety of SME, SMB, and SOHO IT topics.

NVIDIA will have the ability to vary this capacity.\u201d\nHow is that possible with no company manufacturing 60 GB LPDDR5X chips? One would need to stack 20x 24Gbit dies. There must be some kind of version with more chips but that should decrease bandwidth.\n@opensourceservers \nThis is not going to grind anything. Grace is a niche CPU that is only going to be used in very few HPC applications or as companion for GPUs. None of the shown benchmarks is going to have an impact on SPR or Genoa as those are already much faster than the previous generation for these benchmarks like OpenFOAM or WRF (and BWA will benefit a lot from AVX512 but it is not a typical benchmark so no comps). \nIf anything it\u2019s going to be a competitor to SPR Max but that is a very small market for apllications where bandwidth is everything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissident Aggressor\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            January 25, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            4:56 am                                            \n\n\n\nA single 9004 has 128 lanes.  a dual socket 9004 has 128 lanes.\nI know it\u2019s hard to report honestly \u2013 especially when AMD is losing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatrick Kennedy\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            January 25, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            9:31 am                                            \n\n\n\nHi DA \u2013 That 128 lane is one configuration with 4 xGMI links. There is also a 160 lane configuration with 3x xGMI links that is becoming more common given the increase in xGMI bandwidth in this generation.\nWe have covered this before and fairly extensively: https://www.servethehome.com/dell-and-amd-showcase-future-of-servers-160-pcie-lane-design/\nHere is the video for that if it helps: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oe_hwJ7hl7A\nAlso, the EPYC 9004 has more lanes than the 7002/7003 series with the addiiton of extra PCIe Gen3 lanes for features like lower-speed 1/10GbE NICs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsamir\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            January 25, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            1:41 pm                                            \n\n\n\nToday I\u2019ve seen an internet troll get rolled by an expert. 128 max 2p epyc. lolz.

Give us more lanes so we don\u2019t need to spin up servers at home just to handle extra high-speed storage! If you don\u2019t, you will be the leading causes of a whole new subjectively lethal pandemic!
