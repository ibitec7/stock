(Photos: Instagram)   Despite the pandemic's attempt to cancel summer and tropical travel in 2020, our favorite female celebrities still flooded Instagram feeds with photos in their best bikinis. And while some made followers envious of warm quarantine weather, those of women embracing their bodies at all ages made people feel empowered and inspired during an otherwise difficult time.  Jennifer Lopez recently admitted to Yahoo Life that \"I've never struggled more with my health and nutrition\" than she has during the pandemic. Still, the 51-year-old didn't let that stop her from feeling comfortable and confident in her own skin as she showed off her figure in a number of pieces of swimwear.  And the singer, dancer and actress wasn't the only one. Lopez was joined by a host of women 50 and older posting their own photos featuring their supermodel poses in swimwear \u2014 including 54-year-old Paulina Porizkova and 55-year-old Elizabeth Hurley, who have both been praised for doing so.   And while many followers comment on the photos to say that the two \"don't age,\" Carla Marie Manly, a clinical psychologist and author of Aging Joyfully, tells Yahoo Life that displaying aging bodies is exactly the point. \"These are women in their 50s and 60s and 70s saying, 'I don't look like I did when I was 20 or when I was 30 and I'm not going to let that hold me back from showing myself as who I am now, nor will I devalue that,\" Manly explains. \"I will make it as valuable and beautiful when I am 50 or 60 or 70 as when I was 20. I'm not lesser. I am different.\" Salma Hayek, 54, did exactly that when she posted photos of herself in a bathing suit from 1999 followed by similar photos in 2020.   By drawing attention to the 20 years in between, the actress is not only sending a message of empowerment to her followers, but also to herself. \"The concept of ageism not only comes from others, but it comes from the self, the self-judgement: 'I'm not pretty enough, I'm too wrinkly. I'm too this, I'm too that,'\" Manly says. \"When a woman says, 'Hey, my body's changed and it's beautiful,' we're able to say exactly that. She is empowered. She is proud. She is putting herself out there as the embodiment of what I can do.\"   STORY_CONTINUES These images, Manly explains, combat the culture of ageism which is often upheld by women who subscribe to the idea that their body should be hidden after a certain age. \"We were used to women, once they were mothers and once they were certainly in their forties being told, 'Cover it up and act your age. Don't wear a bikini, wear a one-piece. Don't wear one-piece, wear a muumuu,'\" she recalls. \"As women come out, stand solid with each other, then we create a different culture.\"And while women like Molly Shannon, 56, and Beverly Johnson, 68, are part of those leading the way, Manly is sure that younger generations will follow in a movement of body and age acceptance.Read more from Yahoo Life:Jennifer Lopez, 50, hailed as an 'ageless queen' after posting ab-baring bikini selfie Ashley Graham is working to teach women how to embrace pregnancy \u2014 stretch marks and all Physician who saved man's life wearing a bikini goes viral: 'Female doctors can wear whatever they want'   TERMS  AND PRIVACY_POLICY   Privacy dashboard     RECOMMENDED_STORIES     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Antony reviews and covers the latest PC hardware and laptop technologyFollow AuthorDec 01, 2020, 08:59am ESTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.Nvidia's RTX 3060 Ti will cost $399 Antony Leather\nToday I'll be reviewing Nvidia's (Nasdaq:NVDA) GeForce RTX 3060 Ti. The company has an enviable history of offering great graphics cards in its XX60-series line-ups. The GTX 960, GTX 1060 and RTX 2060 Super are just some of the classics that have graced the mid-range gaming scene and the GTX 1060 is still one of the most popular graphics cards in the Steam Hardware Survey too. Today there's a new one - the RTX 3060 Ti and if Nvidia's claims are to be believed, we're looking at an RTX 2080 Super-beater and a 4K-capable gaming card for less than $400.\n\n\nYou can see my video review of the RTX 3060 Ti below.\n\n\n\nForbesNvidia RTX 3070 Vs. RTX 2080 Ti: And The Winner Is?By Antony Leather\nCompared to the RTX 3070, you get the same 8GB GDDR6 memory, 256-bit memory interface and in identical cooler too. The flow-through fan design is still here and there are two fans in total, although the RTX 3060 Ti has a silver housing rather than the gun metal grey of the RTX 3070.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\nNvidia's RTX 3060 TiAntony Leather\n\nYou obviously don't get all the bells and whistles of the RTX 3070. There are around 1,000 fewer CUDA cores and a lower boost frequency too. You also get 152 Tensor Cores compared to 184 and 38 RT Cores compared to 46 for the RTX 3070, with a $100 price difference as well. However, as well as answering the question which one should you buy, there's also comparisons to be made with previous generation cards too. The RTX 2080 and 2080 Super are both in the RTX 3060 Ti's crosshairs too in terms of performance.\n\n\nFor now, AMD doesn't really have a competitor, though, as the Radeon RX 6800 is an RTX 3070 competitor with a price to match, and the RX 5700 XT was only ever meant to tussle with the RTX 2070 Super - a card that is at least one notch lower than what the RTX 3060 Ti is aiming for and which outperforms the RX 5700 XT as well.\nTest system and benchmarksMy water-cooled system for testing graphics cardsAntony Leather\nI used Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti test driver and fully up-to-date version of Windows 10. The benchmarks now include results for 1080p performance for some models, as the RTX 3060 Ti's price will likely mean owners of high-refresh rate monitors who game at 1080p might consider it, as well as this looking to future-proof their system. Similarly, as the RTX 3060 Ti proved more than capable of handling games at 4K, I've compared it against several other cards both at 4K and 1440p.\nThe test system includes a BarrowCH Rhopilema water-cooled test bench with Corsair Hydro X water-cooling components, an Intel Core i9-10900K, MSI MEG Z490 Ace motherboard and 16GB Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro memory.\nWith ray tracing enabled at 1080p, Metro Exodus gives the RTX 3060 Ti an easy ride, coming close to matching the more expensive RX 6800 and not a million miles away from the RTX 3070 either.\nAdding a few more cards into the mix at 1440p and Nvidia's claims seem to be on the money - performance similar to the RTX 2080 Super, which means it's going to be a lot faster than any of the RTX 2060/RTX 2070 models out there.\nThe RTX 3060 Ti was impressive withy ray tracing and DLSS enabled, again matching the RTX 2080 Super and outstripping the RX 6800's average frame rate too, but ultimately a fair way behind the RTX 3070.\nDisabling ray tracing at 4K sees the RX 6800 offer significantly more performance, though, with the RTX 3070 doing so as well, but to a lesser extent. Still, the RTX 3060 Ti was again matching the RTX 2080 Super, although the 29fps 99th percentile minimum frame rate wasn't exactly stellar at 29fps.\nSwitching ray tracing and DLSS back on and the RTX 3060 Ti betters both AMD's new Radeon 6000-series cards and again matches the RTX 2080 Super although the minimum frame rates isn't exactly stellar at 29fps.\nWith ray tracing turned off in Wolfenstein, it was a similar story against the RTX 3070, with it generally offering performance in line with the extra $100 it demands.\nThe RTX 3070 seemed to be significantly quicker with ray tracing turned on too, but no AMD cards in this test, though, as they don't currently support ray tracing in this game.\nUnfortunately I haven't had time to re-test the RTX 2080 Super in Wolfenstein yet with ray tracing disabled, but again the RTX 3070 did offer a compelling reason to splash out an extra $100 or so.\nFor some reason, when upping the resolution and enabling ray tracing, the RTX 3060 Ti's minimum 99th percentile dropped to 88fps, but the average was faster than the RTX RTX 2080 Super.\nSwitching up to 4K and with ray tracing disabled, there was a sizable gap between it and the RTX 3070, which is ultimately a much better option if you're gaming at 4K. However, with a 99th percentile of 62fps at 4K, frame rates were still silky smooth.\nOnce again there was a hiccup at 4K with ray tracing enabled with a lower than expected 99th percentile for the RTX 3060 Ti. I'll be doing some investigating here and seeing what numbers other reviewers have found.\nFar Cry New Dawn at 1080p seems to have some kind of bottleneck as we saw in my RX 6800 review and all cards here performed similarly.\nThere was a little more scaling at 1440p, and again the RTX 3060 Ti matched the RTX 2080 Super and even managed a similar 99th percentile minimum frame rate to the RTX 3070, albeit a much lower average frame rate.\nThe RTX 2080 Super managed to edge out the RTX 3060 Ti at 4K, but the latter matched the RTX 2080. Again, though, if you can't stretch to an RTX 3080 and are looking for something more affordable for 4K gaming, the RTX 3070 is definitely worth the step up.\nAt 1080p with ray tracing disabled, the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3070 performed similarly, potentially pointing at limitations elsewhere.\nIt was a similar situation at 1440p, where it also bettered the RTX 2080 Super and matched the RTX 3070 - a result I'll need to double check given the latter should in theory be faster.\nAt 4K, though, the RTX 3070 finally pulled ahead with noticeably higher frame rates and the RTX 3060 Ti also bettered the RTX 2080 Super by the biggest margin so far.\nSwitching on ray tracing and DLSS saw the RTX 3060 Ti match the RTX 2080 and 2080 Super again an also outstrip both AMD RX 6800 series cards with 34fps being a reasonable 99th percentile at 4K for a $400 graphics card.\nBorderlands is the final game test and here the RTX 3060 Ti wasn't too far off the likes of the RTX 2080 Super and RTX 3070, but there's more of a load on other components here at 1080p.\nit was a little slower than the RTX 2080 at 1440p, though, but the RTX 3070 didn't offer a massive lead either.\nFinally, at 4K it was fairly even between the RTX 3060 Ti, RTX 2080 and RTX 2080 Super with the RTX 3070 edging out a significant lead.\nPower consumptions was, as expected, the lowest on test at just 332W, which was a little below the RTX 3070 and 60W less than the similarly-performing RTX 2080 Super.\nConclusions\nCompared to the RTX 3070, the RTX 3060 Ti ultimately sits where it should given the $100 price drop compared to its big brother. The former had sizeable advantages in some areas, especially as you ramp up the resolution so if you can't stretch to the RTX 3080 or RX 6800 XT, the RTX 3070 is ultimately worth the extra cash, especially if you're looking for a 4K-capable card for $500 or less. However, that's not to say the RTX 3060 Ti isn't capable of 4K -far from it. We saw playable frame rates in every game at 4K here and with DLSS enabled, things get even smoother.Nvidia's RTX 3060 TiAntony Leather\nCompared to the RTX 2080 Super and 2080, it's mostly on par with these older models but a lot will depend on availability and price as to which you should go for. Find an RTX 2080 Super for $350? It's probably worth it. Sadly, there's no current generation competition from AMD yet and the RX 5700 XT isn't really in the same league being more in the hunt for the scalp of the RTX 2070 Super, but the RTX 3060 Ti has already proven itself to be considerably faster than both given it matches the rTX 2080 Super.\nOverall the RTX 3060 Ti does what Nvidia said it would - match the RTX 2080 Super for $400 and also has the benefit of DLSS to boost frame rates at 4K, which means it can tame ray-traced titles too.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

But the show is over at last, now that the Singapore digital bank license results are out. In the end, MAS only awarded 4 digital bank licenses: 2 digital full bank licences + 2 digital wholesale bank licenses. Here are the results, and what this new era of digital banking means for you and me. \u00a0 Who are the 4 Singapore digital bank licence winners?  Type of licenceDigital bank licence winners Digital full bankSingtel & Grab Digital full bankSea Limited Digital wholesale bankAnt Financial Digital wholesale bankGreenland Financial Holdings, Linklogis Hong Kong & Beijing Co-operative Equity Investment Fund Management  It\u2019s no surprise that Singtel & Grab won a digital full bank license. Grab has been making such inroads into the finance space that we thought they\u2019d better start getting regulated by MAS. Singtel also has financial products such as Singtel Dash (payment platform) and EasyEarn (insurance savings plan).  Sea Limited is perhaps better known as the parent company of Shopee, though it also owns gaming company Garena and digital finance company SeaMoney. Meanwhile, the digital wholesale banking license is for serving SMEs and business accounts, and both winners are Chinese-based. Ant Financial is best known for Alipay. And while we don\u2019t know much about the Greenland consortium, the conglomerate of Chinese-based companies appears to be focused on \u201cserving China\u2019s SMEs in Singapore\u201d. \u00a0 How are the digital bank license winners chosen? As noted above, when MAS announced in June 2019 that it would be awarding up to 5 digital bank licenses, there was a gold rush as companies of all kinds applied for a license. MAS then assessed the 14 applicants holistically, based on the following criteria: Value proposition of business model, incorporating innovative use of technology to serve customer needs and reach under-served segments; Ability to manage a prudent and sustainable digital banking business; and Growth prospects and other contributions to Singapore\u2019s financial centre.  Note that there are differences between a digital full bank license vs a digital wholesale bank license.  Digital full bank Digital wholesale bank  Serves retail customers, with a deposit cap of $75,000 for each individualServes small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and other non-retail segments Will start off as a Restricted Digital Full Bank in Singapore and offer simple credit and investment productsWill open and maintain deposit accounts for businesses  \u201cRestricted\u201d? What can digital full banks not do in the meantime?    Story continues According to an MAS spokesperson, \u201cA Restricted Digital Full Bank will be subject to a deposit cap. The deposit cap will commence at S$50m (with a corresponding low paid-up capital of S$15m) and will be gradually lifted as the bank demonstrates its ability to manage its operations and risks in an adequate manner that is commensurate with the scale of its business.\u201d There will also be deposit caps from each individual customer and restricted digital full banks can only offer simple credit and investment products. \u00a0So what can digital banks do for us?In general, digital banks should provide the same functions of a traditional bank but without the brick and mortar branches. (Although some virtual banks can tap on existing ATM networks.)They operate purely on digital platforms, so you can probably expect real-time updates, quicker account approval times, quick investing services and personalisation. These will be done using artificial intelligence and big data analysis. Ideally, virtual banks should be faster, more efficient and operate at a much lower cost structure than traditional banks, since there is less expenditure on property rent and manpower.According to an MAS spokesperson, digital banks will open up the below possibilities:New digital banks could potentially offer deposit accounts without imposing any minimum deposit amount or fall-below fees, as seen in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. Digital banks with access to more wide-ranging data sources could adopt different credit risk assessment approaches to lend to under-served segments of the economy such as the young and micro enterprises. Increased competition from digital banks is also likely to spur existing banks to improve further on their own digital offerings. Timothy Chen, CEO and co-founder of MaxFinx, a company that provides the infrastructure for digital banks, says, \u201cDigital banking will speed up account opening, allow instant customer verification and personalisation of banking services at much lower costs.\u201dSo, probably like how Circles.Life spurred incumbent telcos to revamp their pricing, regular folks should be able to see some innovative financial products and hopefully higher interest rates on deposits. Fingers crossed!What are some of the most successful digital banks globally? Let\u2019s look elsewhere to see how the digital banking landscape will play out in Singapore.China was one of the first in Asia to embrace digital banking since as early as 2013. China\u2019s mobile payment market is now the world\u2019s largest market with $17 trillion in transactions in 2017. Huge financial technology companies like Ant Financial Service Group, known for their mobile app Alipay, and Tencent Holdings Ltd, creator of QQ Wallet and WeChat Pay, have since developed a range of apps that provide banking and payment services ranging from loans to insurance to private banking. Ant and Tencent have recently made way into Hong Kong, winning virtual banking licenses there too. To date, Hong Kong has issued 8 digital bank licences and the banks are expected to begin operations within 2019. In response, traditional banks in China have caught up with the competition and are moving into offering more digital services. There are now fully automated bank branches in Shanghai featuring teller-bots and \u201cIntelligent Teller Machines\u201d that much more capable than existing ATMS.We will probably see the same trend happening in Singapore. Although for a period of time traditional banks can leverage on the fact that they can have both digital and physical banking facilities, they would probably need to up their game to serve tech-savvy consumers. Seven Bank in Japan, a unit of Seven & I Holdings did just that. Since improving their virtual banking services, they have offered banking and other financial services through ATM machines in 7-Eleven convenience stores throughout Japan, without operating actual branches. While virtual banks would need some time to establish themselves, it has the potential to become mainstream given the ubiquity of the digital services in our daily lives.\u00a0What does all this mean for you and me?Singaporeans are already no stranger to mobile banking. Digital banking will probably only take it a step further.The biggest hurdle for the new players would be to overcome the branding lead that our local banks enjoy, especially among the baby boomers.But if there is any lesson to learn from Circles.Life\u2019s entry to the telco market, attractive pricing and responsive customer service go a long way.That said, with MAS taking a conservative approach, it will be some time before virtual banks root themselves in Singapore.For a start, the 4 digital banking licenses will spice up Singapore\u2019s banking offerings while not shaking up the incumbent banks too much.An MAS spokesperson tells us, \u201cRestricting digital full bank applicants to players that are anchored in Singapore ensures that a strong local core in our banking system remains, and we avoid unintended unilateral liberalisation of our full bank regime as a result of our WTO commitments.\u201dOh, and in case you were wondering, the Singapore Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures bank deposits up to $75,000 per person per bank, would also cover digital banks.\u00a0Apart from retail customers, SMEs also stand to benefitThinking of starting your own company? You may benefit from the services of a digital wholesale bank. Digital banking will probably allow small companies to get better credit scoring and subsequently, faster loan approvals.Timothy Chen, CEO and co-founder of MaxFinx says, \u201cDespite Singapore being a heavily banked market, there are still some who have fallen through the gaps, such as SMEs, micro setups, and so on. They are not as well served as the medium and large enterprises.\u201dMaxFinx will offer a cloud-based fintech platform that tailors financial services for banks and corporations. One of the software modules, transaction management, allows companies to monitor their cash flow and also review their counter-party risks and credit scoring. He says, \u201cThis means that SMEs can get better credit scoring and faster turnaround for loan approvals. We strongly believe it will reduce fraud for a lot of business transactions too.\u201dFound this article useful?

Omniverse allows creators, engineers and researchers to collaborate in virtual worlds that are all connected \u2014 the beginnings of the term Neal Stephenson coined, \u201cMetaverse.\u201d\nThe platform enhances efficiency, productivity and flexibility, as teams from across the room or across the globe can enter Omniverse and simultaneously work together on projects with real-time photorealistic rendering.\nAs part of the open beta, we\u2019ve released several Omniverse applications that can be used within the Omniverse software, including Omniverse View for architecture, engineering and construction professionals; Omniverse Create for designers, creators and specialists in media and entertainment and manufacturing/product design; and Omniverse Kaolin for 3D deep learning researchers.\nEarly next year, we\u2019ll release Omniverse Audio2Face, an AI-powered facial animation app; Omniverse Machinima for GeForce RTX gamers; and Isaac Sim 2021.1 for robotics development.\nA fundamental breakthrough of Omniverse is the ability to easily work concurrently between software applications. Creators, designers and engineers can access several Omniverse Connectors to leading industry software applications like Autodesk Maya and Revit, Adobe Photoshop, Substance Designer, Substance Painter, McNeel Rhino, Trimble SketchUp and Epic Unreal Engine. Many more are in development, including those for Blender, Houdini, 3ds Max and Motion Builder.\n\nCustomers Reach New Heights with Omniverse\nOver 500 creators and professionals across industries like architecture, manufacturing, product design, and media and entertainment have tested Omniverse through our early access program.\nGlobal architectural firm Kohn Pedersen Fox used the platform to bring together its worldwide offices and have its people work simultaneously on projects.\n\u201cThe future of architectural design will rely on the accessibility of all design data in one accurate visualization and simulation application,\u201d said Cobus Bothma, director of applied research at KPF. \u201cWe\u2019ve been testing NVIDIA Omniverse and it shows great potential to allow our entire design team to use a variety of applications to collaborate in real time \u2014 wherever they\u2019re working.\u201d\nImage courtesy of KPF.\nEcoplants, a member of NVIDIA Inception, focuses on bringing real-world experience into the virtual world in an innovative way, offering high-quality real 3D models and materials.\n\u201cOmniverse innovatively fuses development and production workflows of different software packages and across multiple industries,\u201d said Peng Cheng, CEO of Ecoplants. \u201cWe are testing how we will use Omniverse to be widely adopted and intensively applied across our company, delivering long-term business value and enabling us to improve efficiency and reduce rendering time from hours to seconds.\u201d\nImage courtesy of Ecoplants.\nMany industry software leaders are also integrating Omniverse into their applications so users can collaborate and work through graphics workflows.\nOne early partner for Omniverse is Adobe with its Substance by Adobe suite for texturing and material authoring. At the forefront of physically based rendering, and an early supporter of NVIDIA Material Definition Language, Substance has revolutionized the texturing workflow for real-time rendering.\n\u201cFrom its inception, we\u2019ve been a strong believer in Omniverse and the vision behind application interoperability. We\u2019re proud to be among the first to work with NVIDIA to integrate Substance by Adobe into early versions of the platform,\u201d said S\u00e9bastien Deguy, vice president of 3D and Immersive at Adobe. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for our users to experience the power of real-time collaboration and unlock new, more powerful workflows.\u201d\nReallusion is a software developer of animation tools, pipelines and assets for real-time production. Specializing in digital human character creation and animation, Reallusion software provides users with a rapid development solution for virtual characters.\n\u201cSince our early understanding of the platform, we have been working to connect our iClone character and animation capabilities through a live link to Omniverse.\u00a0 We believe this open platform will enable artist, designers, movie and game makers to collaborate and design across multiple workflows in real-time with amazing fidelity,\u201d said Charles Chen, CEO of Reallusion. \u201cThe ability for our users to move from world to world and leverage the power of our tools combined with other software tools in their workflows seamlessly and quickly will enable world building and real-world simulation.\u201d\nThe Metaverse Begins\nNVIDIA Omniverse has played a critical role in physically accurate virtual world simulation.\nAt GTC in October, we showed how DRIVE Sim leveraged the platform\u2019s real-time, photoreal simulation capabilities for end-to-end, physically accurate autonomous vehicle virtual validation.\n\nNVIDIA Isaac Sim 2021.1, releasing in February, is built entirely on Omniverse and meets the demand for accurate, reliable, easy-to-use simulation tools in robotics. Researchers and developers around the world can use the app within Omniverse to enhance their robotics simulation and training.\n\nAnd in research, Omniverse is combining scientific visualization tools with high-quality computer graphics. NVIDIA showcased a simulation of COVID-19, visualized in Omniverse, where each spike on a coronavirus protein is represented with more than 1.8 million triangles, rendered by NVIDIA RTX GPUs.\nNVIDIA Omniverse isn\u2019t just a breakthrough in graphics \u2014 it\u2019s a platform that\u2019s setting the new standard for design and real-time collaboration across all industries.\nUsers can download the platform directly from NVIDIA and run on any NVIDIA RTX-enabled GPU.

Designed for everyday urban mobility, the vehicle is powered by NVIDIA and is one of the first level 5 robotaxis featuring bi-directional capabilities, providing a concrete view into the next generation of intelligent transportation.\n\nZoox and NVIDIA first announced their partnership in 2017, with the innovative startup leveraging the high-performance, energy-efficient compute of NVIDIA to build a level 5 vehicle from the ground up. It was a significant milestone toward an autonomous future. Zoox is also an alumnus of NVIDIA Inception, our accelerator program for startups transforming industries with AI and data science.\nRobotaxis are set to transform the way we move. Experts at UBS estimate these vehicles could create a $2 trillion market globally by 2030, while reducing the cost of daily travel for riders by more than 80 percent. With greater affordability, robotaxis are expected to decrease car ownership in urban areas \u2014 a recent survey of 6,500 U.S. drivers showed nearly half would be willing to give up car ownership if robotaxis became widespread.\nWith Zoox and the openness and scalability of NVIDIA AI technology, this vision of safer and more efficient mobility is no longer a faraway future, but a close reality.\nAutonomy Forwards and Backwards\nUnlike current passenger vehicles that focus on the driver, Zoox is designed for riders. The vehicle was built from the start to optimize features necessary for autonomous, electric mobility, such as sensor placement and large batteries.\nEach vehicle features four-wheel steering, allowing it to pull into tight curb spaces without parallel parking. This capability makes it easy for Zoox to pick up and drop off riders, quickly getting to the curb and out of the flow of traffic to provide a better and safer experience.\nThe vehicle is bidirectional, so there is no fixed front or back end. It can pull forward into a driveway and forward out onto the road without reversing. In the case of an unexpected road closure, the vehicle can simply flip directions or use four-wheel steering to turn around. No reversing required.\nInside the vehicle, carriage seating facilitates clear visibility of the vehicle\u2019s surroundings as well as socializing. Each seat has the same amount of space and delivers the same experience \u2014 there\u2019s no bad seat in the house. Carriage seating also makes room for a wider aisle, allowing passengers to easily pass by each other without getting up or contorting into awkward positions.\n\nAll together, these design details give riders the freedom of seamless mobility, backed by safety innovations not featured in conventional cars.\nOne Solution\nNVIDIA provides the only end-to-end platform for developing software-defined vehicles with a centralized architecture, spanning from the data center to the vehicle.\nFor robotaxis, achieving level 5 autonomy requires compute with enough headroom to continuously add new features and capabilities. NVIDIA enables this level of performance, starting with the infrastructure for training and validation and extending to in-vehicle compute.\nThese vehicles can be continuously updated over the air with deep neural networks that are developed and improved in the data center.\nThe open and modular nature of the NVIDIA platform enables robotaxi companies to create custom configurations to accommodate new designs, such as Zoox\u2019s symmetrical layout, with cameras, radar and lidar that achieve a 270-degree field of view on all four corners of the vehicle.\nWith the ability to use as many processors as needed to analyze data from the dozens of onboard sensors, developers can ensure safety through diversity and redundancy of systems and algorithms.\nBy leveraging NVIDIA, Zoox is using the only proven, high-performance solution for robotaxis, putting the vision of on-demand autonomous mobility within reach.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Priced at $399, it goes on sale tomorrow and Nvidia promises it will deliver more performance than the previous-generation top-of-the-line RTX 2080 and 2080 Super. But the 3060 Ti is far from the top of the line \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s the least expensive RTX card you can buy. If the RTX 3070 was the sweet spot for 1440p gaming, the RTX 3060 Ti looks like an even sweeter spot thanks to the extra $100 savings.Just like the RTX 3070, the RTX 3060 Ti will be able to do 4K gaming if you\u2019re willing to knock the settings down, but both cards are ideally positioned for the 1440p market instead. The 3060 Ti is another great option if you\u2019re looking to move from a 1080p display to a 1440p one without the $699 price tag on the RTX 3080 or the extra power requirements and power draw.I\u2019ve spent the past week testing out the new RTX 3060 Ti at both 1440p and 4K ahead of its debut on December 2nd. Just like the RTX 3070, this card will give you plenty of headroom at 1440p or below, but it struggles to hit 60fps in a number of modern games at 4K. Still, I\u2019ve been impressed with the RTX 3060 Ti\u2019s performance, especially for $399.8Verge ScoreNvidia RTX 3060 Ti$400$400The GoodVery quiet and coolGreat for 1440p gamingDLSS helps transform gamesThe Bad8GB of memory$400 at Best BuyHow we rate and review productsHardwareThe RTX 3060 Ti looks almost identical to the RTX 3070. The size and shape are the same, combined with a traditional dual-fan setup. The dual-axial fans work together to keep the card cool, with the right fan pushing air all the way through the card to the opposite side, while the left directly cools the GPU cores with air that can exhaust out the rear of your chassis.The RTX 3060 Ti is a quiet card as a result, and I rarely heard the fans spinning up as it hit temperatures of 73 degrees Celsius during most games I tested. Just like the RTX 3070, the RTX 3060 Ti has a dense and compact PCB that\u2019s designed to improve airflow throughout the card. Nvidia is using its new 12-pin power connector here, instead of regular 6- or 8-pin power connectors.There\u2019s an adapter inside the box, which you have to use. You only have to adapt one 8-pin connector for the RTX 3060 Ti, so the setup isn\u2019t as bulky as the adapter for the RTX 3080. I\u2019d still recommend picking up a dedicated 12-pin connector from your PSU manufacturer, so you can avoid this ugly adapter altogether.The 12-pin power connector on the RTX 3060 Ti. Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeThe dual fans on the RTX 3060 Ti. Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeThe RTX 3060 Ti also features a single HDMI 2.1 port and three DisplayPort 1.4a ports. Like the rest of the RTX 3000 series, Nvidia has dropped the USB-C VirtualLink port found on the RTX 2000 series.Much like the RTX 3070, there\u2019s GeForce RTX branding on the side of the card but it doesn\u2019t light up when your PC is powered on. The main difference between the two cards, visually, is that Nvidia is using a slightly lighter silver coating on the 3060 Ti. It\u2019s different from the darker silver found on the rest of the RTX 3000 series cards, and I personally prefer the darker variant.RelatedNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 review: 4K PC gaming finally makes senseNvidia GeForce RTX 3070 review: the 1440p sweet spotAMD Radeon RX 6800 XT review: AMD is back in the gameAMD Radeon RX 6800 review: entry-level 4KNvidia\u2019s RTX 3000 series cards have all bumped up their power requirements, but the RTX 3060 Ti is a little more modest in that regard. Nvidia is recommending a 600W power supply for the RTX 3060 Ti, and it will draw up to 200 watts. That\u2019s only 15 watts more than the RTX 2060 Super, and 50 watts less power draw than the RTX 2080 Super for similar performance.1440p testingTest machine for 1440p and 4K:Processor: Intel Core i9-10900K 3.7GHz 10-CoreCPU Cooler: Corsair H150i PRO RGBMotherboard: Asus ROG STRIX Z490-E GAMINGRAM: Corsair Vengeance Pro 32GB (2 x 16GB) DDR4-3200Storage: Samsung 970 Evo Plus 2TB M.2 SSDCase: Corsair Crystal 570XPSU: Corsair 850W RMx Series RM850xI\u2019ve been testing the RTX 3060 Ti on a PC using Intel\u2019s latest Core i9-10900K inside. For 1440p tests, I hooked up the RTX 3060 Ti to a 27-inch Asus ROG Swift PG279Q monitor. This monitor supports refresh rates up to 165Hz plus G-Sync, so it\u2019s a good 1440p option to test the limits of the 3060 Ti. I\u2019ve also been testing 4K performance, which you can find below.I\u2019ve been playing a variety of games to test the RTX 3060 Ti, and I\u2019m impressed with the results at 1440p. Shadow of the Tomb Raider is able to hold 100fps steady at max settings, and Call of Duty: Warzone manages 119fps even with ray-traced shadows enabled.Even Control, a typically demanding title, manages to hit well above 60fps. The only exceptions are Watch Dogs: Legion and Metro Exodus. You can enable DLSS in both titles to make up for the performance dips here, or even drop some of the visual settings. I\u2019m less concerned at Watch Dogs just barely missing the magical 60fps, especially as Control performs so well.RTX 3060 Ti (1440P)BenchmarkRTX 3060 TiRTX 3070RTX 2080Microsoft Flight Simulator20fps40fps35fpsShadow of the Tomb Raider103fps111fps87fpsShadow of the Tomb Raider (DLSS)108fps118fps97fpsCoD: Warzone120fps130fps97fpsCoD: Warzone (RT)119fps126fps92fpsFortnite134fps139fps102fpsFortnite (DLSS quality)188fps173fps138fpsFortnite (DLSS perf)219fps214fps153fpsGears 5123fps114fps85fpsDeath Stranding132fps134fps114fpsDeath Stranding (DLSS quality)158fps166fps141fpsDeath Stranding (DLSS perf)171fps172fps184fpsControl87fps95fps78fpsControl (DLSS quality + RT)91fps94fps76fpsControl (RT)54fps57fps46fpsControl (DLSS quality)131fps140fps114fpsMetro Exodus39fps44fps35fpsMetro Exodus (RT)24fps28fps21fpsMetro Exodus (DLSS+RT)46fps53fps42fpsAssassin's Creed Valhalla63fps69fps58fpsWatch Dogs: Legion59fps66fps52fpsWatch Dogs: Legion (RT)39fps34fps28fpsAll the games I\u2019ve tested run better on the RTX 3060 Ti than the RTX 2080, and the ray tracing and DLSS performance is noticeably better here. None of the games I\u2019ve tested with the RTX 3060 Ti come close enough to maxing out the 165Hz refresh rate on my monitor, though. Death Stranding was the closest at 132fps, but you\u2019d need to enable DLSS in most games to really take advantage of higher refresh rates.DLSS has consistently impressed me during all of the RTX 3000 series reviews, and it\u2019s been particularly noticeable with the $399 RTX 3060 Ti. I was surprised at how well Fortnite manages to improve frame rates with DLSS turned on. I managed to get up to a 219fps average with the DLSS performance mode enabled, which is close to what even the RTX 3080 can provide.You can pick between quality and performance modes for DLSS in a wide range of games, and Nvidia\u2019s image reconstruction technique will render the game at a lower resolution and then upscale the image to make it look as good if not better than the native resolution. On PC monitors at 1440p, it looks great, and I think it\u2019s worth enabling in most games to get a bit more performance if you need or want it.The RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3070 side by side. Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge4K testingThe RTX 3060 Ti handles 1440p well, but 4K is definitely more of a struggle. Most games I tested didn\u2019t make it to 60fps regularly enough, and I really had to lower settings to get playable frame rates in some. Watch Dogs: Legion falls below 30fps at 4K most of the time with maxed out settings, and it barely even runs with ray tracing enabled.I wasn\u2019t expecting a $400 card to do much at 4K, but it still manages to handle games like Fortnite well if you enable DLSS. Even Control can hit 72fps with DLSS enabled, whereas it\u2019s unplayable at times when it dips below its average of 45fps without DLSS.RTX 3060 Ti (4K)BenchmarkRTX 3060 TiRTX 3070RTX 2080Microsoft Flight Simulator19fps23fps19fpsShadow of the Tomb Raider52fps54fps45fpsShadow of the Tomb Raider (DLSS)65fps69fps61fpsCoD: Warzone60fps74fps62fpsCoD: Warzone (RT)59fps70fps58fpsFortnite66fps73fps52fpsFortnite (DLSS quality)99fps105fps79fpsFortnite (DLSS perf)135fps139fps107fpsGears 569fps66fps46fpsDeath Stranding59fps72fps64fpsDeath Stranding (DLSS quality)83fps104fps89fpsDeath Stranding (DLSS perf)101fps158fps120fpsControl45fps48fps41fpsControl (DLSS quality + RT)50fps57fps49fpsControl (RT)12fps12fps13fpsControl (DLSS quality)72fps83fps60fpsMetro Exodus14fps16fps15fpsMetro Exodus (RT)8fps9fps10fpsMetro Exodus (DLSS+RT)24fps37fps29fpsAssassin's Creed Valhalla39fps57fps49fpsWatch Dogs: Legion27fps31fps30fpsWatch Dogs: Legion (RT)6fps12fps6fpsI wouldn\u2019t pick the RTX 3060 Ti if I was building a 4K rig right now. It\u2019s just not designed for 4K gaming, and if Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla can\u2019t even come close to 60fps at max settings, then demanding games coming in 2021 and beyond aren\u2019t going to fare well either.The other concern I have here with 4K gaming on the RTX 3060 Ti is that it ships with 8GB of video memory. 4K games can average between 4GB and 6GB of memory, and 8GB just doesn\u2019t feel like enough for some reasonable headroom for 4K gaming. If you\u2019re looking for 4K gaming, I\u2019d recommend the RTX 3080 instead.RTX 3060 Ti ports. Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeThe RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3070 are visually similar. Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeOnce again, Nvidia continues to deliver impressive performance with its range of RTX 3000 series cards. For $399, I think the RTX 3060 Ti is a bargain given you\u2019d have to shell out $699 or more for this level of performance only a few months ago.If I was building a budget 1440p gaming PC right now I\u2019d pick the RTX 3060 Ti for sure. It has some solid performance at 1440p, support for ray tracing, Nvidia\u2019s DLSS technology, and a range of RTX features that are designed for creators. If you want even more performance at 1440p then there\u2019s the $499 RTX 3070, or even AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 6800 if you\u2019re willing to shell out $579.I\u2019m still super curious to see when and how AMD will compete with the $399 pricing here. Especially as its RTX 3070 competitor (the Radeon RX 6800) is priced higher at $579. I\u2019d say it might be worth waiting to see what AMD has at this price point soon, but given its cards followed Nvidia\u2019s latest by a couple of months, I think we\u2019ll be waiting until January or February at this point.Either way, it\u2019s highly likely you won\u2019t actually be able to purchase an RTX 3060 Ti even if you want one. Availability of the RTX 3080, RTX 3070, and even AMD\u2019s latest cards is incredibly constrained. Demand is still outstripping supply, and I\u2019d doubt the launch of the 3060 Ti tomorrow will improve things.Still, it\u2019s great that there are even more choices if you\u2019re planning to move to a 1440p monitor. The RTX 3070 made that leap more affordable, and at $399 the RTX 3060 Ti makes it even more comfortable for those looking to leave 1080p behind.Photography by Tom Warren / The VergeSee More: Desktop ReviewsEntertainmentGamingGPU ReviewsNvidiaPC GamingReviewsTechMost PopularMost PopularAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?Leaked Apple meeting shows how dire the Siri situation really isInstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Despite the ongoing global pandemic (COVID-19), gamers are investing more savings towards PC hardware and peripherals, keeping the market vibrant and lively. Since most gamers and even regular consumers have nothing else to do, they are buying more gaming hardware to spend their time enjoying at home & this has driven unprecedented amounts of PC hardware and peripherals sales in the segment.\nRelated Story AMD Targets NVIDIA\u2019s Grace & Intel Granite Rapids Xeon CPUs With New 5th Gen EPYC Performance Showcase, Up To 2.75x Power Efficiency\n\nAs per the report, GPU makers also saw increased shipments with AMD's shipments increasing 18.7%, NVIDIA's shipments increasing 10.8% and Intel's shipments increasing 7.8% compared to the previous quarter. This led to AMD's market share climbing by 1.3%, NVIDIA's market share by 0.09%, and Intel's market share slightly declining by -1.4%. The overall GPU market share stands at 62% for Intel, and 19% for both AMD & NVIDIA.\n\n\u201cThe AIB market reached $14.8 billion last year,\u201d said Dr. Jon Peddie. \u201cWe forecast it to be $20.3 billion by 2023. Intel entered the OEM AIB market in Q4\u201920. The company will introduce a consumer AIB by Q2\u201921. Since 1981, 2,077 million AIBs have shipped.\u201d\nvia Jon Peddie Research\nQuick highlights (Overall GPU Shipments)\n\nAMD\u2019s overall unit shipments increased by 18.7% quarter-to-quarter, Intel\u2019s total shipments rose by 7.8% from the last quarter, and Nvidia\u2019s increased 10.8%.\nThe GPU's overall attach rate (which includes integrated and discrete GPUs, desktop, notebook, and workstations) to PCs for the quarter was 122%, up 0.6% from last quarter.\nThe overall PC market increased by 9.75% quarter-to-quarter and increased by 9.47% year-to-year.\nDesktop graphics add-in boards (AIBs that use discrete GPUs) increased by 13.44% from the last quarter.\nQ3'20 saw an increase in tablet shipments from last quarter.\n\nIn the discrete GPU segment which includes AIB figures (Discrete graphics cards and GPUs for desktops and laptops), the overall market saw over $4.2 Billion worth of AIBs shipped in Q3 '20. This marks a 13.4% increase from the previous quarter and a 9.1% increase compared to last year.\n\nThe outgoing quarter also saw AMD's dGPU market share increase from 22% in Q2 2020 to 23% in Q3 2020. NVIDIA's market share dropped to 77% (vs 78% in Q2 2020) but they still hold a dominant position in the segment. The increased AMD sales were due to AMD's Renoir APU lineup which was shipping with their Navi based discrete chips and also the fact that several RX 5000 series graphics cards were available at discounted rates along with appealing game bundle deals that prompted users running an older GPU to upgrade to them given their fantastic price to performance value.\nGPU Market Share Report by JPR (Q3 2020)\n\n\n\nAIB Discrete GPUsQ3 2019Q4 2019Q1 2020Q2 2020Q3 2020\n\n\n\n\nAMD27.1%31.1%30.8%22%23%\n\n\nNVIDIA72.9%68.9%69.2%78%77%\n\n\nIntel0%0%0%0%0%\n\n\nOverall GPUsQ3 2019Q4 2019Q1 2020Q2 2020Q3 2020\n\n\nAMD16%19%17%18%19%\n\n\nIntel65%63%67%64%62%\n\n\nNVIDIA19%18%16%19%19%\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon vs NVIDIA GeForce GPU Historical Market Share Graph (Via 3DCenter):\n\nAt the same time, these numbers came before the launch of both NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 30 GPUs based on the Ampere architecture and the AMD Radeon RX 6000 series GPUs based on the RDNA 2 architecture. In Q4 2020, we could potentially see NVIDIA gaining back share since their lineup is ranged from the RTX 3060 Ti which starts at $399 US and goes all the way up to the $1499 US RTX 3090 whereas AMD has only focused its launch on $500 US+ variants which are attractive in their own right with absolutely stellar performance and efficiency figures but don't cover the mainstream market as much as the RTX 3060 Ti does.\nIntel also offered its first mainstream discrete GPU, the Iris Xe Max, for its Tiger Lake-based laptops. The Iris Xe Max is the first of many discrete GPUs that the company is going to offer in the coming years on both the desktop and notebook segment. The Xe-based lineup will be competing against both AMD and NVIDIA and we will definitely start seeing them making some ground in the AIB GPU share by the end of 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nWith that said, the supply and stock issues still persist & both companies have severely lacked in their ability to tackle the immense demand for these cards. Almost no cards are available to buy and the little stock that is available has been artificially inflated by retailers. Both AMD and NVIDIA have promised supply to get better by 2021 so the market share figures for Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 are ultimately going to tell which company was able to offer a bigger supply of GPUs to their customers.\n\n\n\nWhich graphics card are you currently running inside your PC?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 GPU (Ampere)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 20 GPU (Turing)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce GTX 10 GPU (Pascal)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Older NVIDIA GPU (Pre 10 Series)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n AMD Radeon RX 6000 GPU (RDNA 2)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n AMD Radeon RX 5000 GPU (RDNA 1)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Older Radeon RX GPU (Pre RDNA)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJP Morgan Believes AMD\u2019s AI GPU Business Would Grow By 60 Percent This Year, Highlights Oracle\u2019s Initial Order Of 30,000 MI355X GPUs\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n137\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n84\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n78\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n52\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n49\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Using a fraction of the study material needed by a typical GAN, it can learn skills as complex as emulating renowned painters and recreating images of cancer tissue.\nBy applying a breakthrough neural network training technique to the popular NVIDIA StyleGAN2 model, NVIDIA researchers reimagined artwork based on fewer than 1,500 images from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Using NVIDIA DGX systems to accelerate training, they generated new AI art inspired by the historical portraits.\nThe technique \u2014 called adaptive discriminator augmentation, or ADA \u2014 reduces the number of training images by 10-20x while still getting great results. The same method could someday have a significant impact in healthcare, for example by creating cancer histology images to help train other AI models.\n\u201cThese results mean people can use GANs to tackle problems where vast quantities of data are too time-consuming or difficult to obtain,\u201d said David Luebke, vice president of graphics research at NVIDIA. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what artists, medical experts and researchers use it for.\u201d\nThe research paper behind this project is being presented this week at the annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, known as NeurIPS. It\u2019s one of a record 28 NVIDIA Research papers accepted to the prestigious conference.\nThis new method is the latest in a legacy of GAN innovation by NVIDIA researchers, who\u2019ve developed groundbreaking GAN-based models for the AI painting app GauGAN, the game engine mimicker GameGAN, and the pet photo transformer GANimal. All are available on the NVIDIA AI Playground.\n\nThe Training Data Dilemma\nLike most neural networks, GANs have long followed a basic principle: the more training data, the better the model. That\u2019s because each GAN consists of two cooperating networks \u2014 a generator, which creates synthetic images, and a discriminator, which learns what realistic images should look like based on training data.\nThe discriminator coaches the generator, giving pixel-by-pixel feedback to help it improve the realism of its synthetic images. But with limited training data to learn from, a discriminator won\u2019t be able to help the generator reach its full potential \u2014 like a rookie coach who\u2019s experienced far fewer games than a seasoned expert.\nIt typically takes 50,000 to 100,000 training images to train a high-quality GAN. But in many cases, researchers simply don\u2019t have tens or hundreds of thousands of sample images at their disposal.\nWith just a couple thousand images for training, many GANs would falter at producing realistic results. This problem, called overfitting, occurs when the discriminator simply memorizes the training images and fails to provide useful feedback to the generator.\nIn image classification tasks, researchers get around overfitting with data augmentation, a technique that expands smaller datasets using copies of existing images that are randomly distorted by processes like rotating, cropping or flipping \u2014 forcing the model to generalize better.\nBut previous attempts to apply augmentation to GAN training images resulted in a generator that learned to mimic those distortions, rather than creating believable synthetic images.\nA GAN on a Mission\nNVIDIA Research\u2019s ADA method applies data augmentations adaptively, meaning the amount of data augmentation is adjusted at different points in the training process to avoid overfitting. This enables models like StyleGAN2 to achieve equally amazing results using an order of magnitude fewer training images.\nAs a result, researchers can apply GANs to previously impractical applications where examples are too scarce, too hard to obtain or too time-consuming to gather into a large dataset.\nDifferent editions of StyleGAN have been used by artists to create stunning exhibits and produce a new manga based on the style of legendary illustrator Osamu Tezuka. It\u2019s even been adopted by Adobe to power Photoshop\u2019s new AI tool, Neural Filters.\nWith less training data required to get started, StyleGAN2 with ADA could be applied to rare art, such as the work by Paris-based AI art collective Obvious on African Kota masks.\nAnother promising application lies in healthcare, where medical images of rare diseases can be few and far between because most tests come back normal. Amassing a useful dataset of abnormal pathology slides would require many hours of painstaking labeling by medical experts.\nSynthetic images created with a GAN using ADA could fill that gap, generating training data for another AI model that helps pathologists or radiologists spot rare conditions on pathology images or MRI studies. An added bonus: With AI-generated data, there are no patient data or privacy concerns, making it easier for healthcare institutions to share datasets.\nNVIDIA Research at NeurIPS\nThe NVIDIA Research team consists of more than 200 scientists around the globe, focusing on areas including AI, computer vision, self-driving cars, robotics and graphics. Over two dozen papers authored by NVIDIA researchers will be highlighted at NeurIPS, the year\u2019s largest AI research conference, taking place virtually from Dec. 6-12.\nCheck out the full lineup of NVIDIA Research papers at NeurIPS.\nMain images generated by StyleGAN2 with ADA, trained on a dataset of fewer than 1,500 images from the Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | ResearchTags: Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA Research \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Faster than the $699 RTX 2080 SUPER, and beating the RTX 2060 SUPER by an average of 40%, the new $399 RTX 3060 Ti is a tremendous addition to the GeForce RTX 30 Series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether you\u2019re playing rasterized games or cutting-edge ray-traced titles, or powering through creator and productivity workflows, the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti delivers the best possible experience in its class.\nThis is possible thanks to the advanced NVIDIA Ampere Architecture, featuring 2nd Generation Ray Tracing Cores, 3rd Generation Tensor Cores for AI, and critically acclaimed tech like NVIDIA DLSS, NVIDIA Reflex, and NVIDIA Broadcast. These technologies improve your gaming, accelerate your gameplay, make voice chat clearer and better, and enhance your video calls with friends, family and colleagues.\nNo other platform offers these advantages - if you want the best possible experience, whether that\u2019s in a game, productivity task, creative workflow, or simply when chatting and video calling, GeForce RTX is the only game in town.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year we\u2019ve worked hand in hand with CD PROJEKT RED, Activision, Ubisoft and others to bring immersive, game-changing ray-traced effects to Cyberpunk 2077, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Watch Dogs: Legion, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve also brought performance accelerating NVIDIA DLSS technology to over 25 games, and more are adding this transformative, sought-after tech every month. Better performance, as-good-as or better anti-aliasing and visual clarity, and other improvements make it a no-brainer, giving GeForce RTX gamers massively faster frame rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of the year, nearly a dozen games will have adopted our newest technology, NVIDIA Reflex. This reduces system latency (\u2018input lag\u2019), making games more responsive, giving players in competitive multiplayer titles an extra edge over the opposition -- hopefully leading to more kills and wins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith NVIDIA Broadcast, an evolution of the highly regarded RTX Voice beta app, we have audio and video AI enhancements you can apply to your Discord chats, Skype calls and video meetings. And now, we have released the technology powering NVIDIA Broadcast to our partners so they can add these AI effects to their apps and give users more control.\nThis allows users to remove background noise per audio track in XSplit Broadcast, apply noise removal to videos in Adobe Premiere Pro with VoiceFX, do motion tracking with a simple webcam in Notch, and capture your content at 4K on a second PC without the need of a capture card with NDI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll this is to say that the $399 GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is just as feature-rich as the GeForce RTX 30 Series cards that came before it. It offers the same set of powerful features, with the industry\u2019s best ray tracing technology. And, it also supports NVIDIA DLSS, our AI-powered performance accelerator that massively boosts frame rates in graphically demanding titles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti GPUs come bundled with a one-year GeForce NOW Founders membership, available to existing or new members. So, when you\u2019re away from your rig, you can still play your favorite games with amazing GeForce features like RTX and DLSS, even on a Mac, Chromebook, Android or iPhone. That\u2019s the power of GeForce NOW.\nAnd if you do buy one of these amazing new graphics cards, be sure to download and install the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Game Ready Driver\u00a0on December 2nd to unlock its full potential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This is NVIDIA\u2019s GPU offering that sits between the Quadro RTX 5000 and Quadro RTX 8000. With a list price of around $4000, this is not an inexpensive GPU by any means but it often competes in categories where software licensing costs are steep compared to hardware costs. Still, these cards often trickle into other markets so we wanted to see how the card performs. Plus, there is an aspect to this where it is just nice to complete our generational reviews series for a set of GPUs.\u00a0Let us take a look at the NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 to see how it fares.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 Overview\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 is a dual-slot GPU with a length of 10.5\u2033. The front of the NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 shows the blower-style cooling fan which makes the Quadro RTX 6000 suitable for dense GPU configurations.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 Front\nAt the back of the NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000, we see bare circuits with no backplate to aid in cooling and circuit protection. On a card in this price range, we would have seen a backplate. Even adding a few dollars to a BOM in this price range while protecting a card and potentially providing better cooling feels like it should be present.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 Back\nAt the far end, we find two power connections, a 6-pin and an 8-pin. Power connections at the end of the GPU make installing in workstations and servers much easier and avoid the server hump. Something to note here is that these GPUs use the desktop power inputs, not the server power input.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 Power Connections\nAt the other end, we find the video outputs which consist of a quad DisplayPort for standard video and a single USB Type-C port. Many of NVIDIA\u2019s newer cards have dropped this USB Type-C port but it was a common feature on this generation.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 Video Outputs\nSomething our keen readers will notice is that this is not the first time we have seen the Quadro RTX 6000 on STH. We saw a variant of these cards lacking display outputs, using more traditional data center power, with a backplate, and in a passive cooler setup in our\u00a0ASUS ESC4000A-E10 2U AMD EPYC GPU Server Review. We already had the blower-style cooler version, so we decided to review this one instead of that quad GPU configuration.\nASUS ESC4000A E10 Left Two GPUs Out\nStill, the presence of a passively cooled RTX 6000 option for servers without the need to use workarounds for many display outputs means NVIDIA saw a market well beyond the traditional workstation market for these GPUs.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 Nvidia Smi 4 Cards\nOur sense is that these were popular in servers which is why the NVIDIA Quadro Branding is being Phased Out for New Products and the new generation\u00a0NVIDIA RTX A6000 48GB Drops Quadro Designation.\nNext, let us take a look at the Quadro RTX 6000 key specifications and continue with our performance testing.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \n\n TAGSNVIDIANVIDIA Quadro RTXQuadroRTXTuring \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleHow AWS Added Apple Mac Mini Nodes to EC2Next articleiXsystems TrueNAS Mini X+ ZFS NAS Review William Harmonhttp://www.servethehome.com  \n \nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAcemagic F3A an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 Mini PC with up to 128GB of RAM \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASUS ESC8000A-E13P Review an 8x PCIe GPU Server \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASRock Rack 4U8G-TURIN2 A Fresh Take on a Classic AI Server Design \n\n  \n\n\n\n5 COMMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarry Barras\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            December 29, 2020\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            6:31 pm                                            \n\n\n\nOne of the big differences between the RTX Titan and the RTX 6000 is the ability to RDMA, aka, GPU-Direct DMA between machines. \nI\u2019d love to see that tested using Mellanox RDMA ConnextX 5 or higher cards on a 25, 40 or 100gb VPI or ethernet connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nemerth\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            December 30, 2020\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            12:45 am                                            \n\n\n\n@Larry Barras\nI\u2019ve a dual 2080ti machine in a network that runs gig-E and QDR Infiniband.

The 3090 is typically about 2x as fast as the 2080ti in that benchmark \u2013 not quite the difference you\u2019ve benchmarked.\nSeems like something is super off there as the benchmark isn\u2019t VRAM limited and so even a 2080 should be positioned a lot differently.\nAre you sure you are running the latest benchmark?

We wanted to highlight two big themes from Bill Dally, NVIDIA\u2019s Chief Data Scientist and SVP of Research\u2019s keynote. Those two key themes are co-packaged optics and AI inference which are designed to scale-up and scale-out the company\u2019s reach with its compute capabilities.\nNVIDIA Co-Packaged Silicon Photonics\nDuring Bill\u2019s keynote, he touched upon key themes we have been covering for some time at STH, silicon photonics and co-packaged optics. Transmitting bits over distance has some energy cost. That energy cost generally increases based on speed and distance. Current electrical interconnects, as we see in the NVIDIA DGX and a HGX platform we reviewed in the Inspur NF5488M5 Review A Unique 8x NVIDIA Tesla V100 Server, are running at around 8pJ/b with 25Gbps per link signaling while being limited to 0.3m or around 1ft. A consequence of this is that high-speed topologies are limited to in-box designs and quickly require switches like NVSwitch and retimers to span longer distances that are still relatively short. While this keynote focused on NVLink, PCIe will see this soon which will require changes after PCIe Gen5 (although when is up for debate) to reach rack-scale disaggregated computing. NVIDIA is showing an industry challenge here.\nNVIDIA GTC China 2020 Bill Dally Optical DGX\n\u201cThe way we plan to do this is with a relatively new optical technology, Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing.\u201d (DWDM) Bill Dally NVIDIA at GTC China 2020 Keynote.\nDWDM has been used in networking for decades, but the basic idea is that a comb light source is used and different colors of light are used over a single fiber optic cable with each color being a distinct data path. Each color is modulated to encode data and then at the end of the link each color is detected separately. Instead of adding multiple electrical traces (wires) to scale-out bandwidth, DWDM can use more colors of light. NVIDIA discussed using 32 colors, but 128 lane DWDM even for long haul communications have been around for 10-20 years. That means from a 32-lane design, there is a well-known path to scale both transmission speeds per color, but also the number of colors used to increase bandwidth well into the Tbps era.\nNVIDIA GTC China 2020 Bill Dally Photonics Link\nSwitching to optics lowers the power required to move data and provides high signal integrity over long distances which will become more important as the company needs to increase the bandwidth through processors.\nNVIDIA showed off a design for co-packaged optics both with GPUs, on the GPU package, as well as with switches for 4.8Tbps NVLink. To put that in perspective, 4.8Tbps is faster than many of today\u2019s CPUs can ingest data through memory hierarchies.\nNVIDIA GTC China 2020 Bill Dally Co Packaged Optics\nWith photonics replacing electrical signaling, NVIDIA can scale-up systems in a more disaggregated fashion. No longer is a system limited by 0.3m electrical traces which means more devices can be aggregated to different topologies. While these examples are focused more on the DGX-style of computing, next-gen NVIDIA BlueField is another prime candidate for integrating optics instead of using pluggable modules at some point in the future.\nNVIDIA GTC China 2020 Bill Dally Co Packaged Photonics GPU Topologies\nNVIDIA still has some way to go. Not only will the company need to move to co-packaged optics for GPUs, at some point its networking division, spearheaded by the Mellanox acquisition, will need to adopt co-packaged optics as well. We asked during the recent\u00a0NVIDIA Mellanox NDR 400Gbps InfiniBand announcement and while DACs were still possible, there is a recognition that co-packaged optics needs to happen. At STH, this is something we have been following for some time. We even had exclusive hands-on access to Intel\u2019s co-packaged silicon photonics demo earlier in 2020.\n\nWe hope that NVIDIA is further along in its photonics journey than described in the presentation since that is going to be a major enabler of architecture in a few generations. The network switch players are at the point they are telling us it will be the amount of adoption rather than if there will be adoption at the next 51.2T generation with an eventual industry transition. Those 51.2T switches are on roadmaps and not far off. Even if not for its GPU side, NVIDIA will need this for the network fabric side earlier, but it would be great to see NVIDIA have future GPUs have this for a \u201ckiller app\u201d.\nAI Inference and Efficiency\nOn that efficiency theme, NVIDIA also discussed inference performance. As some context, Chinese AI researchers are moving quickly into the realm of putting AI models to practical applications, something we discussed recently in AI in 2020 and a Glimpse of 2021 with Inspur and NVIDIA. NVIDIA for its part is showing its inference performance scaling to meet the challenge of this rapidly growing workload.\nNVIDIA GTC China 2020 Bill Dally Inference Performance Over Time\nPart of the discussion was broader around dedicated AI accelerators such as the Intel Habana Labs offerings that Facebook selected over NVIDIA GPUs and\u00a0Amazon AWS recently announced EC2 Intel Habana Gaudi Instances as examples, but other smaller players are in the market as well. Here, NVIDIA is showing its specialized instructions reduce overheads of data movement. In turn, the computations occur with less overhead while maintaining GPU programmability and flexibility.\nNVIDIA GTC China 2020 Bill Dally Overhead For Data Movement Versus Payload\nSpecifically, on the inference side, NVIDIA showed off its RC18 or research chip 2018 that it previously published on at 9 TOPS/W. It then showed a next-gen at 29 TOPS/W.\nNVIDIA GTC China 2020 Bill Dally RC18 For Inference\nMuch of this has to do with a more-optimized data flow to maximize the power/ performance of each operation. For inference to become ubiquitous, it needs to be low power as many of the applications will use solar, battery, or other limited power sources and also produced in great quantities.\nNVIDIA GTC China 2020 Bill Dally Inference Next Gen And Has Hit 100TOPSpW\nAnother claim made during the keynote was that NVIDIA now has a test chip at 100TOPS/W. Although NVIDIA said it was not a commercial product, the implications are immense. With the pending NVIDIA-Arm acquisition, this is the type of NVIDIA IP that could potentially be added to the Arm licensing library in the future.\nNVIDIA Orin and The Product Not Named: Jetson Ampere\nAlong the key theme of inferencing, there are a number of Chinese companies working on autonomous transportation projects. As such, NVIDIA is using GTC China 2020 to show off its next-gen autonomous vehicle platforms. For the show, the company showed off its next-gen autonomous vehicle chip, the NVIDIA Orin. Per NVIDIA:\n\u201cThe Orin SoC integrates NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation GPU architecture and Arm Hercules CPU cores, as well as new deep learning and computer vision accelerators that, in aggregate, deliver 200 trillion operations per second\u2014nearly 7x the performance of NVIDIA\u2019s previous generation Xavier SoC.\u201d (Source: NVIDIA)\nNVIDIA GTC China 2020 Bill Dally Orin Ampere\nThe L5 Robotaxi card is said to take two of these Orin SoCs along with two Ampere GPUs for redundancy. NVIDIA has been making hardware for autonomous vehicles for some time but says that this new platform is designed for the 2022 vehicle production timelines.\nEarlier in the talk, Bill showed off an Ampere SXM module and said:\n\u201cWe can scale the power that\u2019s in Ampere from this module (SXM A100) for very demanding computing problems, all the way down to our Jetson line of products to our Jetson products.\u201d Bill Dally NVIDIA at GTC China 2020 Keynote.\nHe gave this line while transitioning from a A100 to a Jetson module.\nNVIDIA GTC China 2020 Bill Dally Jetson\nWhile the company did not announce a Jetson Ampere edition, it makes sense something like this may be coming. One can also see a Jetson box in the background next to a GeForce RTX 3090.\nFinal Words\nOverall, we did not get a major new GPU announcement, and we stretched our hope beyond Orin to hoping this hints at an Ampere Jetson. Still, NVIDIA\u2019s work on AI inference as well as co-packaged photonics show more than the focus on a particular GPU. Instead, these projects are designed to scale and proliferate AI. In the data center, co-packaged photonics will allow for larger and faster system topologies that will help scale-up and scale-out compute to tackle bigger challenges. For the edge, the AI inference efficiency, plus some of what NVIDIA has been showing in products and future compute elements shows how the company is planning to bring inference performance up and power consumption down to meet the needs of more applications. Short of a new GPU announcement, these are exciting visions for the future.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n TAGSAIInspurIntelNVIDIASilicon Photonics \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleNew Intel Optane P5800X 100 DWPD SSD Dominates PCIe Gen4Next articleMarvell Prestera 7K Edge and Access Switch Chip Launch Patrick Kennedyhttps://www.servethehome.comPatrick has been running STH since 2009 and covers a wide variety of SME, SMB, and SOHO IT topics.

This blog post includes updated numbers with additional optimizations since the keynote aired live on 12/8.\nAt re:Invent 2019, we demonstrated the fastest training times on the cloud for Mask R-CNN, a popular instance segmentation model, and BERT, a popular natural language processing (NLP) model. Over the past several months, we have worked in collaboration with NVIDIA to significantly improve the underlying infrastructure, network, machine learning (ML) framework, and model code to once again achieve the best training times for state-of-the-art models used by our customers. Today, we\u2019re excited to share with you the fastest training times for Mask R-CNN on TensorFlow and PyTorch and T5-3B (NLP) on PyTorch, and dive deep into the technology stack, our optimizations, and how you can leverage these capabilities to train large models quickly with Amazon SageMaker.\nSummary results\nOur customers training deep neural network models in PyTorch and TensorFlow have asked for help with problems they face with training speed and model size. First, customers told us they wanted to train models faster without waiting days or weeks for results. Data scientists need to iterate daily to get ML applications to market faster. Second, customers told us they struggled to apply the latest research in NLP because these model architectures didn\u2019t fit in a single NVIDIA GPU\u2019s memory during training. Customers knew they could get higher accuracy from these larger models with billions of parameters. But there was no easy way to automatically and efficiently split a model across multiple NVIDIA GPUs.\nTo solve these problems, AWS released new SageMaker distributed training libraries, which provide the easiest and fastest way to train deep learning models. The SageMaker data parallelism library provides better scaling efficiency than Horovod or PyTorch\u2019s Distributed Data Parallel (DDP), and its model parallelism library automatically splits large models across multiple GPUs. In this post, we describe how this underlying technology was used to achieve record training times for Mask R-CNN and T5-3B.\nMask R-CNN\nObject detection algorithms form the backbone of many deep learning applications. Self-driving cars, security systems, and image processing all incorporate object detection. In particular, Mask R-CNN is ubiquitous in this field. Mask R-CNN takes in an image and then isolates and identifies objects within that image, providing both a bounding box and object mask. Since it was first proposed in 2017, training Mask R-CNN on the COCO dataset has become the standard benchmark for object detection models, and many of our customers use this as their baseline to build their own models.\nOne issue with Mask R-CNN is its complexity. The model incorporates multiple different neural networks performing different tasks. One network identifies candidate objects, while two others are responsible for identifying objects and generating masks. In addition, the model must perform operations like non-max suppression and sample selection, which can be difficult to optimize on the GPU. In the original 2017 paper, Mask R-CNN took 32 hours to train on 8 GPUs with the COCO data. Since then, training time has significantly improved. In 2019, we demonstrated the fastest training times in the cloud for Mask R-CNN\u201427 minutes with PyTorch and 28 minutes with TensorFlow. In 2020, we collaborated with NVIDIA to bring this down to 6:45 minutes on PyTorch and 6:12 minutes on TensorFlow. To our knowledge, this is the fastest time to train Mask R-CNN in the cloud and a 75% reduction from our record last year.\nMask-RCNN Technology stack and performance\nAchieving these results required optimizations to the underlying hardware, networking, and software stack. We added GPU implementations of some operations that are central to training Mask R-CNN. We also added new data pipelining utilities to speed up pre-processing and avoid any degradation in GPU utilization. In collaboration with NVIDIA, we deployed a new optimizer, NovoGrad, to push the boundaries further on large batch training. All of these optimizations are available in SageMaker, the AWS Deep Learning Containers, and the AWS Deep Learning AMIs. The result is that our training times this year are more than twice as fast on a single-node workload, and more than three times as fast on a multi-node workload, as compared to 2019.\nNext, we scaled this optimized single-node workload to a cluster of 64 p3dn.24xlarge instances, each with 8 NVIDIA V100 GPUs. Efficiently scaling to 512 V100 GPUs requires fully utilizing the available bandwidth and topology between Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. At SC20 this year, we demonstrated a reimagined parameter server at scale that was designed from scratch to use the AWS Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) and node-to-node communication between EC2 instances. This technology is available to developers as of today with the SageMaker data parallelism library, with native framework APIs for both TensorFlow and PyTorch.\nDistributed training generally uses one of two distribution strategies: parameter servers or AllReduce. Although parameter servers can perform gradient reduction with less communication than AllReduce (2 hops vs. 2(n-1) hops, respectively) and can perform asynchronous parameter updates, parameter servers tend to suffer from uneven bandwidth allocation and network congestion. Both drawbacks become more apparent with larger clusters. As a result, AllReduce is more often used. However, AllReduce has its own drawbacks. In addition to the increased number of hops, AllReduce requires synchronous updates between nodes, meaning all training is impacted by a single straggler node.\nWe can use EFA to overcome network congestion by spreading communication evenly across multiple routes between nodes. In addition, SageMaker introduces a balanced fusion buffer, which collects gradients on each GPU and shards them evenly to each parameter server, ensuring a balanced workload across the entire cluster. The results show significantly improved scaling efficiency, and reduced training times on larger clusters. With SageMaker, along with new large batch optimizations, we can efficiently scale both TensorFlow and PyTorch to 512 A100 GPUs, while scaling almost linearly. With these new tools, we can train Mask R-CNN to convergence in just above 6 minutes on both frameworks, beating last year\u2019s best time by more than 75%. The following charts show the improvement in scaling efficiency using SageMaker\u2019s data parallelism library when training Mask-RCNN relative to DDP and Horovod.\n \nT5-3B: Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer\nWe\u2019ve seen rapid progress in NLP model accuracy in the past few years. In 2017, we saw the invention of the transformer layer, a novel way for models to identify the portion of the text to focus on. We then saw state-of-the-art models such as BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, and DistilBERT. Now we see researchers achieving record accuracy and zero- or few-shot learning with large models that have billions or hundreds of billions of parameters.\nEmpirical results from OpenAI show that optimal performance comes from scaling up in three dimensions: model size, dataset size, and training steps. Model size is the primary bottleneck, and for smaller models such as BERT, data parallelism alone has been sufficient. Yet scaling to extreme language model sizes has been prohibitively difficult for developers and researchers because models can no longer fit onto a single GPU\u2019s memory, preventing any data parallelism from taking place.\nT5 is 15 times larger than the original BERT model and achieved near-human performance on the SuperGLUE benchmark. In addition, sequence-to-sequence models can perform machine translation, text summarization, and open-domain question-answering. In collaboration with NVIDIA, who supplied the base technology for T5 pre-training and fine-tuning tasks [1], we trained T5-3B in 4.68 days on 2,048 A100 GPUs on 256 p4d.24xlarge instances. The technologies for automatic and efficient splitting of large models across multiple GPU devices are now available in SageMaker.\nT5-3B Technology stack and performance\nSageMaker splits the model into multiple partitions that each fit on a single GPU. The freed memory can then be used to scale to larger batch sizes, further increasing training throughput and speeding up convergence. SageMaker also implements pipelined execution that splits data into smaller micro-batches and interleaves execution to increase GPU utilization.\nThe following figure illustrates an example execution schedule for the interleaved pipeline over two GPUs. F0 represents the forward pass for micro-batch 0, and B1 represents the backward pass for micro-batch 1. \u201cUpdate\u201d represents the optimizer update of the parameters. The figure shows that GPU0 always prioritizes backward passes whenever possible (for instance, running B0 before F2), which allows for clearing the memory used for activations earlier.\n\nTo train T5-3B, SageMaker performed 8-way model parallel training combined with 256-way data parallel training. We further improved training time by using the new p4d.24xlarge instances, equipped with 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs and supporting 400 Gbps network bandwidth. We reduced the training time to 4.68 days by efficiently scaling out to 256 instances. We used EFA to optimize network communication over large clusters. We achieved the best training performance by using SageMaker, 256 p4d.24xlarge instances, and EFA.\nTo evaluate model performance, we fine-tuned the pre-trained checkpoints on a downstream natural language inference task. We used the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI) corpus for fine-tuning. The corpus contains around 433,000 hypothesis/premise sentence pairs and covers a range of genres of spoken and written text with support for cross-genre evaluation. We obtained a score of 91.48 for in-genre (matched) and a score of 91.29 for cross-genre (mismatched) in only 4.68 days time to train.\nConclusion\nWith these new record-breaking training times, AWS continues to be the industry leader in cloud ML.

It wasn\u2019t this year,\u00a02010, or even during the \u201890s tech boom. It\u2019s from one of America\u2019s top computer scientists: in\u00a01960.\n\n\nYou\u2019ve surely heard about\u00a0Artificial Intelligence (AI)\u00a0before. \u201cAI\u201d often conjures up images of intelligent robots taking over the world. You\u2019ll often read that it\u2019s only a matter of time before AI steals all our jobs.\n\nBut the idea of humanoid machines is nothing new. It began with the \u201cheartless\u201d Tin Man from\u00a0The Wizard of Oz. By the 1950s, a generation of scientists and engineers were convinced we\u2019d soon co-exist with clever robots.\n\n\nThe term artificial intelligence was coined in 1954 at Dartmouth during the world\u2019s first AI conference. Attendee Marvin Minsky, who later founded MIT\u2019s AI lab, said\u00a0\u201cIn 3\u20138 years, we will have a machine with the intelligence of a human.\u201d\nA couple of years later, Stanford created its AI project\u00a0\u201cwith the goal of building a fully intelligent machine in a decade.\u201d\nThis idea gripped Hollywood, too. Ever watch the sci-fi classic\u00a02001: A Space Odyssey? The 1968 movie is best remembered for the intelligent supercomputer, HAL 9000. HAL could think just like a human and had the ability to scheme against anyone who threatened its survival.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nSoon novels like\u00a0I, Robot\u00a0packed our bookshelves. We got stories of robots gone mad, mind-reading robots, robots with a sense of humor, and robots that secretly run the world.\n\nEven the US military was convinced, so it pumped billions of dollars into AI research. In the \u201850s, we imagined bionic men would soon be running factories. Within a decade, cyborgs would be doing our housework. We were promised a new breed of machines.\n\n\n70 years later, what did we get? Dishwashers, air conditioners, and microwaves!\nHow Do Robots Learn?\nDespite many lofty predictions and billions of dollars in funding, we never got machines with human-like intelligence. You have to dig into how machines learn to see why the idea was a flop from the get-go.\n\u201cAI\u201d is a term that\u2019s shrouded in a weird mix of hype and complexity. But the core idea of\u00a0artificial intelligence\u00a0is a machine that learns and thinks just like you or I. Most importantly, it learns all by itself, without human intervention.\nOf course learning doesn\u2019t come naturally to robots. To overcome this challenge, scientists created neural networks in the late 1950s. In short, neural networks are computer programs that mimic how the human brain works. They are made of thousands\u2014sometimes millions\u2014of artificial \u201cbrain cells\u201d that learn through analyzing examples.\nSay you\u2019re creating a machine that can recognize cats. First, you\u2019ll feed tons of cat pictures into the neural network. After analyzing, say, 1,000 examples, it starts to learn what a cat looks like. Then you can show it a real cat it\u2019s never seen before, and it will know what it is.\nScientists who believed neural networks would breed intelligent computers were right on the money. Problem was\u2026 they lacked the raw materials needed to fuel their ambitions.\nRemember, machines learn through analyzing examples, or data. And it turns out you need to feed them with truly enormous amounts of data to kindle any kind of intelligence. So machines need to see hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of cat pictures before they \u201clearn\u201d what a cat looks like. But in the \u201860s and \u201870s, we didn\u2019t have that much data. The internet wasn\u2019t invented, so we had almost no digital text or images. Books, photo libraries, and documents were still in the physical world, which meant converting them into digital files was inefficient and expensive.\nAnd get this: the lack of data wasn\u2019t even the greatest hurdle to building intelligent computers. Designing computer programs that mimic the human brain was genius. The drawback was neural networks needed hyper-fast computers to function.\nAnd by 1995, even supercomputers were shockingly slow. For example, it took a giant \u201crender farm\u201d of 117 Sun Microsystems running 24/7 to produce the original\u00a0Toy Story. The machines worked non-stop for seven weeks to produce the 78-minute film.\nA Match Made in Heaven\nAfter 40 years in the wilderness,\u00a0two huge breakthroughs are fueling an AI renaissance.\nThe internet handed us a near unlimited amount of data. A recent IBM paper found 90% of the world\u2019s data has been created in just the last two years. From the 290+ billion photos shared on Facebook, to millions of e-books, billions of online articles and images, we now have endless fodder for neural networks.\nThe breathtaking jump in computing power is the other half of the equation. RiskHedge\u00a0readers know computer chips are the \u201cbrains\u201d of electronics like your phone and laptop. Chips contain billions of \u201cbrain cells\u201d called transistors. The more transistors on a chip, the faster it is.\nYour phone is more powerful than the render farm that produced\u00a0Toy Story. The 117 Sun Microsystems had 1 billion transistors, combined. There are 8.7 billion packed onto the chip inside the latest iPhone!\nAnd in the past decade, a special type of computer chip emerged as the perfect fit for neural networks.\nDo you remember the blocky graphics on video games like Mario and Sonic from the \u201890s? If you have kids who are gamers, you\u2019ll know graphics have gotten far more realistic since then. Here\u2019s each Lara Croft from the\u00a0Tomb Raider\u00a0series since 1996:Source: Epic Games\nThis incredible jump is due to chips called\u00a0graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs can perform thousands of calculations all at once, which helps create these movie-like graphics. That\u2019s different from how traditional chips work, which calculate one by one.\nAround 2006, Stanford researchers discovered GPUs \u201cparallel processing\u201d abilities were perfect for AI training. For example, do you remember Google\u2019s Brain project? The machine taught itself to recognize cats and people by watching YouTube videos. It was powered by one of Google\u2019s giant data centers, running on 2,000 traditional computer chips. In fact, the project cost a hefty $5 billion.\nStanford researchers then built the same machine with GPUs instead. A dozen GPUs delivered the same data crunching performance of 2,000 traditional chips. And it slashed costs from $5 billion to $33,000! The huge leap in computing power and explosion of data means we finally have the \u201clifeblood\u201d of AI.\nAmerica\u2019s Most Important Company\nArtificial intelligence is the ultimate buzzword in tech these days. Data from Bloomberg shows a record 840 US firms mentioned AI at least once in recent earnings reports. In short, it\u2019s become a \u201cmating call\u201d for companies trying to attract investor dollars.\nThe reality is few of these companies are building intelligent systems. For example, venture capital firm MMC Ventures recently studied 2,830 AI start-ups. In 40% of cases, it found no evidence AI was an important part of their business.\nYou only need to ask one simple question to weed out the fakes: What percent of their sales come from AI? I\u2019ve done the work: and I can tell you only a handful make any money from this budding disruption.\nThe one company with a booming AI business is\u00a0NVIDIA (NVDA). NVIDIA invented graphics processing units back in the 1990s. It\u2019s solely responsible for the realistic video game graphics we have today. And then we discovered these gaming chips were perfect for training neural networks.\nNVIDIA stumbled into AI by accident, but early on, it realized it was a huge opportunity. Soon after, NVIDIA started building chips specifically optimized for machine learning. And in the first half of 2020, AI-related sales topped $2.8 billion. In fact, more than 90% of neural network training runs on NVIDIA GPUs today.\nIts AI-chips are lightyears ahead of the competition. Its newest system, the A100, is described as an \u201cAI supercomputer in a box.\u201d With more than 54 billion transistors, it\u2019s the most powerful chip system ever created.\nIn fact, just one A100 packs the same computing power as 300 data center servers. And it does it for one-tenth the cost, takes up one-sixtieth the space, and runs on one-twentieth the power consumption of a typical server room. A single A100 reduces a whole room of servers to one rack.\nThe Epicenter of Disruption\nNVIDIA has a virtual monopoly on neural network training. And every breakthrough worth mentioning has been powered by its GPUs.\nComputer vision is one of the world\u2019s most important\u00a0disruptions. And graphics chips are perfect for helping computers to \u201csee.\u201d\nNVIDIA crafted its DRIVE chips specially for self-driving cars. These chips power several robocar startups including Zoox, which Amazon just snapped up for $1.2 billion. With NVIDIA\u2019s backing, vision disruptor Trigo is transforming grocery stores into giant supercomputers.\nTrigo fits stores out with a network of cameras and sensors, which feed its neural network with reams of data. In short, the network has learned to \u201csee\u201d what items customers throw in their baskets. So when you\u2019re finished shopping, you simply walk out. Trigo then sends the store a tally, who bills you for that amount.\nTrigo\u2019s computer vision system is powered by NVIDIA chips and software. The UK\u2019s largest grocer, Tesco, is trialing Trigo in several of its stores. and each system runs on 40\u201350 GPUs.\nBut hands-down the biggest breakthroughs are happening in America\u2019s most broken industry\u2014healthcare.\nCancer is the #2 killer in America, responsible for 600,000 deaths last year. Catching the disease early has proven to be an effective way of beating it. But today, spotting tumors is a manual, time-consuming process.\nMedical imaging disruptor Paige.AI built an AI system that could revolutionize cancer diagnosis. Paige.AI fed millions of real-life medical images into its neural network. Using 10 NVIDIA GPUs, it trained the system to detect early signs of tumors.\nThe neural network recently tested itself by scanning 12,000 medical images for potential tumors. It had never seen these images before, yet was able to \u201cachieve near perfect accuracy.\u201d After announcing these results, Paige.AI was granted \u201cBreakthrough Designation\u201d by the FDA,\u00a0the first ever for an AI in cancer diagnosis.\nNVIDIA is also opening the door to early detection of Alzheimer\u2019s. Stanford researchers built an AI system that detects Alzheimer\u2019s disease from scanning MRIs with 94% accuracy. Powered by six GPUs, it \u201clearned\u201d what biomarkers were most commonly associated with early signs of the disease.\nThe powerful GPU/AI combo is also saving victims of strokes. During a stroke, patients lose roughly 1.9 million brain cells every minute. So interpreting their CT scans even one second faster matters.\nMedical imaging startup Deep01 has created a neural network which almost instantly evaluates strokes. DeepCT has a 95% accuracy rate within 30 seconds per case, which is roughly 10x faster than traditional methods. The system was trained on 60,000 medical images, using NVIDIA chips. And get this\u2026 it\u2019s the first Asian firm to be granted FDA clearance for an AI product.\nI could pepper you with dozens more examples, but you see my point. NVIDIA\u2019s chips have powered almost every major AI breakthrough. It\u2019s a buy today.\nGet my report\u00a0\"The Great Disruptors:\u00a03 Breakthrough Stocks Set to Double Your Money\".\u00a0These stocks will hand you 100% gains as they disrupt whole industries.\u00a0Get your free copy here.\n\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Five of these units, with sizes ranging from 743 to 1,184 sq ft, are designated for F&B use and have prime frontage along Upper Changi Road North.    Scale model of the retail podium of Parc Komo, called Komo Shoppes, which has 28 strata shop units across two floors (Photo: Albert Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) Parc Komo is a redevelopment of the former Changi Garden, which CEL Development had acquired en bloc for $248.8 million, or $888 psf per plot ratio (psf ppr), in October 2017. The former Changi Garden had 72 apartments on the upper floors of the four-storey block, and 12 shops on the ground level. Among the F&B outlets that used to be there were a coffeeshop, bistro and an Italian restaurant, Porta-Porta, which had been there for more than 20 years ago.  Don't miss out to check out the hottest new launch condo and new landed property in Singapore \u201cThese old shops did very well because there\u2019s a huge catchment of people living in the area who would drop by for lunch, coffee break or dinner,\u201d says Michael Ng, executive director of CEL Development. \u201cAnd we want to make sure that the new Komo Shoppes does well too.\u201d Given that there are only five F&B units, the developer is very selective in ensuring that it gets the right tenants in. \u201cWe need to have at least three different F&B tenants to provide residents with variety,\u201d says Peter Wee, CEL general manager of business development and marketing. \u201cWe want to secure brands that will be well-liked by residents.\u201d    Showflat of a two-bedroom, duplex apartment at Parc Komo (Photo: Albert Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) Catchment \u2014 private condos and landed housing estates When completed sometime in 1H2022, Komo Shoppes will be accessible to the public too. Its catchment area therefore extends beyond the residents of the 276 units at Parc Komo. In the vicinity are the landed housing estate of Jalan Mariam and Toh Estate, as well as the private condos in the Flora Drive and Flora Road enclave. That translates to a combined total of 5,000 households and population size of about 20,000, estimates CEL Development\u2019s Ng. Nearby is not just Changi Business Park, but the Changi North and Changi South industrial estates, Loyang Industrial Estate and the Aviation Logistics Park. On weekdays, the shops will benefit from the lunch crowd from the offices in the neighbouring industrial estates and logistics park, notes Wee.   Story continues The change in the Service 5 bus route is also a boon for the future tenants at Komo Shoppes. The new route for Service 5 will include stops at Flora Drive and Mariam Way before reaching the bus stop in front of Komo Shoppes. This brings greater convenience for residents living in the neighbourhood who want to dine or shop at Komo Shoppes, adds Wee.Besides the five F&B shop units, there are seven other strata-titled units on the first level with a combined strata area of 7,212 sq ft. CEL Development therefore wants to lease the space to an upscale supermarket, notes Ng. Several supermarket operators are already vying for the space and negotiations are \u201cat an advanced stage\u201d, he adds.On the second level of Komo Shoppes are 16 strata shop units of various sizes, ranging from 323 to 1,679 sq ft in strata area. These retail units are ideal for tuition centres or enrichment schools, amenities such as hair salons, wellness spas, or even medical clinics and dental clinics. It is already seeing interest from a private medical group interested in occupying several units on the second level and operating a specialists\u2019 centre there, says Ng.  Second level of two-bedroom, duplex showflat at Parc Komo (Photo: Albert Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)Laidback lifestyleThis is because the residential enclave in that part of Changi is predominantly made up of mid-upper to high-income households, continues Ng. Komo Shoppes is well-positioned as a high-end project, which is in line with Parc Komo\u2019s concept of a \u201cresort lifestyle, with lush landscaping\u201d, he adds.With the Covid-19 pandemic this past year, more people \u2014 both young and old \u2014 have discovered the merits of a laidback lifestyle. In addition to its resort-style setting, Parc Komo is situated near Changi Village, the 2.2km Changi Boardwalk coastal trail, Changi Beach Park and Changi Sailing Club. It is also near Jewel at Changi Airport, as well as within a nine-minute walk to the future Loyang MRT Station on the Cross Island Line.Besides underground parking for visitors, there is dedicated parking space for bicycles at Komo Shoppes too. \u201cMore people have taken up cycling since the circuit breaker,\u201d says Ng. CEL\u2019s priority is to lease out the shop units, the F&B outlets and supermarket space at Komo Shoppes.

The 99-year leasehold private condominium is scheduled for completion in 2Q2022 \u2014 about 1.5 years from now. Nestled in the private residential estate of Toh Tuck Road in Bukit Timah, it is also in proximity to Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and Bukit Batok Nature Reserve. The serenity of the location is one of the main reasons why Daintree Residence\u2019s developer, SP Setia International, was drawn to it. SP Setia International is a Singapore-based subsidiary and overseas business arm of Malaysian public-listed property developer, SP Setia. In April 2017, the developer submitted the top bid of $265 million for the 201,523 sq ft site \u2014 the highest among 24 bids received \u2014 and was awarded the tender. Named after Daintree Rainforest in Queensland, Australia, which is a World Heritage site where up to three-quarters of land is covered with tropical rainforests, Daintree Residence\u2019s landscaping and 50 facilities seek to emulate lush living in the tropics.    High-quality finishes and fittings, such as imported marble flooring, are provided in the units (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore)  The 12 five-storey blocks of the development are arranged in two wings, aptly named the Rainforest Wing and Valley Wing. All units enjoy a view of the pools in the development, or surrounding greenery outside of the development. In the Valley Wing, there is a 25m infinity pool, spa beds and bubbling waters, set in a verdant environment. The tennis court is on the top floor in the Valley Wing as well.  Meanwhile, in the Rainforest Wing, there is a 50m leisure pool which is equipped with a jacuzzi, aqua gym and foot spa. At the other end of the pool, there is a separate splash pool for young children. Residents can exercise in the gym or relax in the steam room, or escape to a quieter corner at the Hammock Bay and Water Bay, away from the main pool. The appointed architect at Daintree Residence is renowned ADDP Architects and the landscape designer is EcoPlan Asia. Neo Keng Hoe, general manager of SP Setia International, the developer of Daintree Residence, says: \u201cThe design showcases a well-articulated fa\u00e7ade, reminiscent of the terrain of a quarry that characterised Bukit Timah.\u201d    Units on the first and fifth floors boast high 4.3m ceilings (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore)    Story continues Neo says that buyers have shown interest and excitement to have their guests explore the panoramic 330m Treetop Walk on the sixth storey, which connects the Valley Wing with the Rainforest Wing. On this linkway, homeowners can enjoy views of nature and access facilities on the top floors of both blocks.Another highlight of the development is the heritage raintree at the Rainforest Wing, which has stood tall since Singapore\u2019s nation-building years. Neo says: \u201cIt will offer residents a sanctuary-like ambience for them to revitalise themselves and to relax.\u201dGrowing tenant pool in a mature estateNeo says that construction at Daintree Residence has resumed after stopping for a few months during the \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d period, and is now in full swing.Daintree Residence will only be a six-minute walk to Beauty World MRT Station. Bukit Timah Shopping Centre and Beauty World Plaza will be a short walk away.  Buyers like the project\u2019s spacious layouts (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore) Daintree Residence will also be near the future Bukit Timah Community Building. The 216,000 sq ft building will house a community club, indoor sports hall, community library and elderly facility. There will also be a new market and hawker centre within the facility.Don't miss out to check out the hottest new launch condo and new landed property in SingaporeTop schools located nearby include Methodist Girls\u2019 School, Nanyang Girls\u2019 High School, Hwa Chong Institution, National Junior College and NUS High School. For young families, there are three primary schools within 1km of the project: Pei Hwa Presbyterian School and Bukit Timah Primary School. Keming Primary School is also within 2km.Neo says: \u201cThe ongoing rejuvenation of Beauty World will enhance connectivity and introduce amenities and nature attractions to the precinct. The many good schools in its vicinity and a new integrated transport hub will attract residents and tenants to this convenient, charming and mature neighbourhood.\u201dIn the future, there will be a new mixed-use development at Jalan Anak Bukit, which will form part of the integrated transport hub, connected directly to the Beauty World MRT station. The tender for the site will close at the end of next March. The future development will have over one million sq ft of space, including retail and F&B offerings, which will benefit residents nearby, including those at Daintree Residence.Neo says that there has been an increase in interest from \u201cserious buyers\u201d since the announcement of the launch of the Jalan Anak Bukit site for tender, given its proximity to the Toh Tuck enclave.Quality finishes and fittings, such as imported marble flooring, are provided in the units, ranging from 517 sq ft one-bedders to 1,539 sq ft four-bedders. Bathroom fittings and wares will be from Hansgrohe and Duravit. Kitchens will also come fully equipped with top-end appliances from De Dietrich.

Team Latestly   10 December 2020 3 min read          The digital age has been a game changer for many entrepreneurs since its inception, as they look for different avenues to monetize via the internet. From leisurely posts, to showcasing everything from their new clothing to their favorite activities, social media has become a powerful force in growing an individual's image. Once these individuals started garnering hundreds of thousands of likes and followers, people and brands started taking notice of this phenomenon, where an individual could become a self-made entrepreneur that capitalizes on their likeness. Subscription based platforms have started growing with an overwhelming pace, and one entrepreneur has been able to largely monetize her success on the rise of such platforms.  Jessica Bartlett is that entrepreneur, with over 1 million followers on Instagram, she began to see the striking capabilities to profit off the large following she had amassed. Bartlett realized that she could make a substantial amount of money via brand sponsorship and partnerships with various companies, however, there was something missing from this concept that she believed other fellow influencers were also aware of. Why promote someone else\u2019s brand or service, when she could create a platform for herself to engage her followers and capitalize on herself? When Bartlett realized this, COY Co. was born. Bartlett noticed that influencers like herself began to see value in formulating a brand based off themselves, as opposed to using their social media success for the benefit of others. Exclusive content was more profitable than partnering with a brand, so why let someone capitalize on your likeness, when you can capitalize on yourself? This was the cornerstone on which Bartlett built her very own platform, COY Co.  Bartlett\u2019s platform gives influencers the control to create various content, so long as it offers more value than their loyal followers can find on Instagram. Bartlett emboldens her fellow influencers to make full utility of her platform, and \u201cCapitalize on You\u201d. Coy Co. distinguishes itself from sites like OnlyFans and Patreon, where the influencers aren\u2019t perceived as sex workers, but rather elite influencers who have worked hard to amass a following- Bartlett also has a requisite component to her site that the influencers have to have a certain number of followers to be considered for her platform. Another great element of the platform is that it has safeguards in place to shield the influencers from content leaks, as well as legal support. Any leaked content is instantly removed from the site within a span of 24 hours.   Story continues With the necessary safety measures on Bartlett\u2019s platform, influencers are free of any potential concern or stress, as they are free to solely focus on creating exclusive content that their loyal fan base can appreciate, content that goes well beyond what they would see on Instagram. COY Co. also provides influencers with valuable components like aiding with the organization of monthly photo shoots, top notch production, paid marketing and media campaigns, among other things. Bartlett knows the industry inside and out, and her platform is well on its way to becoming the most popular option when it comes to premium subscription content.To get more information about COY Co., visit their Instagram page @thecoyco or their website at www.thecoyco.com  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

DBS Group Research analyst Sachin Mittal has maintained \u201cbuy\u201d on Sea Limited as he believes its securing of a digital full bank (DFB) licence by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) could accelerate its growth in the greater Southeast Asia region.  \u201cIts licence award seems ideal because Sea has a trio of digital services; Garena (digital entertainment), Shopee (ecommerce) and SeaMoney (digital financial services). Obtaining the licence to operate as a fully-fledged digital bank would allow them to cater to the users it acquired through its three core business segments while offering banking services to the underserved segments and small and medium businesses in Singapore,\u201d he writes in a Dec 7 report. As such, Mittal has upped Sea\u2019s target price to US$228 ($304.41) from US$204 previously, mainly on higher valuation for digital financial services. \u201cThe change in our target price is derived from a fair value of US$22 (previously US$2) for digital financial services (DFS) as we switch to Enterprise Value (EV) to user base (from EV to revenue earlier) and a fair value of US$83 (previously US$80) for the gaming business on higher Price to Earnings Ratio (PER) of 24x (previously 23x) based on peer valuation,\u201d he adds.  For more stories about where the money flows, click here for our Capital section  The winning of the DFB licence on Dec 4 is currently expected to accelerate Sea\u2019s growth in the digital financial services. To this end, Mittal has projected FY2019-2022F adjusted revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 91% for e-commerce, 34% for gaming and 124% for digital financial services. Potential catalysts that could contribute to Sea\u2019s share price include the growth in e-commerce adjusted revenue as well as sustained growth in profits in the gaming business. That said, Mittal says the brokerage\u2019s FY2020F/2021F adjusted revenue are 10% higher than consensus\u2019 estimates.  SEE:DBS ups\u00a0Sea\u00a0Limited\u2019s TP on 'surging popularity' of Free Fire  Its gaming segment is also seeing growth. Sea\u2019s in-house developed game, Free Fire, has continued to enjoy popularity amid the movement restrictions amid Covid-19. The game is also benefitting from the ban of the PUBG game in India, one of Sea\u2019s largest markets. \u201cSea\u2019s mounting cash flow from its gaming business is a big competitive edge in: consolidating its leadership position in the e-commerce business, and kick-starting growth of its nascent payment business,\u201d says Mittal.   Story continues \u201cSea might burn more cash in the e-commerce business to raise its market share further. We expect the e-commerce and DFS segments to continue to report adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) losses in FY20F/21F due to the intense competition,\u201d he adds.\u201cOur projections could be at risk if Free Fire slows down next year and if Sea is unable to develop a pipeline of new games. For e-commerce, cross-border revenue could disappoint due to regulatory issues.\u201dShares in Sea are trading at US$198.78 with a price-to-book value of 139.7x.See Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore IHH Healthcare prepares to administer Covid-19 vaccine in 10 countries  BRC Asia uses Covid-19 downtime to improve on products and services Global race to recover from Covid-19 Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

Knowing the general trends in the property market can alert you moments to when you should shop around for deals or consider putting up a property for sale. Conversely, it can also alert you to moments when it would be better to hold off on buying and selling.  Thankfully, the internet is a goldmine of information for anyone who\u2019s buying, selling or renting property. Aside from our quarterly Property Market Index and annual Property Market Outlook reports, official statistics and data released by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is another useful resource. In fact, the URA maintains a data calendar so you can monitor when certain figures (such as the URA Property Price Index) are released.  Here are some key sets of URA data you can find online. \u00a0 About URA Real Estate Statistics As mentioned, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) releases real estate statistics for the private property market every quarter.

For those who are thinking of buying or selling a private home, here are some useful real estate statistics released by URA every quarter. You can find them under the title \u201cQuarterly Property Market Updates\u201d.Here\u2019s an example of Q3 2020\u2019s data report.\u00a0  ura real estate stats 1  Credit: URA\u00a0For this article, we will be using Q3 2020\u2019s report as an example as it is the latest at the time of writing.Property prices and rentalsBuying or renting private residential property? Then you\u2019ll want to follow the rental and price indices published by URA. These indices compare the current quarter\u2019s prices and rents with previous quarters\u2019 and indicate by what percentage they have risen or fallen.\u00a0  ura real estate stats 2  The URA Property Price Index chart, as of Q3 2020. Credit: URA\u00a0  ura real estate stats 3  The URA Rental Index chart, as of Q3 2020. Credit: URA\u00a0Looking at quarterly index movements in graph form over a number of years can give you a better idea of how property prices and rents have been changing over time. This is particularly useful for property investors who are trying to identify an opportune time to buy or sell.Launches and take-up ratesThe launch and take-up rate reflect the demand and supply of property. In particular, look out for gaps between the launch and take-up rate to identify opportunities.\u00a0  ura real estate stats 4  The URA launches and take-up rate chart, as of Q3 2020. Credit: URA\u00a0For instance, a high launch and low take-up rate can indicate that there is an oversupply of property in the market, which is favourable for buyers looking for a bargain. On the other hand, a low launch and high take-up rate indicate high demand relative to supply, and can be favourable for those who are looking to sell property at a good price. Sales and sub-salesURA tracks the number of new, resale and sub-sale transactions every quarter. It\u2019s useful to know the difference between the three. New sales are typically developer sales, which represent the new launch condos sold by developers. For example, a property seeker \u2013 let\u2019s call him John \u2013 visited a showflat for a new project and decided to buy a unit. That is considered a new sale. Like new sales, sub-sale transactions tend to involve uncompleted property. A sub-sale is when a property is bought from a developer and then sold from the first buyer to another buyer before the project has been completed. For example, after John buys a new launch condo from the developer, there was a change in his plans. As such, he decided to sell his unit to another buyer, even though the project has not been completed and he has not even lived in the new home. The transaction between John and this new buyer is a sub-sale. Lastly, resale transactions are the sales of an existing, usually completed, property from an existing owner to another person. For example, when John decided to buy his new condo, he also needed to sell his existing home to free up cash to afford the new property. The sale of his existing home is a resale transaction. These three add up to the total volume of sales, which can be valuable information as it indicates availability and/or demand of property on the market. The quarterly report typically shares a chart on the resale and sub-sale figures:\u00a0  ura real estate stats 5  The URA resale and sub-sale transaction chart, as of Q3 2020. Credit: URA\u00a0A high proportion of sales being sub-sales can indicate certain trends, such as a financial crisis which forces people to sell their properties in a sub-sale, or conversely a property boom that encourages people to sell at a profit before the property is completed.Supply in the pipelineURA also publishes figures on the housing supply in the pipeline. This figure indicates uncompleted private residential units. URA also indicates how many of them are still unsold.\u00a0  ura real estate stats 6  The URA unsold units chart, as of Q3 2020. Credit: URA\u00a0Checking this figure can help you to avoid selling your property in periods when developers are releasing large numbers of units.Stock and vacancyThis figure measures the occupancy rate of private residential units, and is of interest if you are a property owner looking to rent out property or a renter looking to negotiate a new lease or renegotiate an existing one.\u00a0  ura real estate stats 7  The URA stock and vacancy chart, as of Q3 2020. Credit: URA\u00a0A big difference between stock and vacancy indicates that landlords are struggling to find renters, and typically puts downward pressure on rents.\u00a0Complement URA\u2019s data with PropertyGuru\u2019s Market Index reportsFor those looking for more data on which to base real estate decisions, PropertyGuru publishes a quarterly Property Market Index report containing insightful analysis of data collected internally.PropertyGuru\u2019s report can be a great complement to URA data\u2014the latter measures actual transactions, while PropertyGuru\u2019s data comes from asking prices and listings on the PropertyGuru website, which is one of Singapore\u2019s most widely used real estate portals.Using data from both URA and PropertyGuru, you can get a more complete snapshot of the market each quarter and make smarter and more informed decisions.Here\u2019s a list of the property reports for 2020:Property Market Index Q1 2020 Property Market Index Q2 2020 Property Market Index Q3 2020 Property Market Index Q4 2020 Property Market Outlook 2021 For the latest news and market insights, follow PropertyGuru on Facebook or check our Guides section.

Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

A village in Madhya Pradesh's Dhar district has begun submerging as the level of the backwater of neighbouring Gujarat's Sardar Sarovar Dam started rising over the past fortnight due to heavy rains.\nOn Sunday, the backwater level rose to 133 metres, 6.5 metres above the danger mark, leaving thousands of trees, a large chunk of agricultural land and human settlements in Nisarpur, about 180 kilometres from here, on the brink of going under, a senior official said.\nA backwater is part of a river in which there is almost no current and gets created after the natural flow of the river is obstructed due to the construction of dams as well as natural causes like vegetation.\nThe village, two centuries old, has a population of around 10,000 and several of them have moist eyes as they see everything that was part of their lives start to fold up as the water level rises unrelentingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is located on the banks of the Uri Baghini river and water released from the Sardar Sarovar Dam over the past 20 days had caused the river level to rise continuously, Devendra Kumar Kamdar, a leader of the dam's affected people and president of a local traders union, told PTI.\n\"On Sunday, level of Sardar Sarovar Dam's backwater, located about four kilometres from Nisarpur, reached 133 metres, which is 6.5 metres above the danger mark,\" an official from Madhya Pradesh government's Narmada Valley Development Authority (NVDA) told PTI.\n\"After heavy rain, water is being released from dams built on the Narmada and its tributaries, including Uri Baghini. The water level near Nisarpur is rising rapidly,\" the NVDA official added.\nKamdar informed that around half the villages in the vicinity have been evacuated, claiming that the situation also highlighted the irregularities and discrepancies in the government's compensation distribution mechanism and the resettlement of displaced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn official on condition of anonymity contended that several people continued to stay in Nisarpur despite getting compensation and being asked to shift.\nThe administration has asked people to leave as soon as possible as the water level rises by the hour, an official said, adding that the state government had set up a permanent rehabilitation site as well as temporary tin-sheds for the displaced.\nVehicles were being arranged for the people to shift household items, he added.\nResidents rue markets, temples, mosques, crematoria, and other sites that have been part of their lives for years now are slowly beginning to disappear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These are the places I grew up in, playing with my friends. Maybe the water level will come down during summer but Nisarpur will never be the same again due to large scale migration,\" said a tearful Yash Patidar.\nPatidar had a two-wheeler showroom in Nisarpur which he recently vacated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAGS\n\n\n\n\nFloods \n\n\n\nSardar Sarovar Dam \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE-editions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPodcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur sites\n\n\n\n\n\nMANORAMA ONLINE\n\n\nHello Address\n\n\nMANORAMA HORIZON\n\n\nVANITHA\n\n\nTHE WEEK\n\n\nMANORAMA NEWS TV\n\n\nMANORAMA YEARBOOK\n\n\nMANORAMA MAX\n\n\nRADIO MANGO\n\n\nBOOKS & MAGAZNE\n\n\nQUICKERALA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nMANORAMA PRODUCTS\n\n\nMEDIA KIT\n\n\nPrivacy\n\n\nCareers @ Manorama\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Link\n\n\n\n\n\nCareers @ Manorama\n\n\nSALES KIT\n\n\nMEDIA KIT\n\n\nMANORAMA PRODUCTS\n\n\nSITEMAP\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\nPrivacy\n\n\nCode of Ethics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews & Specials\r\n            Now on WhatsApp\nGet latest news updates and Onmanorama exclusives on our WhatsApp channel.\n\n\n\n Click to Join \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSections\n\n\n\n\n        Kerala\n    \n\n\n\n        News\n    \n\n\n\n        Entertainment\n    \n\n\n\n        LifeStyle\n    \n\n\n\n        Health\n    \n\n\n\n        Career & Campus\n    \n\n\n\n        Sports\n    \n\n\n\n        Food\n    \n\n\n\n        Travel\n    \n\n\n\n        Videos\n    \n\n\n\n        Web Stories\n    \n\n\n\n        Podcast\n    \n\n\n\n        Shortz\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2025 Onmanorama.

The 8,740 sq ft, five-bedroom unit was sold for $27.64 million ($3,163 psf) on April 24; it had been previously bought for $16 million ($1,831 psf) in January 1998. This is the first time this penthouse has changed hands on the resale market. The sale earned the seller a windfall of $11.65 million, or a profit of 73%. This translates to an annualised profit of 2.5% over 22 years.  Ardmore Park is one of the biggest luxury condominiums in the prestigious Ardmore Park neighbourhood. Nearby luxury apartments include Le Nouvel Ardmore, Sculptura Ardmore and Nouvel 18. The development is also close to Shangri-La Hotel, The Tanglin Club and Orchard Road.

(Picture: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore) The freehold Ardmore Park was completed in 2001 and comprises three 30-storey towers with 330 units. It has only four-bedroom units of about 2,884 sq ft, apart from each tower having two duplex penthouses on the 29th and 30th floors. There have been five resale transactions at Ardmore Park this year. Four of them have been profitable, with gains ranging from $720,000 to the $11.65 million in April.\u00a0 The second most profitable transaction at Ardmore Park this year was the sale of a 2,885 sq ft unit on the 13th floor for $8.5 million ($2,947 psf) on Sept 24. The unit had previously fetched $5.38 million ($1,865 psf) in January 1997. As a result, the seller earned $3.12 million, or a profit of 58%. This translates to an annualised profit of 2% over 23 years.     The second most profitable transaction of 2020 occurred at Ardmore Park\u2019s neighbouring condo, The Claymore. It involved the sale of a 4,919 sq ft, five-bedroom unit for $17 million ($3,456 psf)\u00a0 on April 13, having been bought for $7.99 million ($1,626 psf) in March 2002. As a result, the seller earned $9 million\u00a0 or a profit of 113%. This translates to an annualised profit of 4.3% over 18 years. This sale is also the most profitable resale transaction to date at The Claymore. The Claymore is a freehold development on Claymore Road in prime District 9. There are 146 units in two residential towers that comprise a mix of three- and five-bedroom units of 2,680 sq ft to 4,919 sq ft.   Story continues The previous record resale transaction was by a similarly sized, five-bedroom unit in the opposite block that fetched $12.75 million ($2,592 psf) in January 2011, after it had been bought for $5.5 million ($1,118 psf) in May 2001. This means that the seller walked away with a profit of $7.25 million, or a 132%, on the sale, and an annualised profit of 9% over nine years.  A 4,919 sq ft unit at The Claymore fetched $17 million when it was sold on April 13. (Picture: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore)Staying in District 9, the top resale loss of the year involved the sale of a 2,756 sq ft unit at Reignwood Hamilton Scotts. This three-bedroom unit on the 24th floor was sold for $7.19 million ($2,609 psf) on Dec 2, after it had been bought for $13.78 million ($5,001 psf) in June 2013. As a result, the seller incurred a loss of $6.59 million, or 48%, on the deal. This translates to an annualised loss of 8.3% over 7\u00bd years. It is also the most unprofitable deal that has been recorded at the development so far.Reignwood Hamilton Scotts is a freehold luxury condo on Scotts Road. The 52-unit development comprises a mix of three-bedroom units of 2,756 sq ft to 2,722 sq ft, two junior penthouses of 3,229 sq ft, and two penthouses of 6,975 sq ft. The signature feature at Reignwood Hamilton Scotts is the sky garages for each unit that are designed to showcase the owners\u2019 luxury cars.So far this year, there have been only two resale transactions at the condo, and both have resulted in losses. The other unprofitable transaction this year was the sale of a 2,722 sq ft unit on the 25th floor for $7.5 million ($2,722 psf) on July 21. The property had been bought for $8.82 million ($3,200 psf) in June 2010. The seller thus saw a loss of $1.32 million, or 15%, from the resale transaction, translating to an annualised loss of 1.6% over 10 years.  The sale of a 2,756 sq ft unit at Reignwood Hamilton Scotts on Dec 2 turned into the most unprofitable deal of 2020, with a $6.59 million loss for the seller. (Picture: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore)Another transaction that resulted in a notable loss this year occurred at The Coast at Sentosa Cove. A 4,779 sq ft, five-bedroom unit fetched $5.3 million ($1,109 psf) when it was sold on Oct 7, after the property had been bought for $11.47 million ($2,400 psf) in August 2007. The loss for the seller was $6.17 million, or 54%. It translates to an annualised loss of 5.7% over 13 years. This sale is also the most unprofitable transaction at the development this year.The Coast at Sentosa Cove is a 99-year leasehold development on Ocean Drive on Sentosa Island. The 127-unit development was completed in 2010, and comprises a mix of three- to five-bedroom units of 1,916 sq ft to 4,779 sq ft.There have been 10 resale transactions at The Coast this year, all of which have resulted in losses for the sellers, ranging from $41,550 to the $6.17 million loss in October. The second most unprofitable deal there during the year was the sale of a 2,357 sq ft, four-bedroom unit for $3.4 million ($1,442 psf) on Oct 9. That unit had been bought for $4.7 million ($2,000 psf) back in February 2007. Thus, the seller suffered a $1.31 million loss.Check out the latest listings near Ardmore Park, The Claymore, Reignwood Hamilton Scotts, The Coast at Sentosa Cove, Le Nouvel Ardmore, Sculptura Ardmore, Nouvel 18For price trends, recent transactions, other project info, check out these projects' research page: Le Nouvel Ardmore, Sculptura Ardmore, Nouvel 18See Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools New Launch Condo & Landed Property in Singapore (COMPLETE list & updates) Park living in Pasir Panjang Pre-MOP four-bedder at Bellewaters EC on the market for $1.1 mil Penthouse unit at Nassim Jade sold for $6.05 mil profit  En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

The rupee was aided by dollar sales by foreign banks and exporters during the session, a trader at a mid-sized private bank said.   Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

Nvidia's own design has broad appeal but many will instead be choosing partner graphics cards from the big four (Asus, EVGA, Gigabyte, and MSI) for either; higher-end features, a cheaper entry price, or simply due to availability. With that in mind let's take a quick look at what Nvidia's biggest partners have prepared for you.\nAsus\nAsus has prepared GeForce RTX 3060 graphics cards to fit into five main lines for retailers; the ROG Strix, TUF Gaming, Dual, Dual Mini, and KO series. At the top of the pile is the ROG Strix GeForce RTX 3060 Ti OC Gaming with 1890MHz boost clock. This card features the kind of high-end triple axial fan cooler familiar to the higher end graphics cards already released in the RTX 30 series. It uses a larger heatsink than other cards in the range as well as a 2.9 slot footprint, MaxContact technology, Super Allow Power II components, dual BIOS, Auto Extreme manufacturing, a metal backplate, and its reinforced metal frame hosts aRGB LED lighting.\n\nTraversing the range we find the compact (less than 20cm long) Dual Mini design with 1695MHz boost clock \u2013 designed to fit in SFF systems like the Intel NUC 9 Extreme Kit and Intel NUC 9 Pro Kit.\nThe cheapest offering though is going to be the Asus KO GeForce RTX 3060 Ti graphics card with 1695MHz boost clock. This model sports twin axial fans, long-lasting capacitors and a vented backplate, as well as aRGB LEDs within its 2.7-slot footprint. Asus isn't releasing the KO in the UK for now it will debut in the USA, Brazil, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Australia this month.\n\nWe have a smattering of pricing indications from Asus UK as follows:\n\nROG-STRIX-RTX3060TI-O8G-GAMING\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a3514.99 MSRP\nROG-STRIX-RTX3060TI-8G-GAMING\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a3504.99 MSRP\nTUF-RTX3060TI-O8G-GAMING\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a3444.99 MSRP\nTUF-RTX3060TI-8G-GAMING\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a3439.99 MSRP\nDUAL-RTX3060TI-O8G\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a3423.99 MSRP\nDUAL-RTX3060TI-8G\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a3369.99 MSRP\n\nEVGA\nEVGA is kicking off its GeForce RTX 3060 Ti range with two offerings. The new EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti FTW3 with iCX3 cooling, and RTX 3060 Ti XC, are triple and twin fan designs, respectively.\n\nFor key specs, you will find the aRGB FTW3 has a 1800MHz boost clock, while the XC model eschews RGB LEDS but still has a metal backplate and goes to 1210MHz out of the box. EVGA has listed these two GPUs at $439 and $399 respectively but to buy direct you must join its auto-notify queuing system.\nGigabyte\nGigabyte hasn't sent along its press release, or even published one on its news pages, at the time of writing. However if you go to the official site and filter the RTX 30 series products you will see there is an RTX 3060 Ti option. Once selected, you will see five new graphics cards, one a top tier Aorus Master model, the other four using the Gigabyte Gaming and Eagle brands. They are all chunky looking designs but the Eagle series is a little bit smaller using a twin fan shroud.\n\nGigabyte's Aorus GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Master 8G is the fastest choice here with its core clock of 1800MHz but it is the longest at 290mm and uses an 8- and 6-pin power connector. As well as aRGB frills this card features 'LCD Edge View' display for monitoring info or animations and so on. Meanwhile the Gaming cards are up to 1770MHz, and the base Eagle card (non-OC model) runs at reference clocks (1665MHz) out of the box. Eagle cards are just 242mm long and make do with a single 8-pin powr connector.\nMSI\nMSI has launched eight new GeForce RTX 2060 Ti graphics cards. You might alternatively say it has launched four cards in regular and OC versions. Pricing for the range starts at SU$499 and it consists of models in the MSI Gaming Trio, Gaming, Ventus 3X and Ventus 2X ranges.\n\nMSI's top god is the MSI GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Gaming X Trio with a core boost clock of 1830MHz. This card uses a triple fan cooler, as you would expect from the name, and is a substantial 232mm long. The point of this beefy cooler is to \"play hard, stay silent,\" says MSI and its Tri Frozr 2 tech with Torx Fan 4.0, Core Pipes and Fin & Airflow Control tech is very likely to deliver on that. While it is quiet for your ears, this graphics card can be stealthily dark or light up in millions of colours thanks to Mystic Light.\nAt the other end of the range MSI's $399 offering is the compact black Ventus X2 with reference clock speeds out of the box. It is just 232mm long but MSI has big claims for the cooling system which features Torx 3.0 fans, Zero Frozr, Core Pipes tech. The fans in particular are said to provide 50 per cent more air pressure than a 'normal' fan. Interestingly this design is heavier (827g) than the triple fan Ventus 3X/OC models (760g).\nStay tuned to HEXUS for upcoming reviews of GeForce RTX 3060 Ti partner designs.\nGeForce RTX 3060, 3060 Super etc\nWhat is next? Nvidia's press release for the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti states that this is \"the first member of the RTX 3060 family,\" so we can safely expect to see more RTX 3060 graphics cards released in the not-too-distant future.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\nAsus shares its Intel Z690 motherboard guide\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nHEXUS Week In Review: Asus ROG Strix Arion and Seagate Storage Expansion Card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 30 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

Offering 4K and 8K support (RTX 3090) these cards future proof your gaming set up for years to come.\nFrom the image below, provided by Nvidia, you can see that the new RTX 30 Series takes your gaming to a whole new level. Depending on the types of games you play, this card may be exactly what you need, or may be too feature packed. Wherever you land, one thing is for certain: these cards have been selling out and they\u2019re nearly impossible to obtain. The question on everyone\u2019s mind is:\u00a0 are these cards truly as good as they claim to be?\nImage via NVIDIA\nThanks to Adorama and Asus, I was able to get my hands on the ASUS TUF RTX 3080 OC Edition. Throughout this article I will go in depth, from the packaging all the way to the gaming. I hope to answer all the questions you have, and if you have more, Adorama is here for all your gaming needs!\nPC Specs:\nProcessor: Intel Core i7-6700k (Not oc\u2019d)\nGraphics: ASUS TUF RTX 3080\nRam: 32GB\nPSU: 750W\nPhoto by Josh Saleh\nDesign:\nNow, most of us gamers could care less about packaging, and trust me I get it. Right when we buy a brand-new component, we want to rip it open, and install it immediately. However, when I am treating myself to a new graphics card, I want the packaging and design to be just as nice as the product itself. When opening the box, the card lays beautifully staring you right in the face. I felt as if I was Indiana Jones opening a chest full of treasure. The card is ginormous! Now, I was fore-warned about the size of these cards, but seeing it in person and holding the card I was astonished! The card measures 11.81\u201d x 5.0\u201d, making this card nearly a foot long. Make sure your desktop can fit this beast of a card.\nPhoto by Josh Saleh\nThe three-fan design is perfect for those looking to overclock this card. I always prefer more fans; the last thing I want is my rig to get too hot. If you are an avid gamer or a content creator, you know how fast your computer can get hot. Asus provides three fans, one more than the Nvidia RTX 3080 Founders Edition, and when deciding on which card to get, that can be a deciding factor.\nAnother key aspect that sets this card apart from the competition are the ports. I have two 1080p monitors and a Dell S2417DG 24\u201d 2K monitor. With my three-monitor set up, I need more ports. ASUS gives you three DisplayPort\u2019s and two HDMI ports. This is one extra HDMI port than the other RTX 3080 cards out there.\nImage via NVIDIA\nThis size of this card means it takes 2.7 slots in your rig. The main reason for the extra height and width is the bigger heatsink that\u2019s keeping temperatures cool.\u00a0 I absolutely love the design of this card. It is apparent that ASUS has the gamer and streamer in mind for this card. With the extra HDMI port, and extra fan, this card stands above the rest.\nPhoto by Josh Saleh\nSoftware:\nAsus has its own GPU tuning app called \u201cGPU Tweak II\u201d. This app allows you to alter fan speed, tweak GPU core Clocks, memory frequency, and voltage settings. After I installed my card, the fans were incredibly loud on idle, and even louder when gaming. Through the ASUS support page, I was able to download a Bios update that fixed everything. After downloading the Bios, my fans were ridiculously quiet, to the point where I didn\u2019t even think they were running. After downloading the Bios, I started playing with the GPU Tweak app and It was incredibly simple.\n\nThe app allows you to cycle three different modes.\n\nOC mode: When you want to overclock your GPU, focusing on performance.\nGaming mode: Splits focus on performance, coolness, and silence evenly.\nSilent mode: Focuses on silencing your fans.\n\nI primarily used gaming mode, and even then, the fans were quiet. What I loved about this app is how seamless it was. For example: with just the click of a mouse you have a new mode ready to go. You can create your own profiles to customize how fast you want your fans, and how much you want to clock your GPU.\u00a0 I always have this app open on one of my monitors, to see my clock speeds, temperatures, and usage.\nGaming:\nThe true test was about to begin! What would be the first game I would load up? I started a game I\u2019ve been playing a lot of: Apex Legends. Now, when I first loaded Apex Legends, it was stuttering, there was screen tearing, and lag. After doing a lot of research into the game, and my setup I found out that on a 2K monitor, my CPU, i7-6700k might not be strong enough for the 3080. My graphic card was bottlenecking my processor. The card was too powerful with my five-year-old components. What didn\u2019t make sense to me is that my four-core processor should be powerful enough since most games don\u2019t take advantage of multiple cores.\nI decided to do even more testing. I scavenged Google, Reddit and other forums looking for an answer. The majority said it depends on the game, each game could be more CPU-intensive than GPU. My next test was to download Call of Duty: Warzone, an extremely graphic-intensive game. After waiting about three hours for the massive game to download, I started it up. Once again, my CPU was at 100% load, and my GPU was barely using 10%. All my drivers were updated, all my games were updated, my power supply is a 750w, which was the recommended. This didn\u2019t make any sense; my CPU must be bottlenecking.\nSuccess:\nI was just about to give up and look for a new CPU and Motherboard, but then Cyberpunk 2077 released its recommended specs.\nThe specs showed that with Ray Tracing (RT) on Ultra settings, they recommend an Intel i7-6700k paired with an RTX 3080. Wait, that\u2019s what I have! How would I be able to run Cyberpunk 2077, one of the most graphically intensive games of 2020, but I couldn\u2019t run Apex Legends or Call of Duty: Warzone? Just to be safe, I decided to do some research on new processors.\nIf I were to upgrade my processor, I would want more cores, more threads and faster GHz\u2019s. My research led me the processors below. If you can get your hands on the new AMD Processors: 5800x, 5900x, and the 5950x, then I would strongly recommend those. However, they are tough to find, but the processors below are available and will pair with your RTX beautifully!\nProcessors I would recommend to pair with an RTX:\nIntel i7-10700k\n\nIntel i9 \u2013 10900k\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 3900X\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 3800X\n\nWhen looking at these processors you want to think of the value you are getting for performance. Depending on which way you lean: Intel or AMD, you want to get a CPU that can work with your GPU, applications you use, and games you play. These processors will future-proof your set for when you are ready for 2K, 4K or even 8K gaming.\nI also decided to refresh my system first. After a few days, I was back up and running with brand new drivers, and a refreshed Windows. I followed online videos on the best settings for my Nvidia Control Panel, and settings for Apex Legends. With MSI Afterburner on in the background, I had to make sure my CPU and GPU weren\u2019t overheating, and usage was where it should be. I loaded into the game and it was GORGEOUS! It was working! No frame skips, no stuttering, no lag! I was so happy the refresh worked. I loaded up Call of Duty: Warzone (after another download), and just like Apex, it was running flawlessly. I\u2019m so ready for Cyberpunk 2077.\nThis card has handled every game I throw at it. I\u2019m honestly shocked at how smooth each game runs. I\u2019ve never had a card this powerful before and I\u2019m soaking up every second. The true test will be when Cyberpunk 2077 releases on December 10th, but until then I will be enjoying the games I have. Stayed tuned for the release of Cyberpunk 2077, and I\u2019ll follow up with how the game runs with the RTX 3080.\n\nAsus TUF Gaming NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Graphics Card\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nDepending on the games you play, an RTX 3080 might be more than what you need. But, if you\u2019re like me and are eagerly awaiting Cyberpunk 2077, you want to have the best equipment available. NVIDIA has taken its graphics card to an affordable jaw dropping price with incredible power. Whether you are a streamer, gamer, or both, the ASUS TUF RTX 3080 is a beast of a card. With the additional HDMI port, extra fan, and ASUS GPU tweak app, this card has the gamer in mind.

For the gaming community, adding features such as more memory, more compute elements, and better ray tracing are a big deal. Since this is STH, we wanted to take a different view of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, specifically related to compute. With 24GB of memory, the same as the\u00a0NVIDIA Titan RTX and the promise of more compute resources, we thought this would be a winning combination. It turns out, we were correct.\nVideo Companion\nFor this review, we also have an accompanying video companion discussing the impact of the performance we are seeing in this review:\n\nThe video looks more at the industry impact of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 on the GPU compute markets. Our suggestion, given the size of this review, and the video\u2019s subject is a bit different, is to open the video in a separate tab. Note the video came out several hours after the main site article so we added this into the original article.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Overview\nThe card itself is a PCIe form factor in a very loose sense. There is a PCIe Gen4 x16 connector on the bottom of the card, but it now occupies the width of around three PCIe slots. The card does not stop at the top of the rear I/O faceplate nor anywhere near the end of the x16 connector. Instead, it is 313mm x 138mm or 12.3\u2033 x 5.4\u2033 despite needing three PCIe slots of width.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Heatsink Side Light 3\nOne can see the purpose of this size from the pictures. The card itself is a dual fan unit. Air is no longer directed through the card to the rear of the chassis as we see in blower-style coolers. It is not even directed to the same side of the card as we saw with the Titan RTX. Instead, this is a relatively small PCB surrounded by an enormous, albeit attractive, cooling apparatus.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 And Titan RTX 3\nAbove, we can see just how much bigger this card is next to what is probably the most competitive card of the previous generation, the Titan RTX. For some comparison here, the Titan RTX is a $2,500 card while the newer larger RTX 3090 is $1,500.\nWe are going to let Jensen Huang, NVIDIA\u2019s CEO, show off the other side. Its otherwise attractive design is one that almost perfectly exemplifies why the PCIe form factor for a large card like this is showing its age. The \u201cRTX 3090\u201d is printed on the card assuming you are looking at the card from the top side of the rear angle. If you, for example, have the card situated with the PCIe slot facing down, as is common in deployments and even when we normally take product photos, then the RTX 3090 is upside down. The Titan RTX had a nice solution for this branding need versus a brain\u2019s search for logical order by simply rotating the name 90 degrees.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\nOn the top edge of the card, we have the new 12-pin power connector. Perhaps it is time for a new connector standard, but most will simply be using an adapter Y-cable with this card.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 12 Pin Power Connector\nThe rear of the unit has four display outputs. There is a single HDMI 2.1 port along with three DisplayPort 1.4a options. The card itself can drive four displays.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 IO\nIt is hard not to appreciate the heatsink design. These bare heatsink fins form attractive patterns, but we will note that we can imagine some will be damaged due to mishandling. Backlighting the card we can see how the PCB is located closer to the rear I/O without opening the card up. The blue light is permeating the right side where the second fan is because there is not a PCB blocking it. If it is not clear from the pictures thus far, that should give a scale of just how much of this design is dedicated to cooling, rather than the GPU, memory, I/O, and power delivery.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Heatsink Side 4\nWe are going to quickly note here that the is a 350W GPU (we will see this later) and also that the card itself is both massive and heavy. For STH readers that build systems for customers, this is one we would be wary of shipping with only a few screws on the rear I/O plate. There is a risk of this being a long and heavy lever inside a system for shipping purposes.\nNext, let us take a look at the RTX 3090 FE key specifications and continue with our performance testing.\n\n\n\n \n\n 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 REVIEW OVERVIEWDesign & Aesthetics9.3Performance9.8Feature Set9.4Value9.5SUMMARYIn our NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 review, we see how this new Ampere-based offering brings massive GPU compute gains transforming price performance and performance per watt expectations for those who are doing more than just gaming9.5OVERALL SCORE\n\n TAGSAmperegeforceNVIDIARTX \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleKioxia CD6-L PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSD Review Ending Data Center SATANext articleNew Intel 670P and Optane H20 SSDs with Legacy PCIe Gen3 William Harmonhttp://www.servethehome.com nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-review-a-compute-powerhouseIn our NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 review, we see how this new Ampere-based offering brings massive GPU compute gains transforming price performance and performance per watt expectations for those who are doing more than just gaming \n \nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAcemagic F3A an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 Mini PC with up to 128GB of RAM \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASUS ESC8000A-E13P Review an 8x PCIe GPU Server \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASRock Rack 4U8G-TURIN2 A Fresh Take on a Classic AI Server Design \n\n  \n\n\n\n7 COMMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPavel\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            December 15, 2020\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            1:42 pm                                            \n\n\n\nAre you using the Tensorflow 20.11 container for all the machine learning benchmarks?

NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is here, and it helps round out the RTX 30 Series lineup with a card at the ~$400 level (in a world where GPUs are available at any \u2013 let alone list \u2013 price). And the performance? As you\u2019ll see it\u2019s very good for $399, marking a substantial upgrade over the RTX 2060 Super at the same theoretical price level.\nAnd please understand, as this is a launch review we haven\u2019t seen availability yet. This particular model \u2013 the Founders Edition \u2013 will be sold exclusively through NVIDIA.com and Microcenter \u2013 at the $399 list price. These cards may last seconds, minutes, or possibly even hours. Who knows! We can only judge the card based on a theoretical price level, something recent AMD and NVIDIA cards can not currently be found anywhere near, to the consternation of many.\nPlease direct your attention to the center of this table: \n \n\n\n\n\nRTX 3080\nRTX 3070\nRTX 3060 Ti\nRTX 2080 SUPER\nRTX 2080\n\n\nGPU\nGA102\nGA104\nGA104\nTU104\nTU104\n\n\nArchitecture\nAmpere\nAmpere\nAmpere\nTuring\nTuring\n\n\nSMs\n68\n46\n38\n48\n46\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n8704\n5888\n4864\n3072\n2944\n\n\nTensor Cores\n272 (2nd Gen)\n184 (2nd Gen)\n152 (2nd Gen)\n384 (1st Gen)\n368 (1st Gen)\n\n\nRT Cores\n68 (2nd Gen)\n46 (2nd Gen)\n38 (2nd Gen)\n48 (1st Gen)\n46 (1st Gen)\n\n\nBase Clock\n1440 MHz\n1500 MHz\n1410 MHz\n1650 MHz\n1515 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1710 MHz\n1725 MHz\n1665 MHz\n1815 MHz\n1710 MHz\n\n\nTexture Units\n272\n184\n152\n192\n184\n\n\nROPs\n96\n96\n80\n64\n64\n\n\nMemory\n10GB GDDR6X\n8GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Data Rate\n19 Gbps\n14 Gbps\n14 Gbps\n15.5 Gbps\n14 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Interface\n320-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n760 GB/s\n448 GB/s\n448 GB/s\n496.1 GB/s\n448 GB/s\n\n\nTransistor Count\n28.0B\n17.4B\n17.4B\n13.6B\n13.6B\n\n\nDie Size\n628 mm^2\n392 mm^2\n392 mm^2\n545 mm^2\n545 mm^2\n\n\nProcess Tech\n8nm Samsung\n8nm Samsung\n8nm Samsung\n12nm TSMC\n12nm TSMC\n\n\nTGP\n320W\n220W\n200W\n250W\n215W\n\n\nLaunch Price\n$699\n$499\n$399\n$699\n$699\n\n\n\n \nEssentially we are looking at a slightly \u201ccut-down\u201d RTX 3070 here, based on the same GA104 GPU. The memory capacity (8GB) and interface (256-bit GDDR6) is the same as the RTX 3070, with clock speeds down slightly and the TGP down by 20W (200W) compared to the 3070.\nBy the way, the presence of the RTX 2080 Super on the table above is especially important here as NVIDIA targets that card\u2019s performance for this new GPU, indicating that the RTX 3060 Ti is actually faster than a 2080 Super, and not just an RTX 2080.\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\nThe RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition\nNVIDIA\u2019s design for the RTX 3060 Ti Founders edition card is exactly the same as the RTX 3070 Founders Edition, other than the color and the fact that the logo doesn\u2019t light up. You might notice the lighter aluminum frame, compared to the previous darker hue (silver vs. space grey, basically). That\u2019s it. Everything else is the same right down to that ever-popular 12-pin power connection.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI heartily recommend a glance over our earlier RTX 3070 Founders Edition review for some better photos of what amounts to the same design \u2013 with a slightly darker grey finish.\n \n \n \n\n\nPerformance\nAs mentioned in the intro performance with the RTX 3060 Ti is a substantial upgrade over the RTX 2060 Super. In fact it\u2019s faster than an RTX 2080 (and a 2080 Super, according to NVIDIA), making this a no-brainer at $400 in a world where buying new GPUs at theoretical list prices is a possibility. But enough about what will doubtless be another frustrating 2020 tech product launch, and on to the charts!\nNote: I focused on performance relative to a 2060 Super when benchmarking, and did not re-test the 2080 Super on the current GPU platform. I have recommended that I be fired immediately for this display of ineptitude.\n \n\n\n\nPC Perspective GPU Test Platform\n\n\nProcessor\nAMD Ryzen 9 3900X\n\n\nMotherboard\nASUS ROG Crosshair VIII HERO WIFI\n\n\nMemory\nHyperX Predator DDR4-3600 CL16 32GB (16GBx2)\n\n\nStorage\nSamsung 850 EVO 1TB SSD\n\n\nPower Supply\nCORSAIR RM1000x 1000W\n\n\nOperating System\nWindows 10 64-bit (1909)\n\n\nDrivers\nGeForce GRD 452.06, 456.16, 456.96 (Legacy Tests)GeForce GRD 457.40 (Press Driver, RTX 3060 Ti)Radeon Software Adrenalin 2020 Edition 20.8.3\n\n\n\n \nMetro Exodus\nWe will look at both 2560\u00d71440 and 3840\u00d72160 results here, both run at the \u201chigh\u201d preset using DX12.\n \n\n\nAt 2560\u00d71440 we have an impressive first showing for the new card; significantly faster than the RTX 2060 Super it effectively replaces at $399, and noticeably faster than the RTX 2080. Add about 5% to those 2080 FPS numbers to estimate a 2080 Super and, yeah, that\u2019s basically the 3060 Ti here.\nMore excellent performance at 4K follows:\n \n\n\n\nThe Division 2\nMoving quickly along, we look at another DX12 title, with The Division 2 run using that API at the \u201chigh\u201d quality preset. 2560\u00d71440 first:\n \n\n\nAt 2560\u00d71440 we have another result well above the RTX 2080, and 10 FPS behind the RTX 3070. Considering the $100 difference in price the RTX 3060 Ti is looking like the better buy \u2013 at least so far. (Yes, I get it. You actually have to be able to BUY it to have a better buy. Moving on!)\n \n\n\nAt 4K the performance scales nicely, and we have essentially the same result here relative to the 2080 and 3070.\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\nAnother DX12 test, this was also run at both 1440 and 4K, and also at the \u201chigh\u201d preset.\n \n\n\n\n\nNo surprises here, with similar gains over the RTX 2080 to those seen from The Division 2.\nDiRT 5\nA decidedly AMD-optimized title, DiRT 5 provides a \u201cworst-case\u201d scenario for NVIDIA cards. This marks the only occasion in which the RTX 3060 Ti did not beat the RTX 2080, instead effectively matching it at 1440:\n \n\n\n\n\nThe RTX 3060 Ti was slightly ahead of the RTX 2080 at 4K, but both results were too close to call between these two cards in DiRT 5.\n\nFar Cry 5\nFinally we move to our lone DX11 test with Far Cry 5, run at the highest settings at 4K.\n \n\n\nAnother test, another result placing the RTX 3060 Ti between the RTX 2080 and RTX 3070. The gains over the RTX 2060 Super are massive, and overall this is a great performer for its price segment.\n \nPower Consumption\nThe RTX 3060 Ti has a TGP of 200W, which is 20W lower than the 3070. Here\u2019s a quick look at observed power draw from our particular test platform:\n \n\n\nNo surprises here as the RTX 3060 Ti is indeed drawing less power (17W) than the RTX 3070. And while this generation has famously drawn a lot of power at the high end, it\u2019s impressive to see the power draw of this new card relative to the RTX 2080. The 3060 Ti is a more economical choice than a 3070 in both price and power consumption, in theory anyhow.\n \n \n \n\n\nConclusion\nAs promised, this review was pretty short. NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti launches tomorrow (December 2) for $399, and considering the performance (better than an RTX 2080) we saw here \u2013 which marks quite a substantial upgrade over the RTX 2060 Super it replaces at this price point \u2013 the RTX 3060 Ti is a fantastic choice in the fantasy world in which it would be widely available at launch.\n \n\n\nOnce again, this is a launch review. We haven\u2019t seen availability yet. The Founders Edition we looked at will be sold exclusively through NVIDIA.com and Microcenter here in the USA, which means sales at the $399 list price \u2013 when the card is in stock.\nSo, assuming you can find one, I think it\u2019s easy to recommend this new GPU \u2013 particularly as AMD does not currently offer a 6000 Series product to compete at this price level.\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nFor excellence in industrial design, the Sapphire NITRO+ wins the gold medal\n \n \n \n \n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nReview Disclosures\n\n\n\n\nThis disclosure statement covers the way the product being reviewed was obtained and the relationship between the product's manufacturer and PC Perspective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Product Was Obtained\nThe GPU is on loan from NVIDIA for the purpose of this review.\n\n\nWhat Happens To Product After Review\nThe GPU remains the property of NVIDIA but will be on extended loan to PC Perspective for the purpose of future testing and product comparisons.\n\n\nCompany Involvement\nNVIDIA provided the product sample and technical brief to PC Perspective but had no control over the content of the review and was not consulted prior to publication.\n\n\nPC Perspective Compensation\nNeither PC Perspective nor any of its staff were paid or compensated in any way by NVIDIA for this review.\n\n\nAdvertising Disclosure\nNVIDIA has not purchased advertising at PC Perspective during the past twelve months.\n\n\nAffiliate Links\nIf this article contains affiliate links to online retailers, PC Perspective may receive compensation for purchases made through those links.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVideo News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviousHelp Parting With Your Money On Cyber Monday \n\nNextCoaxing Better Speed From QLC With A Little Tender Loving Care \n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\n\n\n \n\nSebastian Peak\nEditor-in-Chief at PC Perspective.

But as usual, NVIDIA isn't stopping there. Earlier this month, it unveiled the $399 RTX 3060 Ti, the cheapest entry in its new lineup. Given just how successful NVIDIA's new Ampere architecture has been, I expected the 3060 Ti to be a solid improvement over its predecessor, the RTX 2060 Super. After a few weeks of testing, I'm somehow even more impressed.Despite costing just $399, the RTX 3060 Ti is even faster than the RTX 2080 Super, which launched at $700 last year. For most gamers, it'll be more than enough to play modern titles in 1080p and 1440p, and it should keep them satisfied for years to come. At least, until they start demanding higher resolutions and more frames for high-refresh-rate monitors.1 / 7NVIDIA RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA RTX 3060 TiYou can think of the RTX 3060 Ti as a stripped-down 3070: They both run NVIDIA's GA104 GPU and have 8GB of GDDR6 RAM, but the cheaper card has less power overall. It features 4,864 CUDA cores and a boost clock speed of 1.67GHz, whereas the 3070 offers 5,888 CUDA cores and tops out at 1.73GHz. Still, the 3060's CUDA figure more than doubles the RTX 2060's 2,176 cores, and its new architecture also includes updated RT cores for ray tracing and tensor cores for AI processing. As with NVIDIA's other GPUs this year, the 3060 Ti features fewer tensor cores than the card it replaces, but it makes up for that by handling AI tasks more efficiently.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementThe company is also counting teraflops very differently with its 3000-series GPUs, which makes it tough to directly compare their figures to its older cards. NVIDIA rates the 3060 Ti at 16.2 TFLOPs of shader performance, whereas the 2060 Super offered 7.2 TFLOPs. There's no doubt that the new GPU is faster, but don't expect it to literally be over twice as fast, since there's a lot more behind that performance than raw TFLOPS numbers.Despite all the differences under the hood, you'd be hard-pressed to tell the RTX 3060 Ti and 3070 Founder's Edition cards apart. They both feature NVIDIA's revamped PCB arrangement, which places the bulk of the card towards the front ports. Two large fans keep things cool, with the rear fan blowing air right through the card toward the top of your case. It's a unique approach -- one that's worked out well so far for NVIDIA. The 3060 Ti typically idled around 41 celsius and reached 74C under heavy loads, with a maximum fan noise that's far quieter than the RTX 2060 Super. As for ports, the 3060 Ti features three DisplayPort 1.4a connections and a single HDMI 2.1 socket, which supports 4K beyond 60Hz and 8K displays.1,440p benchmarksShadow of the Tomb Raider BenchmarkHitman 2 BenchmarkLuxmark Luxball HDRRTX 3060 Ti88fps110fps45,900RTX 3070107fps130fps49,006RTX 3080110fps130fps68,701RTX 2060 Super52fps83fpsN/AAll games tested in 1440p with the highest graphics quality settings and ray tracing (where available), on a rig powered by an Intel Core i7-8700K and 32GB of RAM.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementAfter spending much of this fall testing out powerful new GPUs (be sure to check out our reviews of AMD's Radeon 6800 and 6800 XT), I knew what to expect with the 3060 Ti. It's just going to be a cheaper take on the 3070, right? But what truly surprised me was how much performance NVIDIA could deliver for $399. As I mentioned before, the 3060 Ti easily bested the RTX 2080 Super in all of our benchmarks, which proves just how much of an upgrade it is over the 2060 Super. But I was also pleased to see that it wasn't much slower than the 3070 either. Devindra Hardawar/EngadgetIn 3DMark Time Spy Extreme, the 3060 Ti came in just 600 points lower than the 3070, whereas the gap between the 3070 and 3080 was about 1,300 points. When it came to 1440p gaming, the cheaper cards were more closely matched. The Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark reached 88fps on the 3060 Ti with maxed graphics settings and ultra RTX shadows. On the 3070, meanwhile, I saw 107fps. That's a big difference in raw frames, but it's not something you'd readily notice while you're playing the game, even with a 120Hz or 144Hz monitor. Similarly, the 3060 Ti hit 85 to 110fps in Destiny 2 with the highest graphics settings in 1440p, whereas the 3070 typically clocked 100 to 120 fps.I was able to get Cyberpunk 2077 running on the 3060 Ti around 65fps in 1440p with mid-range ray tracing settings and DLSS enabled. Turning off DLSS, which renders games at low resolutions and uses AI supersampling to approximate the look of high resolutions, brought the game to a sluggish 40fps. Pushing the 3060 Ti a bit harder, I hit 55fps on my ultrawide monitor's native 3,440 by 1,440 resolution with DLSS. To achieve that, though, I had to switch DLSS to its highest performance setting, which at times made the game look like it was being rendered below 1080p. As you can imagine, that wasn't playable for too long, even if things were running smoothly otherwise.4K benchmarks3DMark Time Spy ExtremeShadow of the Tomb Raider BenchmarkHitman 2 BenchmarkDestiny 2RTX 3060 Ti5,40835fps60fps50-65fpsRTX 30706,06151fps70fps85-95fpsRTX 30807,37182fps98fps130-140fpsRTX 2060 Super4,01430fps45fpsN/AAll games tested in 4K with the highest graphics quality settings and ray tracing (where available), on a rig powered by an Intel Core i7-8700K and 32GB of RAM.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementThe 3060 Ti's limits are more apparent when you start stressing it with 4K gaming. Destiny 2 hovered between 45 and 60fps with the highest graphics settings, while the 3070 was more stable between 70 and 80fps. Throw in ray tracing at 4K, and the 3060 Ti starts to fall apart even more. Shadow of the Tomb Raider crawled at 32fps with ultra ray tracing shadows. I suppose that's not too bad, though, as the 3070 could only muster 37fps with those same settings. (For what it's worth, the 3080 also struggled a bit to reach between 55 and 65fps.)Clearly, the 3060 Ti isn't the card you'd want to pump out native 4K games to your TV. But at $399, that seems like a decent tradeoff for anyone who's primarily playing on a 1080p or 1440p monitor. And of course, it's also only $399 in an ideal world. Right now, the 3060 Ti is out of stock at every major retailer. And even when they're available, many cards from NVIDIA's partners will go for $450 and more. It's always been tough to get your hands on the latest GPUs, but that problem seems even worse this year, as the COVID-19 pandemic has slowed production considerably.If the idea of 4K gaming intrigues you, it may make more sense to save up for an RTX 3070 (again, whenever those are back in stock). And if you're married to the idea of true 4K gaming with maxed out ray tracing settings,\u00a0the RTX 3080 is well worth its $699 starting price.If anything, the RTX 3060 Ti proves that NVIDIA\u2019s new Ampere architecture can scale down very well. The fact that it\u2019s faster than the company\u2019s last $700 card makes it clear just how much of a deal it is. And while I won\u2019t say it\u2019s enough of a leap to upgrade from an RTX 2060 Super, it\u2019s something everyone who\u2019s held onto their aging GTX 1060s should consider.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

Whether you\u2019re looking to dominate the leaderboards and earn a spot on an eSports league team, or you only video game to escape into a more colorful, freedom-filled world, you depend on your PC to be the powerful vehicle that transports you with a single power-on. Diving into a rich game scape that is as mechanically responsive as it is visually immersive means fine-tuning your specs for functional perfection.\r\n\n\r\n  Modern video-gaming has become wildly impressive, blurring the line between realities with increased attention to detail and optimized 3D rendering. To properly accommodate the visual properties that make bestsellers like Red Dead Redemption and Assassin\u2019s Creed stand out, having VSync is a must.\r\n\n\r\n  VSync is one of the latest and greatest visual-enhancement technologies that work to bring your favorite video game scapes to vibrant life. But what exactly is VSync? What difference does this technology make, and should you turn it off or on? Use this comprehensive guide to answer all of your burning VSync questions.\r\n\nWhat is VSync?\n\n\r\n  Short for vertical sync, VSync is the graphics technology responsible for synchronizing the frame rate of a game to the refresh rate of a monitor. This synchronization delivers smooth, uninterrupted gameplay for graphics-heavy 3D games.\r\n\n\r\n  First engineered by GPU developers looking to mitigate the issue of screen-tearing, VSync\u2019s earliest aim was to eliminate the problem altogether. Screen-tearing is a frame-rendering glitch that occurs when two different \u201cscreens\u201d of an image clash and shatter. Typically, this will look like two frames shown together in a single frame, causing a jarring torn effect.\r\n\n\r\n  Screen-tearing ruins gameplay in an instant and compromises any strategy you may have had by no fault of your own. When refresh rates are out of sync, the images you see are marred fragments of a full picture. This happens most frequently with games that utilize refresh rates of 60 frames per second (fps) or more. When VSync is turned on, a strict fps cap is set to ensure there is no rate synchronization breakage.\r\n\nWhat is Adaptive Sync?\n\r\n  NVIDIA\u2019s Adaptive Sync is a smart alternative to VSync that allows you to render frames using the NVIDIA Control Panel software. Adaptive Sync is only available to those with GPUs running a GT 600-series NVIDIA graphics card or newer.\r\n\n\r\n  Adaptive Sync technology is designed to function similarly to VSync by limiting fps output to match your monitor\u2019s refresh capacity, but it works harder to eliminate performance lag caused by dipping refresh rates. At top-end frame rates, VSync eliminates screen-tearing, at low-end frame rates, it\u2019s disabled to minimize stuttering, but effectively increases input lag. Adaptive Sync does a better job of streamlining visual performance without any stuttering or tearing.\r\n\nWhat is Fast Sync?\n\r\n  Fast Sync is one of NVIDIA\u2019s newer technologies that only works with a GTX 900 series graphics card, or a 10-series GPU or newer. Fast Sync does an excellent job of eliminating all screen-tearing and input lag while keeping latency to an absolute minimum. This heightened technology tends to perform more impressively and consistently than VSync.\r\n\n\r\n  One of the primary reasons why gamers prefer to keep VSync disabled is because latency levels have the potential of skyrocketing above 100 ms. With Fast Sync enabled, latency is significantly reduced, even comparable to gameplay when VSync is completely turned off.\r\n\nWhat is Enhanced Sync?\n\n\r\n  Enhanced Sync is quite literally an enhanced VSync solution engineered by AMD. Rather than replacing VSync technology, Enhanced Sync works in unison with it. They work together to reduce the stutter and input lag experienced when fps drops below the monitor refresh rate.\r\n\n\r\n  Enhanced Sync doesn\u2019t completely fix the issues associated with VSync, but it does make great improvements to performance capability and consistency. In the event that performance drops, Enhanced Sync is turned off, effectively stopping your frame rate from serious fps dipping.\r\n\n\r\n  Note: It is important to note that Enhanced Sync is only usable with AMD Radeon graphics cards.\r\n\nWhat is Smooth VSync?\n\r\n  Smooth VSync was engineered to reduce stutter when VSync is enabled and Scalable Link Interface (SLI) is active. SLI is a parallel processing algorithm for GPUs designed to increase processing power. When active, SLI makes it possible for up to four NVIDIA GPUs to join forces to render your game of choice at extremely high frame-rates.\r\n\n\r\n  Smooth VSync reduces stuttering by locking into the most sustainable frame rate of your game and only increasing the fps if the game performance transitions sustainably above the monitor\u2019s rate. While Smooth VSync does effectively lower the average frame rate of your game, it improves and streamlines the overall visual experience.\r\n\nDoes turning VSync on make a significant graphic difference?\n\r\n  To fully grasp VSync\u2019s purpose and functionality, you must first understand what\u2019s happening when your computer screen refreshes.\r\n\n\n\r\n  Monitors typically have refresh rates ranging between 60 Hz and 144 Hz. A single hertz is indicative of one cycle per second, so 60 Hz means 60 cycles per second. During each cycle, the image you see on the screen is drawn from left to right and top to bottom. This, of course, happens faster than your eyes can actually visualize, however inside your PC, each drawing function swaps from the back buffer to the front buffer.\r\n\n\r\n  GPUs typically come equipped with 1 to 3 onboard buffers. PCs usually have 2 buffers while Macs tend to have 3 buffers. Assuming you have a double buffer PC, the front buffer is the screen you see, and the back buffer is the information pushed out to the GPU. In the gamer\u2019s case, the game you\u2019ve loaded sends information to the GPU which then writes the information and sends back an image to the front buffer.\r\n\n\r\n  So let\u2019s say you\u2019re trying to run Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey on a monitor that has a lower refresh rate than the game\u2019s required 60 fps. Because the monitor cannot appropriately accommodate the game\u2019s high refresh rate, you\u2019ll run into screen-tearing. With VSync enabled, refresh rates are limited and synchronized to minimize screen tearing and deliver more fluid gameplay. This is where VSync makes the most significant difference.\r\n\n\r\n  VSync does not affect or improve your PC\u2019s resolution, nor the colors or brightness levels. It is simply a preventative technology engineered to mend the problems caused by divergent refresh rate specifications.\r\n\nShould I have VSync on or off?\n\r\n  We\u2019ve come to the million-dollar question: should you turn VSync on or off? The answer to this question comes down to preference and specific case by case situations.\r\n\nWhen to turn VSync on\n\r\n  If your GPU is rendering more frames than your monitor is capable of displaying, it\u2019s smart to have VSync enabled. However, if your game\u2019s frame rate is lower than your monitor\u2019s maximum refresh rate, there is no particular need to have VSync on.\r\n\nWhen to turn VSync off\n\r\n  Should your game arrive at a graphically intense climax and the frame rate drops below your monitor\u2019s refresh rate VSync will automatically attempt to match that sudden change, leaving you with unsightly visual and performance lag. In this case, having it turned off is to your gaming benefit.\r\n\nHow to turn VSync on or off?\n\r\n  Enabling or disabling VSync is a simple process. Follow these easy instructions steps to master your control buttons.\r\n\n\nStep 1: Access the NVIDIA control panel by entering NVIDIA control panel into your Windows search bar\r\n\n\nStep 2: Select Manage 3D Settings\n\n\nStep 3: Under the Global Setting tab you should find a list of features. Scroll down and find Vertical Sync\r\n\n\nStep 4: Using the dropdown menu to the right, select Force on\n\n\r\n  Settings will differ depending on your specific graphics processor, however this four-step procedure is a universal method of accessing your VSync settings.\r\n\nVSync vs. AMD FreeSync: What\u2019s the difference?\n\n\r\n  AMD FreeSync takes a different approach to eliminating gameplay inconsistencies. VSync aims to adjust frame rates whereas FreeSync delivers dynamic refresh rates that synchronize the fps rate of a monitor to a Radeon graphics card. This effectively reduces input latency and eradicates stuttering.\r\n\nVSync vs. G-Sync: What\u2019s the difference?\n\r\n  G-Sync, developed by NVIDIA, operates on a principle similar to AMD\u2019s FreeSync technology. G-Sync aims to adapt the monitor\u2019s refresh rate to the frame rate your PC can handle. However, unlike FreeSync, G-Sync relies on built-in NVIDIA hardware for full functionality.\r\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of VSync?\n\r\n  Like any specs in the gaming world, there are a number of pros and cons to any technology. Though VSync tends to err on the side of being more helpful than harmful, there are downsides and downfalls as well.\r\n\nPros of VSync\n\r\n  VSync is an excellent option for gamers who are dealing with mismatched frame rates and refresh rates. VSync forces your graphics processor unit and monitor to work in unison with fine-tuned cohesion. This synchronism effectively eliminates screen-tearing and promotes smoother, more fluid gameplay.\r\n\n\r\n  In addition to being a great assistive tool for newer games, VSync is excellent for gamers who prefer running older games on their PC via emulators. Where new games demand high-quality graphics output and top-speed performance, older games require the opposite. VSync slows down your frame rate to match the aged specs of your vintage of preference.\r\n\n\r\n  High frame rates force your GPU into overdrive, and because GPUs operate as quickly as they can to feedback display images, heat generation quickly comes into play.\r\n\n\r\n  Enabling VSync caps the fps at the monitor\u2019s maximum refresh rate and reduces the excessive strain on your GPU.\r\n\n\nRecap: Pros of VSync\r\n\n\nFocus better on gameplay with reduced screen-tearing\nVSync is built into your GPU, so it comes at no additional cost\nCompatible with both NVIDIA and AMD graphics cards\nEmulator friendly\nReduces strain on GPU\n\nCons of VSync\n\r\n  VSync works by waiting for the monitor to push the next screen, which is great on the visual end, but laggy on the operational front. One of the most common problems gamers have with VSync is its lack of input responsiveness. Key presses and mouse clicks are delayed, which can be game changers in titles that require speedy reflexes and reaction timing. This is where AMD\u2019s FreeSync and NVIDIA\u2019s G-Sync take up the slack.\r\n\n\r\n  In the event that your game comes to a graphically intense moment and the frame rate drops below your monitor\u2019s refresh rate VSync will attempt to match that sudden change. Instead of being a seamless transition, VSync delivers an even bigger drop in frame rate, leaving you with increased visual and performance lag.\r\n\n\nRecap: Cons of VSync\r\n\n\nIncreased input lag (key-presses and mouse clicks)\nFrame rate drops can spoil gameplay\n\nWhat other specs should I look for in a gaming PC?\n\n\r\n  When it comes to setting up your ideal rig, there\u2019s plenty more to consider than VSync compatibility. While it is an incredibly important piece to the puzzle, your rig is an assemblage of working parts. If you\u2019re looking to enter an immersive world of lifelike graphics and peak performance, you\u2019ll need some impressive hardware. Be on the lookout for these specs and components as you piece together and perfect your PC.\r\n\n\n1. High-end processors\n\n\r\n  Video-gaming requires plenty of processing power, so it\u2019s smart to gear up with a high-end CPU that can process data at blazing speeds. Do your research before settling on a processor, and make sure it can handle the demands of your favorite games.\r\n\n\n2. Dedicated graphics cards\n\n\r\n  The vast majority of gaming computers come equipped with a standalone, dedicated graphics card. Dedicated GPUs boast stronger performance power due to having their own dedicated memory.\r\n\n\n3. Cooling systems\n\n\r\n  From the moment you power-on your PC, it generates heat. Electricity flows throughout the internal workings of your machine, warming things up in an instant. Cooling systems work to reduce the temperature of your PCs hardware, effectively allowing your PC to function without ever missing a beat.\r\n\n\n4. Random Access Memory (RAM)\n\n\r\n  RAM is responsible for temporarily storing data while your computer performs other tasks. In essence, RAM allows you to multi-task without any perceivable lag. Gamers should have at least 8GB of RAM to run any game at a seamless speed.\r\n\n\r\n  Don\u2019t want to build your own gaming PC? Browse through HP\u2019s collection HP OMEN gaming computers.

This is the fourth RTX 30-related GPU to be announced by the popular gaming brand in the last few months, following on from the RTX 3070, 3080, and 3090. \nThe other RTX 30-Series cards were first announced in early September, although they did not start to become available to buy until later in the month. At the time, the new GPUs were touted as the company\u2019s \u201cgreatest-ever generational leap\u201d and mostly due to the switch to the company\u2019s new Ampere architecture. Since then, AMD has released its own updated Radeon RX graphics cards offering consumers even more choice.\nRelated:\u00a0Related: Radeon RX 6800 XT Vs. Nvidia RTX 3070: Best GPU To Buy Under $650?\nNvidia has now confirmed the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti will go on sale on December 2, priced at $399 in the U.S. At this price, it is currently the cheapest RTX 30-Series\u00a0card on the market, with Nvidia specifically noting it is priced to match the \u201cmarket\u2019s sweet spot.\u201d In spite of the low price, the RTX 3060 Ti does come with some hallmark features of the series, including ray tracing, NVIDIA Reflex, and Nvidia\u2019s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology. In addition to what\u2019s said to be some major performance upgrades compared to the RTX 2060S (Super) and the RTX 2060S. Adding to the value, Nvidia has also\u00a0explained that RTX 3060 Ti buyers will get a free one-year subscription to GeForce Now. \n                        What About Supply Issues?\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith as many as four GeForce RTX\u00a0cards having been announced in a matter of months, it would be assumed that consumers have their pick when it comes to buying. Yet, that has not really been the case, as the 2020 RTX line has suffered massively in terms of supply. The previous three 30-Series GPUs were announced together, but released at different times. However, on each occasion, the available stock sold out extremely quickly, leaving many consumers without an option to buy. Raising the question of whether the same supply, demand, and scalper issues will be in effect this time around?\nThe reality is, the answer to that question remains unknown at the moment. Nvidia has not officially commented on the stock situation this time. However, considering the new\u00a0card goes\u00a0on sale tomorrow, one positive in this sense could be the quick turnaround\u00a0as this might help circumvent any major organized attempts to buy up all the stock. Although, with the launch taking place in the weeks leading up to Christmas, it is likely the RTX 3060 Ti graphics card will still sell out, and especially at this price.\nMore:\u00a0RTX 3080 & 3090: Don't Expect Stock Issues To Stop This Year, Says Nvidia CEO\nSource: Nvidia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThe Sex Lives Of College Girls Cancelled After Season 3 On Max, Show Will Attempt To Find A New Home\n\t\t\n\n\nThe Sex Lives of College Girls\n\nThe Sex Lives of College Girls has been canceled after three seasons on Max, but will attempt to find a new home on another streaming service.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nAdam Bentz\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThis Underhyped Fantasy Show With 84% On RT Would Have Been So Much Bigger If It Premiered Just Two Years Later\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nMatthew Rudoy\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tChris Pratt & Millie Bobby Brown's New Sci-Fi Movie Becomes Netflix Global Hit Despite 16% Rotten Tomatoes Score\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nAdam Bentz\n\n\n51 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tI Never Knew Dragon Ball's Creator Once Collaborated With Star Wars\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nPatrick Macias\n\n\n3 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDwarfs vs Dwarves: Is Disney Right Or...

This has included Intel, AMD, and now NVIDIA, who today is announcing an event for January 12th.\nDubbed \u201cGeForce RTX: Game On\u201d, the broadcasted event will be presented by Jeff Fisher, NVIDIA\u2019s Senior VP for GeForce. NVIDIA has set aside an hour for their CES-adjacent presentation, which will kick off at 9am Pacific on January 12th, 2021.\nToday\u2019s reveal is little more than a hold the date teaser, with NVIDIA promising to \u201cunveil the latest innovations in gaming and graphics.\u201d And while the company isn\u2019t offering any more details than that, observationally we\u2019ve seen that over the last several years NVIDIA has frequently used CES to announce new products and technologies. This goes particularly for laptop products, as CES has increasingly transformed into a laptop showcase for the PC OEMs. Fittingly, as NVIDIA continues its Ampere GPU release cadence with smaller and less power-hungry parts, the next chip expected to be released (GA106?) should be a good candidate for use in laptops.\nOne way or another, we\u2019ll find out for sure next month with NVIDIA\u2019s presentation. So stay tuned.\n\n\n                Source:\n                NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n38 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nTEAMSWITCHER - Wednesday, December 16, 2020 - link\nUntil I can actually buy an RTX 3080, I don't want to hear about anything else.\n\n\n\nExarKun333 - Wednesday, December 16, 2020 - link\nThank you.

Said Kress:\nWe do have supply constraints, and our supply constraints do expand past what we're seeing in terms of wafers and silicon, but yes, some constraints are in substrates and components. We continue to work during the quarter on our supply, and we believe, though, that demand will probably exceed supply in Q4 for overall gaming.\nShe also said that it might be \"a couple months\" before Nvidia can catch up to demand, but qualified even that by saying \"at this time, it's really difficult for us to quantify.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest and demand across almost every part of the gaming industry has soared in 2020, presumably as people spend more time at home pursuing hobbies, when they would have previously (in the pre-pandemic world) been out and about. But at the same time, COVID-19 has impacted supply lines for electronics companies. These two factors together have led to many situations where demand has outstripped supply for gaming products like video cards or consoles.\nEven early in the pandemic, long before the new 30-series RTX cards launched, Nintendo Switch consoles became scarce at retailers around the world because Nintendo struggled to keep up with a sudden, unexpected surge in demand this spring. And like Nvidia's RTX cards, the newly launched PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S game consoles have sold out near-instantly any time they've become available from online retailers, leaving many would-be buyers frustrated.\n\"We would characterize the launch and what we're seeing as overwhelming demand,\" Kress said. \"Each day, things continue to improve. But before the end of the quarter, we'll be able to provide some more information.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Nvidia announces the $399 RTX 3060 Ti\u2014and we\u2019ve tested it\n          \n\n            Assuming you can find one when it launches tomorrow, what performance can you expect?\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamuel Axon\nSenior Editor\n\n\n\n\nSamuel Axon\nSenior Editor\n\n\n      Samuel Axon is a senior editor at Ars Technica.

Microsoft Flight Simulator really pushed it beyond the limit, but that's also a game that looks impossibly real, designed to look incredible even years from now. But I'm having to make some sacrifices in other games, too, as well as being locked out of newer features.Typical frugal Scot that I am, I managed to stop myself from splashing out on the first batch of Nvidia's RTX graphics cards, opting to stick with my excellent 1080Ti until more games started taking advantage of all these new bells and whistles. And now I'm rightly being punished for not hitching my ride to this wagon straight away, as I'm ready to enter the flashy world of ray tracing smack bang in the middle of a shortage.(Image credit: CD Projekt)Cyberpunk 2077 is the first game where I've felt like I needed ray tracing to really appreciate what the studio was trying to create. Everyone makes a big deal about how amazing Control looks with ray tracing, but Control looks amazing all the time. Cyberpunk does not. Night City's got a strong look, but low quality textures and lighting leaves the place often looking flat and dreary. Chuck in ray tracing lighting and reflections, though, and the city and characters start to come to life. At times the difference is subtle, but in other places it's like night and day. None of which I can actually experience on my PC.If it was just ray tracing I was missing out on, I could probably ignore it, but Cyberpunk's also very demanding and not especially optimised. To get a steady 60 fps at 1440p, I have to go all the way down to the low preset, and the actually-not-especially-impressive performance gain isn't worth using my other monitor and dropping it down to 1080p. Either way, I'm having to cut a lot of corners just to get a reasonable framerate.Unable to summon a 3080 out of thin air, I started eyeing up GeForce Now. I've got an Nvidia Shield TV Pro, so I thought I might as well dive further into Nvidia's ecosystem. What's one more added to the pile? The service is a little different from the likes of Stadia, as you're playing games that you've purchased on stores like Steam and GOG, and then accessing your library using GeForce Now, which then assigns you a rig to play on over the cloud. And it works surprisingly well.\u00a0(Image credit: CD Projekt)GeForce Now can be installed on your Shield, phone, some TVs or your PC, and the only hurdle is your internet connection. Which might be an insurmountable one. It needs to be steady more than it needs to be fast, and Nvidia recommends 25 Mbps for 1080p at 60fps, though in my experience you'll want to at least double that. A wired connection is the way to go, though wireless via a 5GHz is viable. Not recommended for Cyberpunk 2077, though.\u00a0The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Right now, the biggest hook is getting access to all the RTX magic without a card. In Cyberpunk 2077's case, that means ray tracing shadows, lighting and reflections, as well as various DLSS settings that will help you find the right balance between performance and fidelity. Even though I was ready to get a 3080, I was still on the fence about ray tracing, but now I'm a convert.\u00a0I'm getting a high-end PC beamed into my living room without shelling out a big wad of cash, so it feels like a bit of a steal. It's not perfect, though. The image quality isn't quite as high as the original, and during combat or high speed chases I've noticed some hiccups, though both of those are down to my not-great internet speed. The one thing that really feels like it's missing is support for resolutions above 1080p. I've got a 4K TV, but honestly I think 4K streaming would be out of reach for my connection anyway, so it's not a huge loss. The Shield TV's AI upscaling feature comes in quite handy here, not to the point that it mimics 4K, but it at least removes the blurriness that comes from streaming at 1080p on a 4K display.(Image credit: CD Projekt)If you don't have an RTX card or a PC that can handle Cyberpunk 2077, GeForce Now is probably the best way to play the game. While you can start using the service for free, that won't let you take advantage of any RTX features, so you'll have to pay for Founders membership. That's \u00a34.99/$4.99 a month, which doesn't feel too steep.Founders membership, it's worth noting, doesn't give you unfettered access, and with the popularity of Cyberpunk you might find yourself queuing. Being stuck in a queue to play a singleplayer game that you already own absolutely sucks, and highlights one of the biggest concerns I have about cloud gaming generally: that we're giving away the last shred of actual ownership we have over our games.As well as queuing, you can get logged out of your game due to inactivity, and after six hours you'll be given the boot. It's like playing an MMO who is also your mum. Yes, six hours is a long time to play a game without a proper break, but I will fight any machine that tells me to log off.The future is going to be weird. It's empowering, sure. You can just conjure up a gaming rig. It's ridiculous. And basically effortless. But it also introduces a lot of new frustrations and concessions. All of them, I think, worth it, at least until you can beef up your own PC. As an outright replacement for a high-end gaming PC GeForce Now isn't there yet, but it looks like it's heading that way.\n\n\nFraser BrownSocial Links NavigationOnline EditorFraser is the UK online editor and has actually met The Internet in person.

The models are priced at 1999 Euros but only come with the Max-Q configuration while the Max-P variant is missing here.\nFinally, we have the top of the line NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Max-Q variant with 16 GB GDDR6 memory. This model features a price of 2599 Euros so a 600 Euro difference between the GeForce RTX 3070 and the GeForce RTX 3080. The GeForce RTX 3060 laptops are listed with pre-orders commencing in January-February 2021 while the GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3070 GPU based models are expected to hit pre-orders around the end of Q1 2021. Laptop makers will also be offering high-end and enthusiast configurations of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Ampere GPUs with AMD's Ryzen 5000H 'Cezanne-H' CPUs, some of which we reported here today.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n137\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n84\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n78\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n52\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n49\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The key points from the slides it has shared are that premium gaming laptops with RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 mobile GPUs are \"scheduled for January 2021.\" Some weeks later, but still in H1, we can expect to see the first RTX 3060 powered laptops appear, according to the slides/report.\nIn the main slide published, you can see that Nvidia will be replacing models that used to come packing GeForce RTX 2080 Super, RTX 2070 Super, and some RTX 2070 GPUs with a range of offerings based around the RTX 3080 and RTX 2070. This action takes place in the US$1,299 to $1,999 segment.\n\nMoving lower down the performance/price chart the roadmap slide includes GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs \u2013 and these are destined to mop up and replace the last of the RTX 20 series mobile offerings \u2013 the cheaper RTX 2070 and RTX 2060 laptops. Many of these machines are priced between US$999 and $1,299. However, this segment won't be refreshed in Januanry but a little later according to the source.\nAll the way through Q1 2021 you will see that cheaper (gaming) laptops will continue to be sold with the likes of the GTX 1650, 1650 Ti, and 1660 Ti. As the purportedly genuine slide includes the H1 GTX 1660 Ti and 1650 Ti models in new boxes in the table it is thought that they might get a minor tweak or two.\nAnother touted change in the mobile computing landscape as H1 2021 arrives is that AMD CPUs are supposed to become more prevalent in gaming laptops with Nvidia GPUs. WCCF Tech reckons this change will coincide with the introduction of AMD Cezanne-H mobile CPUs.\n\nSo, between now and sometime in January it is possible that any sizable stocks of high end gaming laptops will get significant price cuts to help shift them. We've just had Black Friday / Cyber Monday but I didn't pay much attention to laptops, did any readers? I'm sure there are plenty of other sales opportunities between now and early/mid January.\nIf you have just snapped up a bargain and regret not waiting for RTX 30 Mobile GPUs to arrive you might find some consolation in the source's theory that the \"RTX 30 mobility series {will} have a very short life cycle\". It thinks that Nvidia will quite quickly move to TSMC 7nm to ready RTX 30 Super variants in its never ending battle for supremacy. Perhaps that change will come as soon as the (traditional) Computex time.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 6 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

GPU rendering in the cloud helped the team complete the movie while working remotely.\n\u201cRelying on the Microsoft Azure platform with NVIDIA\u2019s GPU cloud rendering allowed us to focus on the production quality of the film without having to worry about the technical rendering challenges even during the COVID-19 pandemic. It really was a game changer for us,\u201d said Kiran Bhakta Joshi, CEO of Incessant Rain Studios.\n\nArtists Take to the Cloud to Power Animations\nIncessant Rain Studios collaborated closely with the Azure team to develop an animation production pipeline in a cloud-based environment.\nWith the help of the Azure support team from various locations around the world, they developed a system that was specifically designed to meet their production requirements. Along with the availability of GPU virtual machines, the team took advantage of GPU rendering in the cloud.\nQuickly setting up the infrastructure and collaborative tools was essential. First, the studio in Nepal tapped Azure\u2019s data center in Singapore, which allowed the teams to move data back and forth easily while minimizing latency and optimizing bandwidth.\nThe artists were able to smoothly bring up shots and render them using NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs with Autodesk Maya and Chaos Group V-Ray. The sets and characters of the film were completed in one pass, while effects like motion blur and atmospherics were done in separate passes. In total, the movie consists of 1,660 animated shots.\n\u201cWe designed V-Ray to work well in cloud rendering scenarios, and we are very pleased to see that Incessant Rain successfully produced such a large production on Microsoft Azure, where V-Ray GPU on V100 instances delivered super-fast turnarounds for their effects shots,\u201d said Phillip Miller, vice president of product management at Chaos Group.\nTo manage the virtual machines, Azure provides a wide array of tools including centralized logging, activity security, auditing and monitoring, and other features from the Azure portal.\nScaling VMs was easy as Incessant Rain was able to quickly deploy as many as needed through the Azure portal. The operating system licenses were always updated and security was managed by Azure itself, which saved the team lots of time during the deployments.\nThe image size produced by the renders were significantly large, so, to optimize the workflow process, the artists used Azure Remote Desktop to review the render sequences on the cloud before downloading them on premises, which further helped them manage the internet bandwidth.\nAnd with the production pipeline already developed on Azure, the transition to remote working after COVID-19 hit was smooth, allowing the team to meet the tight deadlines and complete the movie by November.\nAs early adopters and innovators in cloud-based animation, Threshold Entertainment and Incessant Rain are now looking toward the future of the studio in the cloud for upcoming productions.\n\nNew Frontiers with Infinite Scale\nThe innovation generated through this process is ultimately making Azure better at supporting the AI needs of their customers, even at scale. With the Azure NDv2 VM series, Azure was the first and only public cloud service offering clusters of VMs with NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs, connected by high-bandwidth, low-latency NVIDIA Mellanox InfiniBand networking.\nThe latest NCas T4 v3 Series VM from Azure is specifically designed for the AI and machine learning workloads, as they feature four NVIDIA T4 GPUs with 16GB of memory each.\nThe recently released ND A100 v4 VM series, Microsoft\u2019s powerful and scalable AI virtual machine, starts with a single VM and eight NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, and can scale up to thousands of GPUs with 1.6 Tb/s of interconnect bandwidth per VM.\nEach GPU is provided with its own dedicated 200 Gb/s NVIDIA Mellanox HDR InfiniBand connection. Tens, hundreds or thousands of GPUs can then work together as part of a Mellanox InfiniBand HDR cluster to achieve any level of AI ambition.\nLearn more about NVIDIA GPUs in media and entertainment.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: Cloud Services | GPU | Remote Work \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

After months of waiting, we finally have independent benchmarks and testing data. Nvidia has thrown down the gauntlet, clearly challenging AMD's Big Navi to try and match or beat what the Ampere architecture brings to the table.We're going to hold off on a final verdict for now, as we have other third-party RTX 3080 cards to review, which will begin as soon as tomorrow. That's good news, as it means customers won't be limited to Nvidia's Founders Edition for the first month or so like we were with the RTX 20-series launch. Another piece of good news is that there's no Founders Edition 'tax' this time: The RTX 3080 FE costs $699, direct from Nvidia, and that's the base price of RTX 3080 cards for the time being. The bad news is that we fully expect supply to be insufficient to keep up with what we expect to be exceptionally high demand.The bottom line, if you don't mind spoilers, is that the RTX 3080 FE is 33% faster than the RTX 2080 Ti, on average. Or, if you prefer other points of comparison, it's 57% faster than the RTX 2080 Super, 69% faster than the RTX 2080 FE \u2014 heck, it's even 26% faster than the Titan RTX!But there's a catch: We measured all of those 'percent faster' results across our test suite running at 4K ultra settings. The lead narrows if you drop down to 1440p, and it decreases even more at 1080p. It's still 42% faster than a 2080 FE at 1080p ultra, but this is very much a card made for higher resolutions.\u00a0Also, you might need a faster CPU to get the full 3080 experience \u2014 check out our companion GeForce RTX 3080 CPU Scaling article for the full details.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 at Amazon for $839.99Swipe to scroll horizontallyNvidia GPU SpecificationsGraphics CardRTX 3080 FERTX 2080 Super FERTX 2080 FEArchitectureGA102TU104TU104Process (nm)Samsung 8NTSMC 12FFNTSMC 12FFNTransistors (Billion)28.313.613.6Die size (mm^2)628.4545545GPCs666SMs684846FP32 CUDA Cores870430722944Tensor Cores272384368RT Cores684846Boost Clock (MHz)171018151800VRAM Speed (Gbps)1915.514VRAM (GB)1088VRAM Bus Width320256256ROPs966464TPCs342423TMUs272192184GFLOPS FP32297681115110598Tensor TFLOPS FP16 (Sparsity)119 (238)8985RT TFLOPS582625Bandwidth (GBps)760496448TDP (watts)320250225Dimensions (mm)285x112x38267x116x38267x116x38Weight (g)135512781260Launch DateSep-20Jul-19Sep-18Launch Price$699 $699 $799 Meet GA102: The Heart of the Beast\u00a0(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)We have a separate article going deep into the Ampere architecture that powers the GeForce RTX 3080 and other related GPUs. If you want the full rundown of everything that's changed compared to the Turing architecture, we recommend starting there. But here's the highlight reel of the most important changes:The GA102 is the first GPU from Nvidia to drop into the single digits on lithography, using Samsung's 8N process. The general consensus is that TSMC's N7 node is 'better' overall, but it also costs more and is currently in very high demand \u2014 including from Nvidia's own A100. Could the consumer Ampere GPUs have been even better with 7nm? Perhaps. But they might have cost more, only been available in limited quantities, or maybe they would have been delayed a few more months. Regardless, GA102 is still a big and powerful chip, boasting 28.3 billion transistors packed into a 628.4mm square die. If you're wondering, that's 52% more transistors than the TU102 chip used in RTX 2080 Ti, but in a 17% smaller area.Ampere ends up as a split architecture, with the GA100 taking on data center ambitions while the GA102 and other consumer chips have significant differences. The GA100 focuses far more on FP64 performance for scientific workloads, as well as doubling down on deep learning hardware. Meanwhile, the GA102 drops most of the FP64 functionality and instead includes ray tracing hardware, plus some other architectural enhancements. Let's take a closer look at the Ampere SM found in the GA102 and GA104.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Nvidia GPUs consist of several GPCs (Graphics Processing Clusters), each of which has some number of SMs (Streaming Multiprocessors). Nvidia splits each SM into four partitions that can operate on separate sets of data. With Ampere, each SM partition now has 16 FP32 CUDA cores, 16 FP32/INT CUDA cores, a third-gen Tensor core, load/store units, and a special function unit. The whole SM has access to shared L1 cache and memory, and there's a single second-gen RT core. In total, that means 64 FP32 cores and 64 FP32/INT cores, four Turing cores, and one RT core. Let's break that down a bit more.The Turing GPUs added support for concurrent FP32 (32-bit floating point) and INT (32-bit integer) operations. FP32 tends to be the most important workload for graphics and games, but there's still a decent amount of INT operations \u2014 for things like address calculations, texture lookups, and various other types of code. With Ampere, the INT datapath is upgraded to support INT or FP32, but not at the same time.If you look at the raw specs, Ampere appears to be a far bigger jump in performance than the 70% we measured. 30 TFLOPS! But it generally won't get anywhere near that high because the second datapath is an either/or situation: It can't do both types of instructions on the pipeline in the same cycle. Nvidia says around 35% of gaming calculations are INT operations, which means you'll end up with something more like 20 TFLOPS of FP32 and 10 TOPS of INT on the RTX 3080.While we're on the subject, let's also point out that a big part of the increased performance comes from increased power limits. RTX 2080 was a 225W part (for the Founders Edition), and RTX 3080 basically adds 100W to that. That's half again more power for 70% more performance. It's technically a win in overall efficiency, but in the pursuit of performance, Nvidia had to move further to the right on the voltage and frequency curve. Nvidia says RTX 3080 can deliver a 90% improvement in performance-per-watt if you limit performance to the same level on both the 2080 and 3080 \u2026 but come on, who wants to limit performance that way? Well, maybe laptops, but let's not go there.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)One thing that hasn't changed much is the video ports. Okay, that's only partially true. First, there's a single HDMI port, but it's HDMI 2.1 instead of Turing's HDMI 2.0b, but the three DisplayPort connections remain 1.4a. And last but not least, there's no VirtualLink port this round \u2014 apparently, VirtualLink is dead. RIP. The various ports are all capable of 8K60 using DSC (Display Stream Compression), a \"visually lossless\" technique that's actually not really visually lossless. But you might not notice at 8K.Getting back to the cores, Nvidia's third-gen tensor cores in GA102 work on 8x4x4 FP16 matrices, so up to 128 matrix operations per cycle. (Turing's tensor cores used 4x4x4 matrices, while the GA100 uses 8x4x8 matrices.) With FMA (fused multiply-add), that's 256 FP operations per cycle, per tensor core. Multiply by the 272 total tensor cores and clock speed, and that gives you 119 TFLOPS of FP16 compute. However, Ampere's tensor cores also add support for fine-grained sparsity \u2014 basically, it eliminates wasting time doing multiplications by 0, since the answer is always 0. Sparsity can provide up to twice the FP16 performance in applications that can use it.The RT cores receive similar enhancements, with up to double the ray/triangle intersection calculations per clock. The RT cores also support a time variable, which is useful for calculating things like motion blur. All told, Nvidia says the 3080\u2019s new RT cores are 1.7 times faster than the RTX 2080\u2019s, and they can be up to five times as fast for motion blur.There are plenty of other changes as well. The L1 cache/shared memory capacity and bandwidth has been increased to better feed the cores (8704KB vs. 4416KB), and the L2 cache is also 25% larger than before (5120KB vs. 4096KB). The L1 cache can also be configured as varying amounts of L1 vs. shared memory, depending on the needs of the application. Register file size is also nearly 50% larger (17408KB vs. 11776KB) with the RTX 3080. GA102 can also do concurrent RT + graphics + DLSS (previously, using the RT cores would stop the CUDA cores).Finally, the raster operators (ROPS) have been moved out of the memory controllers and into the GPCs. Each GPC has two ROP partitions of eight ROP units each. This provides more flexibility in performance, so where the GA102 has up to 112 ROPS total, the RTX 3080 disables two memory controllers but only one GPC and ends up with 96 ROPS. This is more critical for the RTX 3070 / GA104, however, which still has 96 ROPS even though it only has eight memory controllers. Each GPC also includes six TPCs (Texture Processing Clusters) with eight TMUs (Texture Mapping Units) and a polymorph engine, though Nvidia only enables 34 TPCs for the 3080.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)With the core enhancements out of the way, let's also quickly discuss the memory subsystem. GA102 supports up to twelve 32-bit memory channels, of which ten are enabled on the RTX 3080. Nvidia teamed up with Micron to use its GDDR6X memory, which uses PAM4 signaling to boost data rates even higher than before. Where the RTX 20-series cards topped out at 15.5 Gbps in the 2080 Super and 14 Gbps in the other RTX cards, GDDR6X runs at 19 Gbps in the RTX 3080. Combined with the 320-bit interface, that yields 760 GBps of bandwidth - a 70% improvement over RTX 2080.The RTX 3080\u2019s memory controller has also been improved, with a new feature called EDR: Error Detection and Replay. When the memory detects a failed transmission, rather than crashing or corrupting data, it simply tries again. It will do this until it's successful, though it's still possible to cause a crash with memory overclocking. The interesting bit is that with EDR, higher memory clocks might be achievable, but still result in lower performance. That's because the EDR ends up reducing memory performance when failed transmissions occur. We'll have more to say on this in the overclocking section.GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition: Design, Cooling, Aesthetics(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Nvidia has radically altered the design of its Founders Edition cards for the RTX 30-series. The new design still includes two axial fans, but Nvidia heavily redesigned the PCB and shortened it so that the 'back' of the card (away from the video ports) consists of just a fan, heatpipes, radiator fins, and the usual graphics card shroud. Nvidia says the new design delivers substantial improvements in cooling efficiency, while at the same time lowering noise levels. We'll see the fruits of the design later.Aesthetics are highly subjective, and we've heard plenty of people like the new design, while others think it looks boring. There's no RGB bling if that's your thing, and the only lighting consists of a white GeForce RTX logo on the top of the card with subtle lighting around the 'X' on both sides of the card (but only half of the 'X' is lit up on the side with the \"RTX 3080\" logo).Personally, I think the new card looks quite nice, and it feels very solid in the hand. It's actually about 100g heavier than the previous RTX 2080 design, and as far as I'm aware, it's the heaviest single-GPU card Nvidia has ever created. It's also about 2cm longer than the previous generation cards and uses the typical two-slot width. (The GeForce RTX 3090 is about ready to make the 3080 FE look puny, though, with its massive three-slot cooler.)\u00a0Image 1 of 6(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Nvidia provided the above images of the teardown of the RTX 3080 Founders Edition. We're not ready to attempt disassembly of our card yet \u2014 and frankly, we're out of time \u2014 but we may return to the subject soon. We're told getting the card apart is a bit trickier this round, mostly because Nvidia has hidden the screws behind tiny covers.The main board looks far more densely populated than previous GPUs, with the 10 GDDR6X memory chips surrounding the GPU in the center. You can also see the angled 12-pin power connector and the funky-looking cutout at the end of the PCB. Power delivery is obviously important with a 320W TGP, and you can see all the solid electrolytic capacitors placed to the left and right of the memory chips.The memory arrangement is also interesting, with four chips on the left and right sides of the GPU, up to three chips above the GPU (two mounting positions are empty for the RTX 3080), and a final single chip below the GPU. Again, Nvidia clearly spent a lot of effort to reduce the size of the board and other components to accommodate the new and improved cooling design. Spoiler: It works very well.One interesting thing is that the 'front' fan (near the video ports) spins in the usual direction \u2014 counterclockwise. The 'back' fan, which will typically face upward when you install the card in an ATX case, spins clockwise. If you look at the fins, that means the back fan spins the opposite direction from what we normally expect. The reason is that Nvidia found this arrangement pulls air through the radiator better and generates less noise. Also note that the back fan is slightly thicker, and the integrated ring helps increase static pressure on both fans while keeping RPMs low.If you don't like the look of the Founders Edition, rest assured there will be plenty of other options. We have a few third-party RTX 3080 cards in for testing, all of which naturally include RGB lighting. None of the third party cards use the 12-pin power connector, either \u2014 not that it really matters, since the required adapter comes with the card. Still, that vertically-mounted 12-pin port just looks a bit less robust if you happen to swap GPUs on a regular basis. I plan to leave the adapter permanently connected and just connect or disconnect the normal 8-pin PEG cables. The 12-pin connector appears to be rated for 25 'cycles,' and I've already burned through half of those (not that I expect it to fail any time soon).\u00a0Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080: Price Comparison $749.99View $839.99View $978.97View $999.99View $2,480.99ViewLow StockShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by \n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n6\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nCurrent page:\n\nGeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition: Hail to the King!\n\n\n\nNext Page GeForce RTX 3080: Initial Overclocking Results\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNVIDIA RTX\n4K\nGeForce RTX 3080\nTitan\nBenchmark\nGeForce\nrtx\nray tracing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (11)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

I don't see any good reason to buy an AMD GPU other than for a pity-purchase. AMD is pricing their cards less, because they are less. In sheer performance it's just a bit less, but in next generation capabilities .. it's a lot less. I will hold out for an RTX 3080. AMD won't catch up, before Nvidia has filled the demand of the market. Patience will be rewarded.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeszekSol\n\n\nWhat is a point discussing items (namely - Nvidia RTX3080 Founders Edition) which dos not exist in free market?

You're right, the actual settings are different in FFXIV Benchmark. I use the \"high\" and \"maximum\" settings instead of medium/ultra for that test. I'll see about updating the script to put in the correct names, though I intend to drop the FFXIV benchmark at some point regardless.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nacsmith1972\n\n\nThe cheapest I see this card for right now is $1800. I really wish these manufacturers wouldn't be pricing these cards based on bitcoin mining. It's once again going to price the rest of us out of getting any decent video cards till BTC drops again.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 11 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeydous NJ98-CP V2 HE Review: Dedicated calculators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicron 4600 2TB SSD Review: The New Baseline in SSDs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogitech G Pro X Superlight 2 Dex Review: A very close second\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASRock PG-1600G Phantom Gaming power supply review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID-Cooling FX 360 INF Pink Review: Stylishly pink, but loud in more ways than one\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewSonic XG2536 25-inch FHD IPS 280 Hz gaming monitor review: Incredibly quick and value priced\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWD Black SN7100 SSD Review: The power efficiency king, with caveats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D Review: Stunning gaming performance meets top-tier productivity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMacBook Air (M4, 2025) review: Blue skies ahead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple Mac Studio (Early 2025) Review: Renewed vigor with M4 Max and M3 Ultra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

But for people working in architectural design visualization, two huge leaps forward have propelled us toward that ideal state.\nAnd to celebrate, NVIDIA and its partners led by Lenovo, Chaos Group, KitBash3D and CGArchitect are launching a real-time rendering design challenge, called \u201cBuilding Utopia,\u201d with great prizes at stake.\nThe first leap came with the introduction of NVIDIA RTX technology in 2018 at the SIGGRAPH Conference. NVIDIA RTX provided the industry with the graphics and compute power needed to instantly create accurate, photorealistic, ray-traced renders with physically based materials and lighting.\nArchviz specialists used to have to wait overnight for their CPU render farms to produce a high-fidelity animation of an architectural scene. Come morning, they\u2019d sometimes find that the job had crashed \u2014 and then would have to run the render all over again.\nWith NVIDIA RTX, millions of designers around the world suddenly had the ability to render huge models in real time while they iterated on designs.\nThe second leap happened with Chaos Group announcing the general availability of Vantage, which uses the RT Cores in NVIDIA RTX technology to enable the real-time exploration of V-Ray authored scenes within a 100 percent ray-traced environment.\nUsing Vantage, project teams can more effectively visualize models with photorealistic views and flythroughs of building interiors and exteriors. It\u2019s a big help for everything from conceptual designs for bid preparation and imagining new projects, to iterating on options during detailed design.\nCreating compelling renders of buildings is a critical part of design reviews with clients and for producing marketing assets to help with commercial sales. Chaos Vantage with NVIDIA RTX reduces the time spent waiting for renders to resolve, so archviz specialists can go through more iterations to find the best expression of their vision for presenting the scene.\nBuilding Utopia Design Visualization Challenge\nParticipants in the Building Utopia real-time rendering challenge will have access to a futuristic 3D model provided by KitBash3D and will submit short animations created using Chaos Vantage.\nEntries will be judged on various criteria including overall originality, cinematography and use of lighting. The contest is led by Lenovo and hosted by CGArchitect. Deadline for submissions is Jan. 25, 2021. Winners will be announced online March 26, 2021.\nThe winners will receive fabulous prizes, including a Lenovo ThinkPad P15 with an NVIDIA RTX 5000 professional GPU or an NVIDIA RTX 8000 or RTX 6000 professional GPU, along with a one-year V-Ray Collection. Register now to join the Building Utopia challenge.\n\u201cLenovo has long supported creatives across industries \u2014 bringing together the power, speed and reliability needed for today\u2019s increasingly complex design and visualization workflows,\u201d said Chris Ruffo, worldwide segment lead for AEC and Product Development at Lenovo. \u201cWe are thrilled to partner with NVIDIA, Chaos Group and CG Architect to launch the Building Utopia competition, rewarding extraordinary work, while challenging entrants to really push the boundaries of what is possible with today\u2019s real-time rendering technology.\u201d\n\u201cChaos Vantage and real-time ray tracing on RTX is a game changer for design visualization,\u201d said Lon Grohs, head of Creative at Chaos Group. \u201cThe Building Utopia challenge will be an incredible showcase of what artists and designers can achieve with this groundbreaking technology.\u201d\nChaos Vantage joins over 50 industry-leading software products that have integrated support for NVIDIA RTX technology.\nFeatured image\u00a0rendered in Chaos Vantage.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: NVIDIA RTX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They can then quickly run it on Nvidia GPU instances from within the AWS console in conjunction with a variety of AWS services, from EC2 and SageMaker to Elastic Kubernetes Service and Elastic Container Service.\nThe NGC software coming to AWS Marketplace includes Nvidia AI, a suite of frameworks and tools, including MXNet, TensorFlow and Nvidia Triton Inference Server; Nvidia Clara Imaging, a deep learning training and inference framework for medical imaging; Nvidia DeepStream SDK, a video analytics framework for edge computing; and Nvidia NeMo, an open-source Python toolkit for conversational AI.\n\u201cWe first began providing GPU-optimized software through the Nvidia NGC catalog in 2017. Since then, industry demand for these resources has skyrocketed,\u201d El Hallak wrote. \u201cMore than 250,000 unique users have now downloaded more than 1 million of the AI containers, pre-trained models, application frameworks, Helm charts and other machine learning resources available on the catalog.\u201d\nMatthew DuBell, a consulting solutions architect for the Business and Analytics Advisors group at St. Louis, Mo.-based World Wide Technology, an Nvidia and AWS partner, said Nvidia expanding NGC to the cloud is important for enterprises that have been developing AI applications on their private cloud and are looking to scale up production.\n\u201cIn the enterprise space, a lot of organizations are now just really wanting to get to scale in production, so having these apps as a starting point enables you to start learning how to use them and then determining what you need to build off of this versus doing it from the ground up,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, this gives you a good head start in that realm, and then allows you to start designing the business-rich features that you need in addition to these apps.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Nvidia kept the Turing line going for two years before replacing it with Ampere in September 2020. AMD were a little kinder, leaving a 15 month gap between their new designs, but most people weren't interested in that.\nWhat they wanted to see was AMD launching a top end model to compete head-to-head with the best from Nvidia. They did just that and now that we've seen the results, PC gamers are now spoilt for choice (at least theoretically), when it comes to spending their dollars on the best performing graphics cards.\nBut what about the chips powering them? Is one of them fundamentally better than the other?\nRead on to see how Ampere and RDNA 2 battle it out!\nNote this is a long article. Use this index to navigate it...\nArticle Index\n\nNodes and die sizes\nOverall structure of Ampere GA102 and RDNA 2 Navi 21\nHow everything is organized inside the chips\nCounting cores the Nvidia way\nRay Tracing\nMemory system, multi-level caches\nRendering pipelines, SAM, RTX IO\nMultimedia engine, streaming\nBuilt for compute, built for gaming\n\nNvidia shrinks, AMD grows\nNodes and die sizes\nHigh-end GPUs have been considerably bigger than CPUs for a number of years, and they've been steadily increasing in size. AMD's latest offering is roughly 520 mm2 in area, more than double the size of their previous Navi chip. It's not their largest, though \u2013 that honor goes to the GPU in their new Instinct MI100 accelerator, at around 750 mm2.\nThe last time AMD made a gaming processor anywhere near the size of Navi 21 was for the Radeon R9 Fury and Nano cards, which sported the GCN 3.0 architecture in a Fiji chip. It was 596 mm2 in die area, but it was manufactured on TSMC's 28HP process node.\nAMD has been using TSMC's much smaller N7 process since 2018 and the biggest chip from that production line was the Vega 20 (as found in the Radeon VII), with an area of 331 mm2. All of their Navi GPUs are made on a slightly updated version of that process, called N7P, so it makes to compare these products.\n\nThe Radeon R9 Nano: tiny card, massive GPU\nBut when it comes to sheer die size, Nvidia takes the crown, not that this is necessarily a good thing. The latest Ampere-based chip, the GA102, is 628 mm2. That's actually about 17% smaller than its forefather, the TU102 \u2013 that GPU was a staggering 754 mm2 in die area.\nBoth pale in size when compared to Nvidia's monstrous GA100 chip - used in AI & data centers, this GPU is 826 mm2 and it's a TSMC N7 chip. While never designed to power a desktop graphics card, it does show what scale of GPU manufacturing is possible.\nPutting them all side-by-side highlights just how bulky Nvidia's biggest GPUs are. The Navi 21 looks fairly svelte, although there's more to a processor than just die area. The GA102 is packing around 28.3 billion transistors, whereas AMD's new chip sports 5% fewer, at 26.8 billion.\n\nWhat we don't know is how many layer each GPU is built of, so all we can compare is the ratio of transistors to die area, typically called die density. The Navi 21 is roughly 51.5 million transistors per square mm, but the GA102 is notably lower at 41.1 \u2013 it could be that Nvidia's chip is stacked a little higher than AMD's, but it's more likely to be an indication of process node.\nAs already mentioned, the Navi 21 is manufactured by TSMC, using their N7P production method, which offers a small increase in performance over N7; but for their new offering, the GA102, Nvidia turned to Samsung for production duties. The South Korea semiconductor giant is using a tweaked version, specifically for Nvidia, of their so-called 8 nm node (labelled as 8N or 8NN).\nThese node values, 7 and 8, have little to do with the actual size of the components with the chips: they're simply marketing terms, used to differentiate between the various production techniques. That said, even if the GA102 has more layers than the Navi 21, the die size does have one particular impact.\n\nA 300 mm (12 inch) wafer being tested in a TSMC fabrication plant.\nMicroprocessors and other chips are fabricated from large, circular discs of highly refined silicon and other materials, called wafers. TSMC and Samsung use 300 mm wafers for AMD and Nvidia, and each disc will generate more chips using smaller dies compared to larger ones.\nThe difference is unlikely to be huge, but when every wafer costs thousands of dollars to produce, AMD have a small advantage over Nvidia, when it comes to keeping manufacturing costs down. That's assuming, of course, Samsung or TSMC aren't doing some kind of financial deal with AMD/Nvidia.\nAll of this die size and transistor count shenanigans would be for naught, if the chips themselves weren't any good at what they're design to do. So let's dig into the layouts of each new GPU and see what's underneath their hoods.\nDissecting the dies\nOverall structure of Ampere GA102 and RDNA 2 Navi 21\nWe start our exploration of the architectures with a look at the overall structure of the Ampere GA102 and RDNA 2 Navi 21 GPUs \u2013 these diagrams don't necessarily show us how everything is physically laid out, but they give a clear indication as to how many components the processors have.\nIn both cases, the layouts are very familiar, as they are essentially expanded versions of their predecessors. Adding more units to process instructions will always increase the performance of a GPU, because at high resolutions in the latest 3D blockbusters, the rendering workloads involve a huge number of parallel calculations.\n\nSuch diagrams are useful, but for this particular analysis, it's actually more interesting looking at where the various components are within the GPU dies themselves. When designing a large scale processor, you generally want shared resources, such as controllers and cache in a central position, to ensure every component has the same path to them.\nInterface systems, such as local memory controllers or video outputs, should go on the edges of the chip to make it easier to connect them to the thousands of individual wires that link the GPU to the rest of the graphics card.\nBelow are false-color images of AMD's Navi 21 and Nvidia's GA102 dies. Both have been run through some image processing to clean up the images, and both are really only showing one layer within the chip; but they do give us a superb view of the innards of a modern GPU.\n\nThe most obvious difference between the designs is that Nvidia hasn't followed a centralized approach to the chip layout \u2013 all of the system controllers and main cache are at the bottom, with the logic units running in long columns. They've done this in the past, but only with middle/lower end models.\nFor example, the Pascal GP106 (used in the likes of the GeForce GTX 1060) was literally half of a GP104 (from the GeForce GTX 1070). The latter was the larger chip, and had its cache and controllers in the middle; these moved to the side in its sibling, but only because of the design had been split.\n\nPascal GP104 vs GP106. Source: Fritzchens Fritz\nFor all their previous top end GPU layouts, Nvidia used a classic centralized organization. So why the change here? It can't be for interface reasons, as the memory controllers and the PCI Express system all run around the edge of the die.\nIt won't be for thermal reasons either, because even if the cache/controller part of the die ran hotter than the logic sections, you'd still want it in the middle to have more silicon around it to help absorb and dissipate the heat. Although we're not totally sure of the reason for this change, we suspect that it's to do with the changes Nvidia have implemented with the ROP (render output) units in the chip.\nWe'll look at those in more detail later on, but for now let's just say that while the change in layout looks odd, it won't make a significant difference to performance. This is because 3D rendering is riddled with lots of long latencies, typically due to having to wait for data. So the additional nanoseconds added by having some logic units further from the cache than others, all get hidden in the grand scheme of things.\nBefore we move on, it's worth remarking on the engineering changes AMD implemented in the Navi 21 layout, compared to the Navi 10 that powered the likes of the Radeon RX 5700 XT. Even though the new chip is double the size, both in terms of area and transistor count, than the earlier one, the designers also managed to also improve the clock speeds, without significantly increasing power consumption.\nFor example, the Radeon RX 6800 XT sports a base clock and boost clock of 1825 and 2250 MHz respectively, for a TDP of 300 W; the same metrics for the Radeon RX 5700 XT were 1605 MHz, 1905 MHz, and 225 W. Nvidia raised the clock speeds with Ampere, too, but some of that can be attributed towards using a smaller and more efficient process node.\n\nOur performance-per-watt examination of Ampere and RDNA 2 cards showed that both vendors have made significant improvements in this area, but AMD and TSMC have achieved something quite remarkable \u2013 compare the difference between the Radeon RX 6800 and the Radeon VII in the chart above.\nThe latter was their first GPU collaboration using the N7 node and in the space of less than two years, they've increased the performance-per-watt by 64%. It does beg the question as to how much better the Ampere GA102 could have been, had Nvidia stayed with TSMC for their production duties.\n\nManaging a GPU factory\nHow everything is organized inside the chips\nWhen it comes to the processing of instructions and managing data transfers, both Ampere and RDNA 2 follow a similar pattern to how everything is organized inside the chips. Game developers code their titles using a graphics API, to make all of the images; it might be Direct3D, OpenGL, or Vulkan. These are essentially software libraries, packed full of 'books' of rules, structures, and simplified instructions.\nThe drivers that AMD and Nvidia create for their chips essentially work as translators: converting the routines issued via the API into a sequence of operations that the GPUs can understand. After that, it's entirely down to the hardware to manage things, with regards to what instructions get done first, what part of the chip does them, and so on.\nThis initial stage of instruction management is handled by a collection of units, reasonably centralized in the chip. In RDNA 2, graphics and compute shaders are routed through separate pipelines, that schedule and dispatch the instructions to the rest of the chip; the former is called the Graphics Command Processor, the latter are Asynchronous Compute Engines (ACEs, for short).\n\nNvidia just uses one name to describe their set of management units, the GigaThread Engine, and in Ampere it does the same task as with RDNA 2, although Nvidia doesn't say too much about how it actually manages things. Altogether, these command processors function rather like a production manager of a factory.\nGPUs get their performance from doing everything in parallel, so the next level of organization is duplicated across the chip. Sticking with the factory analogy, these would be akin to a business that has a central office, but multiple locations for the manufacturing of goods.\nAMD uses the label Shader Engine (SE), whereas Nvidia calls theirs Graphics Processing Clusters (GPC) \u2013 different names, same role.\n\nThe reason for this partitioning of the chip is simple: the command processing units just can't handle everything, as it would end up being far too large and complex. So it makes sense to push some of the scheduling and organization duties further down the line. It also means each separation partition can be doing something completely independent of the others \u2013 so one could be handling a raft of graphics shaders, while the others are grinding through long, complex compute shaders.\nIn the case of RDNA 2, each SE contains its own set of fixed function units: circuits that are designed to do one specific task, that typically can't be heavily adjusted by a programmer.\n\nPrimitive Setup unit \u2013 gets vertices ready for processing, as well as generating more (tessellation) and culling them\nRasterizer \u2013 converts the 3D world of triangles into a 2D grid of pixels\nRender Outputs (ROPs) \u2013 reads, writes, and blends pixels\n\nThe primitive setup unit runs at a rate of 1 triangle per clock cycle. This might not sound like very much but don't forget that these chips are running at anywhere between 1.8 and 2.2 GHz, so primitive setup shouldn't ever be a bottleneck for the GPU. For Ampere, the primitive unit is found in the next tier of organization, and we'll cover that shortly.\nNeither AMD nor Nvidia say too much about their rasterizers. The latter calls them Raster Engines, we know that they handle 1 triangle per clock cycle, and spit out a number of pixels, but there's no further information to hand, such as their sub-pixel precision, for example.\nEach SE in the Navi 21 chip sports 4 banks of 8 ROPs, resulting in a total of 128 render output units; Nvidia's GA102 packs 2 banks of 8 ROPs per GPC, so the full chip sports 112 units. This might seem that AMD has the advantage here, because more ROPs means more pixels can be processed per clock. But such units need good access to cache and local memory, and we'll say more about that later in this article. For now, let's continue looking at how the SE/GPC partitions are further divided.\n\nAMD's Shader Engines are sub-partitioned in what they term Dual Compute Units (DCUs), with the Navi 21 chip fielding ten DCUs per SE \u2013 note that in some documents, they're also classed as Workgroup Processors (WGP). In the case of Ampere and the GA102, they're called Texture Processing Clusters (TPCs), with each GPU containing 6 TPCs. Every cluster in Nvidia's design houses something called a Polymorph Engine \u2013 essentially, Ampere's primitive setup units.\nThey too run at a rate of 1 triangle per clock, and although Nvidia's GPUs are clocked lower than AMD's, they have a lot more TPCs than Navi 21 has SEs. So for the same clock speed, the GA102 should have a notable advantage as the complete chip holds 42 primitive setup units, whereas AMD's new RDNA 2 has just 4. But since there are six TPCs per Raster Engine, the GA102 effectively has 7 complete primitive systems, to the Navi 21's four. Since the latter isn't clocked 75% higher than the former, it would seem that Nvidia takes a clear lead here, when it comes to geometry handling (though no game is likely to be limited in this area).\nThe final tier of the chips' organization are the Compute Units (CUs) in RDNA 2 and the Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) in Ampere \u2013 the production lines of our GPU factories.\n\nThese are very much the meat-and-vegetables in the GPU pie, as these hold all of the highly programmable units used to process graphics, compute, and now ray tracing shaders. As you can see in the above image, each one takes up a very small portion of the overall die space, but they are still extremely complex and highly important to the overall performance of the chip.\nUp to now, there hasn't been any serious deal-breakers, when it comes to how everything is laid out and organized in the two GPUs \u2013 the nomenclature is all different, but their functions are much the same. And because so much of what they do is limited by programmability and flexibility, any advantages one has over the other, just comes down to a sense of scale, i.e. which one has the most of that particular thing.\nBut with the CUs and SMs, AMD and Nvidia take different approaches to how they go about processing shaders. In some areas, they share a lot in common, but there are plenty of others where that's not the case.\n\nCounting cores the Nvidia way\nSince Ampere ventured into the wild before RDNA 2, we'll take a look at Nvidia's SMs first. There's no point in looking at images of the die itself now, as they can't tell us exactly what's inside them, so let's use an organization diagram. These aren't supposed to be representations of how the various components are physically arranged in the chip, just how many of each type are present.\nWhere Turing was a substantial change to its desktop predecessor Pascal (losing a stack of FP64 units and registers, but gaining tensor cores and ray tracing), Ampere is actually a fairly mild update \u2013 on face value, at least. As far as Nvidia's marketing division was concerned, though, the new design more than doubled the number of CUDA cores in each SM.\n\nIn Turing, the Streaming Multiprocessors contain four partitions (sometimes called processing blocks), where each house 16x INT32 and 16x FP32 logic units. These circuits are designed to carry out very specific mathematical operations on 32-bit data values: the INT units handled integers, and the FP units worked on floating point, i.e. decimal, numbers.\nNvidia states that an Ampere SM has a total of 128 CUDA cores, but strictly speaking, this isn't true \u2013 or if we must stick to this count, then so too did Turing. The INT32 units in that chip could actually handle float values, but only in a very small number of simple operations. For Ampere, Nvidia has opened the range of floating point math operations they support to match the other FP32 units. That means the total number of CUDA cores per SM hasn't really changed; it's just that half of them now have more capability.\nAll of the cores in each SM partition processes the same instruction at any one time, but since the INT/FP units can operate independently, the Ampere SM can handle up to 128x FP32 calculations per cycle or 64x FP32 and 64x INT32 operations together. In Turing, it was just the latter.\nSo the new GPU has, potentially, double the FP32 output than its predecessor. For compute workloads, especially in professional applications, this is a big step forward; but for games, the benefits will be far more muted. This was evident when we first tested the GeForce RTX 3080, which uses a GA102 chip with 68 SMs enabled.\n\nDespite having a peak FP32 throughput 121% over the GeForce 2080 Ti, it only averages a 31% increase in frame rates. So why is all that compute power going to waste? The simple answer is that it's not, but games aren't running FP32 instructions all the time.\nWhen Nvidia released Turing in 2018, they pointed out that on average about a 36% of the instructions processed by a GPU involved INT32 routines. These calculations are typically run for working out memory addresses, comparisons between two values, and logic flow/control.\n\nSo for those operations, the dual rate FP32 feature doesn't come into play, as the units with the two data pathways can only do integer or floating point. And an SM partition will only switch to this mode if all 32 threads, being handled by it at the time, have the same FP32 operation lined up to be processed. In all other cases, the partitions in Ampere operate just as they do in Turing.\nThis means the likes of the GeForce RTX 3080 only has a 11% FP32 advantage over the 2080 Ti, when operating in INT+FP mode. This is why the actual performance increase seen in games isn't as high as the raw figures suggest it should be.\nOther improvements? There are fewer Tensor Cores per SM partition, but each one is a lot more capable than those in Turing. These circuits perform a very specific calculations (such as multiply two FP16 values and accumulate the answer with another FP16 number), and each core now does 32 of these operations per cycle.\n\nThey also support a new feature called Fine-Grained Structured Sparsity and without going into the details of it all, essentially it means the math rate can be doubled, by pruning out data that doesn't affect the answer. Again, this is good news for professionals working with neural networks and AI, but at the moment, there's no significant benefit for game developers.\nThe ray tracing cores have also been tweaked: they can now work independently of the CUDA cores, so while they're doing BVH traversal or ray-primitive intersection math, the rest of the SM can still be processing shaders. The part of the RT Core that handles the testing of whether or not a ray intersects a primitive has doubled in performance, too.\n\nThe RT Cores also sport additional hardware to help apply ray tracing to motion blur, but this feature is currently only exposed through Nvidia's proprietary Optix API.\nThere are other tweaks, but the overall approach has been one of sensible but steady evolution, rather than a major new design. But given that there was nothing particularly wrong with Turing's raw capabilities in the first place, it's not surprising to see this.\nSo what about AMD \u2013 what have they done to the Compute Units in RDNA 2?\nTracing the rays fantastic\nOn face value, AMD haven't changed much about the Compute Units \u2013 they still contain two sets of an SIMD32 vector unit, an SISD scalar unit, textures units, and a stack of various caches. There's been some changes regarding what data types and associated math operations they can do, and we'll say more about those in a moment. The most notable change for the general consumer is that AMD now offer hardware acceleration for specific routines within ray tracing.\nThis part of the CU performs ray-box or ray-triangle intersection checks \u2013 the same as the RT Cores in Ampere. However, the latter also accelerates BVH traversal algorithms, whereas in RDNA 2 this is done via compute shaders using the SIMD 32 units.\n\nNo matter how many shader cores one has or how high their clock rates are, going with customized circuits that are designed to do just one job is always going to be better than a generalized approach. This is why GPUs were invented in the first place: everything in the world of rendering can be done using a CPU, but their general nature makes them unsuitable for this.\nThe RA units are next to the texture processors, because they're actually part of the same structure. Back in July 2019, we reported on the appearance of a patent filed by AMD which detailed using a 'hybrid' approach to handling the key algorithms in ray tracing...\n\nWhile this system does offer greater flexibility and removes the need to have portions of the die doing nothing when there's ray tracing workload, AMD's first implementation of this does have some drawbacks. The most notable of which is that the texture processors can only handle operations involving textures or ray-primitive intersections at any one time.\nGiven that Nvidia's RT Cores now operate fully independently of the rest of the SM, this would seem to give Ampere a distinct lead, compared to RNDA 2, when it comes to grinding through the acceleration structures and intersection tests required in ray tracing.\nAlthough we've only briefly examined the ray tracing performance in AMD's latest graphics cards, so far we did find that the impact of the use of ray tracing was very dependent on the game being played.\n\nIn Gears 5, for example, the Radeon RX 6800 (which uses a 60 CU variant of the Navi 21 GPU) only took a 17% frame rate hit, whereas in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, this rose to an average loss of 52%. In comparison, Nvidia's RTX 3080 (using a 68 SM GA102) saw average frame rate losses of 23% and 40% respectively, in the two games.\nA more detailed analysis of ray tracing is needed to say anything more about AMD's implementation, but as a first iteration of the technology, it does appear to be competitive but sensitive to what application is doing the ray tracing.\nAs previously mentioned, the Compute Units in RDNA 2 now support more data types; the most notable inclusions are the low precision data types such as INT4 and INT8. These are used for tensor operations in machine learning algorithms and while AMD have a separate architecture (CDNA) for AI and data centers, this update is for use with DirectML.\n\nThis API is a recent addition to Microsoft's DirectX 12 family and the combination of hardware and software will provide better acceleration for denoising in ray tracing and temporal upscaling algorithms. In the case of the latter, Nvidia have their own, of course, called DLSS. Their system uses the Tensor Cores in the SM to perform part of the calculations, but given that a similar process can be constructed via DirectML, it might seem that these units are somewhat redundant. However, in both Turing and Ampere, the Tensor Cores also handle all math operations involving FP16 data formats.\nWith RDNA 2, such calculations are done using the shader units, using packed data formats, i.e. each 32-bit vector register holds two 16-bit ones. So which is the better approach? AMD labels their SIMD32 units as vector processors, because they issue one instruction for multiple data values.\nEach vector unit contains 32 Stream Processors, and since each one of these just works on a single piece of data, the actual operations themselves are scalar in nature. This is essentially the same as an SM partition in Ampere, where each processing block also carries one instruction on 32 data values.\nBut where a entire SM in Nvidia's design can process up to 128 FP32 FMA calculations per cycle (fused multiply-add), a single RDNA 2 Compute Unit only does 64. Using FP16 raises this to 128 FMA per cycle, which is the same as Ampere's Tensor Cores when doing standard FP16 math.\nNvidia's SMs can process instructions to handle integer and float values at the same time (e.g. 64 FP32 and 64 INT32), and has independent units for FP16 operations, tensor math, and ray tracing routines. AMD's CUs do the majority of the workload on the SIMD32 units, although they do have separate scalar units that support simple integer math.\nSo it would seem that Ampere has the edge here: the GA102 has more SMs than Navi 21 has CUs, and they're packing a bigger punch, when it comes to peak throughput, flexibility, and features on offer. But AMD has a rather nice trick card up their sleeve.\n\nFeeding those hungry hungry hippos\nMemory system, multi-level caches\nHaving a GPU with thousands of logic units, all blazing their way through fancy math, is all well and good \u2013 but they'd be floundering at sea if they couldn't be fed quickly enough, with the instructions and data they require. Both designs sport a wealth of multi-level caches, boasting huge amounts of bandwidth.\nLet's take a look at Ampere's first. Overall there have been some notable changes internally. The amount of Level 2 cache has increased by 50% (the Turing TU102 sported 4096 kB respectively), and the Level 1 caches in each SM have both doubled in size.\n\nAs before, Ampere's L1 caches are configurable, in terms of how much cache space can be allocated for data, textures, or general compute use. However, for graphics shaders (e.g. vertex, pixel) and asynchronous compute, the cache is actually set to:\n\n64 kB for data and textures\n48 kB for shared general memory\n16 kB reserved for specific operations\n\nOnly when running in full compute mode, does the L1 become fully configurable. On the plus side, the amount of bandwidth available has also doubled, as the cache can now read/write 128 bytes per clock (although there's no word on whether or not the latency has been improved, too).\nThe rest of the internal memory system has remained the same in Ampere, but when we move just outside the GPU, there's a nice surprise in store for us. Nvidia partnered with Micron, a DRAM manufacturer, to use a modified version of GDDR6 for their local memory needs. This is still essentially GDDR6 but the data bus has been entirely replaced. Rather than using a conventional 1 bit per pin set up, where the signal just bounces very rapidly between two voltages (aka PAM), GDDR6X uses four voltages:\n\nPAM2 in GDDR6 (top) vs PAM4 in GDDR6X (bottom)\nWith this change, GDDR6X effectively transfers 2 bits of data per pin, per cycle \u2013 so for the same clock speed and pin count, the bandwidth is doubled. The GeForce RTX 3090 sports 24 GDDR6X modules, running in single channel mode and rated to 19 Gbps, giving a peak transfer bandwidth of 936 GB/s.\nThat's an increase of 52% over the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti and not something to be dismissed lightly. Such bandwidth figures have only been achieved in the past by using the likes of HBM2, which can be costly to implement, when compared to GDDR6.\nHowever, only Micron makes this memory and the use of PAM4 adds additional complexity to the production process, requiring far tighter tolerances with the signalling. AMD went down a different route \u2013 instead of turning to an outside agency for help, they used their CPU division to bring something new to the table. The overall memory system in RDNA 2 hasn't changed much compared to its predecessor \u2013 there are only two major changes.\n\nEach Shader Engine now has two sets of Level 1 caches, but as they are now sporting two banks of Dual Compute Units (RDNA just had the one), this alteration is to be expected. But shoehorning 128 MB of Level 3 cache into the GPU? That surprised a lot of people. Utilizing the SRAM design for the L3 cache found in their EPYC-range of Zen 2 server chips, AMD have embedded two sets of 64 MB high-density cache into the chip. Data transactions are handled by 16 sets of interfaces, each shifting 64 bytes per clock cycle.\nThe so-called Infinity Cache has its own clock domain, and can run at up 1.94 GHz, giving a peak internal transfer bandwidth of 1986.6 GB/s. And because it's not external DRAM, the latencies involved are exceptionally low. Such cache is perfect for storing ray tracing acceleration structures and since BVH traversal involves a lot of data checking, the Infinity Cache should notably help with this.\n\nTwo 64 MB strips of Infinity Cache and the Infinity Fabric system\nAt the moment, it's not clear if the Level 3 cache in RDNA 2 operates in the same way as in a Zen 2 CPU: i.e. as a Level 2 victim cache. Normally, when the last level of cache needs to be cleared to make room for new data, any new requests for that information will have to go to the DRAM.\nA victim cache stores data that's been flagged for removal from the next tier of memory, and with 128 MB of it to hand, the Infinity Cache could potentially store 32 complete sets of L2 cache. This system results in less demand being placed on the GDDR6 controllers and DRAM.\nOlder GPU designs by AMD have struggled with a lack of internal bandwidth, especially as once their clock speeds were ramped up, but the extra cache will go a long way to making this issue fade into the background.\n\nSo which design is better here? The use of GDDR6X gives the GA102 enormous bandwidth to the local memory, and the larger caches will help reduce the impact of cache misses (which stall the processing of a thread). Navi 21's massive Level 3 cache means the DRAM doesn't have to tapped as often, and leverages the ability to run the GPU at higher clock speeds without data starvation.\nAMD's decision to stick with GDDR6 means there are more sources of memory available for third party vendors, meanwhile any company making a GeForce RTX 3080 or 3090 will have to use Micron. And while GDDR6 comes in a variety of modules densities, GDDR6X is currently limited to 8 Gb.\nThe cache system within RDNA 2 is arguably a better approach than that used in Ampere, as using multiple levels of on-die SRAM will always provide lower latencies, and better performance for a given power envelope, than external DRAM, regardless of the latter's bandwidth.\n\nThe ins and outs of a GPU\nRendering pipelines\nBoth architectures feature a raft of updates to the front and back ends of their rendering pipelines. Ampere and RDNA 2 fully sport mesh shaders and variable rate shaders in DirectX12 Ultimate, although Nvidia's chip does have more geometry performance thanks to its greater number of processors for these tasks.\nWhile the use of mesh shaders will enable developers to create ever more realistic environments, no game is ever going to have its performance be entirely bound to this stage in the rendering process. This is because the bulk of the hardest work is at the pixel or ray tracing stages.\n\nThis is where the use of variable rate shaders come into play \u2013 basically, the process involves apply shaders for lighting and color on a block of pixels, rather than individual ones. It's akin to decreasing the resolution of the game in order to improve performance, but since it can be applied to just selected regions, the loss in visual quality isn't readily apparent.\nBut both architectures have also been given an update to their render output units (ROPs), as this will improve performance at high resolutions, whether or not variable rate shaders are used. In all previous generations of their GPUs, Nvidia tied the ROPs to the memory controllers and Level 2 cache.\nIn Turing, eight ROP units (collectively called a partition) were directly linked to one controller and a 512 kB slice of the cache. Adding more ROPs creates a problem, as it requires more controllers and cache, so for Ampere, the ROPs are now entirely allocated to a GPC. The GA102 sports 12 ROPs per GPC (each one processing 1 pixel per clock cycle), giving a total of 112 units for the full chip.\nAMD follows a similar system to Nvidia's old approach (i.e. tied to a memory controller and L2 cache slice), although their ROPs are primarily use the Level 1 cache for pixel read/writes and blending. In the Navi 21 chip, they've been given a much needed update and each ROP partition now handles 8 pixels per cycle in 32-bit color, and 4 pixels in 64-bit.\nSomething else that Nvidia have brought to the table with Ampere is RTX IO \u2013 a data handling system that allows the GPU to directly access the storage drive, copy across the data it needs, and then decompress it using the CUDA cores. At the moment, though, the system can't be used in any game, because Nvidia are using the DirectStorage API (another DirectX12 enhancement) to control it and that's not ready for public release yet.\n\nThe methods used at the moment involve having the CPU manage all this: it receives the data request from the GPU drivers, copies the data from the storage drive to the system memory, decompresses it, and then copies it across to the graphics card's DRAM.\nBesides the fact that this involves a lot of wasted copying, the mechanism is serial in nature \u2013 the CPU processes one request at a time. Nvidia are claiming figures such as \"100x data throughput\" and \"20x lower CPU utilization,\" but until the system can be tested in the real world, such figures can't be examined further.\n\nWhen AMD introduced RDNA 2 and the new Radeon RX 6000 graphics cards, they launched something called Smart Access Memory. This is not their answer to Nvidia's RTX IO \u2013 in fact, it's not even really a new feature. By default, the PCI Express controller in the CPU can address up to 256 MB of the graphics card's memory, per individual access request.\nThis value is set by the size of the base address register (BAR) and as far back as 2008, there has been an optional feature in the PCI Express 2.0 specification to allow it be resized. The benefit of this is that fewer access requests have to be processed in order to address the whole of the card's DRAM.\nThe function requires support by the operating system, CPU, motherboard, GPU, and its drivers. At present, on Windows PCs, the system is limited to a specific combination of Ryzen 5000 CPUs, 500 series motherboards, and Radeon RX 6000 graphics cards.\n\nThis simple feature gave some startling results when we tested it \u2013 performance boosts of 15% at 4K are not to be dismissed lightly, so it should come as no surprise that Nvidia have said that they'll be offering the feature for the RTX 3000 range at some point in the near future.\nWhether or not resizable BAR support is rolled out for other platform combinations remains to be seen, but its use is certainly welcome, even though it's not an architectural feature of Ampere/RDNA 2 as such.\nVideo killed the radio star\nMultimedia engine, video output\nThe GPU world is normally dominated by core count, TFLOPS, GB/s, and other headline-grabbing metrics, but thanks to the rise of YouTube content creators and live gaming streams, the display and multimedia engine capabilities are also of considerable note.\nThe demand for ultra high refresh rates, at all resolutions, has grown as the price of monitors supporting such features has dropped. Two years ago, a 144 Hz 4K 27\" HDR monitor would have set you back $2,000; today, you can get something similar for almost half the price.\nBoth architectures provide a display output via HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4a. The former offers more signal bandwidth, but they're both rated for 4K at 240 Hz with HDR and 8K at 60 Hz. This is achieved by using either 4:2:0 chroma subsampling or DSC 1.2a. These are video signal compression algorithms, which provide a significant reduction in bandwidth requirements, without too much loss of visual quality. Without them, even HDMI 2.1's peak bandwidth of 6 GB/s wouldn't be enough to transmit 4K images at a rate of 6 Hz.\n\nThe 48\" LG CK OLED 'monitor' \u2013 4K at 120 Hz needs HDMI 2.1\nAmpere and RDNA 2 also support variable refresh rate systems (FreeSync for AMD, G-Sync for Nvidia) and when it comes to the encoding and decoding of video signals, there's no discernable difference here either.\nNo matter which processor you look at, you'll find support for 8K AV1, 4K H.264, and 8K H.265 decoding, although exactly how well they both perform in such situations hasn't been thoroughly examined yet. Neither company gives much detail about the actual innards of their display and multimedia engines. As important as they are these days, it's still the rest of the GPU that garners all of the attention.\n\nDifferent strokes for different folks\nBuilt for compute, built for gaming\nEnthusiasts of GPU history will know that AMD and Nvidia used to take rather different approaches to their architectural choices and configurations. But as 3D graphics have become increasingly dominated by the compute world and the homogenization of APIs, their overall designs have been increasingly similar.\nAnd rather than the demands of rendering in today's games setting the tone for the architectures, it's the market sectors that the GPU industry has expanded into that's steering the direction. At the time of writing, Nvidia has three chips using the Ampere technology: the GA100, GA102, and GA104.\n\nThe GA104 can be found in the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti\nThe last one is simply a cut-down version of the GA102 \u2013 it simply has fewer TPCs per GPC (and one less GPU overall) and two thirds the Level 2 cache. Everything else is exactly the same. The GA100, on the other hand, is a different beast altogether.\nIt has no RT Cores and no CUDA cores with INT32+FP32 support; instead it packs in a raft of additional FP64 units, more load/store systems, and an enormous amount of L1/L2 cache. It also has no display or multimedia engine whatsoever; this is because it's designed entirely for large scale compute clusters for AI and data analytics.\nThe GA102/104, though, need to cover every other market that Nvidia targets: gaming enthusiasts, professional graphics artists and engineers, and small scale AI and compute work. Ampere needs to be a 'jack of all trades' and a master of all of them \u2013 no easy task.\n\nThe 750 mm2 Arcturus CDNA monster\nRDNA 2 was designed for just gaming, in PCs and consoles, although it could just as well turn its hand to the same areas as Ampere sells in. However, AMD chose to keep their GCN architecture going and update it for the demands of today's professional clients.\nWhere RDNA 2 has spawned 'Big Navi', CDNA could be said to have spawned 'Big Vega' - the Instinct MI100 houses their Arcturus chip, a 50 billion transistor GPU that sports 128 Compute Units. And like Nvidia's GA100, it too contains no display nor multimedia engines.\nAlthough Nvidia heavily dominates the professional market with Quadro and Tesla models, the likes of the Navi 21 simply are not aimed at competing against these and has been designed accordingly. So does that make RDNA 2 the better architecture; does the requirement for Ampere to fit into multiple markets constrain it in any way?\nWhen you look at the evidence, the answer would appear to be: no.\n\nAMD will be releasing the Radeon RX 6900 XT soon, which uses a complete Navi 21 (no CUs disabled), which may perform as well as the GeForce RTX 3090 or better. But the GA102 in that card isn't fully enabled either, so Nvidia always have the option to update that model with a 'Super' version, as they did with Turing last year.\nIt could be argued that because RDNA 2 is being used in the Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5, game developers are going to favor that architecture will their game engines. But you only have to look at when GCN was used in the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 to see how this is likely to play out.\nThe first release of the former, in 2013, used a GPU built around the GCN 1.0 architecture \u2013 a design that didn't appear in desktop PC graphics cards until the following year. The Xbox One X, released in 2017, used GCN 2.0, a mature design was already over 3 years old by then.\n\nSo did all games made for the Xbox One or PS4 that got ported over to the PC automatically run better on AMD graphics cards? They did not. So we can't assume that this time will be different with RDNA 2, despite its impressive feature set.\nBut none of this ultimately matters, as both GPU designs are exceptionally capable and marvels of what can be achieved in semiconductor fabrication. Nvidia and AMD bring different tools to the bench, because they're trying to crack different problems; Ampere aims to be all things to all people, RDNA 2 is mostly about gaming.\nThis time round, the battle has drawn to a stalemate, even though each can claim victory in a specific area or two. The GPU wars will continue throughout next year, and a new combatant will enter the fray: Intel, with their Xe series of chips. At least we won't have to wait another two years to see how that fight runs its course!\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3090 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 6800 XT on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 6800 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3070 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 28\n\n\n Got something to say?

It will also provide support through the NVIDIA Inception Program, a virtual incubator for startups; NVIDIA\u2019s Deep Learning Institute, which provides hands-on and remote AI training; NVIDIA\u2019s AI Tech Center, for joint applied AI research; and NVIDIA partner ecosystem, to accelerate applications that can be adopted by the Thai government.\nThrough the collaboration, the consortium will be engaged in NVIDIA AI Nations partnerships, support the adoption of NVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing platforms, and explore the \u00a0potential of connecting NVIDIA DGX AI supercomputers across Thailand to function as a more powerful virtualised AI supercomputer capable of solving even more complex problems.\nOther potential collaborations include advancing Thailand\u2019s Smart Cities initiative by leveraging NVIDIA\u2019s DGX, EGX, Metropolis and Clara Guardian platforms; and utilizing partner ecosystems to improve the quality of urban life, protect the health of citizens and support the re-activation of business in a post-COVID age.\nThe partners may also introduce a national AI skills development initiative delivered through the universities to cultivate the next generation of AI leaders in Thailand\nGolden Opportunity for Thai Researchers and Startups\n\u201cToday is a special day for me to be able to witness and help drive Thailand\u2019s digital and AI innovations onto the world stage via the network of NVIDIA, the manufacturer of the GPU machine that is the heart of the world\u2019s AI technology.\u00a0 Several Thailand\u2019s leading research universities join forces to work together in driving innovation at a national level. This collaboration will help our country to become more powerful and develop at a much faster pace than ever before,\u201d said Associate Professor Dr Siree Chaiseri, director, Program Management Unit for Competitiveness (PMU C) MHESI. \u201cThis cooperation between the leading Thai and international researchers, and the support and participation of many leading private companies and institutions, is no doubt a golden opportunity for the Thai researchers and startups to move onto the world stage and create commercial values to the Thai digital economy.\u201d\nKeith Strier, World Wide Vice President for NVIDIA AI Nations Initiatives, said: \u201cAI can greatly transform many industries. It can make our transportation systems safer and more efficient, aid in breakthrough scientific discoveries, and help medical professionals provide better care for more people. Being the first in Southeast Asia to be part of NVIDIA\u2019s AI Nations initiative shows the country\u2019s vision and desire to excel in the AI era. As the leader in AI, NVIDIA will do our part to help the nation achieve its goal of having a world-class infrastructure for researchers and nurture a new generation of IT talents.\u201d\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0NVDA) is the AI computing company. Its invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined modern computer graphics and revolutionised parallel computing. More recently, GPU deep learning ignited modern AI \u2013 the next era of computing \u2013 with the GPU acting as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world.

The stated reason? Spending too little time focusing on RTX ray tracing, as opposed to raster performance. Hardware Unboxed, apparently, did \"not see things the same way that we (Nvidia), gamers, and the rest of the industry do.\"\n\nAs most of you know, Hardware Unboxed is Steve and Tim's YouTube channel, and both Steve and Tim have been long time TechSpot partners. To this day, our publications collaborate and share the same PC enthusiast DNA that we forged together over nearly two decades. At TechSpot, we are proud hosts of their work for written versions of their latest reviews and analysis on CPUs, GPUs and views on the PC hardware industry as a whole. \nAs a corporation, it's Nvidia's prerogative to decide on the reviewers it chooses to collaborate with. However, this and other related incidents raise serious questions around journalistic independence and what they are expecting of reviewers when they are sent products for an unbiased opinion. As an independent tech publication, we've spent the past 20+ years providing objective and informative content. Hardware Unboxed tech reviews are comprehensive. They're meant to inform consumers about every aspect of a particular product, so you know exactly what you're getting before making a purchasing decision.\n\nNvidia have officially decided to ban us from receiving GeForce Founders Edition GPU review samples\n\nTheir reasoning is that we are focusing on rasterization instead of ray tracing.\n\nThey have said they will revisit this \"should your editorial direction change\".\n\nMore to come\n--- Hardware Unboxed (@HardwareUnboxed) December 11, 2020\nIn today's dynamic graphics hardware space, with 350W flagships, hardware ray tracing, and exotic cooling solutions, there's a wide range of data points HUB looks at. But at the end of the day, there's only one real question every GPU buyer wants to know: how well do games run on a particular piece of hardware? Considering that 99% percent of Steam games feature raster-only rendering pipelines, rasterization performance was, is, and will be, a key point that Steve considers in GPU reviews.\nRay tracing is becoming increasingly important. AMD outfitted both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S with hardware ray accelerators, and we've seen remarkable ray-traced visuals in games like Spiderman: Miles Morales on PlayStation 5 and the upcoming Forza Motorsport on Xbox Series X/S. While performance isn't really where it ought to be (even with the help DLSS), Cyberpunk 2077 delivers a jaw-dropping vision of the next-gen on PC, with RTX effects dialed all the way up.\nHowever, most games (including almost all RTX titles) are built on raster renderers. A hypothetical graphics card with most of its die space reserved for ray tracing would run Quake II RTX great and... not much else. Ray tracing absolutely deserves a place in modern GPU reviews. But there's simply not enough of it in enough games for any responsible reviewer to put it center-stage, in place of raster performance. It wouldn't do justice to consumers, who will primarily be running raster workloads. This is why Nvidia's complaint is so puzzling.\n\nThank you everyone for the support, while reading comments and stories I realized that I reviewed my first Nvidia GeForce product exactly 20 years ago, the GeForce2 GTS supplied by Nvidia. So, they just ended a 20-year working relationship and for what?\n--- Hardware Unboxed (@HardwareUnboxed) December 11, 2020\nIn his email to Steve, Nvidia Senior PR Manager Bryan Del Rizzo says that \"Nvidia is all-in for ray tracing,\" and \"despite all this progress, your GPU reviews and recommendations have continued to focus singularly on rasterization performance and you have largely discounted all of the other technologies we offer gamers.\" Del Rizzo goes on to state that \"you do not see things the same way that we, gamers, and the rest of the industry do.\" \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n YouTube at 20 \n\n\n\nThis statement is particularly ironic and obnoxious. On Nvidia's landing page for DLSS, the GPU manufacturer literally uses a Hardware Unboxed quote (\"Extremely impressive\") to promote their AI upscaling technology. Our initial look at DLSS in Battlefield V revealed a technology that was in dire need of improvement. Two years later, we revisited DLSS 2.0 in Control and Wolfenstein Youngblood and recognized the tremendous improvement Nvidia made to this technology. Claiming HUB \"doesn't see things the same way\" is disingenuous, to say the least. As an objective reviewer, it's Steve's responsibility to its viewers and readers to see things the way they are, which may not always coincide with the way Nvidia sees them.\nTrust and objectivity are critical for any successful reviewer. Not every graphics card is a winner. Some, like the Radeon VII and the GeForce GT 1030 DDR4, were just plain awful. Not every graphics technology is a game-changer either.\n\nI have something else to say about NVIDIA's latest decision to shoot both its feet: They've now made it so that any reviewers covering RT will become subject to scrutiny from untrusting viewers who will suspect subversion by the company.\n\nShortsighted self-own from NVIDIA.\n--- GamersNexus (@GamersNexus) December 11, 2020\nClearly, reviewers know this is no isolated incidence, but it was very arrogant of Nvidia to write an entire email explaining you could either get in line with their views, or else.\nA decade ago, Nvidia's hardware PhysX acceleration was touted as a revolution, enabling advanced destruction, fluid dynamics, and particle simulation in games like Arkham City and Metro: 2033. Back in 2010, we included PhysX benchmarks in our review of Mafia II. AnandTech, Tom's Hardware, and other outlets also extensively covered PhysX. However, it was never made out to be more important than raster performance. There were raster benchmarks, more raster benchmarks with anti-aliasing enabled, and then a PhysX test. There's a clear, consistent thread here from PhysX to RTX: HUB and TechSpot give GPU technologies the amount of coverage we believe they need for consumers to make an informed choice.\n\nIt's even more trouble (and out of touch, as JayZTwoCents describes it), when Del Rizzo alludes to how Hardware Unboxed and other outlets \"benefit\" from GPU review units, in contrast to customers. Del Rizzo states the obvious here, that customers \"don't get free GPUs, they work hard for their money.\" Setting aside the fact that HUB's detailed reviews often take several days and weeks to put together, this statement misses the forest for the trees. Yes, most review outlets get units from hardware vendors. But they get these on the understanding that their reviews will reach hundreds of thousands of potential customers, who are looking for trusted information.\nIt'd be hard to assess exactly how many people purchased a GeForce RTX graphics card after watching one of HUB's several RTX reviews \u2013 between TechSpot and HUB combined, we estimate in the thousands \u2013 but it's certainly worth more than the cost of a single graphics card. But, ultimately, that's not what's at play here...\nAttacking press freedom is always a lose-lose-lose scenario: reviewers, customers, and businesses are all impacted negatively. Shortly after Steve went public with Nvidia's email, he's seen overwhelming support from the tech community. Not just fans of Hardware Unboxed, or viewers and readers, but numerous tech outlets who understand that this is not just about Steve or Hardware Unboxed, but it's about principle.\nClearly, reviewers know this is no isolated incidence, but it was very arrogant of Nvidia to write an entire email explaining you could either get in line with their views, or else. This could have happened to any other outlet. In fact, it has happened to many of them already, but either to a lesser extent or handled in a way that Nvidia (or any other big tech company) simply played the part of ignoring the reviewer without ever giving them any explanation.\nLess than 48 hours later, Steve received the good news.\nNvidia apologized and walked everything back. Great news indeed, but let's be clear this wouldn't have happened if not for the support of the community at large and key people in the tech space that have such an enormous influence that it was too much for Nvidia to ignore. Linus from LinusTechTips (his angry rant on the WAN Show embedded above is pure gold) and Steve from Gamers Nexus, were two of those persons.\nOur own Steve Walton (HUB) was the one living this whole situation close to his chest for the past few days and he's expected to upload a video soon with his recount (now live).\n\nBIG NEWS\n\nI just received an email from Nvidia apologizing for the previous email & they've now walked everything back.\n\nThis thing has been a roller coaster ride over the past few days. I'd like to thank everyone who supported us, obviously a huge thank you to @linusgsebastian\n--- Hardware Unboxed (@HardwareUnboxed) December 12, 2020\nThings really don't need to be this hard. At the end of the day, reviewers, customers (and \"the rest of the industry\") all want the same things. We want Nvidia, AMD, Intel (and heck, even Apple!) to produce great hardware that can do justice to the next generation of games and computing. There is so much to look forward to in the coming years.\nWe're going to continue to take a broad, holistic view so that every technology that we cover gets its fair space. As Nvidia said, consumers work hard for their money. We just want to make sure you know what you're spending it on.\n\n\n\n\n 170 comments\n \n3.6K likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nSony's advanced RGB LED aims to rival OLED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamsung CEO warns of \"do-or-die\" situation for the company\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

There were two sides to the coin in this case, the first being the incredible power and performance uplift provided by these GPUs, which was quite frankly startling. But the flipside was that this astonishing feat was tainted by severe stock issues and failing to meet customer demand for these graphics cards by a long shot.Naturally, there was more to 2020 than Ampere GPUs, and Nvidia also made a highly impressive breakthrough on the audio front \u2013 as well as an eye-opening acquisition which could have massive repercussions for the tech world. Let\u2019s explore all this in more detail, before looking at what next year could potentially hold for Team Green.Where to buy an Nvidia RTX 3080We'll show you how to build a PCThese are the\u00a0best gaming laptops(Image credit: Future)Amping things upNvidia\u2019s headline move for 2020 was the introduction of Ampere graphics cards, otherwise known as the RTX 3000 series.Initially, three GPUs were revealed in September: the RTX 3090, the flagship RTX 3080 and RTX 3070, all launching in September except for the RTX 3070 which followed in October. The RTX 3060 Ti came later in December.So, there are two major talking points here: performance and availability. Nvidia certainly excelled in the former category, with RTX 3000 GPUs representing a huge leap forward over last-gen Turing cards.In our review, we were particularly impressed with the most recent offering, Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3060 Ti, which punches way above its weight, and in certain scenarios outdoes the RTX 2080 Super.There\u2019s no more clear summary of how good Ampere is than looking at our best graphics cards roundup \u2013 Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3000 GPUs hold four out of the top five spots at the time of writing (the only AMD product in that top five is in fourth place, the Radeon RX 5600 XT, which still wins the price-performance battle for 1080p gamers).Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Nvidia also completely owned AMD when it came to ray tracing. While the initial Big Navi cards launched by AMD late in the year proved worthy competitors in terms of raw performance, even at the high-end \u2013 if still not quite there, though AMD\u2019s RX 6800 is a compelling value proposition compared to the RTX 3070 \u2013 they fell flat in ray tracing. And while some folks will certainly argue that they can live without ray-traced sparklies in their gaming visuals, it\u2019s pretty clear which way the industry is headed, just look at the new consoles.So, while there can be no doubt that Ampere was a major victory for Nvidia in 2020, the problems cropped up when it came to availability. As soon as the various RTX 3000 models hit the shelves in their staggered launch from September onwards, they sold out in a flash.And because of the low stock levels of GPUs, and huge demand, the problem was exacerbated by scalpers and bots stealing away sales \u2013 buying graphics cards just to resell them for extortionate prices on the likes of eBay.This has caused a lot of frustration for would-be RTX 3000 buyers, who are having to scour web forums and keep their ears to the ground online \u2013 or check the likes of our current stock guides \u2013 in order to pounce when small amounts of new Ampere graphics cards drip onto the market. Nvidia has already admitted that stock issues will remain a problem until 2021, and possibly several months into the year, unfortunately.All this left the door wide open for AMD Big Navi to come in and benefit from a whole load of hungry gamers wanting a new high-end graphics card, but as luck would have it \u2013 at least from Nvidia\u2019s perspective \u2013 AMD stock problems have been just as bad, or indeed even worse from what we\u2019ve seen and heard.Of course, that has only compounded the frustration of consumers in terms of a great crop of graphics cards being launched from both companies, with little chance of actually getting one, unless you\u2019re very lucky, very dedicated, or willing to pay a ridiculous premium to get one from a scalper.So, Nvidia may have won the battle of the new GPUs in 2020 overall, but the real fight in actually getting cards on shelves so PC gamers could buy them was lost by both sides, sadly.(Image credit: CD Projekt Red)DLSS gets betterNvidia\u2019s RTX 3000 graphics cards made gaming in 4K resolution a realistic proposition in 2020. As we said in our review, the GeForce RTX 3070 is notable for finally bringing 4K gaming to the mainstream (and ditto for the RX 6800), costing less than half the price of what you\u2019d need to buy to get this performance in Nvidia\u2019s last-gen range (namely the RTX 2080 Ti).And as we\u2019ve already mentioned, these new Ampere GPUs also hugely increased ray tracing performance, while Cyberpunk 2077 waltzed onto the gaming scene in December to quite a bit of controversy, but it did show us just how good a full-on ray-traced game can look.So these were big developments, but really, a lot of the heavy lifting was done in another area where Nvidia made weighty strides forward in 2020 \u2013 namely with a fresh incarnation of its DLSS tech (version 2.0).DLSS allows for clever upscaling of resolution, effectively allowing your PC to run a game at a lower resolution, upscaled to a higher quality. So, for example, 4K resolution, or something which looks very much like it, can be achieved while only making 1440p demands of your graphics card. And this can further help to get the horsepower needed to turn ray tracing bells and whistles on.To take some startling examples of the difference this tech can make, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War\u00a0gets a massive up to 85% performance increase at 4K resolution thanks to DLSS 2.0. Cyberpunk 2077 runs at just 22 fps using an RTX 3090 (plus Intel Core i9-10900K) with maxed out graphics settings (4K \u2018ultra\u2019 with ray tracing on at maximum), yet turn DLSS on (in \u2018performance\u2019 mode) and it reaches 58 fps (not far off tripling the frame rate).In other words, Cyberpunk 2077 goes from pretty much unplayable on max details to smooth running by flicking that DLSS switch. There is some image quality loss in \u2018performance\u2019 mode, but make no mistake \u2013 DLSS is a fantastic innovation for this kind of scenario.Of course, the caveat is that games still have to be coded to support DLSS. And the concern we recently aired is that developers could become reliant on leveraging DLSS for playable frame rates in high-end gaming, when we have beefy Ampere \u2013 and Big Navi \u2013 graphics cards which are plenty powerful enough to do 4K with no assistance from such technology. That\u2019s something to watch as the games industry moves forward next year.(Image credit: Nvidia)Not just graphics \u2013 but audioNvidia\u2019s RTX technology isn\u2019t just about graphics, but also audio, as we saw earlier in 2020. Nvidia unleashed RTX Voice in beta form back in April, its noise canceling feature which really improves audio quality in voice or video calls made from your PC. Essentially, it very neatly filters out distracting background noises with clever AI processing tech \u2013 so when you\u2019re working from home, and your dog barks at someone walking past the window when you\u2019re on an important work-related video call, all that woofing will go unheard by your boss.It\u2019s cool to see a GPU utilized in a very different way \u2013 and a very useful one. This productivity-focused feature was \u2013 and still is \u2013 most welcome, particularly in a time when a lot of us are still working from home due to the Covid-19 pandemic.(Image credit: Nvidia)GeForce Now goes live \u2013 and a mass exodus ensuesNvidia\u2019s GeForce Now streaming service finally shed its beta tag and officially launched in February, and almost as soon as it went live, disaster after disaster followed in terms of major publishers exiting stage left.First of all, Activision Blizzard pulled all its games from GeForce Now, then Bethesda, followed by 2K Games, Xbox Game Studios and Warner Bros. That represented a whole host of big-name games which were yanked away from the platform in the first few months of GeForce Now\u2019s existence, leaving a lot of unhappy gamers. A wobbly start with the official launch indeed, although the actual service itself offered an impressively robust performance in terms of streaming.Nvidia subsequently changed the way in which games were drafted on board the streaming service, in order to avoid the licensing issues which caused all those major departures \u2013 and we then had some more positive news such as the return of Square Enix to GeForce Now.Cyberpunk 2077 was, of course, the jewel in the streaming crown, giving gamers without lesser-powered PCs the chance to enjoy this title complete with ray tracing goodness \u2013 even on a Chromebook. There were complaints at the game\u2019s launch \u2013 naturally \u2013 with long queues, and some performance issues, which was unsurprising given the rush of folks trying to play the latest and greatest game from CD Projekt Red.However, it\u2019s clear enough that behind all the hiccups \u2013 and some pretty messy fails at that \u2013 Nvidia is onto something good with GeForce Now. Hopefully when the company manages to renegotiate and get back some of those big titles which fled in the early days, the streaming offering will only get stronger and stronger.(Image credit: Nvidia)ARM and a legNvidia made a big acquisition in 2020. A huge one. As you\u2019ll likely recall, this was the purchase of ARM for $40 billion, and as we covered back when this happened in September, it\u2019s a major shift in the tech world \u2013 if the deal actually goes through.Exactly what the repercussions will be \u2013 and how the acquisition might pan out \u2013 is anyone\u2019s guess, really. But Nvidia is making promises not to rock the boat, that things will continue as they are, and ARM\u2019s neutrality will be maintained \u2013 basically trying not to scare any of ARM\u2019s big clients, as you might imagine.So yes, this is a big one \u2013 but at this point, pretty much still only a big question mark. As one analyst, Geoff Blaber of CCS Insight, stated, it\u2019s \u201cvery difficult to see how Nvidia can balance its own requirements with that of the ARM ecosystem\u201d. It still remains to be seen whether the deal will clear all regulatory hurdles globally, of course.(Image credit: Nvidia)Concluding thoughtsOn the whole, 2020 was a good year for Nvidia, with the crowning glory being its RTX 3000 graphics cards, which proved to be nothing short of some of the best GPUs ever made. The performance leap with Ampere was giant, but the equally giant stumbling block was the fact that so many people couldn\u2019t \u2013 and still can\u2019t \u2013 buy a card due to stock being thin on the ground, and demand being through the roof.That\u2019s left a bad taste in the mouths of some, and those people would surely have defected to AMD \u2013 if Big Navi graphics cards hadn\u2019t suffered the exact same problem. As it is, we\u2019re in the rather odd position where not performance, but simply availability, is likely to determine the winner of this particular battle of the GPU wars. If AMD can get its cards on the table in meaningful quantities first, it probably won\u2019t matter that they are lacking on the ray tracing front compared to Nvidia \u2013 they will still sell by the bucket load.What we can hope to see in 2021 is the resolution of stock problems for both Nvidia and AMD, and potentially fresh cards from Nvidia \u2013 an RTX 3080 Ti is again rumored (it was a while back, too), along with a lower-end RTX 3050 card (yes, it appears Nvidia is ditching GTX models entirely, and going all-in with ray tracing). The latter is particularly anticipated as a more wallet-friendly way of getting some seriously beefed-up Ampere performance.Nvidia should also have RTX 3000 laptop chips inbound at the start of 2021, and they\u2019ll probably be unveiled at CES, further powering up gaming notebooks \u2013 with the tantalizing possibility that they could be paired with AMD Ryzen 5000 mobile CPUs.The key aspect going into 2021, though, will be resolving stock issues, and if AMD beats Nvidia to the punch in that respect, it could make a wobbly start for Team Green. On a broader level, the development to watch will, of course, be whether that ARM deal actually goes through \u2013 and if so, how Nvidia\u2019s going to work the practical aspects of that acquisition.Find the best Nvidia GPU for you\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\nARM\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

This excellent GPU may actually be the most exciting entry in Nvidia\u2019s RTX 30-series yet.\nAt $400, the RTX 3060 Ti costs significantly more than the 60- and 70-class GeForce options of yesteryear (anybody remember the $330 GTX 970 and $380 GTX 1070?), continuing a trend we\u2019ve seen in recent graphics card families. But if you can look past the name, you\u2019ll find the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti delivers a lot of value, pumping out frames faster than last generation\u2019s $800 GeForce RTX 2080 Super\u2014the second-fastest graphics card in the world up until a few months ago\u2014for half the price. Yes, that includes ray tracing performance. Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics card soundly rings the death knell for older, similarly priced graphics cards like the Radeon RX 5700-series and the GeForce RTX 2060 Super.\n\nToday, we\u2019re digging into Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition, priced squarely at this GPU\u2019s $400 MSRP. Giddy-up.\n[ Further reading: Best graphics cards for PC gaming ]\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti specs, features, and design\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nUnlike the GeForce RTX 3090, RTX 3080, and RTX 3070 reviews, this one is pretty straightforward. The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti features a cut-down version of the $500 RTX 3070\u2019s \u201cGA104\u201d GPU, based on the company\u2019s new \u201cAmpere\u201d graphics architecture. Nvidia\u2019s more affordable card packs roughly 17 percent fewer simultaneous multiprocessors (SMs), a ratio that carries over to the CUDA cores, RT cores, tensor cores, and texture units found within those SMs. Nvidia also cut down the render output unit (ROP) count by roughly the same margin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$520 at  Newegg \n\n\n\n\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3060 Ti includes the hardware counts shown in the Nvidia-supplied chart below, which compares the new GPU against last generation\u2019s GeForce RTX 2060 Super and the aforementioned 3070. It\u2019s worth noting that the newer RT and tensor cores in the RTX 30-series, paired with the higher raw performance of these GPUs, deliver vastly improved ray tracing performance compared to the 2060 Super, even though the 3060 Ti offers far fewer tensor cores and a similar RT core count. (We dove deeper into Ampere\u2019s ray tracing and DLSS performance in our RTX 3080 review.)\n Nvidia\nThe GeForce RTX 3070 also runs a bit faster, with a 1,725MHz Boost clock speed versus the RTX 3060 Ti\u2019s 1,665MHz rating. In practice, though, all Nvidia cards exceed their rated speeds with help from the GPU Boost feature, which takes your graphics card\u2019s thermals and power into consideration to bump up speeds automatically. Factoring in all the tweaks, the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti consumes slightly less power than its bigger sibling, but yet more power than last-gen\u2019s RTX 2060 Super, splitting the difference with a 200-watt rating. That reveals Ampere\u2019s improved efficiency, however, as the RTX 2080 Super that this GPU outguns was rated for 250W.\nNvidia carried the full memory configuration of the RTX 3070 down to the RTX 3060 Ti, equipping the new GPU with 8GB of GDDR6 memory across a 256-bit bus, for a total memory bandwidth of 448GB/s. That\u2019s a fine amount for the 1440p gaming this graphics card targets, and a smart move by Nvidia as rival Radeon RX 6000-series cards look poised to increase raw capacity while leveraging their innovative Infinity Cache throughout AMD\u2019s entire lineup. The non-Super RTX 2060 launched in 2018 with 6GB of GDDR6 memory, but that more limited amount probably won\u2019t hold up well as modern games become more strenuous, especially when ray tracing is active.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nNvidia\u2019s current GeForce RTX 30-series Founders Edition product stack. (Hey-o!) From top: RTX 3060 Ti, 3070, 3080, 3090.\u00a0\n\n\nDesign-wise, the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition mirrors Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3070 FE, but its outer shroud is a lighter shade of silver, as opposed to the more gunmetal-like sheen of the higher-end models. That means it\u2019s a standard 2-slot, 9.5-inch size, and much smaller than the Founders Edition coolers found on Nvidia\u2019s higher-end RTX 3080 and 3090. Here\u2019s how we described the RTX 3070 FE\u2019s cooler:\n\n\n\u201cThe Founders Edition model we\u2019re reviewing today still uses Nvidia\u2019s tiny, highly customized PCB with a notch taken out of it to help with airflow. This means that like the other FE cards revealed so far, it powers on via a proprietary 12-pin connector. Nvidia includes an (ugly, short) adapter in the box. Unlike the more powerful RTX 30-series Founders Edition cards, however, the 12-pin connector is located horizontally in the middle of the edge of the card, rather than positioned vertically and at a 45-degree angle. If your case\u2019s power supply shroud has a cutout for wires underneath your GPU, this is a much better placement.\u201d\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the only design change. Nvidia created a highly unique custom \u2018flow-through\u2019 cooling solution for the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090, with independent push-pull fans and bristling, thick metal heat fins comprising the body of the card itself. It\u2019s very effective.\nThe GeForce RTX 3070 [and 3060 Ti\u2014Ed.] changes things up a wee bit. Rather than having one fan on the top and the bottom of the card in a push-pull configuration, the RTX 3070 FE places both fans in their standard places in the face of the card and adds a sleek backplate to the top. The two fans pushes air through the heatsink; the blower-style fan at the rear of the card expels heat through the I/O bracket, while the other one sends the hot air through a cut-out in the backplate back into the top of your system, where it can be sucked out by your case\u2019s rear outtake fan. It\u2019s functionally the same idea as the cooler on the more powerful RTX 30-series cards, but it takes a different path to get there.\u201d\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nPort report\n\n\nNvidia kept the display outputs the same as well, with three DisplayPort 1.4 connections and a single HDMI 2.1 port capable of 144Hz 4K or 8K60 video output over a single cable, along with AV1 decode support for watching 8K videos without stutter or dropping frames. Rival Radeon RX 6000-series graphics cards match that loadout, but swap one of the DisplayPorts for USB-C. The custom PCB inside the 3060 Ti isn\u2019t quite as exotic as the V-notched version found in the RTX 3080 and 3090, but it remains much shorter than typical.\n Nvidia\nOf course, the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti supports all Nvidia\u2019s extensive software features, some of which are truly killer apps for specific uses. Streamers will appreciate the best-in-class NVENC GPU encoder and the AI-enhanced Nvidia Broadcast suite, esports competitors will dig the Nvidia Reflex suite, and content creators swear by CUDA and Optix optimizations in prosumer apps. The graphics card comes equipped with a cutting-edge PCIe 4.0 connection (though only modern Ryzen platforms support it right now). The card will also support RTX I/O, an upcoming technology built upon Microsoft\u2019s DirectStorage API that allows your GPU and NVMe SSD to talk directly, obliterating game-loading times on the PC.\nFinally, it\u2019s worth noting that Nvidia\u2019s more mature ray tracing technology outperforms the first-gen implementation in AMD\u2019s rival Radeon RX 6000-series graphics cards. It also gets a huge shot in the arm with Nvidia\u2019s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) feature, which helps regain frames lost to ray tracing\u2019s heavy impact. AMD has no answer for it yet. If you want the best ray tracing graphics cards, Team Green is a no-brainer.\nGot it? Good. Let\u2019s get gaming.\n\nNext page: Our test system, gaming benchmarks begin\n\n\nOur test system\nOur dedicated graphics card test system is a couple of years old, but it\u2019s packed with some of the fastest complementary components available to put any potential performance bottlenecks squarely on the GPU, especially at the higher resolution these graphics cards target. Most of the hardware was provided by the manufacturers, but we purchased the cooler and storage ourselves.\n\nIntel Core i7-8700K processor ($300 on\u00a0Amazon) overclocked to 5GHz all cores\nEVGA CLC 240 closed-loop liquid cooler ($105 on\u00a0Amazon)\nAsus Maximus X Hero motherboard\n64GB HyperX Predator RGB DDR4/2933 ($355 on Amazon)\nEVGA 1200W SuperNova P2 power supply ($352 on\u00a0Amazon)\nCorsair Crystal 570X RGB case, with front and top panels removed and an extra rear fan installed for improved airflow\n2x 500GB Samsung 860 EVO SSDs ($70 each on\u00a0Amazon)\n\nWe\u2019re comparing the $400 GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition against Nvidia\u2019s Founders Edition models of the $500 GeForce RTX 3070 and last-generation\u2019s $350 RTX 2060, $500 RTX 2070, and $800 2080 Super. We opted to include the 2080 Super over the non-Super version, as this is the card Nvidia compares against the RTX 3060 Ti. We\u2019ve also included benchmarks for AMD\u2019s new $580 Radeon RX 6800 and last-gen $400 Radeon RX 5700 XT.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3060 Ti in our test system.\n\n\nWe test a variety of games spanning various engines, genres, vendor sponsorships (Nvidia, AMD, and Intel), and graphics APIs (DirectX 11, DX12, and Vulkan). Each game is tested using its in-game benchmark at the highest possible graphics presets unless otherwise noted, with VSync, frame rate caps, real-time ray tracing or DLSS effects, and FreeSync/G-Sync disabled, along with any other vendor-specific technologies like FidelityFX tools or Nvidia Reflex. We\u2019ve also enabled temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) to push these cards to their limits.\u00a0We run each benchmark at least three times and list the average result for each test.\n\nNvidia\u2019s claims prove true: The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti indeed winds up a hair faster than the last-gen RTX 2080 Super across the board\u2014Wolfenstein Youngblood is the lone exception, and that gap is very close. The older RTX 2060 Founders Edition gets absolutely massacred by Nvidia\u2019s new GPU. Given that, we\u2019ll present these standard benchmarks without further commentary.\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti gaming benchmarks\nWatch Dogs: Legion\nWatch Dogs: Legion is one of the first games to debut on next-gen consoles. Ubisoft upgraded its Disrupt engine to include cutting-edge features like real-time ray tracing and Nvidia\u2019s DLSS. We disable those effects for this testing, but Legion remains a strenuous game even on high-end hardware with its optional high-resolution texture pack installed. No card can maintain a 60-frames-per-second average with Ultra graphics options enabled, and the game allocates more than 8GB of memory even at 1440p. Oof.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nHorizon Zero Dawn\nYep, PlayStation exclusives are coming to the PC now. Horizon Zero Dawn runs on Guerrilla Games\u2019 Decima engine, the same engine that powers Death Stranding. Ambient Occlusion can offer iffy results if set to Ultra, so we test with that setting at Medium. Every other visual option is maxed out.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nNext page: Gaming benchmarks continue\n\n\n\nGears Tactics\nGears Tactics puts it own brutal, fast-paced spin on the XCOM-like genre. This Unreal Engine 4-powered game was built from the ground up for DirectX 12, and we love being able to work a tactics-style game into our benchmarking suite. Better yet, the game comes with a plethora of graphics options for PC snobs. More games should devote such loving care to explaining what flipping all these visual knobs mean.\nYou can\u2019t use the presets to benchmark Gears Tactics, as it intelligently scales to work best on your installed hardware, meaning that \u201cUltra\u201d on one graphics card can load different settings than \u201cUltra\u201d on a weaker card. We manually set all options to their highest possible settings.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nWolfenstein: Youngblood\nWolfenstein: Youngblood is more fun when you can play cooperatively with a buddy, but it\u2019s a fearless experiment\u2014and an absolute technical showcase. Running on the Vulkan API, Youngblood achieves blistering frame rates, and it supports all sorts of cutting-edge technologies like ray tracing, DLSS 2.0, HDR, GPU culling, asynchronous computing, and Nvidia\u2019s Content Adaptive Shading. The game includes a built-in benchmark with two different scenes; we tested Lab X.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nMetro Exodus\nOne of the best games of 2019, Metro Exodus is one of the best-looking games around, too. The latest version of the 4A Engine provides incredibly luscious, ultra-detailed visuals, with one of the most stunning real-time ray tracing implementations released yet. We test in DirectX 12 mode with ray tracing, Hairworks, and DLSS disabled for our basic benchmarks.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nBorderlands 3\nBorderlands is back! Gearbox\u2019s game defaults to DX12, so we do as well. It gives us a glimpse at the ultra-popular Unreal Engine 4\u2019s performance in a traditional shooter.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nStrange Brigade\nStrange Brigade\u00a0is a cooperative third-person shooter where a team of adventurers blasts through hordes of mythological enemies. It\u2019s a technological showcase, built around the next-gen Vulkan and DirectX 12 technologies and infused with features like HDR support and the ability to toggle asynchronous compute on and off. It uses Rebellion\u2019s custom Azure engine. We test using the Vulkan renderer, which is faster than DX12.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nNext page: Gaming benchmark continue\n\n\nTotal War: Troy\nThe latest game in the popular Total War saga, Troy was given away free for its first 24 hours on the Epic Games Store, moving over 7.5 million copies before it went on proper sale. Total War: Troy is built using a modified version of the Total War: Warhammer 2 engine, and this DX11 title looks stunning for a turn-based strategy game. We test the more intensive battle benchmark.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nF1 2020\nThe latest in a long line of successful racing games,\u00a0F1 2020 is a gem to test, supplying a wide array of both graphical and benchmarking options, making it a much more reliable (and fun) option that the\u00a0Forza\u00a0series. It\u2019s built on the latest version of Codemasters\u2019 buttery-smooth Ego game engine, complete with support for DX12 and Nvidia\u2019s DLSS technology. We test two laps on the Australia course, with clear skies on and DLSS off.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\u00a0concludes the reboot trilogy, and it\u2019s utterly\u00a0gorgeous. Square Enix optimized this game for DX12, and recommends DX11 only if you\u2019re using older hardware or Windows 7, so we test with DX12.\u00a0Shadow of the Tomb Raider\u00a0uses an enhanced version of the Foundation engine that also powered\u00a0Rise of the Tomb Raider and includes optional real-time ray tracing and DLSS features.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nRainbow Six Siege\nLike GTA V, Ubisoft\u2019s Rainbow Six Siege still dominates the Steam charts years after its launch, and it\u2019ll be getting a visual upgrade for the next-gen consoles. The developers have poured a ton of work into the game\u2019s AnvilNext engine over the years, eventually rolling out a Vulkan version of the game that we use to test. By default, the game lowers the render scaling to increase frame rates, but we set it to 100 percent to benchmark native rendering performance on graphics cards. Even still, frame rates soar.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nNext page: GeForce RTX 3060 Ti ray tracing benchmarks\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti ray tracing benchmarks\nWhile we were busy running benchmarks, we flipped on real-time ray tracing and Nvidia\u2019s Deep Learning Super Sampling in a handful of games. Enabling ray tracing imparts a massive performance impact; DLSS\u2019s AI-enhanced image upscaling claws a lot of those frames back. (DLSS can also be activated separately from ray tracing to drive your in-game frame rates beyond what Nvidia\u2019s hardware pumps out natively.) We dove deeper into Ampere\u2019s ray tracing and DLSS performance in our RTX 3080 review if you\u2019re interested in more analysis.\nWe tested ray tracing capabilities set to Ultra in four games, each deploying a different version of the cutting-edge lighting technology. Shadow of the Tomb Raider uses (surprise!) ray-traced shadows; the ray-traced global illumination in Metro Exodus truly transforms the look and feel of that game; Wolfenstein Youngblood and Ubisoft\u2019s strenuous Watch Dogs Legion show off ray-traced reflections on the rival Vulkan and DirectX 12 APIs, respectively.\u00a0Tomb Raider\u00a0and\u00a0Metro\u00a0use Nvidia\u2019s original DLSS 1.0 implementation, while\u00a0Wolfenstein\u00a0and\u00a0Watch Dogs\u00a0deploy the faster, better DLSS 2.0.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nNo real surprises here. The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is roughly as fast as the last-gen RTX 2080 Super in traditional gaming performance, and it\u2019s roughly as fast in ray tracing performance too. The last-gen RTX 2060 FE couldn\u2019t even run Wolfenstein with ray tracing enabled. We repeatedly received memory capacity warnings onscreen, then the game crashed.\nNext page: Power, thermals, and noise\n\n\n\nPower draw, thermals, and noise\nWe test power draw by looping the\u00a0F1 2020\u00a0benchmark at 4K for about 20 minutes after we\u2019ve benchmarked everything else and noting the highest reading on our Watts Up Pro meter, which measures the power consumption of our entire test system. The initial part of the race, where all competing cars are onscreen simultaneously, tends to be the most demanding portion.\u00a0\nThis isn\u2019t a worst-case test; we removed the Core i7 8700K\u2019s overclock and specifically chose a GPU-bound game running at a GPU-bound resolution to gauge performance when the graphics card is sweating hard. If you\u2019re playing a game that also hammers the CPU, you could see higher overall system power draws. Consider yourself warned.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThe results prove that the Ampere GPU architecture in the RTX 30-series is more power-efficient than the Turing GPUs in last-generation\u2019s RTX 20-series cards, but that the graphics cards themselves draw more power in the same class. The RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition draws a significant 47 watts less under load than the RTX 2080 Super it topples in performance\u2014a sterling result\u2014but also draws over 40W more than the RTX 2060 Founders Edition. The new card smokes the older 60-class option in raw performance, though.\nWe test thermals by leaving GPU-Z open during the\u00a0F1 2020\u00a0power draw test, noting the highest maximum temperature at the end.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nNvidia\u2019s radical new cooler continues to impress as it moves down the Founders Edition product stack. Maxing out at a mere 72 degrees under load is a fantastic result for a reference(ish) graphics card, and significantly cooler than the RTX 2080 Super achieved with similar performance levels. Yet it still leaves room for custom variants by partners like Asus, MSI, and EVGA to improve things\u2014especially noise levels.\nThis is the same cooler design found on the RTX 3070 FE, meaning it not only delivers identical temperature performance, but also acoustic results. While the beefed-up version of the cooler on Nvidia\u2019s more expensive $700 RTX 3080 FE was\u00a0very\u00a0quiet, the much smaller RTX 3060 Ti and 3070 Founders Edition models sounds like standard graphics cards\u2013moderately loud.\nNext page: Should you buy the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti?\n\n\nShould you buy the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti?\nAbsolutely\u2014if you can find it in this extremely supply-limited, demand-heavy year. The $400 GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is a spectacular graphics card that delivers performance a hair faster than last-generation\u2019s $800 RTX 2080 Super in both traditional and ray traced games for half the price, and with lower power consumption. Hot damn.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThat performance paired with 8GB of GDDR6 memory makes the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti a fantastic 1440p gaming option. It exceeds the hallowed 60-frames-per-second mark in every game tested at that resolution, even with the most strenuous visual settings enabled. It flies well beyond that mark in several games, and it should have no problem holding 90 fps+ at 1440p in most titles if you don\u2019t mind performing minor tuning on graphics options. The RTX 3060 Ti would also be a fine pairing for a high-refresh-rate 1080p monitor, though AMD\u2019s inevitable counterpunch may prevail at those settings, given the Radeon RX 6800-series\u2019 superior performance at lower resolutions. Nvidia\u2019s GPUs handle ray tracing much better than Radeon cards, however, and AMD has no answer to Nvidia\u2019s fantastic DLSS tech.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3080\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$1,494.68 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\n\nYou can even play games at 4K at a fine clip with this card if you bump graphics from Ultra to High in most games, as you could with the older RTX 2080 Super. The 8GB memory capacity likely won\u2019t hold up well over the long term, however. We\u2019d recommend opting for a graphics card with more VRAM if you\u2019re buying for 4K today\u2014either the AMD Radeon RX 6800-series or Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3080. Those cards cost substantially more, though.\nThe step-up $500 GeForce RTX 3070 also comes with 8GB of GDDR6 memory, so it\u2019s in the running if you\u2019re looking for a 1440p graphics card. It\u2019s only 9 percent to 15 percent faster than the RTX 3060 Ti at 1440p depending on the game, however, for 25 percent more cash. That makes the RTX 3060 Ti a better option for most people, though the RTX 2070\u2019s performance boost may be worthwhile if you hold onto your graphics cards for an especially long time before upgrading again. The extra frames also make the RTX 3070 better for entry-level 4K gaming, though again, we\u2019d be leery about its 8GB of VRAM at that capacity.\u00a0\n[ Further reading: Best graphics cards for PC gaming ]\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nAt $400, the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti immediately kills any remaining value proposition for comparable last-gen graphics cards like the Radeon RX 5700, 5700 XT, GeForce RTX 2060, and 2060 Super, unless you score one at a massive discount. Don\u2019t count on seeing those discounts in today\u2019s economy, though. Rather than splurging on older tech at this point, be patient and wait to get your hands on this GPU.\n\nNvidia\u2019s unorthodox RTX 30-series Founders Edition cooling continues to impress, though less so the further we move down the stack. The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti FE\u2019s 72-degree Celsius temperatures and soft, but audible noise levels don\u2019t disappoint, especially for a card made by Nvidia itself, but there is room for partner cards from EVGA, Asus and others to improve things. (Stay tuned for many custom RTX 3060 Ti reviews in the coming days\u2014we\u2019ve already got several in our hands.) We still dislike the proprietary 12-pin power connector that Nvidia used with its Founders Edition cards this generation to squeeze in a smaller PCB. The company includes an adapter in the box, but that adapter is too short and looks chunky and ugly compared to nicer traditional cabling options.\nDon\u2019t let that dissuade you, though. Performance this fast cost twice as much last generation and landed near the top of the RTX 20-series stack. Getting this much eye candy for $400 is very welcome indeed. The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is spectacular\u2014a virtually flawless 1440p GPU, minor Founders Edition design squabbles aside. Here\u2019s hoping stocks are plentiful and custom variants aren\u2019t priced as extravagantly as the higher-up RTX 30-series options, because this GPU should sell like hotcakes.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBest Prices Today: GeForce RTX 3060 Ti\t\t\n\n\n\n\nRetailer\n\n\nPrice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,098\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nView Deal \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct\n\n\nPrice\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from Backmarket\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tPCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Notice\nEuropean Privacy Settings\nMember Preferences\nEditorial independence\nLicensing & Eprints\nCalifornia: Do not Sell my Personal Info\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nAd Choice\nContact Us\nFoundry Careers\nGamePro\nSmart Answers\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPCWorld Categories \n\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe \n\n\n\n\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 IDG Communications, Inc. \n\n\n\nExplore the Foundry Network +\nTech AdvisorMacworld \n\n\n\n\nTop Of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDo Not Sell My Info\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Settings\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This has been a long rumored release, and case in point, we have several cards on hand already.\nAlthough we did not receive a Founders Edition model on time for this review, we do have four AIB cards, including the Evga RTX 3060 Ti FTW3 Ultra, Asus ROG Strix RTX 3060 Ti, MSI RTX 3060 Ti Gaming X Trio and Gigabyte RTX 3060 Ti Gaming OC Pro. That's nice. Since the Gigabyte model arrived first we've used it for testing and will be representing the RTX 3060 Ti on our benchmarks, later on we'll explore what is unique about each card however.\n\nNow, when compared to the RTX 2060 Super, the RTX 3060 Ti should be a substantial upgrade as in terms of specs it sits somewhat close to the excellent RTX 3070. It packs just 17% fewer cores, TMUs and ROPs. The memory subsystem remains the same, though we saw the same configuration with the 2060 Super, that's 8GB of GDDR6 memory clocked at 7000 MHz for a 14 Gbps transfer speed. The 256-bit wide memory bus results in a peak bandwidth of 448 GB/s.\n\nThe cores are clocked 3.5% lower than the RTX 3070's at 1665 MHz. As a result the 3060 Ti has a board power rating of 200 watts which is a 14% increase from the 2060 Super. Given what we've seen from Ampere so far, we're expecting the 3060 Ti to be a good bit faster than the 2060 Super, though the real test should be how it fares against the outgoing Radeon RX 5700 XT.\n\n\n\nGeForce\nRTX 3080\nRTX 3070\nRTX 3060 Ti\nRTX 2060 Super\n\n\nPrice MSRP\n$700\n$500\n$400\n$400\n\n\nRelease Date\nSeptember 2020\nOctober 2020\nNovember 2020\nJuly 2019\n\n\nProcess\nSamsung 8N\nTSMC12FFN\n\n\nTransistors (billion)\n28.3\n17.4\n10.8\n\n\nDie Size (mm2)\n628.4\n392.5\n754\n\n\nCore Config\n8704 / 272 / 96\n5888 / 184 / 96\n4864 / 152 / 80\n2176 / 136 / 64\n\n\nGPU Boost Clock\n1710 MHz\n1725 MHz\n1655 MHz\n1650 MHz\n\n\nMemory Capacity\n10 GB\n8GB\n\n\nMemory Speed\n19 Gbps\n14 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Type\nGDDR6X\nGDDR6\n\n\nBus Type / Bandwidth\n320-bit / 760 GB/s\n256-bit / 448 GB/s\n\n\nTGP\n320 watt\n220 watt\n200 watt\n175 watt\n\n\n\nAfter all, the 5700 XT is the previous generation $400 champ as it was over 20% faster than the 2060 Super on average, so we're keen to see if the 3060 Ti can finally put down AMD's first crack at their RDNA architecture.\nFor testing we're still using our Ryzen 9 3950X test system, which will get upgraded to the 5950X as soon as we can. The 3950X has little influence on the 1440p data and doesn't limit the 4K results at all, so for the most part very little will change when moving to the 5950X, or so we expect.\n\nSpeaking of resolutions, our focus on today's review will be on 1440p performance since this isn't a 4K graphics card. We've also dropped 1080p performance as scaling is very similar to what will be shown at 1440p. With that said, we have provided the 18 game average 1080p and 4K data, while also including it in our cost power frame analysis.\n\nOne last important detail, since we are not testing Nvidia's RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition graphics card, we've tested using the Gigabyte Gaming OC Pro. This card comes with a 6% factory overclock, so it will perform slightly better than cards following the reference or base spec, please be aware of that. On the upside, we're also using the MSI Gaming X version of the 2060 Super which is also a factory overclocked, as is the 5700 XT we tested, represented by PowerColor's Red Devil.\n\nWhen we update all our benchmarking data with the Ryzen 9 5950X, we'll replace the Founder Edition results for the 3070, 3080 and 3090 with factory OC AIB models, we'll also do the same for our Radeon RX 6800 and 6800 XT results. Truth be told, it won't make a huge difference, a 6% overclock will typically net you a 3 to 4% performance uplift, but we wanted to be transparent about what's going on here.\n\nBenchmarks\nFirst up we have Godfall and as expected the 3060 Ti isn't a great deal slower than the RTX 3070, trailing by just a 13% margin with 62 fps on average. That meant it was 19% faster than the 5700 XT, which is a reasonable performance uplift. Of course, the massive 48% uplift over the 2060 Super is far more impressive.\n\nWhereas Godfall is a new AMD sponsored title, Watch Dogs Legion is a new Nvidia sponsored title and unsurprisingly the 3060 Ti does even better here relative to the 5700 XT, beating the previous generation Radeon GPU by a 30% margin.\n\nThe RTX 3060 Ti is also 42% faster than the 2060 Super and just 13% slower than the 3070.\nHaving said all that, just 61 fps on average at 1440p isn't exactly amazing performance and we've yet to enable ray tracing, though we will look at that soon along with DLSS performance in this title.\n\nThe RTX 3060 Ti performs very well in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, trailing the 3070 by just a 9% margin, though again we're only looking at 58 fps on average which admittedly is enough for this style of game, though I personally would tune the quality settings for reduced input latency.\nWhen compared to the 2060 Super we're looking at an almost 30% performance boost, so that's nice, though the 3060 Ti was only able to match the 5700 XT in this new AMD sponsored title. So it would seem Nvidia has some driver optimization work to do.\n\nDirt 5 is yet another new AMD sponsored title and we find a situation where the 3060 Ti is slightly slower than the old 5700 XT, despite beating the 2060 Super by a 30% margin. It will be interesting to see how the 5700 XT and 2060/2070 Super stack up by this time next year, we certainly seem to already be seeing a situation where the RDNA architecture is aging much better than Turing.\n\nEven in Death Stranding the new RTX 3060 Ti isn't a great deal faster than the 5700 XT, beating it by a 13% margin despite trailing the 3070 by just a 9% margin.\nWe're also talking about a massive 40% performance uplift over the 2060 Super, so again while the 3060 Ti looks fantastic compared to Nvidia's previous $400 offering, it's far less impressive when compared to AMDs.\n\nWe are seeing a rather healthy 25% performance boost for the 3060 Ti over the 5700 XT in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, taking the average frame rate at 1440p up to 40 fps on average. That means it's just 9% slower than the 3070 and almost 30% faster than the 2060 Super.\n\nEven in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, the 3060 Ti was just 9% slower than the RTX 3070 with 108 fps on average. It was also much faster than the 5700 XT, beating it by almost 30% and a massive 46% margin over the 2060 Super, making Tomb Raider one of the best showings yet for the 3060 Ti.\n\nThe RTX 3060 Ti remains strong in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, beating the 5700 XT by a convincing 24% margin and burning the 2060 Super by an incredible 56%.\nIt's also just 12% slower than the RTX 3070, so overall a great result and not that far from the 2080 Ti, a card that once fetched $1200.\n\nF1 2020 has been a strong title for AMD in the past and here we're seeing that the 3060 Ti is only able to beat the 5700 XT by 7%, though we are seeing 2080 Super-like performance from the 5700 XT, so like we said, this is a strong title for AMD.\nDespite the disappointing margin from the 5700 XT, the 3060 Ti was 51% faster than the 2060 Super, so that's a monstrous generational improvement for Nvidia at the $400 price point.\n\nWe're again seeing the RTX 3060 Ti delivering RTX 2080 Super-like performance with 82 fps on average at 1440p in Gears 5, making it just 9% slower than the 3070. It was also 11% faster than the 5700 XT, despite beating the 2060 Super by an almost 40% margin.\n\nThe Horizon Zero Dawn results are surprising as here the 3060 Ti was just 4% slower than the RTX 3070, delivering 92 fps on average, allowing it to beat even the RTX 2080 Ti. When compared to the 5700 XT we're looking at a 31% performance increase, so very impressive and a truly massive 61% increase over the 2060 Super.\n\n\nWe're looking at a decent 21% performance gain over the 5700 XT in World War Z. Also a massive 61% performance jump over the 2060 Super. When compared to the 3070, the RTX 3060 Ti was just 11% slower, so not much separating these two Ampere products.\n\nMetro Exodus is one of the few games that's quite heavily CPU limited with the Ryzen 9 3950X at 1440p, and as a result the 3060 Ti is just 4% slower than the 3070. Despite that, the 3060 Ti doesn't appear all that CPU limited given it was still 27% faster than the 5700 XT and almost 40% faster than the 2060 Super.\n\nTesting with Resident Evil 3 reveals the 3060 Ti to be just 10% slower than the 3070 and this is fairly typical of what we've seen so far. Even more impressive is the fact that in this title it was 32% faster than the 5700 XT and 51% faster than the 2060 Super. That's a really nice upgrade at the $400 price point.\n\nThe RTX 3060 Ti managed to edge out the 2080 Super, this time in DOOM Eternal and that meant it was 99% faster than the RTX 2060 Super, pretty crazy stuff.\nSo basically the RTX 3060 Ti is a beast in Doom.\nIt was less impressive relative to the 5700 XT, though still a big gain at 42% faster. So basically the RTX 3060 Ti is a beast in Doom.\n\nThe RTX 3060 Ti also dominated the previous-generation competition in Wolfenstein: Youngblood, beating the 5700 XT by a 42% margin and the 2060 Super by a 56% margin. It was also a mere 11% slower than the 3070 and 2080 Ti.\n\nIn the last game we tested, the 3060 Ti was just 10% slower than the RTX 3070 in Hitman 2 and 27% faster than the 5700 XT, so an excellent result here.\nWe're also looking at a 42% performance uplift over the 2060 Super, so when compared to Nvidia's previous generation $400 part, the 3060 Ti looks amazing.\nAverage Gaming Performance\nHere's a look at the average performance seen across the 18 games tested. Although we didn't spend time looking at 1080p performance on each of the games tested so far, we did collect the data.\nA look at the 1080p average data is below and as you can see at this lower resolution the RTX 3060 Ti was on average just 8% slower than the RTX 3070, though be aware at times the 3070 will have been limited by the CPU.\n\nStill, for those gaming at 1080p with a CPU similar (or slower) than the Ryzen 9 3950X, the 3060 Ti won't be much slower than the RTX 3070, though it also won't be much faster than the older Radeon RX 5700 XT. Here we see a 15% performance uplift on average.\nWhen compared to the 2060 Super we are looking at a rather massive 41% performance improvement, so that's quite impressive.\n\nNow at 1440p we're almost never CPU limited, with the exception of two or three titles.\nThe 3060 Ti is 9% slower on average when compared to the RTX 3070, which is similar to the margin seen at 1080p. The GeForce does extend its lead over the 5700 XT out to 21%, which is a decent performance uplift, while not an extreme leap for a next generation GPU.\nOf course, the super impressive leap is seen when looking at the RTX 2060 Super. Here the new RTX 3060 Ti is on average 50% faster at 1440p and that's a serious generational improvement.\n\nAt 4K, the RTX 3060 Ti is seen trailing the 3070 by just 12%, which is a surprisingly small margin. It's also now 28% faster than the 5700 XT which is a decent margin, though in our opinion neither are really suitable for 4K gaming. The cut off here we'd say is the 2080 Ti / RTX 3070 and even the 3070 might be questionable moving forward with its limited 8GB VRAM buffer.\n\nCost Per Frame\nTime for a look at the cost per frame and for now we're going to stick with the MSRP data for the 1080p results. We'll make some adjustments to the 1440p results, which we'll look at in a moment.\nIn a perfect world, where the MSRP meant something, the RTX 3060 Ti would be coming in well below anything we've previously seen in terms of cost per frame...\n\nBut let's move to the 1440p results to continue this discussion.\nWe'll start with an MSRP comparison before looking at retail prices. When compared to the RTX 3070, the 3060 Ti should be coming in offering 13% more value per frame and 14% when compared to the RX 6800.\n\nNow, when compared to the outgoing models like the 2060 Super and 5700 XT, the 3060 Ti is 18% more affordable per frame when compared to the 5700 XT and 33% more affordable when compared to the 2060 Super. Given the performance just seen and the fact that they should all cost $400, no surprises there.\nBut what about actual retail prices? Well let's start with pricing over at Newegg. Now be aware almost all of these graphics cards are out of stock and while the Ampere GPUs have seen numerous re-supplies, they sell out instantly.\n\nWhat we're looking at here is the cheapest list price for each AIB model, there are three 3070 AIB cards at the MSRP and three 3080 cards at the MSRP. There is a single 6800 that's just below the MSRP, it's the PowerColor Fighter and there's another at the MSRP. The 6800 XT though doesn't have any AIB models at the MSRP, the cheapest being the Sapphire Nitro+ at $770.\nFinally, there's a few 5700 XT's at $400, but the vanilla 5700's are all overpriced, presumably due to a lack of supply at the moment. Taking those listings this is what we end up with. Basically the 3060 Ti is still great value with the RX 6800 also looking very good, albeit at a much higher price. The RTX 3070 also looks good though it is coming in at a 14% premium per frame when compared to the 3060 Ti.\nIt's really only the 6800 XT that looks a bit weak here, though it's not too bad compared to the RTX 3080, at least for those wanting to game at 1440p.\n\nRay Tracing Performance\nFor ray tracing and DLSS performance, we're going to have a look at 1080p and 1440p performance. We'll be comparing the RTX 3060 Ti with the 2060 Super and the RX 6800, which is currently the cheapest Radeon GPU that supports ray tracing, though it's not a direct competitor for the 3060 Ti.\nAs we saw before, the 3060 Ti is 34% faster than the 2060 Super in Watch Dogs Legion at 1080p and with ray tracing enabled that margin doesn't change much, using ultra quality ray tracing the RTX 3060 Ti is 38% faster and 41% faster with medium quality RT.\n\nWe're then looking at a 36-42% margin when RT + DLSS enabled and then just a 26% margin with both using just DLSS. So while Nvidia has optimized the 2nd-gen RT cores and 3rd-gen Tensor cores, there's no tangible improvement in performance at the end of the day given there's less of them. An efficiency improvement sure, but an actual performance improvement relative to the standard rasterization performance, not so much.\nThe RTX 3060 Ti will offer similar ray tracing performance to that of the 2080 Super, which is good for a $400 graphics card, but how useful that is at this performance tier will depend on your standards.\nPersonally, gaming at 60 fps feels pretty sluggish for me, even games like Watch Dogs, I like to play at around 90 fps, the input just feels a lot better and I favor input over visual quality, at least when it means playing at or below about 90 fps.\n\nOf course, everyone is different, so if you're happy gaming at around 60 fps then the RTX 3060 Ti will deliver a good experience at 1080p with DLSS enabled.\nWe also find the visual upgrade from 1080p to 1440p to be massive, certainly bigger than the upgrade from 1440p to 4K, which is probably one reason why gamers aren't rushing to 4K. Anyway, if you want to play at 1440p you'll have to be okay with less than 60 fps with DLSS enabled and you can expect regular dips down in the low 40s. The game is unplayable using RT in my opinion without DLSS enabled.\nAgain, my personal preferences would see me disable ray tracing entirely in Watch Dogs Legion with an RTX 3060 Ti and instead go with quality DLSS for 77 fps on average which saw frame rates consistently above 60 fps. For this title and likely many others that support DLSS 2.0, the RTX 3060 Ti can deliver a better experience than even the Radeon RX 6800, and that's very impressive.\n\nPower Consumption\nBecause we don't have the base Founders Edition model on hand, these power figures are going to be a bit all over the place, and therefore we've tested all four AIB models which may be even better for future reference.\nAs you can see on the graph below, the Asus ROG Strix model used the least amount of power, but even so total system consumption was increased by a few watts when compared to the RTX 3070 Founders Edition.\nThe 3060 Ti FE model should use around 20 watts less power, making these AIB models a lot less efficient, thought that's fairly typical.\n\nUsing Nvidia's PCAT to look at board power specifically, we see that the Asus ROG Strix model uses the same power as the RTX 3070 Founders Edition at 226 watts, which is 200 watts over the base spec.\nThe MSI Gaming X Trio is way more power hungry though hitting 255 watts which is well over spec, presumably MSI's been aggressive with their stock voltage.\n\nFor performance per watt, we're using the Gigabyte Gaming OC Pro data as that's the model we used for all game benchmarks. We're also using the 1440p data, previously we've focused on the 4K data for this which is much more favorable for the higher-end Ampere GPUs which do scale better at this higher resolution.\n\nAt 1440p we've seen just how inefficient the 3080 and 3090 are in terms of performance, and as a result performance per watt isn't as impressive as what we've seen at 4K.\nThe RTX 3070, which scales more consistently does fair every well, losing only to the RX 6800. The Gigabyte RTX 3060 Ti Gaming OC Pro though uses the same amount of power as the RTX 3070 Founders Edition and therefore doesn't score as well, though the performance per watt is still quite good. If we had the FE model to test, we imagine the 3060 Ti would be comparable to the 3070.\nThermal Performance\nLet's talk a bit about thermal performance, fan speeds and operating clock speeds. Starting with the Gigabyte Gaming OC Pro, it peaked at just 67C, which is a fairly low temperature, though the fan speed was very high as 2100 RPM.\nThere's the option of a silent BIOS but due to extreme time constraints we've only been able to test each of these four AIB graphics cards using the primary or default BIOS. So, 67C with a 2100 RPM fan speed and maintaining a clock speed of 1950 MHz after 30 minutes of gameplay. By the way, all this testing was conducted in the Corsair Obsidian 500D, with a 21C ambient temperature.\n\nNext up we have the Asus ROG Strix which peaked at just 58C, that's a 9C improvement on the Gigabyte model, though you can expect the Strix card to fetch a higher price. Anyway, 58C with a 1600 RPM fan speed, an excellent result.\nThe Evga FTW3 Ultra peaked at 72C with a 2000 RPM fan speed, that's the worst result we've seen so far and although the clock speed was 1.5% higher at 1980 MHz, that's a negligible difference.\nFinally, the MSI Gaming X Trio which is another premium RTX 3060 Ti and this model peaked at just 61C with an 1800 RPM fan speed, though like the EVGA version it maintained a core clock speed of 1980 MHz. Based on this quick look, we'd say the best model here is the Asus ROG Strix, though it's likely to cost the most, and then the MSI Gaming X Trio.\nOverclocking\nHere's a look at overclocking with the Asus ROG Strix RTX 3060 Ti, given how cool this model ran we decided to use it for overclocking.\n\nIt managed a stable 2.1 GHz for the cores, while the memory achieved 16 Gbps and this resulted in a further 9% performance which placed it on par with a stock base spec RTX 3070. Not bad, though fairly typical for these new Ampere GPUs.\nWhat We Learned\nThe RTX 3060 Ti is a mighty impressive upgrade when compared to Nvidia's previous $400 offering, the RTX 2060 Super, offering 50% more performance at the same price point. The 2060 Super wasn't exactly great value however, same as most of Turing's lineup, and in this price range the go to option for best performance for your dollar was the Radeon RX 5700 XT. In that comparison, the RTX 3060 Ti is offering about 20% more performance.\nThe 5700 XT has been available for about 18 months, so a 20% boost in that timeframe isn't bad, it's just not earth shattering. Had the RTX 3060 Ti offered more VRAM, it'd be a bit more exciting and perhaps more enticing for someone already rocking a 5700 series GPU.\n\nThe RTX 3060 Ti is a great upgrade option for those with something like a GTX 1070, who decided to skip Turing, the ray tracing hype generation that offered very little in the way of a cost per frame improvement. For those with a GTX 1070, you're looking at a 90% performance uplift on average at 1440p, while GTX 1080 owners are looking at a solid 60% performance uplift. You're also getting ray tracing support, which as you know from previous reviews, it's not something I personally find relevant because of the small but growing list of games supported (and consequent performance hit).\nLet's talk a bit about that, and know that this is all based on my personal preferences... First, we're not down to play at 1080p, especially when spending $400 (or more) on a graphics card. That's just too much to be spending on a 1080p experience, unless you're doing it for professional competitive gaming. In my view, 1440p offers a significant visual upgrade and because of this I haven't used a 1080p display in over a decade \u2013 not since 2008 when I purchased my first 2560x1600 monitor, an investment that was with me for almost a decade.\n\nThat being the case, 1080p ray tracing performance just isn't where it's at for me. These cards need to deliver at 1440p and a sub-60 FPS experience when leveraging DLSS is not something we're particularly interested in. So for me the RTX 3060 Ti technically doesn't support ray tracing as it can't deliver an acceptable level of gaming performance with it enabled, even with the help of DLSS.\nOn the other hand, what is a very neat feature and something we'd absolutely use is DLSS.\nGoing from 61 fps in Watch Dogs Legion to 77 fps with no noticeable downgrade to the visuals is a big deal. It's also a feature we'd use in more competitive games, such as Fortnite, for example, which now also supports DLSS. Fortnite supports ray tracing, but it's a complete waste even with an RTX 3090, as any half decent gamer will be turning most effects down or entirely off, for competitive advantage, and that's exactly what we do.\n\nFor those of you who are wondering why we didn't enable DLSS for the benchmarks we just saw in the games that support it, like Death Stranding for example, in short we prefer to show native performance as that's an apples to apples comparison. DLSS while super impressive, isn't always flawless, sometimes suffering from artifacts where it fails to properly fill in the missing information. AMD has said they have their own DLSS-type technology on the way, and hope to have it supported by a much broader range of games. That could drastically change this discussion in the near future, but of course, we'll have to wait and see on that one.\nNo matter which way you slice it though, right now the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is the best value $400 graphics card on the market. There's simply no way you'd invest in a Radeon RX 5700 XT beyond this point. Then again, if availability is anything like what we're seen with the 3070, 3080 and 3090, buying a 3060 Ti is going to be extremely difficult at launch. Based on what we're hearing, availability will be similar to that of the RTX 3070. There will be some RTX 3060 Ti stock available but it'll sell out right away and will be hard to get for the next few weeks.\nAnother relevant point to this conversation, of the four 3060 Ti graphics cards we have on hand, none of them will be available at the $400 MSRP. The Evga RTX 3060 Ti FTW3 Ultra is expected to cost $450, while the MSI RTX 3060 Ti Gaming X Trio will start at $470, and we expect we'll see a similar price for the Gigabyte RTX 3060 Ti Gaming OC Pro. Asus didn't get us proper pricing in time for this review, but rest assured that the ROG Strix model will cost at least $500, at which point you might as well start looking at buying an RTX 3070 instead.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3070 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 6800 on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 9 5950X on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 9 5900X on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 5 5600X on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 67\n\n\n Got something to say?

There\u2019s 20% fewer cores and 5% lower clock speeds but it\u2019s $100 cheaper. GA104 is one of 2 of NVIDIA\u2019s newest \u2018Ampere\u2019 architecture GPUs built with Samsung\u2019s 8nm process node. The other (GA102) is used in the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 models.\nAmpere CardSMPs (Cores)VRAMTFLOPSPriceRTX 30908224 GB GDDR6X36$1499RTX 30806810GB GDDR6X\u00a030$699RTX 3070468GB GDDR620$499RTX 3060 Ti388GB GDDR616$399\nNVIDIA says it\u2019s more powerful than the previous generation RTX 2080 Super, which was priced with an MRSP $300 higher. Benchmarkers such as Digital Foundary confirm that\u2019s true in almost all games tested.\n\nAMD\u2019s nearest competitor from its latest generation is RX 6800. That\u2019s $180 more expensive, but more powerful in most games. 3060 Ti has the lead in ray tracing performance.\nAmpere cards have the best video encoders available on the market, so they offer the highest quality and lowest latency for Oculus Quest headsets using Oculus Link or 3rd party wireless streaming apps like Virtual Desktop. Some of 2018\u2019s NVIDIA \u2018Turing\u2019 cards had a USB-C port and USB controller helpful for Link, but that was dropped from Ampere.\n\nThe introduction of this $399 card means you can now get a $599 HP Reverb G2 and a GPU that can take advantage of it for under $1000. Or theoretically get, I should say. As with all the latest graphics cards stock availability will likely be sporadic and we haven\u2019t tested the card with the headset ourselves.\nNVIDIA describes this as the debut of the \u2018RTX 3060 Family\u2019, which potentially means it\u2019ll launch a RTX 3060 card next year.\nDoes RTX 3060 Ti tempt you? Can you even get one if you want it? Or will you wait for AMD\u2019s direct response?

It\u2019s the latest addition to the company\u2019s RTX 3000 series lineup and the most affordable yet. Nvidia says the RTX 3060 Ti has been designed to outperform both the last-generation RTX 2080 and RTX 2080 Super. On average, Nvidia says it will be 40 percent faster than its predecessor, the RTX 2060 Super.The RTX 3060 Ti will be available worldwide on December 2nd, priced at $399, \u00a3369 in the UK, and \u20ac348 (excluding tax). The card itself looks very similar to the RTX 3070 and is identical in size. It also includes the same traditional dual-fan setup. The main visual difference is that the RTX 3060 Ti uses a lighter shade of gray instead of the darker gray found on current RTX 3000 series cards.Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3060 Ti. Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeThe RTX 3060 Ti comes with 8GB of video memory, a base clock of 1410Mhz, and a boost clock of 1665Mhz. It\u2019s the typical dual-slot design, with Nvidia\u2019s new 12-pin power connector. Nvidia is recommending a 600W power supply for the RTX 3060 Ti, and the card can draw up to 200 watts of power.Like the rest of Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3000 cards, the RTX 3060 Ti will also be capable of real-time ray tracing and will include DLSS support and the ability to run Nvidia\u2019s suite of RTX apps.

It\u2019s an outstanding value for the price, if a bit short on features. While the display only officially supports AMD\u2019s FreeSync Premium adaptive sync technology, you can manually activate G-Sync in Nvidia\u2019s control panel and it works like a charm. You\u2019ll need to use the monitor\u2019s on-screen display to activate adaptive sync first, however.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a list of what\u2019s inside our GPU test system, which was built to minimize potential bottlenecking in other components, putting the full brunt of the tests on the graphics card itself:\n\nIntel Core i7-8700K processor ($300 on\u00a0Amazon) overclocked to 5GHz all-core\nEVGA CLC 240 closed-loop liquid cooler ($105 on\u00a0Amazon)\nAsus Maximus X Hero motherboard\n64GB HyperX Predator RGB DDR4/2933 ($355 on Amazon)\nEVGA 1200W SuperNova P2 power supply ($352 on\u00a0Amazon)\nCorsair Crystal 570X RGB case, with front and top panels removed and an extra rear fan installed for improved airflow\n2x 500GB Samsung 860 EVO SSDs ($70 each on\u00a0Amazon)\n\nEach game is tested using its in-game benchmark at the highest possible graphics presets unless otherwise noted, with VSync, frame rate caps, real-time ray tracing or DLSS effects, and FreeSync/G-Sync disabled, along with any other vendor-specific technologies like FidelityFX or Hairworks. We\u2019ve also enabled temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) to push these cards to their limits when it\u2019s available. Check out our full GeForce RTX 3060 Ti review for deeper insight into our methodology.\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll just be presenting the raw benchmark results after introducing each game. Skip to the end for deeper analysis if you want our thoughts on performance.\u00a0\nWatch Dogs: Legion\nWatch Dogs: Legion is one of the first games to debut on next-gen consoles. Ubisoft upgraded its Disrupt engine to include cutting-edge features like real-time ray tracing and Nvidia\u2019s DLSS. We disable those effects for this testing but Legion remains a strenuous game even on high-end hardware with its optional high-resolution texture pack installed. No card can maintain a 60-frames-per-second average with Ultra graphics options enabled, and the game allocates more than 8GB of memory even at 1440p. Oof.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nHorizon Zero Dawn\nYep, Sony exclusives are hitting the PC now. Horizon Zero Dawn runs on Guerrilla Games\u2019 Decima engine, the same engine that powers Death Stranding. Ambient Occlusion can still offer iffy results if set to Ultra, so we test with that setting at Medium. Every other visual option is maxed out.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nGears Tactics\nGears Tactics puts it own brutal, fast-paced spin on the XCOM-like genre. This Unreal Engine 4-powered game was built from the ground up for DirectX 12, and we love being able to work a tactics-style game into our benchmarking suite. Better yet, the game comes with a plethora of graphics options for PC snobs. More games should devote such loving care to explaining what flipping all these visual knobs mean.\nYou can\u2019t use the presets to benchmark Gears Tactics, as it intelligently scales to work best on your installed hardware, meaning that \u201cUltra\u201d on one graphics card can load different settings than \u201cUltra\u201d on a weaker card. We manually set all options to their highest possible settings.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nMetro Exodus\nOne of the best games of 2019, Metro Exodus is one of the best-looking games around, too. The latest version of the 4A Engine provides incredibly luscious, ultra-detailed visuals, with one of the most stunning real-time ray tracing implementations released yet. We test in DirectX 12 mode with ray tracing, Hairworks, and DLSS disabled for our basic benchmarks.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nWolfenstein: Youngblood\nWolfenstein: Youngblood is more fun if you can play cooperatively with a buddy, but it\u2019s a fearless experiment\u2014and an absolute technical showcase. Running on the Vulkan API, Youngblood achieves blistering frame rates, and it supports all sorts of cutting-edge technologies like ray tracing, DLSS 2.0, HDR, GPU culling, asynchronous computing, and Nvidia\u2019s Content Adaptive Shading. The game includes a built-in benchmark with two different scenes; we tested Lab X.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nStrange Brigade\nStrange Brigade\u00a0is a cooperative third-person shooter where a team of adventurers blasts through hordes of mythological enemies. It\u2019s a technological showcase, built around the next-gen Vulkan and DirectX 12 technologies and infused with features like HDR support and the ability to toggle asynchronous compute on and off. It uses Rebellion\u2019s custom Azure engine. We test using the Vulkan renderer, which is faster than DX12.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nTotal War: Troy\nThe latest game in the popular Total War saga, Troy was given away free for its first 24 hours on the Epic Games Store, moving over 7.5 million copies before it went on proper sale. Total War: Troy is built using a modified version of the Total War: Warhammer 2 engine, and this DX11 title looks stunning for a turn-based strategy game.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\u00a0concludes the reboot trilogy, and it\u2019s utterly\u00a0gorgeous. Square Enix optimized this game for DX12, and recommends DX11 only if you\u2019re using older hardware or Windows 7, so we test with DX12.\u00a0Shadow of the Tomb Raider\u00a0uses an enhanced version of the Foundation engine that also powered\u00a0Rise of the Tomb Raider. It includes optional real-time ray tracing and DLSS features.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nRainbow Six Siege\nLike GTA V, Ubisoft\u2019s Rainbow Six Siege still dominates the Steam charts years after its launch, and it\u2019ll be getting a visual upgrade for the next-gen consoles. The developers have poured a ton of work into the game\u2019s AnvilNext engine over the years, eventually rolling out a Vulkan version of the game that we use to test. By default, the game lowers the render scaling to increase frame rates, but we set it to 100 percent to benchmark native rendering performance on graphics cards. Even still, frame rates soar.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nFinal thoughts and analysis\nEven with all the eye candy cranked to maximum, the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti managed to achieve the 60-frames-per-second gold standard in every game but Watch Dogs Legion and Total War: Troy. The maxed-out presets in those games are especially tough, however, and Nvidia\u2019s card managed to clear 50 fps even under those difficult conditions. Dropping things from Ultra to High would send frame rates soaring beyond 60 fps (and is something I recommend most gamers do in most games), or you could tinker with individual graphics options to achieve the same result. Less strenuous titles like Strange Brigade, Rainbow Six Siege, and Wolfenstein Youngblood blow well past the 100-fps mark.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$520 at  Newegg \n\n\n\n\n\nThose are outstanding results for a $400 graphics card. Again: This level of performance cost twice as much last generation.\n\nIf you wanted a little more oomph to get closer to 60 fps without minor visual compromises in punishing titles, consider the step-up $500 GeForce RTX 3070. It\u2019s not a worthwhile upgrade for most folks on a standard 1440p monitor, offering just 9- to 13-percent more performance than the RTX 3060 Ti while costing 25 percent more, but that uplift increases to about 17 percent in many games at 3440\u00d71440 resolution. Nvidia\u2019s Ampere architecture scales better at higher resolutions. If you have an ultrawide monitor, it\u2019s worth thinking about, as it\u2019s a more tangible difference.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nNvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition.\n\n\nSpending even more on a graphics card will get you even more frames, but crucially, it will also get you more memory. In our GeForce RTX 3060 Ti review, we praised the card\u2019s 8GB of GDDR6 memory for 1440p gaming, but fretted that it might not hold up well over the long term for 4K gaming. The 8GB capacity should hold up better for ultrawide gaming in the years to come, because 3440\u00d71440 splits the difference between 4K and 1440p.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nNixeus EDG 34\u201d Ultrawide 3440 x 1440 1500R Curved Gaming Monitor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$443.13 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019d feel comfortable buying this graphics card for use with an ultrawide monitor, because I don\u2019t mind fine-tuning textures and other visual graphical options if\u2014if\u2014it winds up becoming needed. If you\u2019d be more comfortable with more VRAM, check out the $700 RTX 3080, $1,500 RTX 3090, or AMD\u2019s rival Radeon RX 6800-series options. (The RTX 3070 offers the same 8GB of GDDR6 as the RTX 3060 Ti.) You could also wait to see what AMD will eventually offer in this price range, as those Radeon 6800-series GPUs pack in much more memory than their GeForce competition. AMD could keep the trend going with more affordable releases.\nThat about wraps this up. Again, check out our full GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition review for more detailed info on Nvidia\u2019s 2080 Super-usurping stunner. Give the $550 Nixeus EDG34S a serious look\u00a0if you\u2019re planning on upgrading to 144Hz 3440\u00d71440 to go with it.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tPCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Notice\nEuropean Privacy Settings\nMember Preferences\nEditorial independence\nLicensing & Eprints\nCalifornia: Do not Sell my Personal Info\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nAd Choice\nContact Us\nFoundry Careers\nGamePro\nSmart Answers\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPCWorld Categories \n\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe \n\n\n\n\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 IDG Communications, Inc. \n\n\n\nExplore the Foundry Network +\nTech AdvisorMacworld \n\n\n\n\nTop Of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDo Not Sell My Info\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Settings\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Simply download the latest game ready driver (460.79), find Cyberpunk 2077, and click Optimise to automatically configure the best combination of image quality and performance settings.\n\nClick on the Home tab in GeForce Experience (it defaults to home page already)\nFind Cyberpunk 2077, hover over the game tile, and click Details\nClick Optimise\nIf you want to customize what the game is Optimised for, click the wrench next to the Optimise button and use the slider to set to your preferred optimization settings.\n\nAlternatively, we have prepared three fairly massive charts that will show you the optimal graphics settings based on your RTX GPU and resolution. You may download them below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep up on the latest Cyberpunk 2077 RTX trailers, screenshots, and general news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\n#SHOTWITHGEFORCE\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United Kingdom\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

To take full advantage of the new possibilities ray tracing introduced in the free 1.16.200 update for Minecraft for Windows 10, physically-based textures have also been introduced, featuring extra surface detail, the ability to emit light, and more. To further enhance the visual experience of RTX, creators can also define their own settings for the fog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay Tracing Off (PBR Enabled Textures)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay Tracing On (Same PBR Enabled Textures)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this guide, we\u2019ll walk you through the steps of creating your own Minecraft PBR textures, or upgrading your existing textures and texture packs, so that your ray-traced Minecraft worlds take full advantage of everything that Bedrock Minecraft brings to the table.\nIn addition, we\u2019ll demonstrate how you can create your own high-resolution textures for worlds made of lifelike high definition blocks, and offer an alternative, simpler, easier workflow using the premium Substance Painter application.\nLastly, we\u2019ll cover the system for setting up your own definition for the custom fog to polish off your custom PBR-enhanced resource pack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a guide on how to convert your world, head here. And to ensure you have optimal gaming experiences, download the latest Game Ready Driver for Minecraft for Windows 10 For more information on Minecraft with ray tracing, check out the Mojang Studios FAQs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinecraft Texturing Overview\nMost texture files in vanilla Minecraft (Bedrock) only use 2 maps: base color and opacity. The base color map is stored in the RGB channels of the texture. This is the texture map that most people think of when talking about Minecraft textures.\nSome textures also have an additional opacity map that is either stored in the alpha channel (for .TGA texture files) or stored implicitly (for .PNG texture files). For Minecraft with RTX, you\u2019ll want to use .TGA files with alpha channels for opacity maps. More on that later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new PBR system uses these 2 maps, as well as 5 additional ones, to help describe the realistic material surface that is being represented by the texture:\n\nMetallic map (sometimes called \u201cmetalness\u201d)\nEmissive map\nRoughness map\nNormal\nHeight map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsset Flow\nThis is how the various PBR texture maps relate to objects in the game:\n6 PBR Texture Maps >packed into> 3 Texture Files (.PNG) >defined by a> Texture Set >for each> Block/Item/Object\nCurrently, each of the 6 PBR maps get packed into the channels of 3 texture files, which are then used by the game. Packing the maps reduces the overall file size and number of files of the new texture set. The texture set must be defined by a JSON file.\nFor example, for a PBR version of the \u201cgold_ore\u201d block:\n\nTexture set JSON = gold_ore.texture_set.json\n\nFile names or value-uniforms for up to 3 layers.\nThe JSON schema is explored in the Texture Set JSON Schema section.\n \nTexture file 1 = gold_ore.png\n\nRed, Green, and Blue (RGB) channels = Base Color map\nAlpha (A) channel = None. Not used for this specific texture set since the gold_ore block is intended to be fully opaque.\nNote: Texture sets that do use opacity maps can store them in this alpha channel. See the Opacity Maps section.\n \nTexture file 2 = gold_ore_mer.png\n\nRed channel = Metallic map (grayscale)\nGreen channel = Emissive map (grayscale)\nBlue channel = Roughness map (grayscale)\nAlpha (A) channel = None. Alpha is ignored, texture image may be 3-channel on disk to save space in a resource pack.\nThe \u201c*_mer\u201d suffix is just a reminder that the Metallic, Emissive, and Roughness maps go into the RGB channels, respectively.\n \nTexture file 3 (option 1)= gold_ore_normal.png\n\nRGB channels = Normal map\nNote: mutually exclusive with use of heightmap layer.\nAlpha (A) channel = None. Not used at this time\n \nTexture file 3 (option 2) = gold_ore_heightmap.png\n\nNote: mutually exclusive with use of normal layer. See the Height Maps subsection of the New PBR Texture Maps section.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA and Partner Resource Packs\nThe fourteen, free Minecraft with RTX ray tracing worlds include creator-made PBR resource packs that you can check out. These upgrade textures to follow the Physically Based Rendering pipeline laid out below, and are optimized for maximum performance and detail.\nNVIDIA has also released a new resource pack that\u2019s compatible with the latest version of Minecraft with RTX, and has been updated February 2nd, 2021. Download here, then double click the file and it should automatically be installed for use in-game.\nTo use, download the file and double click the .mcpack file, and it should automatically add the resource pack to your world and enable you to play with RTX ON!\nThere are also two previously released packs from April 2020 which can be used to experiment with textures (CAUTION: These packs may break the RTX experience in the latest version of Minecraft with RTX). HD Decorative Resource Pack and HD Foundational Resource Pack, were created by NVIDIA, but they should not be activated at the same time. If you do activate them at the same time, you will see a resource pack fall back resulting in other textures down-rezzing. \u00a0\nWith these packs, you will be able to experiment with both high-resolution textures (1024x1024) and low-resolution textures (8x8 or 16x16) with PBR capabilities.\nFurther, to demonstrate the possibilities of the new Minecraft PBR textures, we\u2019ve worked with Razzleberries to create the RTX Expo Museum world, a large Smithsonian-esque museum showcasing every enhancement, benefit, and improvement offered by Minecraft with RTX. As you stroll through the world, you\u2019ll see how PBR textures work in concert with ray tracing to enable a level of detail and fidelity that was previously impossible to achieve with traditional rasterization and effects.\nAnd if you make your own textures, you can quickly and easily test them in this world by overwriting the existing textures, accelerating your workflow and iteration speed.\nIn addition, we\u2019ve worked with some of the planet\u2019s best Minecrafters to develop fourteen free Creator Worlds that feature top to bottom path tracing, and PBR texturing, giving you ideas for your own worlds and textures. Download them from the Minecraft Marketplace in-game by searching for \u201cRTX\u201d, or follow the download links here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHopefully, these stunning showcases will provide you with inspiration for your own PBR textures and ray-traced world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTools Needed\nTo create your own PBR texture sets, you will need a photo-editing/digital painting application. Here are a few excellent options:\n\nAdobe Photoshop\nGIMP\nPaint.net\nPixlr.com\nGraphicsGale, etc.\n\nYou will also need a quick plaintext file editor to write your texture set JSON, the default text editor for your operating system will work, but Sublime Text is a good alternative as it supports syntax coloring.\nThis guide will cover the Photoshop workflow specifically, but the concepts should transfer to other digital painting applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpacity Maps\nPay special care to the colors that get stored under the alpha channel as on blocks like Glass, the colors will still apply even if masked by full transparency. To mitigate this, ensure the color is fully white, and save the image as a 32-bits/pixel .TGA file to ensure consistency and avoid an unexpected surprise from PNG image exporters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: In the initial release of Minecraft with RTX, the client will use the same textures for both RTX enabled and disabled. This means that an opacity value that is tuned for RTX enabled might look too transparent when RTX is disabled.\u00a0 To help balance this out, the game will only use the upper half of the range of the texture\u2019s alpha channel (0.5 - 1) when RTX is enabled, but it will map this range to the full range of opacity in the game so no functionality is lost. For RTX disabled, the full range of the alpha channel will be mapped to the full range opacity in the game.\nExamples:\nIf the texture\u2019s alpha channel value = 0 (black), then:\nFor RTX enabled in the game, texture opacity =\u00a0 0 (fully transparent)\nFor RTX disabled in the game, texture opacity = 0 (fully transparent) \u00a0\nIf the texture\u2019s alpha channel value = 0.5 (middle gray), then:\nFor RTX enabled in the game, texture opacity =\u00a0 0 (still fully transparent)\nFor RTX disabled in the game, texture opacity = 0.5 (50% opaque)\n\u00a0\nIf the texture\u2019s alpha channel value = 0.75 (light gray), then:\nFor RTX enabled in the game, texture opacity =\u00a0 0.5 (50% opaque)\nFor RTX disabled in the game, texture opacity = 0.75 (75% opaque)\n\u00a0\nIf the texture\u2019s alpha channel value = 1 (white), then:\nFor RTX enabled in the game, texture opacity =\u00a0 1 (fully opaque)\nFor RTX disabled in the game, texture opacity = 1 (fully opaque)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexture Set JSON Schema\nTo begin your PBR enhancements for any texture, you must start it off with a JSON file to define the PBR settings. For further info and documentation, head to the official Minecraft.net page.\nThe JSON schema is defined as follows:\n\nformat_version: The schema version this JSON was written for.\nminecraft:texture_set:\u00a0 The material definitions for the PBR Texture\n\ncolor: Your base color layer.\n\nThis can be a quoted image file name reference (PNG, TGA, or JPG file types allowed), with or without file extension.\nIt can also be a comma-separated square bracketed list of 3 or 4 values of Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha to set the whole texture as a uniform color. These values can range between 0 and 255.\nIt can also be an ARGB hex value as a string beginning with the # character.\nThis layer is required and your texture will be a pink/black checkerboard otherwise.\n \nmetalness_emissive_roughness: Your texture containing metallicity, emissivity, and roughness information.\n\nThis can be a quoted image file name reference (PNG, TGA, or JPG file types allowed), with or without file extension.\nIt can also be a square bracketed list of 3 values for metallicity, emissivity, and roughness to set the texture uniformly. These values can range between 0 and 255.\nIt can also be an RGB hex value as a string beginning with the # character.\nExcluding this layer will result in the texture having a non-metallic matte look.\n \nnormal: Your material containing per-pixel normals for the texture.\n\nThis can only be a quoted filename reference (PNG, TGA, or JPG file types allowed), with or without\u00a0 file extension.\nIt is mutually exclusive with heightmap.\n \nheightmap: Your material containing per-pixel heights for the texture.\n\nThis can only be a quoted filename reference (PNG, TGA, or JPG file types allowed), with or without file extension.\nIt is mutually exclusive with normal.\n \n \n\nFor the file name, take the name of the original texture without the extension and add it to the beginning of .texture_set.json, for instance, gold_ore.texture_set.json, for the gold_ore.png. Then the JSON file goes into the same folder.\nHere is an example JSON file following the texture set schema, also demonstrating the correct value usage for each definition:\n{  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"format_version\": \"1.16.100\",  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"minecraft:texture_set\": {  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"color\": [118, 185, 0, 255],  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"metalness_emissive_roughness\": \u201c#0008FF\u201d,  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"normal\": \"an_example_normal\"  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 }  }\nFurther details on each of these texture set attributes are explained in depth in the following.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew PBR Texture Maps\nThe PBR system doesn\u2019t require you to use all of the PBR maps for every texture set. However, you will get the best looking results if you do.\n\nMetallic map - How metallic is a pixel in your texture:\n\nValue of 0 (black) means non-metallic (wool, wood, plastic, dirt, grass. etc.)\nValue of 1 (white) means fully metallic (gold, iron, copper, etc.)\nGrayscale values between 0 and 1 can also be used. Values other than black or white will function, but are usually incorrect in PBR rendering.\u00a0 A well-made metallic map will usually contain black and white pixels only.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, the block has uniform roughness on all of its surfaces, but it is using a metallic map to control which pixels are metallic (white), and which pixels are non-metallic (black). The metallic pixels look more like gold while the non-metallic pixels look more like shiny, yellow plastic.\n\nEmissive map - How much a pixel in your texture should glow:\n\nValue of 0 (black) means no glow\nValue of 1 (white) means the strongest glow\nGrayscale values between 0 and 1 can also be used\nThe Color of the glow is determined by the pixels in the base color map\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoughness map - How rough (to the touch) is a pixel in your texture:\n\nValue of 0 (black) means very smooth (glass, polished stone, etc.)\nValue of 1 (white) means very rough (dry dirt, bark, wool, etc.)\nGrayscale values between 0 and 1 can also be used\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, the block has uniform metalness on all of its surfaces, but it is using a roughness map to control which pixels are very rough (white), which pixels are very smooth (black), and some pixels that are somewhere in between (gray). The smooth, less rough pixels look more like shiny blue gemstones while the rough pixels look more like rough gray rock.\n\nNormal map - how raised is a pixel in your texture \n\nNormal maps use the 3 color channels (RGB) in the texture to change how light behaves when hitting the texture. By doing this, it can fake surface details that appear to stick up or recede down into the surface of the 3D mesh.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRGB values of (128, 128, 255) means the pixel doesn\u2019t stick up or recede down when lit. It will appear at the height of the surface of the 3D mesh. When in doubt, use this default color for your normal map, or don\u2019t use one at all to save on file size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRGB values other than this default color (above) should not be manually painted unless you\u2019re confident working with normal maps this way. Normal maps are usually automatically generated from other height information when using specific software applications. More details can be found later in this document.\n\nHeight map - alternative to a normal map for giving pixels height or depth.\nHeight maps have some limitations and should only be used for pixelated texture sets like the 16x16 pixel vanilla Minecraft textures. If you\u2019re painting non-pixelated textures, consider using a normal map instead of a heightmap.\n\nHeightmaps use a 1 color channel (grayscale) in the texture to change how light behaves when hitting the texture.\nR channel values mean the pixel sticks up or recedes inward.\n\nValue of 1 means the pixel will appear to stick out\nValue of 0 means the pixel will recede inward\nValue of 0.5 means no surface change\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefining the Texture Set\nFirst things first, let\u2019s start our PBR texture set for the Gold Ore block before we start texturing our example, with the gold_ore.texture_set.json texture set JSON:\n{\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"format_version\": \"1.16.100\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"minecraft:texture_set\": {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"color\": \"gold_ore\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"metalness_emissive_roughness\": \"gold_ore_mer\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"normal\": \"gold_ore_normal\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating the Base Color and Opacity Texture File\nDefining the Texture Set\nFirst things first, let\u2019s start our PBR texture set for the Gold Ore block before we start texturing our example, with the gold_ore.texture_set.json texture set JSON: { \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"format_version\": \"1.16.100\", \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"minecraft:texture_set\": { \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"color\": \"gold_ore\", \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"metalness_emissive_roughness\": \"gold_ore_mer\", \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"normal\": \"gold_ore_normal\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 } } \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating the Base Color and Opacity Texture File\nLet\u2019s create custom base color and opacity maps:\n1. Open a vanilla Minecraft texture in the app as a starting point, or skip to Step 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Create a new document at the texture resolution that you want. (16x16 pixels for most vanilla Minecraft textures) Also, 72 pixels/inch is recommended for the pixel density.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Create working layers for the base color and opacity map (if needed). Paint what you want and make any edits in these layers. In the example below, multiple layers have been painted to edit the base color map (more gold!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Once you have the base color and opacity map layers looking the way you want, it\u2019s a good idea to save your Photoshop document using the name of the object\u2019s texture set.  For this example, this file was saved as \u201cgold_ore.PSD\u201d. Next, we need to save out a texture file that the game can use.\nNote: For most game objects, transparent pixels in the opacity map must also be painted black in the base color map (e.g. tree leaves). However, there are exceptions where the transparent pixels must also be painted white in the base color map in order to appear correct in the game (e.g. rails). Some experimentation may be necessary. \n5. (Optional, for non-opaque objects only) - Duplicate your opacity map layers, merge the duplicates together to create a single layer, and then copy it (Ctrl+C).\n6. (Optional, for non-opaque objects only) - In the Channels tab, create a new alpha channel, and paste (Ctrl+V) your merged opacity map into this channel. Click on the small gray box to the left of the RGB channel to make the RGB channels visible again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou now have your base color map being stored in the RGB channels and the opacity map stored in the alpha channel.\n7. (Optional, for non-opaque objects only) - Go back to the Layers tab and hide any of your opacity map layers. Only your base color map layers should be showing.\n8. Re-save the .PSD.\n9. Use the Save As command to save a .PNG texture file that can be used by the game. \nNote on opacity: You will save out a 32-bits/pixel .TGA file at this step if your object is intended to be non-opaque and uses an opacity map in the alpha channel. See the Opacity Maps section above.\nNote on naming: File naming is important at this step! This .PNG should have the same name as the game object that you are modifying. For this example, this file was saved as \u201cgold_ore.PNG\u201d.\n10. You have successfully created the first of 3 texture files for a complete PBR texture set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating the Metallic, Emissive, and Roughness Texture File\nNext, you\u2019ll want to create the second PBR texture file combining the metallic, emissive, and roughness PBR maps.\n1. (Optional) Open a vanilla Minecraft texture in Photoshop or a similar app as a starting point, or skip to the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Create a new document at the same texture resolution as your first texture file (base color and opacity map). (16x16 pixels for most vanilla Minecraft textures) Again, 72 pixels/inch is recommended for the pixel density.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Create working layers for the metallic, emissive, and roughness map. Paint what you want and make any edits in these layers.\nNote: You only need to paint these maps using grayscale values.\nIn the example below, multiple layers have been painted to create the desired roughness map result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Make sure to place layers of each map type into layer groups. This is important for the next few steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Right-click on the Metallic layer group and select \u201cBlending Options\u201d.\n6. Uncheck the green (G) and blue (B) channels:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Click \u201cOK\u201d to close the Blending Options window for the Metallic layer group.\n8. Right-click on the Emissive layer group and select \u201cBlending Options\u201d.\n9. Uncheck the red (R) and blue (B) channels:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Click \u201cOK\u201d to close the Blending Options window for the Emissive layer group.\n11. Right-click on the Roughness layer group and select \u201cBlending Options\u201d.\n12. Uncheck the red (R) and green (G) channels:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13. Click \u201cOK\u201d to close the Blending Options window for the Roughness layer group.\n14. Once you have the metallic, emissive, and roughness map layers looking the way you want, it\u2019s a good idea to save your Photoshop document using the name of the object\u2019s texture set with the addition of the *_mer suffix.\nFor this example, this file was saved as \u201cgold_ore_mer.PSD\u201d. Next, we need to save out a texture file that the game can use.\n15. Use the Save As command to save a .PNG texture file that can be used by the game.\nNote: Again, file naming is important at this step. This .PNG file should have the same name as the game object that you are modifying with the addition of the *_mer suffix. For this example, the file was saved as \u201cgold_ore_mer.PNG\u201d.\n16. You have successfully created the second of 3 texture files for a complete PBR texture set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating the Normal Texture File\nNormal maps are usually created using specialised tools. There are many professional software options as well as some great, free alternatives available:\n\nFree Tool - xNormal\nAdobe Photoshop - Filters \u2192 3D \u2192 Generate Normal Map\nPBR Painting - Substance Painter\nPBR Painting - Quixel Mixer\n\nExample of a brick wall PBR texture set (left) and its normal map (right):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a normal map using your preferred tool or workflow at the same resolution as your first texture file (base color and opacity map). Again, 72 pixels/inch is recommended for the pixel density.\n\nUse the Save As command to save a .PNG texture file that can be used by the game. Note: Again, file naming is important at this step. This .PNG should have the same name as the game object that you are modifying with the addition of the *_normal suffix. For this example, the file was saved as \u201cgold_ore_normal.PNG\u201d.  If you\u2019re not familiar with creating normal maps, you can always just leave it out or create a \u201cblank\u201d normal map by filling a texture with (128, 128, 255) RGB color and saving the .PNG file.  Alternatively, since the \u201cgold_ore\u201d example is a pixelated texture, we could have also used the height map option to create surface details. The file name would still be \u201cgold_ore_normal.TGA\u201d in this example, but the information stored in the texture channels would be different. See the Height Maps subsection of the New PBR Texture Maps section above for more info. \n\nFinished! You have created the third and final texture file for a complete PBR texture set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternate Workflow: Using Photoshop\u2019s Generate Image Assets Function\nInstead of having 3 Photoshop .PSD files for each of the 3 PBR texture files, you could alternatively use a single .PSD file and take advantage of Photoshop\u2019s Generate \u2192 Image Assets function in the File menu. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs long as you create a layer group for each PBR texture file and name it with the correct file name and file type (.png), they will save themselves automatically after each change (after you initially save the .PSD file).\nMore information can be found here.\nNote: Since this function cannot output .TGA files, you won\u2019t be able to use it to save a texture file with an alpha channel like those needed for non-opaque texture sets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaveats for Creating Mirrors with Perfect Reflections\nUsing PBR maps like metalness and roughness along with ray tracing, you can create highly reflective materials like shiny plastics, smooth metal, or polished stone. All of these will have high quality reflections.\nHowever, for perfectly reflective objects like mirrors, you\u2019ll want to configure your PBR maps to enable a perfect mirror.\u00a0 If you use a solid black roughness map (0.0) and a solid white (1.0) metalness map, the game will interpret your material as a perfect mirror. This means that the ray tracing code can take some shorter paths during its calculations since it knows that the material will fully reflect the environment without any additional details to take into account.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Create PBR Textures in Substance by Adobe\nIf you have access to the Substance Painter app, you can create higher resolution PBR texture sets in a much more intuitive manner. This software lets you see all of the maps of your PBR texture set displayed in real-time on mesh geometry. This allows you to tune your texture maps as you work without having to launch the game, move any files around, or modify channels.\n1. Launch the application and select New Project from the File menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Template = Unreal Engine 4 - This will automatically set a variety of application and viewer settings. Feel free to try other options or make your own template!\n3. File \u2192 Select - This is where you select what mesh you would like to display and paint your textures on. For Minecraft with RTX, using a 1 meter by 1 meter cube mesh with just 6 faces (no subdivisions) will give you an exact preview of how your textures will look when mapped onto a block in the game. Using the .FBX mesh format is recommended.\n4. Document Resolution - This is the texture resolution that you\u2019re targeting. Note: This setting can be changed later non-destructively at any time. For HD textures, it\u2019s recommended to work at 1024 - you\u2019ll get lots of detail in your textures with minimal pixelation, the app will run nice and fast on most PC setups, and your HD textures should look sharp in the game.\nIf you\u2019ve only ever worked with textures in vanilla Minecraft, you\u2019ll notice that you can\u2019t select 16 pixels by 16 pixels here for your resolution (the lowest is 128). However, you can always author and export textures at 128x128 (or larger) and scale them down later in an image-editing application like Photoshop.\n5. Normal Map Format = DirectX (leave as default)\n6. Compute Tangent Space Per Fragment = True (leave as default)\n7. Add - (Optional) Here you can choose to import any supporting textures that you already have completed. If replacing a vanilla Minecraft texture with an HD version, it can be helpful to import the vanilla texture here for use as a reference. Note: This import step can also be performed later at any time. For this example, the vanilla \u201ciron_block\u201d texture file is going to be imported when the new project is created to be used as a reference.\n8. Click \u201cOK\u201d. The application should open this new project that you\u2019re creating and look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. It\u2019s a good idea to add the emissive map to your texture set list at this point. Even if your texture set isn\u2019t going to use emissivity, don\u2019t worry, it will default to black (0.0) and won\u2019t hurt anything. Note: You can also add an opacity map to your texture set list in the same way if you\u2019re planning on creating a non-fully opaque texture set. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. (Optional) Next, add your texture reference to a new fill layer in the Base Color slot. You\u2019ll find your imported reference texture on the Shelf under the Project heading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayers are automatically set to bilinear filtering when created, which can make pixelated textures like vanilla Minecraft textures look blurry. To correct this, just set the layer\u2019s Filtering to Nearest. However, if you\u2019re not using pixelated textures, leave your layer filtering on the default setting of bilinear HQ.  From here, it\u2019s also a good idea to set this reference layer to have full roughness (1.0), no metalness (0.0), and no emissivity (black: 0, 0, 0). This will make sure that the reference texture is displayed in Painter as close to the vanilla game as it can be.  Note: If you didn\u2019t import reference textures or other resources when you created the project, you can do so at any time using the Import Resources button on the Shelf. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11. Now is a great time to save your project. It\u2019s recommended to name your Painter project after the game object whose texture set you are replacing. For this example, this project file has been saved as \u201ciron_block.SPP\u201d. Naming your project this way will make things easier when exporting your texture set later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12. From here, you can create your texture set with all of its PBR maps as you see fit.  In this example, a new fill layer was added (with some adjustment sub-layers) to create a dark, high definition iron material. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13. Next, a new fill layer adding an indent detail to give the surface of the block some new character.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14. And finally, another fill layer to add some dirt collecting in the corners of the indent and some scratches randomly across the surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15. Re-save as needed.  16. Now that the whole texture set is looking great inside Painter, you need to export your textures. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Select: File \u2192 Export Textures to open the export subwindow.  17. Create a new export preset configuration like this, which will output your texture set in a way that can be used by the game build. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the \u201c$project\u201d prefix on each output map will name each of the exported texture files after the name of the project. So, if you named your project after the game object that this texture set will belong to, all of your exported textures will immediately be ready for use in the game without any additional renaming.  18. Once you have your export preset set up, select it in the \u201cConfig\u201d field and use these recommended settings:  Location - This can be the textures location for the resource pack that you\u2019re working on. This makes things easier because you can export textures from Painter and they will immediately show up or be updated in the same folder that the game is referencing when it runs (assuming that you have your resource pack activated in the game).  PNG - Use this setting to ensure that your files can be used by the game and that they are as small and efficient as possible.  Texture set resolution - This is the size of the textures that will be exported. This setting is independent of the resolution of your project. So, if you want you work on your project at one resolution and then export files at another resolution. 1024x1024 is recommended for HD texture sets. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: The example above is for a fully opaque texture set. If you are using an opacity map in your texture set list for transparency, you will want to export your base color map as a targa (.TGA) file (instead of a .PNG) with the opacity map being stored in the alpha channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19. Re-save your project! This will save your export settings as well, which will make your workflow much faster as you do further iterations with your texture set.\n20. Finished! You have created your first set of HD PBR textures for Minecraft with RTX!

This fog stack is ordered by lowest priority to highest:\n\nHardcoded Engine defaults\nData Default settings from \u201cdefault\u201d object within biomes_client.json\nPer-Biome settings in biomes_client.json\n/fog Command\n\nBoth biomes_client.json and /fog Command refer to Fog Definitions which are defined in JSON with the \u201cfog\u201d folder of Resource Packs.\nFog Definitions\nEach Fog Definition is a JSON file in the \u201cfog\u201d folder of a Resource Pack. An example looks like:\n{ \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"format_version\": \"1.16.2100\", \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"minecraft:fog_settings\": { \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"description\": { \"identifier\": \"nvidia:example_fog\" }, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"distance\": { \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"air\": { \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"fog_start\": 0.92, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"fog_end\": 1.0, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"fog_color\": \"#ABD2FF\", \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"render_distance_type\": \"render\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 } \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 }, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"volumetric\": { \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"max_density\": { \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"air\": { \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"max_density\": 0.1, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"max_density_height\": 56, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"zero_density_height\": 70 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 } \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 }, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"media_coefficients\": { \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"air\": { \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"scattering\": [ 0.02, 0.02, 0.02 ], \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"absorption\": [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 } \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 } \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 } \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 } } \nThe schema for a Fog Definition.\n\nformat_version: The schema version this JSON was written for.\nminecraft:fog_settings: An entry for the fog definition.\n\nDescription\n\nidentifier: A quoted unique name, prefixed with a namespace followed by a colon.

If the VRAY benchmark (via Videocardz) is anything to by (and it is), the card doubles the performance of the RTX 2080 SUPER (well, 90% uplift to be precise) and offers almost the same graphics horsepower as a desktop-class RTX 2080 Ti!\nNVIDIA RTX 3070 mobility almost as powerful as a desktop RTX 2080 Ti\nWe exclusively revealed NVIDIA's mobility lineup a while ago and we know the company is planning up to an RTX 3080 to roll out with Intel and AMD's brand new CPUs in March 2021. Keep in mind, however, that the new RTX series has higher TGP envelopes and will consume more power than the last generation - although you will get much higher absolute performance from the same.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB MemoryWithout any further ado, here are the benchmarks for the NVIDIA RTX 3070 laptop:\n\nAs you can see, the RTX 3070 laptop GPU gets a score of 1394 on VRAY. In comparison, the older RTX 2070 manages a score of 701 vrays and the RTX 2080 SUPER manages a score of 733 vrays. The desktop RTX 3070 gets a score of 1861 vrays so this is a reduction of just 25% when going from the power-hungry desktop platform to laptops. According to videocardz, the estimated TGP (not TDP) of the RTX 3070 will be between 80 to 90W while the RTX 3080 will slot in at 115W to 150W (which is absolutely massive for a mobility GPU).\nNVIDIA RTX 3080 and 3070 mobility GPUs landing in January 2021 in ASUS and MSI laptops, rest to follow in April\nLet's start with NVIDIA's complete mobility lineup and roadmap for the first half of 2021. The company is planning to introduce RTX 3080, RTX 3070, and RTX 3060 GPUs to replace its SUPER lineup and the RTX 2060. For the first half of 2021, NVIDIA does not plan to replace the GTX 1660 Ti, GTX 1650 Ti, and the GTX 1650. The full-stack and the parts they will replace is given in the slide below (all slides in the article have been recreated on a 1-1 basis to remove those pesky Fourier transform watermarks):\n\n\nFull-stack of NVIDIA's RTX 30 series mobility lineup for 1H 2021.\n\nWe have been told that the RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 mobility GPUs will be fast-tracked to land in January 2021, however, the GPUs will initially only be available in ASUS and MSI flavors. HP, Dell, and Lenovo have reportedly decided to wait until April to support these new GPUs as they want to pair it with launches that are happening then. Because of this, RTX 2080 SUPER and RTX 2070 SUPER mobility GPUs are expected to be EOL-ed in January 2021 (no word on the RTX 2070 mobility for now).\nThe GTX 1650 Ti and GTX 1660 Ti in 1H 2021 do not appear to be identical to the ones shipping now (notice NVIDIA chose to put them in a new box as opposed to the same box for the GTX 1650) although we are not at this time sure what the changes are going to be. My source also mentioned that they expect the RTX 30 mobility series to have a very short life cycle (considering there are rumors of NVIDIA planning to shift to 7nm TSMC for its SUPER variants of the RTX 30 lineup).\nGaming performance is going to get cheaper in laptops above the $999 mark thanks to NVIDIA's RTX 30 mobility series\nNow let's talk about the pricing a bit. NVIDIA expects laptops priced at or around $699 to have the GTX 1650, with the GTX 1650 Ti and GTX 1660 Ti coming in at units priced at $799-$899, RTX 3060 to take over above the $999 mark, RTX 3070 at $1299 and the RTX 3080 at $1999. Keep in mind these are only the manufacturer *suggested* pricing and there is no guarantee that we will actually see these in real-world pricing for all NVIDIA-based laptops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA's recommended laptop configurations for RTX 3000 series.\n\nHowever, according to my source, retailers that get significant subsidies from NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel (like Walmart) should be able to hit these prices fairly easily. Anyway you slice it however, gaming performance per dollar is going to come down after the $999 mark and you will see actual SKUs that hit these prices (likely from Walmart) in early 2021. Prices for the rest of the retailers, however, are likely going to be expensive at launch and won't normalize till the other vendors enter the ring in April 2021.\nNVIDIA's high-end mobility GPUs will finally be supporting AMD CPUs\nNVIDIA has also provided recommended specifications (laptops) for its mobility GPUs in the presentation and one major announcement here is the support for the next generation of AMD Ryzen with its high-end GPU lineup. Because of the PCIe bottleneck on Renoir, you could only get up to an RTX 2060 with an AMD CPU. Once the AMD 5000 series (Cezzane-H) lands, however, this is going to change with NVIDIA high-end GPUs freely available equally on AMD and Intel parts (TigerLake H). This is going to result in a lot more sales for both NVIDIA and AMD as people who want an AMD CPU coupled with an NVIDIA GPU (in the high-end segment) can finally do so.\nWe have also heard from these AIBs that they want to get rid of the excess inventory of RTX 2000 series (especially the high end), so we might see some great deals in the holiday season (especially around Black Friday and Cyber Monday) as AIBs try to get rid of the excess inventory before the RTX 30 series lands in January 2021\u00a0 - so if you are looking for a discount deal, be sure to check them out. One thing is clear: 2021 is shaping up to be a very exciting year for tech enthusiasts - especially those looking to upgrade their laptops.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n137\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n84\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n78\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n52\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n49\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Faster Than RTX 2080 SUPER\n\n\t\t\t\t\n                    \n                     By Andrew Burnes on December 01, 2020\n                \n\t\t\t\t | \n\t\t\t\t\t\nFeatured Stories\nGeForce RTX GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, the first member of the RTX 3060 family, is coming December 2nd. Faster than the RTX 2080 SUPER, and beating the RTX 2060 SUPER by an average of 40%, the new RTX 3060 Ti is a tremendous addition to the GeForce RTX 30 Series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether you\u2019re playing rasterized games or cutting-edge ray-traced titles, or powering through creator and productivity workflows, the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti delivers the best possible experience in its class.\nThis is possible thanks to the advanced NVIDIA Ampere Architecture, featuring 2nd Generation Ray Tracing Cores, 3rd Generation Tensor Cores for AI, and critically acclaimed tech like NVIDIA DLSS, NVIDIA Reflex, and NVIDIA Broadcast. These technologies improve your gaming, accelerate your gameplay, make voice chat clearer and better, and enhance your video calls with friends, family and colleagues.\nNo other platform offers these advantages - if you want the best possible experience, whether that\u2019s in a game, productivity task, creative workflow, or simply when chatting and video calling, GeForce RTX is the only game in town.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year we\u2019ve worked hand in hand with CD PROJEKT RED, Activision, Ubisoft and others to bring immersive, game-changing ray-traced effects to Cyberpunk 2077, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Watch Dogs: Legion, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve also brought performance accelerating NVIDIA DLSS technology to over 25 games, and more are adding this transformative, sought-after tech every month. Better performance, as-good-as or better anti-aliasing and visual clarity, and other improvements make it a no-brainer, giving GeForce RTX gamers massively faster frame rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of the year, nearly a dozen games will have adopted our newest technology, NVIDIA Reflex. This reduces system latency (\u2018input lag\u2019), making games more responsive, giving players in competitive multiplayer titles an extra edge over the opposition -- hopefully leading to more kills and wins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith NVIDIA Broadcast, an evolution of the highly regarded RTX Voice beta app, we have audio and video AI enhancements you can apply to your Discord chats, Skype calls and video meetings. And now, we have released the technology powering NVIDIA Broadcast to our partners so they can add these AI effects to their apps and give users more control.\nThis allows users to remove background noise per audio track in XSplit Broadcast, apply noise removal to videos in Adobe Premiere Pro with VoiceFX, do motion tracking with a simple webcam in Notch, and capture your content at 4K on a second PC without the need of a capture card with NDI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll this is to say that the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is just as feature-rich as the GeForce RTX 30 Series cards that came before it. It offers the same set of powerful features, with the industry\u2019s best ray tracing technology.

The GA102, which is featured inside the GeForce RTX 3090 and RTX 3080 and is also rumored to power the upcoming GeForce RTX 3080 Ti.With a die size of 628.4 mm-squared, the GA102 is, by far, Nvidia's biggest mainstream Ampere gaming silicon. Fabricated on an optimized version of Samsung's 8nm process, the GA102 bears an impressive 28.3 billion transistors. Building on Nvidia's microarchitectures, Ampere proudly carries the latest second-generation RT cores for ray tracing and third-generation Tensor cores for artificial intelligence workloads.(Image credit: Locuza)If you look very closely at the die shot, you'll see Ampere's specifications come to life. Twitter user Locuza has added annotations to Fritz's photographs for better visualization. The GA102, in particular, contains seven Graphics Processing Clusters (GPCs) whereby each GPC holds 12 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs). Therefore, the GA102 die has a grand total of 84 SMs. Consequently, each SM contains 128 CUDA cores, four Tensor cores and one RT cores. A complete GA102 die works out to 10,752 CUDA cores, 336 Tensor cores and 84 RT cores.Image 1 of 4Nvidia GA102 Ampere Die(Image credit: Fritzchens Fritz)Nvidia GA102 Ampere Die(Image credit: Locuza)Nvidia GA102 Ampere Die(Image credit: Locuza)Nvidia GA102 Ampere Die(Image credit: Fritzchens Fritz)Nvidia utilizes the GA102 silicon for various models. This helps the chipmaker maximize profits, since what doesn't meet the requirements for a certain SKU can be used for a lower-tier model instead.\u00a0 \u00a0So far, no Ampere-powered GeForce graphics card leverages the full GA102 die. The GeForce RTX 3090, which is the current flagship model and one of the best graphics cards for gamers, comes close, though, with 82 enabled SMs. The current configuration certainly leaves headroom for another SKU down the road should Nvidia see the need to release something faster than the GeForce RTX 3090 to rival AMD's Big Navi army. Knowing Nvidia's fighting spirit, we wouldn't be surprised if a GeForce RTX 3090 Ti or a Titan-grade model is already in the works.Today's best RTX 3080 deals $699.99View $749.99View $1,249View $1,259View No price informationCheck WalmartShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce\nGeForce RTX 3090\nGeForce RTX 3080\nray tracing\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (5)\n\n\n\nZhiye LiuSocial Links NavigationNews Editor and Memory ReviewerZhiye Liu is a news editor and memory reviewer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

On a die of this size, the yield would be noticeably reduced just to enable 100% of the chip instead of 98%, thus a big bump in price (from an already high price), just to get 2% extra performance. They introduced the 3090 as the Titan of Ampere, unless there is a refresh (that would be in at least a year), there won't be a more powerful Ampere GPU than the 3090.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsetx\n\n\nTokyoQuaSar said:I would be extremely surprised if they made a Titan on this generation, or that would be hard trolling imo.

Jennsen originally tapped Samsung's 8nm node (even though it was very slightly technically inferior to TSMC) because he foresaw the massive supply bottleneck that TSMC was turning into. While his reasoning was correct, the gamble does not appear to have paid off since Samsung's 8nm process suffered from low yields and a consequent lack of supply. Interestingly, there were reports a month or so back that Jensen had decided to go back to TSMC for its SUPER lineup (or whatever NVIDIA ends up calling it) but if this Korean story is correct - the second contract is also going to Samsung.\nSamsung lands another contract, worth billions, to make NVIDIA GPUs from Jensen- likely the RTX 30 SUPER series\nBefore we go any further, please do keep in mind that as of right now, this is just one source and could be wrong. Although the report is extremely confident about this contract being awarded to Samsung, some salt is good for a healthy digestive system.\u00a0 Back to the story, the report claims the contract was confirmed on December 17 (yesterday depending on where you are) and that while the exact value is unknown it is worth \"100s of billion won\" (100s of billion won translate to 91 million USD roughly). Samsung will reportedly be making the chips at its Hwaseong plant.\nNVIDIA's CEO Jensen has reportedly signed on Samsung for a second contract to produce its GPUs.\nIf this is true, then this would free up a lot of space at TSMC going forward as NVIDIA's GPUs become one less thing for them to produce - but more importantly - it will result in NVIDIA having an exceptional supply advantage if Samsung manages to fix their 8nm yield issues. Considering NVIDIA very obviously would have made an educated decision, this bodes very well for the industry because it seems they are confident in Samsung's ability to fix yield (*cough* I am looking at you Intel * cough*). The report further mentions that Samsung is looking to narrow the gap between TSMC in the coming years.\nThe key lithographic technology that matters in nodes below 10nm (or 14nm if you are using Intel standards) is something called EUV. EUV (or Extreme Ultra Violet) lithography allows the foundry to significantly reduce the difficulty of fabricating a certain node because the wavelength used in EUV is significantly lower than standard lithographic scanners. While double (or even triple/quad) patterning is required with standard wavelengths, you can achieve 8nm with a single pattern on EUV. The company mentions that they will be using EUV to create a 4nm process that will narrow the gap between TSMC and Samsung. The company is spending $8.6 billion USD to develop chip foundry tech and has no plans of dropping out of the leading edge race anytime soon.\nThis is great news for pretty much everyone (well, except TSMC) because a lowered load on TSMC means more AMD products for everyone and also means exponentially more supply available for NVIDIA by late 2021. It is unclear whether Samsung plans to fix their yield problems or will simply subsidize the bad yields for the company. In any case, it was essential for the company to retain NVIDIA as a client considering the clout of the company (and their demand for a leading edge process) and this is a situation in which everyone appears to have won. While there is no word on what GPUs will be manufactured in this second contract, we can assume the RTX 30 SUPER series will be part of this.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n102\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n98\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n55\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n44\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n32\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1479\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1156\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Or it would have if word of its arrival hadn't been plastered across the internet for months now. Yet even if it breaks convention, it is nonetheless a welcome addition to the RTX 30-series lineup: as a sub-$400 card, it's a far more affordable Ampere graphics card that its forebears.The cheapest of the lot up until now has been the Nvidia RTX 3070, and while being a great card for 1440p and 4K gaming it still necessitates a considerable chunk of change by way of its $499 (\u00a3469) price tag. The RTX 3060 Ti goes some some way to dropping required pay-grade for Ampere at $399 (\u00a3369).Of course its closest match remains the RTX 3070, and its similarity to the bigger sibling runs deeps. Both use a matching memory loadout\u20148GB of GDDR6\u2014and make use of the same GPU at their core, namely the GA104, fabricated on Samsung's 8nm process. The RTX 3060 Ti delivers a slightly cut-down payload of 4,864 CUDA Cores divided across 38 SMs, compared to the 5,888 cores and 46 SMs within the RTX 3070\u2014a 17% reduction in graphics-chomping silicon.That also makes for fewer RT Cores and Tensor Cores, although as you'll see in our benchmarking that doesn't make the RTX 3060 Ti any less a ray tracing card in its own right. These are 2nd generation RT Cores and 3rd generation Tensor Cores, and we're seeing a notable improvement over those included with the Turing architecture and the RTX 20-series.And it's exactly a comparison with the RTX 20-series lineup that Nvidia is hoping for. While priced the same as the RTX 2060 Super, the RTX 3060 Ti is aimed squarely at the performance of the second-run RTX 2080 Super. This is a $399 card facing down what was a $699 graphics card at launch. While that's no longer a graphics card you can really buy\u2014nor can you really purchase any card whatsoever at the time of writing\u2014the RTX 3060 Ti clearly offers a more performant and affordable alternative.There's undoubtedly a not-too-distant competitor to the RTX 3060 Ti on the way from AMD, too. We'd suppose that's bound to look RX 6700-shaped and offer performance upwards of the $399 RX 5700 XT\u2014it's certainly not impossible to picture such a card out of the red team, either, given what we know about RDNA 2 today.But that's a comparison for another day given the struggles AMD has similarly had getting any actual GPU stock out in front of its fans. For now the RTX 3060 Ti enters the fray unabated by any direct competitor, and as such it's only got to impress us enough to prove it's worth $399 of our pay packet. And it surely does.Specifications(Image credit: Nvidia)Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti specsThe RTX 3060 Ti features a cut-down GA104 GPU at its not-so-gooey silicon centre, even so delivers more than a modicum of CUDA Cores with a total of 4,864. That's markedly above the RTX 2080 Super at 3,072 CUDA Cores and a significant departure from the RTX 2060 Super at 2,176.Let us not forget the RTX 2060 Super is, for all intents and purposes, the RTX 3060 Ti's opposite number for the RTX 30-series. The two cards' price tags match at launch, at $399 (\u00a3369), but the significant pull of the RTX 3060 Ti towards the performance of the RTX 2080 Super yet again shows the tremendous generational leap being introduced with the Ampere architecture.RTX 3060 Ti specsGPU - GA104\nLithography - Samsung 8nm\nDie size - 392mm2\nTransistors - 17.4 bn\nCUDA cores - 4,864\nSMs - 38\nRT Cores - 38\nTensor Cores - 152\nGPU Boost clock - 1,665MHz\nMemory bus - 256-bit\nMemory capacity - 8GB GDDR6\nMemory bandwidth - 448GB/s\nTGP - 200W\nLaunch price - $399 (\u00a3369)The RTX 3060 Ti features a decent boost clock at 1,665MHz, rendered partially irrelevant due to Nvidia's GPU Boost technology, which will often see this GPU far exceed that under load\u2014around 1,875MHz on average. That makes it the fastest of the RTX 30-series so far. This is also a reference Founders Edition card so we're not looking at any overclocking out of the box. However, general availability of the Founders Edition coincides with the launch of AIB third-party RTX 3060 Ti's (December 2, 2020), so keep an eye out for OC models if you're interested in pushing things a little more.You'll miss out on the Founders Edition shroud if you do, however. It's near-enough the exact same cooler design as the RTX 3070, which makes it on par with my personal favourite of the lot, but it does differ in one minor way: The tone of the metal finish on the RTX 3060 Ti is considerably lighter than the dark grey for the three 30-series cards above it.That just pushes the RTX 3060 Ti to the top of the leaderboard in my eyes, but it's purely an aesthetic shake up. Both offer near-enough the same quiet and cool operation as the rest bearing Nvidia's own-brand heat sink and clever cut-out cooler, and it similarly makes use of the new compact 12-pin power connector. Don't worry, there's a single 8-pin to 12-pin adapter included in the box.Yet these are mostly aesthetic changes, and while that cooler provides more than adequate chilling power, it's the overhaul to the rasterised rendering pipeline across the Ampere architecture that is the architect of its performance boon. The specifics of which you can read more about in our Nvidia RTX 3080 review, but once again for those in the back\u2026Each streaming multiprocessor, or SM, within Nvidia's RTX 30-series GPUs has received double the number of floating point (FP32) units as past GPU generations. The benefit of which is greater parallelism and the ability to not only alternate between integer and floating point operations depending on the workload but utilise a greater number of FP32 units when there are fewer integer operations required. That happens a lot of the time in gaming, hence the switch.The FP32 units within any given GPU are also what Nvidia counts as the CUDA Core total for each GPU specification. So when comparing the RTX 30-series with the RTX 20-series, the reality of such an architectural split becomes abundantly clear.Image 1 of 3(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)Where you might expect a card closer to the 2,176 core count of the RTX 2060 Super, we're now looking at the 4,854 CUDA Core RTX 3060. The same could be said for the 4,352 CUDA Core RTX 2080 Ti's (sort of) opposite number, the RTX 3090, fit with 10,752 CUDA Cores.It's all been an effective experiment in GPU topology, too, with existing RTX 30-series GPUs managing to dominate their RTX 20-series counterparts. And I'm pleased to report that the RTX 3060 Ti is no different. But we'll get to that.With a capacity at 8GB of GDDR6 and a complimentary 256-bit memory bus, the RTX 3060 Ti is capable of an overall memory bandwidth of 448GB/s\u2014a match for the RTX 3070 in every way. That's the only possible concern for any potential buyer from the specs list that I can point to with any possible consternation.It's not that an 8GB memory capacity has seemingly much of an impact on gaming performance right now\u2014we've seen as much fairly consistently through our testing of AMD's 16GB RX 6800-series cards and the 10GB RTX 3080 and 8GB RTX 3070. But that's not to say it won't at some time or another.I won't speak to unsubstantiated rumour too greatly within a review, but we've heard multiple rumours for yet unannounced RTX 30-series cards with possible higher memory capacities than those currently available, including an RTX 3080 with 20GB VRAM, an RTX 3080 Ti with 20GB VRAM, and even an RTX 3060 with up to 12GB VRAM.It's hardly proof of anything, I must admit. But it does make me wonder whether it's merely a reflexive action in light of AMD's 16GB (and possible 12GB) RX 6000-series graphics cards, or if there is some dark cloud approaching for those of us that own cards with, perhaps let's say, modest memory capacities and overall bandwidth.\u00a0Every game developer I've spoken to has been keen to make better use of greater high-speed memory stores for more elaborate textures and the like, but that shouldn't necessarily mean anyone with less than a given memory buffer will be all out of luck. Scalability is still the name of the game for almost every walk of development, and not the least bit PC gaming.But as I say, that's not so much a reality we're having to deal with today. The RTX 3060 Ti manages to maintain a steady canter in modern games across 1080p, 1440p, and even 4K\u2014which is the first time I believe we can safely say that of an xx60-level graphics card without laboured breath or serious caveats.Performance(Image credit: Nvidia)Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti performance\u00a0With roughly 17% fewer CUDA Cores than an RTX 3070, you can almost have a guess where RTX 3060 Ti \u00a0performance will land with with pretty comfortable accuracy.You wouldn't be all that far off just calling it a day at around a 17% delta between the two, either. At its worst, you'll see almost exactly 17% between the two cards. But don't forget there is a clock speed differential to factor in between the two that can throw things a little out of whack in a handful of games, and sometimes the RTX 3060 Ti can stick within high single-digits of the RTX 3070 frame rates.But that's hardly a referential touchstone we can all get behind\u2014what with very few RTX 3070s available to purchase today. Instead, it's the RTX 2080 Super that the RTX 3060 Ti bears down upon. For the most part, you'll find the RTX 3060 Ti a nose ahead of the RTX 2080 Super, with the odd exception (increasingly at lower resolution) where the RTX 2080 Super just manages to inch into the lead.Ampere's 2nd gen RT cores show their worth across ray tracing benchmarks, too, and despite having fewer of them (RT Core count is tied to SM count) the RTX 3060 Ti is more than a match for the RTX 2080 Super in ray-traced games\u2014which is pretty impressive for 12 fewer RT Cores.4K gaming performanceImage 1 of 8(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)With even the RTX 2070 deemed worthy of 4K performance, the fact we're seeing the RTX 3060 Ti managing to push around more than eight million pixels, with relative ease, should come as no surprise.The RTX 3060 Ti trades blows with the RTX 2080 Super throughout our benchmarking, but at 4K you see it tends to win out over the Turing card. Perhaps it's the increased FP32 unit count coming into play, as both cards feature very similar memory configurations at 8GB of GDDR6 and a 256-bit memory bus.And there's something to be said for the RTX 3060 Ti managing, in some games, to stay not far off the pace of the RTX 3070. With very similar configurations, that's perhaps none too surprising, but if you consider the RTX 3060 Ti is launching at $399, 20% cheaper than the RTX 3070, and managing to stay within a single-digit frame rate delta at times, that's a pretty good showing from the pared-down GPU.1440p gaming performanceImage 1 of 8(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)Once again, the RTX 3060 Ti is dominating Nvidia's RTX 2080 Super at 1440p. Usually by a pretty significant lead, too. Civilization VI appears to be a game that favours the older architecture at higher resolution\u2014make sense of that one\u2014and it's all tied up in F1 2020, but this is a clear win for Ampere and the RTX 3060 Ti.With framerates creeping upwards of 144fps in the least demanding games, and well over 60fps in those with an insatiable hunger for performant GPUs, the RTX 3060 Ti makes a great case for itself as a fantastic 1440p graphics card, and one that should see you well taken care of until 4K GPUs and monitors drop in price to become a little more affordable.1080p gaming performanceImage 1 of 8(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)The RTX 3060 Ti could be seen as a great GPU for high refresh rate gaming at 1080p. There's not too much wasted resource in colossal memory buffers and the like, and so you get a decent blend of performance and cost.That's pretty clear once again from the benchmarks, which see the RTX 3060 Ti sitting comfortably ahead of the RTX 2080 Super in all but F1 2020, which seemingly adores both Turing and the RX 6800-series cards. It'll be interesting to see how this one shakes out with, what can only be, the inevitable RX 6700-series competition from the red team. But all in good time.For now, the RTX 3060 Ti carves out a heap of 1080p performance, and even closes in on the RTX 3070 in a couple of games.Ray tracing performanceImage 1 of 8(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)The Nvidia Ampere architecture comes with second generation RT Cores, and third generation Tensor Cores, with the Volta architecture initially introducing those AI accelerators way back when. It's clearly a superior approach by a decent degree over the previous Turing acceleration, and obviously against the Radeon version too, and that goes a long way to explaining how the RTX 3060 Ti with just 38 RT Cores can outperform the RTX 2080 Super with 48 RT Cores.It's pretty close, but with a slight rasterised performance edge in the RTX games we've tested above, and the improvements to Ampere's RT acceleration, the RTX 3060 Ti comes out way on top.\u00a0The RTX 3060 Ti's ray tracing performance also goes a long way to raising the floor for overall ray tracing performance, with a significant advantage over the RTX 2060 Super with 34 (Gen 1) RT Cores.Power and thermalImage 1 of 3(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)Test rigCPU - Intel Core i7 10700K\nMotherboard - MSI MPG Z490 Gaming Carbon WiFi\nRAM - Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro @ 3,200MHz\nCPU cooler - Corsair H100i RGB Pro XT\nPSU - NZXT 850W\nChassis - DimasTech Mini V2There's not much about the RTX 3060 Ti that's particularly surprising, and the fact it's the most power efficient GPU of the RTX 30-series so far doesn't really change thing. With a 200W TDP, the RTX 3060 Ti occasionally sucks upwards of 232W from the PSU, but mostly maintains a steady gait at 200W or a little less.\u00a0That puts it ahead of the RTX 3070 by just a touch in performance per watt at 1080p, and in line with the rest of Ampere at 4K. That's notably off the performance per watt of AMD's RX 6800 and RDNA 2, which could give AMD a little more leeway when it comes to eventual RX 6700-series SKUs, should they show up anytime soon.\u00a0Verdict(Image credit: Nvidia)Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti verdictOnce again we're looking at a solid generational leap from Nvidia's Ampere generation, and the RTX 3060 Ti delivers superb performance across a heady mix of rasterised and ray-traced games. If you're looking for a steady 60fps or more in the latest, most demanding games, then it's got you covered. If you want a little more more out of 1080p, you're sorted well into high refresh rate territory.And if you hope for 60fps at 4K, that's attainable with only marginal sacrifices to graphics settings. Just what you might expect from an RTX 3060 Ti, no doubt.Nvidia has also made significant gains in its mission to quash any and all frame rate sacrifice associated with true-to-life reflections and dynamic global lighting. There's undoubtedly still a performance hit from switching ray tracing on, but Nvidia's new and improved RT Cores, along with DLSS in many cases, takes some of the oomph out of the swing.\u00a0And that's an important thing to note as we head into PC gaming's third year of ray tracing (yes, it's been that long!). There's already a far more expansive library of ray tracing compatible titles than when Nvidia first launched the RTX suite back in 2018, and it's sure to only grow with AMD, and AMD-powered consoles from Sony and Microsoft, now supporting ray tracing acceleration on-chip.Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: the top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest graphics card: your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: get into the game ahead of the restThe same can be said for DLSS. The feature is become slightly more widespread in today's most played games, and it's becoming an especially useful tool for not only acting as counterweight to the ray tracing performance impact, but actually as a tool for reducing render load at high resolutions\u2014a lot of the time on GPUs that materially don't have the guts to make it work.The RTX 3060 Ti is such a card. While it dabbles in high-fidelity 4K gaming, some graphics settings need to be reduced in order to really crack a solid 60fps in more demanding games. And that's often just in terms of average framerates, to keep your GPU steadily above 60fps may require quite a bit of tinkering. That can sometimes take the fun out of 4K gaming in the first place, the supposed high level of detail.So while DLSS is far from a universal solution, it's a surprisingly not all that lossy way to hit those all-important performance figures for smooth gaming. DLSS has come on leaps and bounds since its first introduction, and in most games it's not something that detracts from the visual or gaming experience in any tangible way.And it's these extra features\u2014ray tracing, DLSS, Reflex, and even Nvidia Broadcast\u2014that generate quite a bit of my interest in the RTX 3060 Ti today beyond its rasterised performance. There's a solid base of genuinely great features behind RTX and the Nvidia package that's only been improved upon with Ampere, none more so than the ray tracing performance for that matter.That's not to say AMD doesn't offer its fair share of alternatives in FidelityFX and Radeon Anti-Lag. But we're yet to see an AMD alternative to the supersampling feature, although one is confirmed to be on the way at some point next year in FidelityFX Super Resolution. And, while ray tracing is no longer an Nvidia-only experience with the introduction of the RX 6800-series, it is an area where the green team is dominating performance graphs.The RTX 3060 Ti delivers superb performance across a heady mix of rasterised and ray-traced gamesThe same goes for a direct competitor to the RTX 3060 Ti\u2014we don't know when it will arrive, but you can be sure that one will. Likely under the RX 6700-series banner.And that's a common footing we find ourselves in with Nvidia's launches so far this generation\u2014the company has materialised graphics cards ahead of AMD's comparative lineup, and that means that we won't truly know if AMD's got a trick up its sleeve to compete with the RTX 3060 Ti until likely early next year.But that doesn't change a thing in my mind right now. It's not all Nvidia vs. AMD, you know, and frankly whether there's an answer to the RTX 3060 Ti in a few months or not, you shouldn't have any regrets in choosing this graphics card for your next big PC rebuild.The RTX 3060 Ti delivers gaming performance that's rather stupendous when you look at generational gains over even the RTX 20-series\u2014next to the 10-series it's quite frightening, actually. There's exceptional 1080p and 1440p performance in a tiny package here, the likes of which would've set you back something close to twice as much cash only last year. And that's pretty great.There's just the small potential issue of availability, that which has similarly loomed over all the other RTX 30-series launches to date. I'm happy to be proven wrong, but judging by every tech launch this year (not only Nvidia's, and not only graphics cards), stock may be sparsely found for the RTX 3060 Ti at launch due to immense demand for new silicon right now.\u00a0Global availability for the RTX 3060 Ti begins December 2, 2020, and I suspect you'll want to be ready to go, front and centre, if you want to have any hope of picking up this graphics card on launch day, or likely anytime before 2021. And given the price and performance of this mid-range Ampere card, it will be worth getting in line for.\n\n\n\nThe Verdict\n\n\n\n\n\n\n90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead our review policy \n\n\nNvidia RTX 3060 Ti review Founders Edition\n\nThe RTX 3060 Ti is exactly what we expected from a fourth-tier RTX 30-series graphics card, but that's no mark against it.

That\u2019s a whole different ballgame, so let\u2019s look at the GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER, which debuted at an MSRP of $699.\n \n \n \n\n\n\nMore Tech News From Around The Web\n\n\n \n \n\n\nNvidia announces the $399 RTX 3060 Ti\u2014and we\u2019ve tested it @ Ars Technica\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti Founder edition @ Guru of 3D\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti @ Techspot\nASUS GeForce RTX 3060 Ti STRIX OC @ Guru of 3D\nMSI GeForce RTX 3060 Ti TRIO X @ Guru of 3D\nMSI RTX 3060 Ti Gaming X TRIO @ Overclockers Club\nMSI GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Gaming X Trio @ TechPowerUp\nGigabyte GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Gaming OC PRO @ Guru of 3D\nInno3D GeForce RTX 3070 iCHILL X3 @ Tweaktown\nASUS GeForce RTX 3060 Ti STRIX OC @ TechPowerUp\nGigabyte GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Gaming OC Pro @ TechPowerUp\nPalit GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GamingPro OC @ TechPowerUp\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Founder\u2019s Edition Review @ Neoseeker\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti FE @ Tweaktown\nNvidia RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition @ Kitguru\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Linux Review @ Phoronix\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition @ TechPowerUp\nMSI GeForce RTX 3090 Suprim X @ TechPowerUp\n\n \n \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVideo News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviousCoaxing Better Speed From QLC With A Little Tender Loving Care \n\nNextMSI X570-A PRO Goes VRMmmm \n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\n\n\n \n\nJeremy Hellstrom\nCall it K7M.com, AMDMB.com, or PC Perspective, Jeremy has been hanging out and then working with the gang here for years.

While the GeForce RTX 3080 kept with the existing pricing structure of the RTX 20-series, replacing the RTX 2080 Super at the $699 price point, the RTX 3090 sees the RTX 2080 Ti's $1200 launch price and raises it another $300. There's an alternative viewpoint, however: The GeForce RTX 3090 is also a replacement for the $2,500 Titan RTX, in which case it's a faster card that costs $1,000 less. Either way, you're going to need some deep pockets if you want to own Nvidia's new halo card.We already have the Ampere architecture deep dive that details what makes the GeForce RTX 3090 tick. Start there if you want more information on how the 3090 and GA102 deliver new levels of performance. We'll cover the highlights here, but the simple answer is that Nvidia has gone with a smaller process node, more cores, faster memory \u2026 plus more power and a higher price. At 350W TGP (Total Graphics Power), this is by far the most power hungry consumer GPU Nvidia has ever released (not counting the dual-GPU cards). It's also the most expensive GeForce branded GPU ever (unless you count the dual-GPU GeForce GTX Titan Z, which I don't).We have a few additional tests we're still trying to run before we render our final verdict (looking at you 8K, or at least 4K with DSR emulating 8K), so we won't have a final verdict just yet. We also have a few AIB (add-in board) partner cards that we'll be looking at in the coming days, once we've had some time to run all the tests and gather some data.One thing we can't fully predict is availability, but our hunch is that it's not going to be great. It's actually more than a hunch, now, as Nvidia pre-emptively apologized yesterday for the limited availability of RTX 3090 cards (while at the same time confirming performance expectations). Ugh. Considering the RTX 3080 cards have been selling out as fast as inventory arrives, even though the RTX 3090 costs over twice as much \u2026 well, some people are paying nearly $1,500 for RTX 3080 cards. It's probably not going to be pleasant if you have your heart set on a 3090 and didn't put in a pre-order. Just give it some time, and things should eventually get sorted out. Cue mom: \"Patience is a virtue!\" Thanks, ma, but I'm still working on it.The short summary of the GeForce RTX 3090 is much as you'd expect. It's theoretically about 20% faster than the RTX 3080 based on specs alone, with over twice the memory. The extra VRAM doesn't really matter much for most games unless you're running at 8K (maybe 5K), but it can prove useful for some professional workloads. The RTX 3090 also requires a beefy CPU to get the most out of the card (we'll be running some additional tests in the coming days to show that, but you can get some idea of what to expect from our RTX 3080 CPU scaling article). This is very much a GPU designed for 4K ultra gaming, and at those settings, it's 12% faster than the 3080 on average in our existing test suite, and 14% faster in our bonus test suite. Drop down to 1440p ultra, and the 3090 is only 8% faster than the 3080. If you're running at 1080p? Don't bother, seriously.Now, let's dig into the specs and look at what's changed relative to other Nvidia GPUs.Today's best RTX 3090 deals $1,690 $1,565.99View $1,789View No price informationCheck WalmartShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesNvidia GPU Specifications\u00a0Swipe to scroll horizontallyGraphics CardRTX 3090 FERTX 3080 FETitan RTXRTX 2080 Ti FEArchitectureGA102GA102TU102TU102Process TechnologySamsung 8NSamsung 8NTSMC 12FFNTSMC 12FFNTransistors (Billion)28.328.318.618.6Die size (mm^2)628.4628.4754754SMs82687268GPU Cores (FP32)10496870446084352GPU Cores (INT32)5248435246084352Tensor Cores328272576544RT Cores82687268Base Clock (MHz)1395144013501515Boost Clock (MHz)1695171017701635VRAM Speed (Gbps)19.5191414VRAM (GB)24102411VRAM Bus Width384320384352ROPs112969688TMUs328272288272TFLOPS FP3235.629.816.314.2TOPS INT3217.814.916.314.2Tensor TFLOPS FP16 (Sparsity)142 (285)119 (238)130114RT TFLOPS69.558.149.245.7Bandwidth (GBps)936760672616TDP (watts)350320285260Launch DateSeptember 2020September 2020December 2018September 2018Launch Price$1,499 $699 $2,499 $1,199 GeForce RTX 3090 Architecture: Nearly a Full GA102\u00a0(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Again, our Ampere architecture goes into more detail on the various aspects of the new 30-series GPUs. There are a lot of changes relative to the previous Turing architecture, but here's the highlight reel.First, GA102 uses Samsung's 8N process technology, which means more transistors in a smaller area than TU102. Looking strictly at overall transistor density, GA102 packs in 45 million transistors per square millimeter, whereas TU102 density is 'only' 24.7 million transistors per square millimeter. That's good, but clearly not as good as TSMC's N7 node: The larger GA100 chip used in Nvidia's A100 contains 65.4 million transistors per square millimeter. Also, AMD's Navi 10 has 41 million transistors per square mm, so Nvidia has at least matched that level of density \u2014 comparing across architectures is definitely looking at apples and oranges, though.Moving on, the GeForce RTX 3090 uses a nearly complete GA102 chip. Of the 84 potential SMs (streaming multiprocessors), only two are disabled. That suggests either the yields are very good \u2026 or Nvidia isn't planning to sell nearly as many 3090 chips as 3080 chips. We suspect the second option is closer to the truth, and actual yields are a closely guarded secret these days. The 3090 also has seven GPCs (graphics processing clusters), and the ROPs (render outputs) are now part of the GPC instead of the memory controller, giving the 3090 112 ROPS.Perhaps a bigger change is that the GeForce RTX 3090 comes equipped with 24GB of GDDR6X memory, this time clocked at 19.5 Gbps (compared to 19 Gbps on the 3080). This is accomplished by enabling the final two 32-bit memory controllers on GA102, and then running 24 chips in half-width 16-bit interface mode. That also means the GDDR6X chips are located on both sides of the PCB (printed circuit board), whereas the RTX 3080 only has memory on the same side as the GPU. There's certainly a question of how much this affects GDDR6X memory temperatures, particularly when half the VRAM isn't actively cooled. However, at present, we don't have a way to measure the GDDR6X chip temperatures.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)We've discussed the GPU CUDA core changes quite a bit in previous Ampere articles, because it's one of the most significant differences between Ampere and Turing. Turing included 64 FP32-capable CUDA cores per SM, with an additional 64 INT32-capable CUDA cores (and two FP64 cores for compatibility purposes). The FP32 and INT32 cores were separate datapaths and could be used concurrently. The FP32 cores could also run FP16 math at double the performance \u2014 'fast math' mode.For Ampere, the FP32 cores lose support for FP16 fast math, which gets shifted over to the Tensor cores \u2014 it's still twice the FP16 performance of the dedicated FP32 cores, but only equal FP16 performance overall. Meanwhile, the INT32 cores gain support for FP32 calculations, which means total FP32 performance per SM has doubled. At the same time, INT32 performance per SM has stayed the same. This has some interesting ramifications for overall performance, but basically, about 30-35% of the CUDA core workload in games is INT32 (for address pointer lookups, texture calculations, and other similar work). That means a good chunk of the second datapath will be busy with INT32, so the real-world performance boost will often be less than the raw FP32 TFLOPS number would suggest.Elsewhere, the tensor cores are another substantial upgrade relative to Turing, with twice the throughput per core. Except there are half as many tensor cores per SM. The 3rd generation tensor cores do add support for fine-grained sparsity, which can double throughput again relative to Turing when used. Also worth noting is that the 3rd gen tensor cores add support for INT8 and INT4 data types at 2x and 4x the base FP16 throughput.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The video ports on GeForce RTX 3090 FE are the same as on RTX 3080: one HDMI 2.1 port and three DisplayPort 1.4a outputs. There's no VirtualLink port this round, as VirtualLink is basically dead. All four outputs are capable of 8K60 using DSC (Display Stream Compression), a \"visually lossless\" technique that's actually not really visually lossless (though you probably won't notice at 8K). We've seen other cards with five display outputs, many opting for dual HDMI 2.1, so keep that in mind if you're planning to use a multi-monitor setup.Other changes (and we're glossing over things here as we've already covered this in the RTX 3080 review, as well as the Ampere architecture piece) include RT cores that are up to twice as fast \u2014 or even more in certain workloads (like motion blur). The L1 cache/shared memory capacity and bandwidth have been increased. The L2 cache is also larger than before, and the L1 cache can be configured as varying amounts of L1 vs. shared memory, depending on the needs of the application. Register file size is also increased, and GA102 can do concurrent RT + graphics + DLSS (previously, using the RT cores would stop the CUDA cores).The raster operators (ROPS) have been moved out of the memory controllers and into the GPCs. Each GPC has two ROP partitions of eight ROP units each. This provides more flexibility in performance, giving the GA102 and RTX 3090 a total of 112 ROPS. Each GPC also includes six TPCs (Texture Processing Clusters) with eight TMUs (Texture Mapping Units) and a polymorph engine, though these come in pairs and Nvidia enables 41 TPCs for the 3090.Finally, as discussed before, the RTX 3090\u2019s memory controller has a new feature called EDR: Error Detection and Replay. When the memory detects a failed transmission, rather than crashing or corrupting data, it simply tries again. It will attempt to do this until successful, though it's still possible to cause a crash with memory overclocking. EDR allows the potential for higher memory clocks that may not actually perform better as you approach the limits of the memory. That's because EDR ends up reducing total memory throughput when failed transmissions occur.\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n6\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nCurrent page:\n\nGeForce RTX 3090 Founders Edition: An Absolute Unit\n\n\n\nNext Page GeForce RTX 3090 Founders Edition: Design, Cooling, Aesthetics \n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNVIDIA RTX\n4K\nGeForce RTX 3090\nZotac\nTitan\nBenchmark\nGeForce\nrtx\nray tracing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (5)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

It's only a more expensive 3080 Ti, which will be proven soon. A halo product for people with more money than sense.\n\n\"Fastest current graphics card, period\" - Wrong, it's not, it's based on the game and if it's optimized for nvidia (DLSS) or AMD (and no DLSS). In the first case it wins in the latter one it gets beaten by RX 6800 XT and RX 6900 XT, sometimes by a mile... as much as it beats them in the first case with DLSS ON, but then AMD does it by raw power.

Again nvidia BS propagated by media still.\n\n\"Needs a 4K display, maybe even 8K\" - no it does not \"need\" an 8k display unless you want to be majorly disappointed and play at 30 fps only. That is today, with today games and today's graphics demands, but tomorrow and next gen games you can kiss it goodbye at 8k.

Nvidia RTX 3090: And The Winner Is?ByAntony LeatherFollowShareSaveEditors' PickInnovationConsumer TechAMD Radeon RX 6900 XT Vs. Nvidia RTX 3090: And The Winner Is?ByAntony Leather, Senior Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Antony reviews and covers the latest PC hardware and laptop technologyFollow AuthorDec 08, 2020, 08:59am ESTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.AMD's Radeon RX 6900 XTAntony Leather\nToday, we're finally allowed to lift the lid on reviews and performance figures of AMD's Radeon RX 6900 XT - it's new flagship graphics card and the most powerful desktop gaming graphics card the company has ever produced. It costs hundreds of dollars less than Nvidia's own flagship - the RTX 3090, so clearly, all eyes are on performance to see if AMD really does have an RTX 3090 killer on its hands.\n\n\nYou can see my video review below including unboxing.\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the specifications, though, the RX 6900 XT isn't offering a singificant leap in any area over the RX 6800 XT. The stream processor count rises from 4,608 t0 5,120, the ray accelerators from 72 to 80 and the memory speed, capacity and interfaces are the same too (16Gbps, 16GB and 256-bit). Even the TDP is the same so while some specs are beefed up, we're not expecting this card to be light years ahead of the RX 6800 XT.\n\nTest systemMy graphics test systemAntony Leather\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nThe test system includes a BarrowCH Rhopilema water-cooled test bench with Corsair Hydro X water-cooling components, an Intel Core i9-10900K and 760p SSD, MSI MEG Z490 Ace motherboard, 16GB Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro memory and a Corsair RM850i PSU.\n\n\n\nIt's a good start for AMD here with a minimum 99th percentile frame rate matching the RTX 3090 but the latter has a much higher average frame rate. It's also not much faster than the RX 6800 XT, and the average frame rate is only 4fps better than the RTX 3080 too.\nWith DLSS and ray tracing enabled, Nvidia as usual has a sizeable advantage, with the RTX 3080 outstripping the RX 6900 XT by a large margin. The RX 6900 XT only managed to match the RTX 2080 Ti, which is actually impressive given AMD lacks an equivalent to DLSS. It was also much faster than the RX 6800 XT as well.\nAt 4K with ray tracing disabled, there's not much between a lot of the front runners except the RTX 3090's average frame rate, which was huge. However, the RX 6800 XT was a just under 10 percent quicker than the RX 6800 XT but barely any faster than the RTX 3080.\nOnce again with ray tracing disabled, Nvidia has a lead on the average frame rates with both the RTX 3080 and 3090, but the RX 6900 XT was very close to the RTX 3090 on the minimum 99th percentile.\nWith ray tracing and DLSS enabled, though, and Nvidia comes out on top and for some reason the RX 6900 XT didn't offer much more grunt here than the RX 6800 XT either.\nFar Cry new Dawn at 1440p tends to lean on the CPU quite a bit so there's lots of bunching at the top, but Nvidia did seem to have an advantage here with the RTX 3080 clearly the better card and making the RTX 3090 look like poor value too.\nHowever, at 4K the RX 6900 XT managed it's best result here, ultimately beating the RTX 3090 fair and square and offering a noticeably higher average frame rate than the RX 6900 XT.\nAnother good result was Borderlands at 1440p where it came a close second to the RTX 3090 on the minimum 99th percentile frame rate, but lost out on the average frame rate to both the RTX 3090 and 3080, despite managing a much higher minimum than the latter too. Again it was around 10 percent quicker than the RX 6800 XT.\nAt 4K, while it maintained the lead over the RX 6800 XT both Nvidia cards leaped ahead with much higher numbers.\nWolfenstein is heavily optimised for Nvidia and it's no surprise to see the RTX 3080 snapping at the heals of the RX 6900 XT. Given it's cheaper, if this is one of your most-played games, Nvidia is far stronger here and the RTX 3090 is a monster. Also the RX 6800 XT punches above its weight here too.\nAt 4K things don't improve much and the RX 6900 XT is essentially matching the RTX 3080, although it offers more noticeable gains over the RX 6800 xT.\nAt 1440p with ray tracing disabled it's another good result for the RX 6900 XT, bettering the average frame rate of the RTX 6900 XT although suffering a slower minimum frame rate. However, it was significantly faster than both the RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT, largely justifying the extra outlay.\nAt 4K the RTX 3080 gained ground and essentially matched the RX 6900 XT, but the RTX 3090 didn't offer much more performance for the extra cash either. The RX 6900 XT was also much faster than the RX 6800 XT.\nWith ray tracing enabled at 4K along with DLSS, Nvidia once again has the advantage and the RTX 6900 XT did it's usual thing of matching the DLSS-enabled RTX 3080 and offering significantly more performance than the RX 6800 XT too.\nAMD's power efficiency is impressive with the RX 6900 XT drawing a huge amount less power than the RTX 3090, but with this result dealing with Ray Tracing and maximum visuals in Metro Exodus, the extra hardware Nvidia has and extra performance means this is maybe expected to some degree.\nFinally, the thermals are a fair bit higher for the RX 6900 XT than they were for the RX 6800 XT, yet the card remained very quiet during testing except for the odd bit of coil whine.\nConclusions\nThis card more than any other from AMD and Nvidia over the last few months, needs more consideration before reaching for your wallet. It's a monster to be sure, but it rarely offers RTX 3090-beating performance, at least in my tests, and there are plenty of instances, even when DLSS and ray tracing are disabled, that the RTX 3080 is faster, never mind the RTX 3090. The RX 6800 XT is rarely that far behind either, meaning the value proposition is questionable over both the 6800 Xtand 3080, which are both great high-end cards. It's not a clean sweep, then, and there are certainly some early driver gremlins to be ironed out that will likely improve performance too.AMD's Radeon RX 6900 XTAntony Leather\nUltimately, in many tests the RX 6900 XT managed to better the RTX 3080 and even match or better the RTX 3090 in some situations too, which shows promise for the forces behind AMD's graphics architecture. It also in these situations offers significantly more performance than the RX 6800 XT and has very low power draw compared to the RTX 3080 and 3090.\nYou'll also see more performance using PCIe 4.0 from both red and green teams as well as from Smart Access Memory - neither of which I've used here, but they will require the latest AMD motherboards and Ryzen processors as well - items only a minority of gamers have. Even with these features though, it's not a clean sweep for the RX 6900 XT and you'll need to carefully weigh up your options if you have around $1000 to spend.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

See our ethics statement.Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeNvidia\u2019s $399 RTX 3060 Ti is available to purchase on Wednesday, December 2nd \u2014 and 6am PT / 9am ET is when it\u2019ll go on sale, Nvidia confirms to The Verge. Like the RTX 3070, this card is a great option if you are looking to play PC games at a 1440p resolution. Also like the RTX 3070 and every other graphics card released this year, stock will likely not last long at most retailers, so you\u2019ll want to be on the dot.In Tom Warren\u2019s review of the 3060 Ti, it put up impressive frame rates on popular titles like Control, Call of Duty: Warzone, Death Stranding, and Fortnite at 1440p resolution \u2014 some of these games were even tested with ray-tracing enabled. At $399, the RTX 3060 Ti provides faster performance than the RTX 2080 Super or the RTX 2080 graphics cards, each of which started at $699 in 2019 and 2018 respectively.If you\u2019re looking for the $399 RTX 3060 Founder\u2019s Edition that we reviewed, you\u2019ll only be able to find it at Best Buy and Micro Center in the United States, but other retailers like Newegg should have an array of boards from partners too, some of which may cost a bit more.So far, only Best Buy has published listings for its complement of cards in the US:Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti$400$400An impressive PCIe 4.0 graphics card that delivers 1440p gaming at a competitive price thanks to its 8GB GDDR6 as well as ray tracing and DLSS support.Read More$400 at Best BuyWe\u2019ll be updating this post with more retailer links as they become available and assuming they stay in stock. But if you\u2019re thinking of buying it and spot one, you should probably pounce, as it won\u2019t stay that way for long.Best Buy Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti listingsNvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Founder\u2019s Edition for $400Gigabyte\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Eagle OC for $420MSI\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti for $450Gigabyte\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Gaming OC for $440B&H Photo Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti listingsGigabyte\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Eagle for $460Gigabyte\u2019s RTX 3060 Ti Eagle OC for $470Gigabyte\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti for $480Gigabyte\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti for $490Gigabyte\u2019s AORUS RTX 3060 Ti for $510Micro Center Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti listingsGigabyte\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Eagle for $400Asus\u2019 GeForce RTX 3060 Ti for $430Gigabyte\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti for $440EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti for $450MSI\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Ventus for $450MSI\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Gaming X Trio for $490Gigabyte\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Aorus for $490Asus GeForce RTX 3060 Ti ROG Strix for $500You may also be able to find it at Amazon, Newegg, and Adorama in the US, Currys and Ebuyer in the UK, and Best Buy Canada.See More: EntertainmentGamingHow toNvidiaPC GamingTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsLego announces Pok\u00e9mon sets are coming next yearAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Before we get to our results, though, we should probably provide some additional color as it related to overclocking Ampere-based GeForce cards...\n\n\nOverclocking Ampere And The RTX 3060 Ti\n\nAmpere-based GeForce RTX 30-series cards like the \u00a0MSI GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Gaming X Trio feature GPU Boost just like previous-gen GeForces. GPU Boost scales frequencies and voltages up and down based on the GPU's workload and environmental conditions at the time, within predetermined power and thermal limits. Should a temperature or power limit be reached,\u00a0GPU Boost will drop down to the previous boost frequency/voltage stepping, in an attempt to bring power and temperatures down gradually, not cause any significant performance swings, and remain within that card's particular thermal and power envelopes.\n\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti FE Default Settings\n\n\nMSI GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Gaming x Trio Default Settings\n\n\r\nAs we've mentioned in some of our previous coverage, NVIDIA has segmented the core and memory power rails with its latest GPUs. It has also significantly tweaked and tuned interfaces on RTX 30-series to optimize signal integrity and power delivery to the GPU and GDDR6 memory, which should help with overclocking when there is power headroom available. With that said, like previous-gen Turing-based cards, the GeForce RTX 30-series is still power limited to prevent damage and ensure longevity, and that power limit is typically what'll determine a card's overclocking capabilties.\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3070 Overclocked\n\r\nNVIDIA offers an automatic overclocking scanner tool, should users want to generate a specifically tailored frequency and voltage curve for their card. But, you can also overclock manually, which is what we did here. In lieu of using the NVIDIA Scanner, we kept things simple and used the frequency and voltage offsets, and the power and temperature target sliders, available in EVGA's Precision X1 utility, to manually push the card beyond its stock specifications.\n\r\nFirst, we cranked up the temperature and power targets, and pushed the voltage up, then we increased the GPU and memory clock offsets until the test system was no longer stable, showed on-screen artifacts, or performance peaked due to hitting the power limit. With the MSI GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Gaming X Trio, the power target can be increased by only 4%, the temperature target from 83\u00b0C to 90\u00b0C, and the GPU voltage can be raised by up to .1v.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nWhile we had our card overclocked, we saw peak GPU Boost frequencies of nearly 2.15GHz, with an effective 7.16GHz memory clock. At those higher clocks, we saw some nice performance increases, which put the MSI card closer to the higher-performing and more expensive 3070 FE. And throughout all of our testing the MSI card's peak GPU temperature never exceeded a paltry 66\u00b0C -- this card runs especially cool. The FE card hit 76\u00b0C in its stock config, which obviously isn't as good as the bigger MSI card, but it still of no concern whatsoever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Power Consumption\n\n\n\n\nTested at the Outlet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe'd also like to cover a couple of final data points regarding power consumption and acoustics. Throughout all of our benchmarking and testing, we monitored noise output and tracked how much power the GPU's were consuming using NVIDIA's PCAT device.\u00a0Our goal was to give you an idea as to how much power each GPU used while idle and also while under a heavy workload. These power numbers were captured over the duration of an entire 3DMark Fire Strike run, including the full demo, and are indicative of the GPU alone -- not the entire system...\n\n\n\n\n\r\nThe power data we collected in right in-line with the typical performance trend we've seen throughout this article. The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition used slightly less average and less peak power than a GeForce RTX 2080 Super, whereas the higher-clocked, faster MSI GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Gaming X Trio used somewhat more power than the 2080 Super on average, but much less peak power, which speaks well to Ampere's efficiency improvements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Acoustics\n\n\n\nMeasuring Noise Output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nWe haven't found noise to be an issue with any GeForce RTX 30-series cards yet, and with the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti's reduced power and thermal considerations, we weren't expecting much of a ruckus here...\n\n\n\n\r\nIn our real-world setup (we tested the GPU inside a chassis), our test rig with the RTX 3060 Ti cards output sound pressure levels that weren't particularly far apart -- these cards are quiet. We measured the sound pressure about 6\" away from the top of the GPU, with the side-panel removed from the chassis. The test system has 3 additional fans -- 1 x 120mm exhaust fan, 1 x 120mm fan on the CPU heatsink, and another 140mm fan in the PSU. Overall, the system is relatively quiet, though its fans do drown out most GPUs, at least until they are placed under a sustained load for an extended period.\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti Summary And Verdict\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti cards are slated to start shipping tomorrow. The NVIDIA Founders Edition card has an MSRP of $399 and overclocked partner boards like the MSI GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Gaming X Trio will obviously be priced higher (usually by about $20 - $60), depending on the level of customization, additional features, and how high the GPU clock is, etc. GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition cards will be available directly from Best Buy and Microcenter, and partner boards will be sold by all of the usual suspects, though product is likely to disappear quickly, as has been the case with all of the recent GPU launches.\n\nFind GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Cards @ Amazon.com\n\r\nAssuming customers can get their hands on cards at or near MSRP, the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is an excellent option. Performance is in the neighborhood of the GeForce RTX 2080 Super, and well ahead of cards like the Radeon RX 5700 XT or RTX 2060 Super, all of which are currently selling for much more than the 3060 Ti\u2019s MSRP. This card's 8GB frame buffer may give some of you pause, but for 1080p \u2013 1440p gaming, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem for the overwhelming majority of titles, and it\u2019s par for the course in this price bracket anyway.\n\r\nWe\u2019ll have to wait until the current craziness ends to see where pricing on previous-gen cards ultimately settles, but if you\u2019re looking for a GPU in the $400-ish price range, the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is the obvious choice. It offers performance in-line with more expensive cards, arrives at the same MSRP as the GeForce RTX 2060 Super, and its feature set it second to none.\r\n\n\n\u00a0\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood Performer\nExcellent Value\nCool and Quiet Operation\nBleeding Edge Feature Set\nPower Friendly\nDecent Overclocker\n\n\n\n\nPower Limited At Stock Specs\nPower Connector Placement On FE Cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrev\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, MSI, GeForce, GPU, (nadsaq:nvda), ampere, geforce rtx 3060 ti\n\n\n\nRelated content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Review: Breakout Speed At $399\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild A Great Gaming PC With HotHardware's 2020 DIY System Guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadeon RX 6800 & RX 6800 XT Review: AMD\u2019s Back With Big Navi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 5950X And 5900X CPU Review: Zen 3 Dominates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Review: Breakout Performance At $499\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT STUFF IN PC COMPONENTS\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Review:...\nBuild A Great Gaming PC With...\nRadeon RX 6800 & RX 6800 XT Review:...\nAMD Ryzen 9 5950X And 5900X CPU Review:...\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Review: Breakout...\nSamsung T7 Portable SSD Review: Blazing...\nNVIDIA Reflex Tested: Low Latency,...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKEEP INFORMED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSITE\n\nHome\n\n\nReviews\n\n\nNews\n\n\nBlogs\n\nFull Site\n\nSitemap\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nPC Components\n\n\nSystems\n\n\nMobile\n\n\nIT Infrastructure\n\n\nLeisure\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nCOMPANY\n\nAbout\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\nNews Tips\n\n\nContact\n\n\nPrivacy And Terms\n\n\nHotTech\n\n\n\nMORE\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nShop\n\n\n\nSTAY CONNECTED\n\nTwitter\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n            As an Amazon and Howl Technologies Associate, HotHardware earns a commission from qualifying purchases made on this site.

Customers get the latest security, performance and hybrid cloud enhancements, with an integrated management and operations experience from the Azure portal, all while being able to take advantage of their existing skills.\nThe breakthrough ZTR technology embedded in NVIDIA Mellanox ConnectX SmartNICs and BlueField data processing units (DPUs) removes the barrier for enterprises to deploy RoCE in on-premises data centers.\nNVIDIA ZTR enables seamless, pervasive deployment and operation of RoCE network transport capabilities. It eliminates the need for special network configurations such as flow control or congestion notification, enabling RoCE to easily be deployed with zero network changes in new and existing environments. With ZTR, RoCE network transport services operate side by side with non-RoCE communications in ordinary TCP/IP environments.\nPaired with NVIDIA EGX-certified servers and NVIDIA Mellanox end-to-end networking, Azure HCI enables enterprises to benefit from hyperscale efficiency from cloud, to core data centers, to edge.\nRoCE Accelerates Compute-Intensive Workloads\nInitially, RoCE was deployed in small data center silos for accelerating data storage platforms. But the exponential growth in data analytics, machine learning and AI has fueled the adoption of RoCE networking everywhere for accelerating diverse compute-intensive workloads.\nNow deployed in the world\u2019s most advanced data centers, RoCE has broken out of its traditional silos and become ubiquitous in cloud and web-scale data centers to accelerate a broad range of compute and storage workloads.\nMicrosoft was the vanguard among the cloud titans to demonstrate a RoCE-everywhere mindset, deploying RDMA across massive computing clusters to accelerate software-defined storage, AI and HPC customer workloads.\nNVIDIA is one of the leading providers of RDMA/RoCE network transport technologies, starting in the high performance computing industry, then expanding its use in storage systems, AI and data science.\nAnnounced at GTC earlier this year, ConnectX-6 Lx SmartNICs are NVIDIA\u2019s 11th generation RoCE-capable products, including ConnectX SmartNICs and BlueField DPUs, which deliver unmatched performance and usability. Adding in NVIDIA Spectrum Ethernet Switches and LinkX cables creates an end-to-end, scalable networking solution which provides high bandwidth, low latency and simplified management.\nRoCE is integrated into the mainstream code of popular ML/AI and data analytics frameworks, including TensorFlow, Apache Spark and PyTorch. RoCE support in these open-source frameworks enables ML/AI-powered applications to benefit from the predictable and scalable performance that RDMA delivers.\nGPUDirect RDMA technology is key to unlocking unparalleled performance of ML/AI workloads, in data-center-scale computing clusters. The hardware acceleration engines in the networking ASIC enable GPUDirect RDMA to perform efficient zero-copy data transfer between nodes, keeping GPUs constantly fed with the data needed to perform AI computing.\nThe rise of Kubernetes for ML/AI multi-node training and edge inferencing has also spurred the growing adoption of RoCE for accelerating compute-intensive workloads.\nNGC, NVIDIA\u2019s hub for GPU-optimized containerized software, hosts a wide range of data science frameworks with native support for UCX, a production-grade, communication framework powered by RDMA/RoCE. NGC helps accelerate productivity with easy-to-deploy frameworks and applications, so users can focus on building their solutions.\nThe pioneering ZTR technology makes RoCE the easy-to-use network transport technology of choice for accelerating any cloud or enterprise computing workload.\nAzure Stack HCI Nabs NVIDIA ZTR to Extend Azure Cloud Economics \nBy facilitating high-throughput, low-latency, node-to-node connectivity, NVIDIA ZTR accelerates Azure Stack HCI performance in bringing Azure services to on-premises, enterprise environments.\nNVIDIA ZTR helps ensure consistent application performance within Azure Stack HCI at every scale and physical location \u2014 from small deployments at branch offices to entire data centers.\n\u201cMicrosoft Azure Stack HCI builds on Azure with an enterprise-grade, cost-optimized design,\u201d said Talal Alqinawi, senior director of Azure Marketing at Microsoft Corp. \u201cNVIDIA Mellanox ConnectX SmartNICs complement our vision to bring full-scale Azure cloud economics to enterprise data centers for hybrid cloud architecture.\u201d\nGet Started with NVIDIA ZTR Technology and Microsoft Azure Stack HCI\nNVIDIA ZTR is available now for ConnectX-4 Lx, ConnectX-5, ConnectX-6, ConnectX-6 Dx and ConnectX-6 Lx SmartNIC devices running the latest firmware and software. NVIDIA ZTR for the recently announced family of BlueField-2 DPUs and EGX converged accelerator will be available next year.\nNVIDIA and leading hardware providers offer a broad range of validated solutions featuring Azure Stack HCI together with NVIDIA Mellanox networking. These validated solutions are based on standardized reference architecture that are supported by Microsoft, NVIDIA and our hardware partners.\nTo learn more, check out these NVIDIA Mellanox Zero-Touch RoCE resources:\n\nNVIDIA Mellanox RDMA/RoCE Technology\nHow RDMA Became the Fuel for Fast Networks\nAccelerating Apache Spark 3.0 with GPUs and RAPIDS\nNVIDIA Mellanox Ethernet Connectivity Solutions\n\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Networking \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Play this year\u2019s most anticipated title on a GeForce RTX GPU to experience CD PROJEKT RED\u2019s masterpiece with several ray-traced technologies that amp up the immersiveness, and accelerate your frame rates with NVIDIA DLSS.\nWith realistic shadows and lighting and the added performance of NVIDIA DLSS, GeForce RTX is the definitive platform for Cyberpunk 2077.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077 With Ray Tracing\nNVIDIA\u2019s worked hand in hand with CD PROJEKT RED to bring ray-traced effects to Cyberpunk 2077. Powered by the platform agnostic DirectX 12 Ultimate API, and accelerated by GeForce RTX\u2019s RT and Tensor Cores, ray tracing enhances Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s world with realistic reflections, improved lighting, enhanced shadowing, and refined ambient occlusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCyberpunk 2077 is a technologically advanced game capable of generating marvelous visuals. It also boldly spearheads the future of real-time graphics by taking advantage of GeForce RTX 30 Series\u2019 2nd generation ray tracing and the advanced AI of NVIDIA DLSS. Simulated reflections, lifelike shadows, and true-to-form diffuse illumination and ambient occlusion -- they all make my heart beat faster\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0- Jakub Knapik, Art Director of Lighting and FX, CD PROJEKT RED\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Reflections\nAccurate real-time reflections are important for realism and immersion, especially in large open world games featuring skyscrapers and innumerable shiny surfaces. Using ray tracing, every suitable surface and object adds these high-quality, realistic reflections, cranking up fidelity for the definitive experience.\nCars reflect the neon lights of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Night City, rivers and bodies of water reflect the surrounding detail, glass features transparent reflections, buildings reflect the world around them, and so on. If it\u2019s meant to be reflective, it reflects, giving GeForce RTX gamers the highest possible graphical fidelity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Diffuse Illumination\nCyberpunk 2077\u2019s Night City is filled with neon signs, advertisements, and other artificial light sources. With ray tracing, the light from these sources accurately illuminates surrounding detail, further enhancing image quality and immersion, and making Night City an even more vibrant locale.\nAdditionally, Cyberpunk 2077 utilizes diffuse illumination tech to enhance lighting from the sky dome, enabling light scattered from the atmosphere to realistically illuminate surfaces, and to be accurately occluded by buildings and objects, creating a more natural look that further improves immersion and image quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Global Illumination\nIn reality, sunlight bounces, increasing the illumination of nearby surfaces and objects. Furthermore, the color properties of surfaces are absorbed and added to bounces, so for example, bright light bounced from a red wall to a white tiled floor would feature a tinge of red.\nRecreating this effect in games requires ray tracing, and by setting the Ray Traced Lighting option to \u2018Psycho\u2019 you can enable it in Cyberpunk 2077.\nThis effect is applied exclusively to light cast by the sun, with one bounce. It\u2019s demanding, but if your system\u2019s got the headroom to enable it, you\u2019ll experience next-level realism and fidelity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Shadows\nUsing ray tracing, we\u2019re adding an extra level of refinement to shadows created by sunlight and moon light. These are intelligently incorporated with the game\u2019s rasterized local shadows to increase detail, most noticeably on finely-detailed game elements, and to alleviate shadow aliasing and other common issues.\nThese enhancements help ground objects and shadows, add genuine contact hardening and softening, and in general further improve fidelity, immersion and realism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Ambient Occlusion\nAmbient Occlusion generates shadows and adjusts shading where objects and game elements occlude light. This often manifests as the smallest, finest shadows around creases in clothing, between pages of paper, and between keys on a keyboard. Without ambient occlusion, games look flat, objects appear to be floating, and realism is greatly diminished.\nWith ray tracing, we can crank up the accuracy and quality of the effect, ensuring every nook and cranny is correctly shadowed, further refining image quality and immersion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAltogether, ray tracing has a transformative effect on the appearance, dynamism and immersion of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s Night City, and its surrounding zones. If you haven\u2019t already, be sure to check out our new RTX ON trailer at the start of this article to see for yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccelerate Performance With NVIDIA DLSS\nTo accelerate intensive ray-traced graphics, Cyberpunk 2077 has integrated AI-powered NVIDIA DLSS, which increases performance by 60% or more, depending on resolution, settings and system configuration. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a look at DLSS\u2019s performance and image quality in this new 2560x1440 \u201cQuality Mode\u201d RTX ON video:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith DLSS, GeForce RTX gamers have the performance headroom to maximize ray tracing settings, increase detail levels, and up the resolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant To Play With RTX ON? GeForce RTX 3070 Recommended\nLeveraging all the capabilities and advantages exclusive to the GeForce RTX platform, you can enjoy Cyberpunk 2077 with a fantastic level of ray-traced detail at 2560x1440 with a GeForce RTX 3070:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe minimum GPU for Ray Tracing, at 1920x1080, is the GeForce RTX 2060. With the RTX 2060, gamers can explore Night City with Medium Ray Tracing and textures powered by DLSS. And if you want to crank up your 1080p experience, the new GeForce RTX 3060 Ti provides a smooth experience with RT Ultra settings.\nAt 2560x1440, we recommend a GeForce RTX 3070 or GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. Ray tracing is taken to Ultra, which greatly increases the fidelity of the aforementioned effects, and the distance at which they are visible, while DLSS provides boosted frame rates with uncompromised image quality. And with rasterized settings also being cranked to Ultra, GeForce RTX 3070 and 2080 Ti gamers receive an incredible experience at the highest detail levels, unmatched by any other platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, if you\u2019re playing at 4K or beyond, the GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3090 deliver the performance to play Cyberpunk 2077 with ray tracing at Ultra at this incredibly demanding resolution. Both GPUs are powered by Ampere\u2014NVIDIA\u2019s 2nd gen RTX architecture\u2014with dedicated RT Cores for ray tracing, and Tensor Cores for DLSS AI acceleration, delivering an unrivaled cinematic-quality experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077 Game Ready Driver Available Now\nWhen you enter the world of Cyberpunk 2077, ensure you have our new Game Ready Driver installed for optimum performance.

The GA104 is one of the many Ampere GPUs that we will be getting on the gaming segment. The GA104 GPU is the second-fastest gaming GPU that NVIDIA has produced.\nThe GPU is based on Samsung's 8nm custom process node designed specifically for NVIDIA and features a total of 17.4 Billion transistors. It measures at 395mm2 which makes it the 2nd biggest gaming GPU ever produced right below the Turing TU102 GPU.\nThe new shader core on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture is 2.7x faster, the new RT cores are 1.7x faster while the new Tensor cores are up to 2.7x faster than the previous generation Turing GPUs. The 2nd Generation RT core delivers dedicated hardware-accelerated ray-tracing performance & features twice the ray/triangles intersection with concurrent RT graphics and compute operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nFor the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, NVIDIA has enabled a total of 38 SM units on its flagship which results in a total of 4864 CUDA cores. In addition to the CUDA cores, NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3060 Ti also comes packed with next-generation RT (Ray-Tracing) cores, Tensor cores, and brand new SM or streaming multi-processor units. The GPU runs at a base clock speed of 1410 MHz and a boost clock speed of 1665 MHz. The card has a TDP of 180W.\nIn terms of memory, the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti comes packed with 8 GB of GDDR6 memory. The memory runs across a 256-bit bus wide interface and features an effective clock speed of 14.00 Gbps which delivers a cumulative bandwidth of 448 GB/s, the same as the GeForce RTX 3070.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series 'Ampere' Graphics Card Specifications:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAmpere GA106-300Ampere GA104-200Ampere GA104-300Ampere GA102-200Ampere GA102-300\n\n\nProcess NodeSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie SizeTBC395.2mm2395.2mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2\n\n\nTransistorsTBC17.4 Billion17.4 Billion28 Billion28 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores358448645888870410496\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs112 / 64152 / 80184 / 96272 / 96328 / 112\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores112 / 28152 / 38184 / 46272 / 68328 / 82\n\n\nBase Clock1320 MHz1410 MHz1500 MHz1440 MHz1400 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock1780 MHz1665 MHz1730 MHz1710 MHz1700 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute13 TFLOPs16 TFLOPs20 TFLOPs30 TFLOPs36 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPs25 TFLOPs32 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs58 TFLOPs69 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPs101 TOPs192 TOPs163 TOPs238 TOPs285 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity12 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR610 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Bus192-bit256-bit256-bit320-bit384-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed16 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps19 Gbps19.5 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth384 Gbps448 Gbps448 Gbps760 Gbps936 Gbps\n\n\nTGP170W175W220W320W350W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$329 US$399 US$499 US$699 US$1499 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)25th February 20212nd December 202029th October 202017th September 202024th September 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n137\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n84\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n78\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n52\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n49\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

To take full advantage of the new possibilities ray tracing introduced in the free 1.16.200 update for Minecraft for Windows 10, physically-based textures have also been introduced, featuring extra surface detail, the ability to emit light, and more. To further enhance the visual experience of RTX, creators can also define their own settings for the fog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay Tracing Off (PBR Enabled Textures)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay Tracing On (Same PBR Enabled Textures)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this guide, we\u2019ll walk you through the steps of creating your own Minecraft PBR textures, or upgrading your existing textures and texture packs, so that your ray-traced Minecraft worlds take full advantage of everything that Bedrock Minecraft brings to the table.\nIn addition, we\u2019ll demonstrate how you can create your own high-resolution textures for worlds made of lifelike high definition blocks, and offer an alternative, simpler, easier workflow using the premium Substance Painter application.\nLastly, we\u2019ll cover the system for setting up your own definition for the custom fog to polish off your custom PBR-enhanced resource pack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a guide on how to convert your world, head here. And to ensure you have optimal gaming experiences, download the latest Game Ready Driver for Minecraft for Windows 10 For more information on Minecraft with ray tracing, check out the Mojang Studios FAQs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinecraft Texturing Overview\nMost texture files in vanilla Minecraft (Bedrock) only use 2 maps: base color and opacity. The base color map is stored in the RGB channels of the texture. This is the texture map that most people think of when talking about Minecraft textures.\nSome textures also have an additional opacity map that is either stored in the alpha channel (for .TGA texture files) or stored implicitly (for .PNG texture files). For Minecraft with RTX, you\u2019ll want to use .TGA files with alpha channels for opacity maps. More on that later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new PBR system uses these 2 maps, as well as 5 additional ones, to help describe the realistic material surface that is being represented by the texture:\n\nMetallic map (sometimes called \u201cmetalness\u201d)\nEmissive map\nRoughness map\nNormal\nHeight map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsset Flow\nThis is how the various PBR texture maps relate to objects in the game:\n6 PBR Texture Maps >packed into> 3 Texture Files (.PNG) >defined by a> Texture Set >for each> Block/Item/Object\nCurrently, each of the 6 PBR maps get packed into the channels of 3 texture files, which are then used by the game. Packing the maps reduces the overall file size and number of files of the new texture set. The texture set must be defined by a JSON file.\nFor example, for a PBR version of the \u201cgold_ore\u201d block:\n\nTexture set JSON = gold_ore.texture_set.json\n\nFile names or value-uniforms for up to 3 layers.\nThe JSON schema is explored in the Texture Set JSON Schema section.\n \nTexture file 1 = gold_ore.png\n\nRed, Green, and Blue (RGB) channels = Base Color map\nAlpha (A) channel = None. Not used for this specific texture set since the gold_ore block is intended to be fully opaque.\nNote: Texture sets that do use opacity maps can store them in this alpha channel. See the Opacity Maps section.\n \nTexture file 2 = gold_ore_mer.png\n\nRed channel = Metallic map (grayscale)\nGreen channel = Emissive map (grayscale)\nBlue channel = Roughness map (grayscale)\nAlpha (A) channel = None. Alpha is ignored, texture image may be 3-channel on disk to save space in a resource pack.\nThe \u201c*_mer\u201d suffix is just a reminder that the Metallic, Emissive, and Roughness maps go into the RGB channels, respectively.\n \nTexture file 3 (option 1)= gold_ore_normal.png\n\nRGB channels = Normal map\nNote: mutually exclusive with use of heightmap layer.\nAlpha (A) channel = None. Not used at this time\n \nTexture file 3 (option 2) = gold_ore_heightmap.png\n\nNote: mutually exclusive with use of normal layer. See the Height Maps subsection of the New PBR Texture Maps section.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA and Partner Resource Packs\nThe fourteen, free Minecraft with RTX ray tracing worlds include creator-made PBR resource packs that you can check out. These upgrade textures to follow the Physically Based Rendering pipeline laid out below, and are optimized for maximum performance and detail.\nNVIDIA has also released a new resource pack that\u2019s compatible with the latest version of Minecraft with RTX, and has been updated February 2nd, 2021. Download here, then double click the file and it should automatically be installed for use in-game.\nTo use, download the file and double click the .mcpack file, and it should automatically add the resource pack to your world and enable you to play with RTX ON!\nThere are also two previously released packs from April 2020 which can be used to experiment with textures (CAUTION: These packs may break the RTX experience in the latest version of Minecraft with RTX). HD Decorative Resource Pack and HD Foundational Resource Pack, were created by NVIDIA, but they should not be activated at the same time. If you do activate them at the same time, you will see a resource pack fall back resulting in other textures down-rezzing. \u00a0\nWith these packs, you will be able to experiment with both high-resolution textures (1024x1024) and low-resolution textures (8x8 or 16x16) with PBR capabilities.\nFurther, to demonstrate the possibilities of the new Minecraft PBR textures, we\u2019ve worked with Razzleberries to create the RTX Expo Museum world, a large Smithsonian-esque museum showcasing every enhancement, benefit, and improvement offered by Minecraft with RTX. As you stroll through the world, you\u2019ll see how PBR textures work in concert with ray tracing to enable a level of detail and fidelity that was previously impossible to achieve with traditional rasterization and effects.\nAnd if you make your own textures, you can quickly and easily test them in this world by overwriting the existing textures, accelerating your workflow and iteration speed.\nIn addition, we\u2019ve worked with some of the planet\u2019s best Minecrafters to develop fourteen free Creator Worlds that feature top to bottom path tracing, and PBR texturing, giving you ideas for your own worlds and textures. Download them from the Minecraft Marketplace in-game by searching for \u201cRTX\u201d, or follow the download links here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHopefully, these stunning showcases will provide you with inspiration for your own PBR textures and ray-traced world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTools Needed\nTo create your own PBR texture sets, you will need a photo-editing/digital painting application. Here are a few excellent options:\n\nAdobe Photoshop\nGIMP\nPaint.net\nPixlr.com\nGraphicsGale, etc.\n\nYou will also need a quick plaintext file editor to write your texture set JSON, the default text editor for your operating system will work, but Sublime Text is a good alternative as it supports syntax coloring.\nThis guide will cover the Photoshop workflow specifically, but the concepts should transfer to other digital painting applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpacity Maps\nPay special care to the colors that get stored under the alpha channel as on blocks like Glass, the colors will still apply even if masked by full transparency. To mitigate this, ensure the color is fully white, and save the image as a 32-bits/pixel .TGA file to ensure consistency and avoid an unexpected surprise from PNG image exporters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: In the initial release of Minecraft with RTX, the client will use the same textures for both RTX enabled and disabled. This means that an opacity value that is tuned for RTX enabled might look too transparent when RTX is disabled.\u00a0 To help balance this out, the game will only use the upper half of the range of the texture\u2019s alpha channel (0.5 - 1) when RTX is enabled, but it will map this range to the full range of opacity in the game so no functionality is lost. For RTX disabled, the full range of the alpha channel will be mapped to the full range opacity in the game.\nExamples:\nIf the texture\u2019s alpha channel value = 0 (black), then:\nFor RTX enabled in the game, texture opacity =\u00a0 0 (fully transparent)\nFor RTX disabled in the game, texture opacity = 0 (fully transparent) \u00a0\nIf the texture\u2019s alpha channel value = 0.5 (middle gray), then:\nFor RTX enabled in the game, texture opacity =\u00a0 0 (still fully transparent)\nFor RTX disabled in the game, texture opacity = 0.5 (50% opaque)\n\u00a0\nIf the texture\u2019s alpha channel value = 0.75 (light gray), then:\nFor RTX enabled in the game, texture opacity =\u00a0 0.5 (50% opaque)\nFor RTX disabled in the game, texture opacity = 0.75 (75% opaque)\n\u00a0\nIf the texture\u2019s alpha channel value = 1 (white), then:\nFor RTX enabled in the game, texture opacity =\u00a0 1 (fully opaque)\nFor RTX disabled in the game, texture opacity = 1 (fully opaque)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexture Set JSON Schema\nTo begin your PBR enhancements for any texture, you must start it off with a JSON file to define the PBR settings. For further info and documentation, head to the official Minecraft.net page.\nThe JSON schema is defined as follows:\n\nformat_version: The schema version this JSON was written for.\nminecraft:texture_set:\u00a0 The material definitions for the PBR Texture\n\ncolor: Your base color layer.\n\nThis can be a quoted image file name reference (PNG, TGA, or JPG file types allowed), with or without file extension.\nIt can also be a comma-separated square bracketed list of 3 or 4 values of Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha to set the whole texture as a uniform color. These values can range between 0 and 255.\nIt can also be an ARGB hex value as a string beginning with the # character.\nThis layer is required and your texture will be a pink/black checkerboard otherwise.\n \nmetalness_emissive_roughness: Your texture containing metallicity, emissivity, and roughness information.\n\nThis can be a quoted image file name reference (PNG, TGA, or JPG file types allowed), with or without file extension.\nIt can also be a square bracketed list of 3 values for metallicity, emissivity, and roughness to set the texture uniformly. These values can range between 0 and 255.\nIt can also be an RGB hex value as a string beginning with the # character.\nExcluding this layer will result in the texture having a non-metallic matte look.\n \nnormal: Your material containing per-pixel normals for the texture.\n\nThis can only be a quoted filename reference (PNG, TGA, or JPG file types allowed), with or without\u00a0 file extension.\nIt is mutually exclusive with heightmap.\n \nheightmap: Your material containing per-pixel heights for the texture.\n\nThis can only be a quoted filename reference (PNG, TGA, or JPG file types allowed), with or without file extension.\nIt is mutually exclusive with normal.\n \n \n\nFor the file name, take the name of the original texture without the extension and add it to the beginning of .texture_set.json, for instance, gold_ore.texture_set.json, for the gold_ore.png. Then the JSON file goes into the same folder.\nHere is an example JSON file following the texture set schema, also demonstrating the correct value usage for each definition:\n{  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"format_version\": \"1.16.100\",  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"minecraft:texture_set\": {  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"color\": [118, 185, 0, 255],  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"metalness_emissive_roughness\": \u201c#0008FF\u201d,  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"normal\": \"an_example_normal\"  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 }  }\nFurther details on each of these texture set attributes are explained in depth in the following.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew PBR Texture Maps\nThe PBR system doesn\u2019t require you to use all of the PBR maps for every texture set. However, you will get the best looking results if you do.\n\nMetallic map - How metallic is a pixel in your texture:\n\nValue of 0 (black) means non-metallic (wool, wood, plastic, dirt, grass. etc.)\nValue of 1 (white) means fully metallic (gold, iron, copper, etc.)\nGrayscale values between 0 and 1 can also be used. Values other than black or white will function, but are usually incorrect in PBR rendering.\u00a0 A well-made metallic map will usually contain black and white pixels only.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, the block has uniform roughness on all of its surfaces, but it is using a metallic map to control which pixels are metallic (white), and which pixels are non-metallic (black). The metallic pixels look more like gold while the non-metallic pixels look more like shiny, yellow plastic.\n\nEmissive map - How much a pixel in your texture should glow:\n\nValue of 0 (black) means no glow\nValue of 1 (white) means the strongest glow\nGrayscale values between 0 and 1 can also be used\nThe Color of the glow is determined by the pixels in the base color map\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoughness map - How rough (to the touch) is a pixel in your texture:\n\nValue of 0 (black) means very smooth (glass, polished stone, etc.)\nValue of 1 (white) means very rough (dry dirt, bark, wool, etc.)\nGrayscale values between 0 and 1 can also be used\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, the block has uniform metalness on all of its surfaces, but it is using a roughness map to control which pixels are very rough (white), which pixels are very smooth (black), and some pixels that are somewhere in between (gray). The smooth, less rough pixels look more like shiny blue gemstones while the rough pixels look more like rough gray rock.\n\nNormal map - how raised is a pixel in your texture \n\nNormal maps use the 3 color channels (RGB) in the texture to change how light behaves when hitting the texture. By doing this, it can fake surface details that appear to stick up or recede down into the surface of the 3D mesh.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRGB values of (128, 128, 255) means the pixel doesn\u2019t stick up or recede down when lit. It will appear at the height of the surface of the 3D mesh. When in doubt, use this default color for your normal map, or don\u2019t use one at all to save on file size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRGB values other than this default color (above) should not be manually painted unless you\u2019re confident working with normal maps this way. Normal maps are usually automatically generated from other height information when using specific software applications. More details can be found later in this document.\n\nHeight map - alternative to a normal map for giving pixels height or depth.\nHeight maps have some limitations and should only be used for pixelated texture sets like the 16x16 pixel vanilla Minecraft textures. If you\u2019re painting non-pixelated textures, consider using a normal map instead of a heightmap.\n\nHeightmaps use a 1 color channel (grayscale) in the texture to change how light behaves when hitting the texture.\nR channel values mean the pixel sticks up or recedes inward.\n\nValue of 1 means the pixel will appear to stick out\nValue of 0 means the pixel will recede inward\nValue of 0.5 means no surface change\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefining the Texture Set\nFirst things first, let\u2019s start our PBR texture set for the Gold Ore block before we start texturing our example, with the gold_ore.texture_set.json texture set JSON:\n{\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"format_version\": \"1.16.100\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"minecraft:texture_set\": {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"color\": \"gold_ore\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"metalness_emissive_roughness\": \"gold_ore_mer\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"normal\": \"gold_ore_normal\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating the Base Color and Opacity Texture File\nDefining the Texture Set\nFirst things first, let\u2019s start our PBR texture set for the Gold Ore block before we start texturing our example, with the gold_ore.texture_set.json texture set JSON: { \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"format_version\": \"1.16.200\", \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"minecraft:texture_set\": { \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"color\": \"gold_ore\", \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"metalness_emissive_roughness\": \"gold_ore_mer\", \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"normal\": \"gold_ore_normal\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 } } \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating the Base Color and Opacity Texture File\nLet\u2019s create custom base color and opacity maps:\n1. Open a vanilla Minecraft texture in the app as a starting point, or skip to Step 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Create a new document at the texture resolution that you want. (16x16 pixels for most vanilla Minecraft textures) Also, 72 pixels/inch is recommended for the pixel density.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Create working layers for the base color and opacity map (if needed). Paint what you want and make any edits in these layers. In the example below, multiple layers have been painted to edit the base color map (more gold!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Once you have the base color and opacity map layers looking the way you want, it\u2019s a good idea to save your Photoshop document using the name of the object\u2019s texture set.  For this example, this file was saved as \u201cgold_ore.PSD\u201d. Next, we need to save out a texture file that the game can use.\nNote: For most game objects, transparent pixels in the opacity map must also be painted black in the base color map (e.g. tree leaves). However, there are exceptions where the transparent pixels must also be painted white in the base color map in order to appear correct in the game (e.g. rails). Some experimentation may be necessary. \n5. (Optional, for non-opaque objects only) - Duplicate your opacity map layers, merge the duplicates together to create a single layer, and then copy it (Ctrl+C).\n6. (Optional, for non-opaque objects only) - In the Channels tab, create a new alpha channel, and paste (Ctrl+V) your merged opacity map into this channel. Click on the small gray box to the left of the RGB channel to make the RGB channels visible again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou now have your base color map being stored in the RGB channels and the opacity map stored in the alpha channel.\n7. (Optional, for non-opaque objects only) - Go back to the Layers tab and hide any of your opacity map layers. Only your base color map layers should be showing.\n8. Re-save the .PSD.\n9. Use the Save As command to save a .PNG texture file that can be used by the game. \nNote on opacity: You will save out a 32-bits/pixel .TGA file at this step if your object is intended to be non-opaque and uses an opacity map in the alpha channel. See the Opacity Maps section above.\nNote on naming: File naming is important at this step! This .PNG should have the same name as the game object that you are modifying. For this example, this file was saved as \u201cgold_ore.PNG\u201d.\n10. You have successfully created the first of 3 texture files for a complete PBR texture set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating the Metallic, Emissive, and Roughness Texture File\nNext, you\u2019ll want to create the second PBR texture file combining the metallic, emissive, and roughness PBR maps.\n1. (Optional) Open a vanilla Minecraft texture in Photoshop or a similar app as a starting point, or skip to the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Create a new document at the same texture resolution as your first texture file (base color and opacity map). (16x16 pixels for most vanilla Minecraft textures) Again, 72 pixels/inch is recommended for the pixel density.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Create working layers for the metallic, emissive, and roughness map. Paint what you want and make any edits in these layers.\nNote: You only need to paint these maps using grayscale values.\nIn the example below, multiple layers have been painted to create the desired roughness map result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Make sure to place layers of each map type into layer groups. This is important for the next few steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Right-click on the Metallic layer group and select \u201cBlending Options\u201d.\n6. Uncheck the green (G) and blue (B) channels:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Click \u201cOK\u201d to close the Blending Options window for the Metallic layer group.\n8. Right-click on the Emissive layer group and select \u201cBlending Options\u201d.\n9. Uncheck the red (R) and blue (B) channels:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Click \u201cOK\u201d to close the Blending Options window for the Emissive layer group.\n11. Right-click on the Roughness layer group and select \u201cBlending Options\u201d.\n12. Uncheck the red (R) and green (G) channels:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13. Click \u201cOK\u201d to close the Blending Options window for the Roughness layer group.\n14. Once you have the metallic, emissive, and roughness map layers looking the way you want, it\u2019s a good idea to save your Photoshop document using the name of the object\u2019s texture set with the addition of the *_mer suffix.\nFor this example, this file was saved as \u201cgold_ore_mer.PSD\u201d. Next, we need to save out a texture file that the game can use.\n15. Use the Save As command to save a .PNG texture file that can be used by the game.\nNote: Again, file naming is important at this step. This .PNG file should have the same name as the game object that you are modifying with the addition of the *_mer suffix. For this example, the file was saved as \u201cgold_ore_mer.PNG\u201d.\n16. You have successfully created the second of 3 texture files for a complete PBR texture set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating the Normal Texture File\nNormal maps are usually created using specialized tools. There are many professional software options as well as some great, free alternatives available:\n\nFree Tool - xNormal\nAdobe Photoshop - Filters \u2192 3D \u2192 Generate Normal Map\nPBR Painting - Substance Painter\nPBR Painting - Quixel Mixer\n\nExample of a brick wall PBR texture set (left) and its normal map (right):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a normal map using your preferred tool or workflow at the same resolution as your first texture file (base color and opacity map). Again, 72 pixels/inch is recommended for the pixel density.\n\nUse the Save As command to save a .PNG texture file that can be used by the game. Note: Again, file naming is important at this step. This .PNG should have the same name as the game object that you are modifying with the addition of the *_normal suffix. For this example, the file was saved as \u201cgold_ore_normal.PNG\u201d.  If you\u2019re not familiar with creating normal maps, you can always just leave it out or create a \u201cblank\u201d normal map by filling a texture with (128, 128, 255) RGB color and saving the .PNG file.  Alternatively, since the \u201cgold_ore\u201d example is a pixelated texture, we could have also used the height map option to create surface details. The file name would still be \u201cgold_ore_normal.TGA\u201d in this example, but the information stored in the texture channels would be different. See the Height Maps subsection of the New PBR Texture Maps section above for more info. \n\nFinished! You have created the third and final texture file for a complete PBR texture set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternate Workflow: Using Photoshop\u2019s Generate Image Assets Function\nInstead of having 3 Photoshop .PSD files for each of the 3 PBR texture files, you could alternatively use a single .PSD file and take advantage of Photoshop\u2019s Generate \u2192 Image Assets function in the File menu. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs long as you create a layer group for each PBR texture file and name it with the correct file name and file type (.png), they will save themselves automatically after each change (after you initially save the .PSD file).\nMore information can be found here.\nNote: Since this function cannot output .TGA files, you won\u2019t be able to use it to save a texture file with an alpha channel like those needed for non-opaque texture sets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaveats for Creating Mirrors with Perfect Reflections\nUsing PBR maps like metalness and roughness along with ray tracing, you can create highly reflective materials like shiny plastics, smooth metal, or polished stone. All of these will have high quality reflections.\nHowever, for perfectly reflective objects like mirrors, you\u2019ll want to configure your PBR maps to enable a perfect mirror.\u00a0 If you use a solid black roughness map (0.0) and a solid white (1.0) metalness map, the game will interpret your material as a perfect mirror. This means that the ray tracing code can take some shorter paths during its calculations since it knows that the material will fully reflect the environment without any additional details to take into account.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Create PBR Textures in Substance by Adobe\nIf you have access to the Substance Painter app, you can create higher resolution PBR texture sets in a much more intuitive manner. This software lets you see all of the maps of your PBR texture set displayed in real-time on mesh geometry. This allows you to tune your texture maps as you work without having to launch the game, move any files around, or modify channels.\n1. Launch the application and select New Project from the File menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Template = Unreal Engine 4 - This will automatically set a variety of application and viewer settings. Feel free to try other options or make your own template!\n3. File \u2192 Select - This is where you select what mesh you would like to display and paint your textures on. For Minecraft with RTX, using a 1 meter by 1 meter cube mesh with just 6 faces (no subdivisions) will give you an exact preview of how your textures will look when mapped onto a block in the game. Using the .FBX mesh format is recommended.\n4. Document Resolution - This is the texture resolution that you\u2019re targeting. Note: This setting can be changed later non-destructively at any time. For HD textures, it\u2019s recommended to work at 1024 - you\u2019ll get lots of detail in your textures with minimal pixelation, the app will run nice and fast on most PC setups, and your HD textures should look sharp in the game.\nIf you\u2019ve only ever worked with textures in vanilla Minecraft, you\u2019ll notice that you can\u2019t select 16 pixels by 16 pixels here for your resolution (the lowest is 128). However, you can always author and export textures at 128x128 (or larger) and scale them down later in an image-editing application like Photoshop.\n5. Normal Map Format = DirectX (leave as default)\n6. Compute Tangent Space Per Fragment = True (leave as default)\n7. Add - (Optional) Here you can choose to import any supporting textures that you already have completed. If replacing a vanilla Minecraft texture with an HD version, it can be helpful to import the vanilla texture here for use as a reference. Note: This import step can also be performed later at any time. For this example, the vanilla \u201ciron_block\u201d texture file is going to be imported when the new project is created to be used as a reference.\n8. Click \u201cOK\u201d. The application should open this new project that you\u2019re creating and look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. It\u2019s a good idea to add the emissive map to your texture set list at this point. Even if your texture set isn\u2019t going to use emissivity, don\u2019t worry, it will default to black (0.0) and won\u2019t hurt anything. Note: You can also add an opacity map to your texture set list in the same way if you\u2019re planning on creating a non-fully opaque texture set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. (Optional) Next, add your texture reference to a new fill layer in the Base Color slot. You\u2019ll find your imported reference texture on the Shelf under the Project heading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayers are automatically set to bilinear filtering when created, which can make pixelated textures like vanilla Minecraft textures look blurry. To correct this, just set the layer\u2019s Filtering to Nearest. However, if you\u2019re not using pixelated textures, leave your layer filtering on the default setting of bilinear HQ.  From here, it\u2019s also a good idea to set this reference layer to have full roughness (1.0), no metalness (0.0), and no emissivity (black: 0, 0, 0). This will make sure that the reference texture is displayed in Painter as close to the vanilla game as it can be.  Note: If you didn\u2019t import reference textures or other resources when you created the project, you can do so at any time using the Import Resources button on the Shelf. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11. Now is a great time to save your project. It\u2019s recommended to name your Painter project after the game object whose texture set you are replacing. For this example, this project file has been saved as \u201ciron_block.SPP\u201d. Naming your project this way will make things easier when exporting your texture set later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12. From here, you can create your texture set with all of its PBR maps as you see fit.  In this example, a new fill layer was added (with some adjustment sub-layers) to create a dark, high definition iron material. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13. Next, a new fill layer adding an indent detail to give the surface of the block some new character.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14. And finally, another fill layer to add some dirt collecting in the corners of the indent and some scratches randomly across the surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15. Re-save as needed.  16. Now that the whole texture set is looking great inside Painter, you need to export your textures. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Select: File \u2192 Export Textures to open the export subwindow.  17. Create a new export preset configuration like this, which will output your texture set in a way that can be used by the game build. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the \u201c$project\u201d prefix on each output map will name each of the exported texture files after the name of the project. So, if you named your project after the game object that this texture set will belong to, all of your exported textures will immediately be ready for use in the game without any additional renaming.  18. Once you have your export preset set up, select it in the \u201cConfig\u201d field and use these recommended settings:  Location - This can be the textures location for the resource pack that you\u2019re working on. This makes things easier because you can export textures from Painter and they will immediately show up or be updated in the same folder that the game is referencing when it runs (assuming that you have your resource pack activated in the game).  PNG - Use this setting to ensure that your files can be used by the game and that they are as small and efficient as possible.  Texture set resolution - This is the size of the textures that will be exported. This setting is independent of the resolution of your project. So, if you want you work on your project at one resolution and then export files at another resolution. 1024x1024 is recommended for HD texture sets. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: The example above is for a fully opaque texture set. If you are using an opacity map in your texture set list for transparency, you will want to export your base color map as a targa (.TGA) file (instead of a .PNG) with the opacity map being stored in the alpha channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19. Re-save your project! This will save your export settings as well, which will make your workflow much faster as you do further iterations with your texture set.\n20. Finished! You have created your first set of HD PBR textures for Minecraft with RTX!

This fog stack is ordered by lowest priority to highest:\n\nHardcoded Engine defaults\nData Default settings from \u201cdefault\u201d object within biomes_client.json\nPer-Biome settings in biomes_client.json\n/fog Command\n\nBoth biomes_client.json and /fog Command refer to Fog Definitions which are defined in JSON with the \u201cfog\u201d folder of Resource Packs.\nFog Definitions\nEach Fog Definition is a JSON file in the \u201cfog\u201d folder of a Resource Pack. An example looks like:\n{ \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"format_version\": \"1.16.2100\", \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"minecraft:fog_settings\": { \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"description\": { \"identifier\": \"nvidia:example_fog\" }, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"distance\": { \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"air\": { \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"fog_start\": 0.92, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"fog_end\": 1.0, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"fog_color\": \"#ABD2FF\", \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"render_distance_type\": \"render\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 } \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 }, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"volumetric\": { \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"max_density\": { \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"air\": { \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"max_density\": 0.1, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"max_density_height\": 56, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"zero_density_height\": 70 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 } \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 }, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"media_coefficients\": { \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"air\": { \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"scattering\": [ 0.02, 0.02, 0.02 ], \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"absorption\": [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 } \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 } \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 } \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 } } \nThe schema for a Fog Definition.\n\nformat_version: The schema version this JSON was written for.\nminecraft:fog_settings: An entry for the fog definition.\n\nDescription\n\nidentifier: A quoted unique name, prefixed with a namespace followed by a colon.

That\u2019s the image for many when they hear the term \u201crobotaxi.\u201d But there\u2019s much more to these futuristic, driverless vehicles than meets the eye. They could be, in fact, the next generation of transportation.\nAutomakers, suppliers and startups have been dedicated to developing fully autonomous vehicles for the past decade, though none has yet to deploy a self-driving fleet at scale.\nThe process is taking longer than anticipated because creating and deploying robotaxis aren\u2019t the same as pushing out next year\u2019s new car model. Instead, they\u2019re complex supercomputers on wheels with no human supervision, requiring a unique end-to-end process to develop, roll out and continually enhance.\nThe difference between these two types of vehicles is staggering. The amount of sensor data a robotaxi needs to process is 100 times greater than today\u2019s most advanced vehicles. The complexity in software also increases exponentially, with an array of redundant and diverse deep neural networks (DNNs) running simultaneously as part of an integrated software stack.\nThese autonomous vehicles also must be constantly upgradeable to take advantage of the latest advances in AI algorithms. Traditional cars are at their highest level of capability at the point of sale. With yearslong product development processes and a closed architecture, these vehicles can\u2019t take advantage of features that come about after they leave the factory.\nWhat\u2019s a Robotaxi? A Vehicle That Gets Better and Better Over Time\nWith an open, software-defined architecture, robotaxis will be at their most basic capability when they first hit the road. Powered by DNNs that are continuously improved and updated in the vehicle, self-driving cars will constantly be at the cutting edge.\nThese new capabilities all require high-performance, centralized compute. Achieving this paradigm shift in personal transportation requires reworking the entire development pipeline from end to end, with a unified architecture from training, to validation, to real-time processing.\nNVIDIA is the only company that enables this end-to-end development, which is why virtually every robotaxi maker and supplier \u2014 from Zoox and Voyage in the U.S., to DiDi Chuxing in China, to Yandex in Russia \u2014 is using its GPU-powered offerings.\nInstalling New Infrastructure\nCurrent advanced driver assistance systems are built on features that have become more capable over time, but don\u2019t necessarily rely on AI. Autonomous vehicles, however, are born out of the data center. To operate in thousands of conditions around the world requires intensive DNN training using mountains of data. And that data grows exponentially as the number of AVs on the road increases.\nTo put that in perspective, a fleet of just 50 vehicles driving six hours a day generates about 1.6 petabytes of sensor data daily. If all that data were stored on standard 1GB flash drives, they\u2019d cover more than 100 football fields. This data must then be curated and labeled to train the DNNs that will run in the car, performing a variety of dedicated functions, such as object detection and localization.\nNVIDIA DRIVE infrastructure provides the unified architecture needed to train self-driving DNNs on massive amounts of data.\nThis data center infrastructure isn\u2019t also used to test and validate DNNs before vehicles operate on public roads. The NVIDIA DRIVE Sim software and NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation autonomous vehicle simulator deliver a scalable, comprehensive and diverse testing environment. DRIVE Sim is an open platform with plug-ins for third-party models from ecosystem partners, allowing users to customize it for their unique use cases.\nNVIDIA DRIVE Constellation and NVIDIA DRIVE Sim deliver a virtual proving ground for autonomous vehicles.\nThis entire development infrastructure is critical to deploying robotaxis at scale and is only possible through the unified, open and high-performance compute delivered by GPU technology.\nRe-Thinking the Wheel\nThe same processing capabilities required to train, test and validate robotaxis are just as necessary in the vehicle itself.\nA centralized AI compute architecture makes it possible to run the redundant and diverse DNNs needed to replace the human driver all at once. This architecture must also be open to take advantage of new features and DNNs.\nThe DRIVE family is built on a single scalable architecture ranging from one NVIDIA Orin variant that sips just five watts of energy and delivers 10 TOPS of performance all the way up to the new DRIVE AGX Pegasus, featuring the next-generation Orin SoC and NVIDIA Ampere architecture for thousands of operations per second.\nWith a single scalable architecture, robotaxi makers have the flexibility to develop new types of vehicles on NVIDIA DRIVE AGX.\nSuch a high level of performance is necessary to replace and perform better than a human driver. Additionally, the open and modular nature of the platform enables robotaxi companies to create custom configurations to accommodate the new designs opened up by removing the human driver (along with steering wheel and pedals).\nWith the ability to use as many processors as needed to analyze data from the dozens of onboard sensors, developers can ensure safety through diversity and redundancy of systems and algorithms.\nThis level of performance has taken years of investment and expertise to achieve. And, by using a single scalable architecture, companies can easily transition to the latest platforms without sacrificing valuable software development time.\nContinuous Improvement\nBy combining data center and in-vehicle solutions, robotaxi companies can create a continuous, end-to-end development cycle for constant improvement.\nAs DNNs undergo improvement and learn new capabilities in the data center, the validated algorithms can be delivered to the car\u2019s compute platform over the air for a vehicle that is forever featuring the latest and greatest technology.\n\nThis continuous development cycle extends joy to riders and opens new, transformative business models to the companies building this technology.\n\n\nCategories: Driving | ExplainerTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Intel spokesman William Moss said the company does not tolerate its products being used to violate human rights and when the company becomes aware of such a concern it ceases or restricts business with third parties until it has confidence its products are not used to commit such violations. Advertisement \nThe United Nations has estimated that more than a million Muslims have been detained in camps in the Xinjiang region. The US State Department has accused Chinese officials of subjecting Uighur Muslims to torture, abuse \u201cand trying to basically erase their culture and their religion\u201d.\nEarlier this year, US President Donald Trump signed legislation calling for sanctions over the repression of China\u2019s Uighurs.\nChina denies the mistreatment and has said the camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism.\nSource: Reutersaj-logoaj-logoaj-logo Sponsored Content  Advertisement AboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usStay ConnectedNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2025 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"

On PC, this breathtaking game is enhanced with ray-traced reflections, diffuse illumination, ambient occlusion and shadows, and NVIDIA DLSS, delivering the best possible Cyberpunk 2077 experience.\nCheck out our world premiere Behind The Scenes video featuring some of the devs from CD PROJEKT RED, showcasing new Cyberpunk 2077 RTX ON gameplay, captured on GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs:\n  \nToday, we\u2019re also unveiling the recommended system configurations for RTX ON gameplay, helping you pick out the parts for a Cyberpunk 2077-ready system that delivers the experience you desire.\nWith RTX ON, Night City is transformed. Glorious ray-traced reflections are cast on every possible surface; substantially improved shadows naturally soften and sharpen; shops, streets and buildings are realistically illuminated with diffuse lighting; and in general the world is more immersive and detailed, enhancing your Cyberpunk 2077 experience.\nThe minimum GPU for Ray Tracing, at 1920x1080, is the GeForce RTX 2060. Gamers will explore Night City with Medium Ray Tracing Preset powered by DLSS.\nAt 2560x1440, we recommend a GeForce RTX 3070 or GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. Ray tracing is taken to Ultra, which greatly increases the fidelity of the aforementioned effects, and the distance at which they are visible, while DLSS provides boosted frame rates with uncompromised image quality. And with rasterized settings also being cranked to Ultra, GeForce RTX 3070 and 2080 Ti gamers receive an incredible experience at the highest detail levels, unmatched by any other platform.\nAnd finally, if you\u2019re playing at 4K or beyond, the GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3090 deliver the performance to play Cyberpunk 2077 with ray tracing at Ultra at this incredibly demanding resolution. Both GPUs are powered by Ampere\u2014NVIDIA\u2019s 2nd gen RTX architecture\u2014with dedicated RT Cores for ray tracing, and Tensor Cores for DLSS AI acceleration, delivering an unrivaled cinematic-quality experience.\n\nIf you lack a GeForce RTX PC or laptop, or are away from your gaming system, you can play RTX-enhanced Cyberpunk 2077 at release via GeForce NOW, our cloud gaming service. GeForce NOW gives your low-end rig the power to stream Cyberpunk 2077 with RTX ON. Explore the streets of Night City across all your devices, streaming from the cloud. And instantly play your existing PC library from stores like Steam, UPlay and the Epic Games Store.\n  \nAs we approach Cyberpunk 2077 release on December 10th, stay tuned to GeForce.com for more RTX ON trailers and screenshots, our Cyberpunk 2077 Game Ready Driver, and more Cyberpunk 2077 PC content.\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

That\u2019s more than an order of magnitude greater efficiency than today\u2019s commercial chips.\nMAGNet uses new techniques to orchestrate the flow of information through a device in ways that minimize the data movement that burns most of the energy in today\u2019s chips. The research prototype is implemented as a modular set of tiles so it can scale flexibly.\nA separate effort seeks to replace today\u2019s electrical links inside systems with faster optical ones.\nFiring on All Photons\n\u201cWe can see our way to doubling the speed of our NVLink [that connects GPUs] and maybe doubling it again, but eventually electrical signaling runs out of gas,\u201d said Dally, who holds more than 120 patents and chaired the computer science department at Stanford before joining NVIDIA in 2009.\nThe team is collaborating with researchers at Columbia University on ways to harness techniques telecom providers use in their core networks to merge dozens of signals onto a single optical fiber.\nCalled dense wavelength division multiplexing, it holds the potential to pack multiple terabits per second into links that fit into a single millimeter of space on the side of a chip, more than 10x the density of today\u2019s interconnects.\nBesides faster throughput, the optical links enable denser systems. For example, Dally showed a mockup (below) of a future NVIDIA DGX system with more than 160 GPUs.\nOptical links help pack dozens of GPUs in a system.\nIn software, NVIDIA\u2019s researchers have prototyped a new programming system called Legate. It lets developers take a program written for a single GPU and run it on a system of any size \u2014 even a giant supercomputer like Selene that packs thousands of GPUs.\nLegate couples a new form of programming shorthand with accelerated software libraries and an advanced runtime environment called Legion. It\u2019s already being put to the test at U.S. national labs.\nRendering a Vivid Future\nThe three research projects make up just one part of Dally\u2019s keynote, which describes NVIDIA\u2019s domain-specific platforms for a variety of industries such as healthcare, self-driving cars and robotics. He also delves into data science, AI and graphics.\n\u201cIn a few generations our products will produce amazing images in real time using path tracing with physically based rendering, and we\u2019ll be able to generate whole scenes with AI,\u201d said Dally.\nHe showed the first public demonstration that combines NVIDIA\u2019s conversational AI framework called Riva\u00a0with GauGAN, a tool that uses generative adversarial networks to create beautiful landscapes from simple sketches. The demo lets users instantly generate photorealistic landscapes using simple voice commands.\nIn an interview between recording sessions for the keynote, Dally expressed particular pride for the team\u2019s pioneering work in several areas.\n\u201cAll our current ray tracing started in NVIDIA Research with prototypes that got our product teams excited. And in 2011, I assigned [NVIDIA researcher] Bryan Catanzaro to work with [Stanford professor] Andrew Ng on a project that became CuDNN, software that kicked off much of our work in deep learning,\u201d he said.\nA First Foothold in Networking\nDally also spearheaded a collaboration that led to the first prototypes of NVLink and NVSwitch, interconnects that link GPUs running inside some of the world\u2019s largest supercomputers today.\n\u201cThe product teams grabbed the work out of our hands before we were ready to let go of it, and now we\u2019re considered one of the most advanced networking companies,\u201d he said.\nWith his passion for technology, Dally said he often feels like a kid in a candy store. He may hop from helping a group with an AI accelerator one day to helping another team sort through a complex problem in robotics the next.\n\u201cI have one of the most fun jobs in the company if not in the world because I get to help shape the future,\u201d he said.\nThe keynote is just one of more than 220 sessions at GTC China. All the sessions are free and most are conducted in Mandarin.\nPanel, Startup Showcase at GTC China\nFollowing the keynote, a panel of senior NVIDIA executives will discuss how the company\u2019s technologies in AI, data science, healthcare and other fields are being adopted in China.\nThe event also includes a showcase of a dozen top startups in China, hosted by NVIDIA Inception, an acceleration program for AI and data science startups.\nCompanies participating in GTC China include Alibaba, AWS, Baidu, ByteDance, China Telecom, Dell Technologies, Didi, New H3C Information Technologies, Inspur Electronic Information, Kuaishou, Lenovo, Microsoft, Ping An, Tencent, Tsinghua University and Xiaomi.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | ResearchTags: Artificial Intelligence | Conversational AI | GTC | Inference | Machine Learning | NVIDIA Research | NVLink | Ray Tracing | Riva \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The AI vehicles, which will be commercially available worldwide, will be powered by the latest in high-performance, energy-efficient compute \u2014 NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Orin.\nThese scalable self-driving haulers will begin to hit the road in 2023, with a variety of models available to customers around the world.\nAutonomous trucks are always learning, taking in vast amounts of data to navigate the unpredictability of the real world, from highways to crowded ports. This rapid processing requires centralized, high-performance AI compute.\nWith the power of AI, these vehicles can easily rise to the demands of the trucking industry. The vehicles can operate 24 hours a day, improving delivery times. And, with increased efficiency, they can slash the annual cost of logistics in the U.S. by 45 percent, according to experts at McKinsey.\nEinride\u2019s autonomous pods and trucks are built for every type of route. They can automate short, routine trips like the loading and unloading of containers on cargo ships and managing port operations, as well as autonomously drive on the highway, dramatically streamlining the shipping and logistics.\nEinride is a member of\u00a0NVIDIA Inception, a program that helps startups during critical stages of product development, prototyping and deployment.\nA New Pod Joins the Squad\nThe latest Einride Pod features a refined design that balances sleek features with the practical requirements of wide-scale production.\nIts rounded edges give it an aerodynamic shape for greater efficiency and performance, without sacrificing cargo space. The Pod\u2019s lighting system \u2014 which includes headlights, tail lights and indicators \u2014 provides a signature look while improving visibility for road users.\nThe cab-less truck comes in a range of variations, depending on use case. The AET 1 (Autonomous Electric Transport) model is purpose-built for closed facilities with dedicated routes \u2014 such as a port or loading bay. The AET 2 can handle fenced-in areas as well as short-distance public roads between destinations.\nThe AET 3 and AET 4 vehicles are designed for fully autonomous operation on backroads and highways, with speeds of up to 45 km per hour.\nEinride is currently accepting reservations for AET 1 and AET 2, with others set to ship starting in 2022.\nTrucking Ahead with Orin\nThe Einride Pod is able to achieve its scalability and autonomous functionality by leveraging the next generation in AI compute.\nNVIDIA Orin is a system-on-a-chip born out of the data center, consisting of 17 billion transistors and the result of four years of R&D investment. It achieves 200 TOPS \u2014 nearly 7x the performance of the previous generation SoC Xavier \u2014 and is designed to handle the large number of applications and deep neural networks that run simultaneously in autonomous trucks, while achieving systematic safety standards such as ISO 26262 ASIL-D.\n\nThis massive compute capability ensures the Einride Pod is continuously learning, expanding the environments and situations in which it can operate autonomously.\nThese next-generation electric, self-driving freight transport vehicles built on NVIDIA DRIVE are primed to safely increase productivity, improve utilization, reduce emissions and decrease the world\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels.\n\n\nCategories: Driving | HardwareTags: Inception | NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Or how long it takes the two-wheeled, NVIDIA Jetson TX2 powered robot, dubbed \u201cTrip,\u201d tending Selene to traverse the co-location facility \u2014 a kind of hotel for computers \u2014 housing the machine.\nOr even the quiet (by supercomputing standards) hum of the fans cooling its 555,520 computing cores and 1,120,000 gigabytes of memory, all connected by NVIDIA Mellanox HDR InfiniBand networking technology.\nIt\u2019s how closely it\u2019s wired into the day-to-day work of some of NVIDIA\u2019s top researchers.\nThat\u2019s why \u2014 with the rest of the company downshifting for the holidays \u2014 Mike Houston is busier than ever.\nIn Demand\nHouston, who holds a Ph.D. in computer science from Stanford and is a recent winner of the ACM Gordon Bell Prize, is NVIDIA\u2019s AI systems architect, coordinating time on Selene among more than 450 active users at the company.\nSorting through proposals to do work on the machine is a big part of his job. To do that, Houston says he aims to balance research, advanced development and production workloads.\nNVIDIA researchers such as Bryan Catanzaro, vice president for applied deep learning research, say there\u2019s nothing else like Selene.\n\u201cSelene is the only way for us to do our most challenging work,\u201d Catanzaro said, whose team will be putting the machine to work the week of the 21st. \u201cWe would not be able to do our jobs without it.\u201d\nCatanzaro leads a team of more than 40 researchers who are using the machine to help advance their work in large-scale language modeling, one of the toughest AI challenges\nHis words are echoed by researchers across NVIDIA vying for time on the machine.\nBuilt in just three weeks this spring, Selene\u2019s capacity has more than doubled since it was first turned on. That makes it the crown jewel in an ever-growing, interconnected complex of supercomputing power at NVIDIA.\nIn addition to large-scale language modeling, and, of course, performance runs, NVIDIA\u2019s computing power is used by teams working on everything from autonomous vehicles to next-generation graphics rendering to tools for quantum chemistry and genomics.\nHaving the ability to scale up to tackle big jobs, or tear off just enough power to tackle smaller tasks, is key, explains Marc Hamilton, vice president for solutions architecture and engineering at NVIDIA.\nHamilton matter of factly compares it to moving dirt. Sometimes a wheelbarrow is enough to get the job done. But for other jobs, where you need more dirt, you can\u2019t get the job done without a dump truck.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t do it to say it\u2019s the fifth-fastest supercomputer on Earth, but because we need it, because we use it every day,\u201d Hamilton says.\nThe Fast and the Flexible\nIt helps that the key component Selene is built with, NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, is incredibly efficient.\nA SuperPOD achieved 26.2 gigaflops/watt power-efficiency during its 2.4 HPL performance run, placing it atop the latest Green500 list of world\u2019s most efficient supercomputers.\n\nThat efficiency is a key factor in its ability to scale up, or carry bigger computing loads, by merely adding more SuperPODs.\nEach SuperPOD, in turn, is comprised of compact, pre-configured DGX A100 systems, which are built using the latest NVIDIA Ampere architecture A100 GPUs and\u00a0 NVIDIA Mellanox InfiniBand for the compute and storage fabric.\nContinental, Lockheed Martin and Microsoft are among the businesses that have adopted DGX SuperPODs.\nThe University of Florida\u2019s new supercomputer, expected to be the fastest in academia when it goes online, is also based on SuperPOD.\nSelene is now composed of four SuperPODs, each with a total of 140 nodes, each a NVIDIA DGX A100, giving Selene a total of 560 nodes, up from 280 earlier this year.\nA Need for Speed\nThat\u2019s all well and good, but Catanzaro wants all the computing power he can get.\nCatanzaro, who holds a doctorate in computer science from UC Berkeley, helped pioneer the use of GPUs to accelerate machine learning a decade ago by swapping out a 1,000 CPU system for three off-the-shelf NVIDIA Geforce GTX 580 GPUs, letting him work faster.\nIt was one of a number of key developments that led to the deep learning revolution. Now, nearly a decade later, Catanzaro figures he has access to roughly a million times more power thanks to Selene.\n\u201cI would say our team is being really well supported by NVIDIA right now, we can do world-class, state-of-the-art things on Selene,\u201d Catanzaro says. \u201cAnd we still want more.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why \u2014 while NVIDIANs have set up Microsoft Outlook to respond with an away message as they take the week off \u2014 Selene will be busier than ever.\nClick, here, to learn more about SuperPOD for enterprises.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*2,795 petaflops FP16/BF16 with structural sparsity enabled.\n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | SupercomputingTags: NVIDIA A100 | NVIDIA DGX | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In the past year, much of the growth has come from interest in AI.\nWith demand for machine learning on the rise, HLRS signed a deal to add 192 NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs linked on NVIDIA Mellanox InfiniBand network to its Hawk supercomputer based on an Apollo system from Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\nHawk Flies to New Heights\nThe GPUs will propel what\u2019s already ranked as the world\u2019s 16th largest system to new heights. In preparation for the expansion, researchers are gearing up AI projects that range from predicting the path of the COVID-19 pandemic to the science behind building better cars and planes.\n\u201cHumans can create huge simulations, but we can\u2019t always understand all the data \u2014 the big advantage of AI is it can work through the data and see its consequences,\u201d said Resch, who also serves as a professor at the University of Stuttgart with a background in engineering, computer science and math.\nThe center made its first big leap into AI last year when it installed a Cray CS-Storm system with more than 60 NVIDIA GPUs. It is already running AI programs that analyze market data for Mercedes-Benz, investment portfolios for a large German bank and a music database for a local broadcaster.\n\u201cIt turned out to be an extremely popular system because there\u2019s a growing community of people who understand AI has a benefit for them,\u201d Resch said of the system now running at near capacity. \u201cBy the middle of this year it was clear we had to expand to cover our growing AI requirements,\u201d he added.\nThe New Math: HPC+AI\nThe future for the Stuttgart center, and the HPC community generally, is about hybrid computing where CPUs and GPUs work together, often to advance HPC simulations with AI.\n\u201cCombining the two is a golden bullet that propels us into a better future for understanding problems,\u201d he said.\nFor example, one researcher at the University of Stuttgart will use data from as many as 2 billion simulations to train neural networks that can quickly and economically evaluate metal alloys. The AI model it spawns could run on a PC and help companies producing sheet metal choose the best alloys for, say, a car door.\n\u201cThis is extremely helpful in situations where experimentation is difficult or costly,\u201d he said.\nAnd it\u2019s an apropos app for the center situated in the same city that\u2019s home to the headquarters of both Mercedes and Porsche.\nIn the Flow with Machine Learning\nA separate project in fluid dynamics will take a similar approach.\nA group from the university will train neural networks on data from highly accurate simulations to create an AI model that can improve analysis of turbulence. It\u2019s a critical topic for companies such as Airbus that are collaborating with HLRS on efforts to mine the aerospace giant\u2019s data on airflow.\nThe Stuttgart center also aims to use AI as part of a European research project to predict when hospital beds could fill up in intensive-care units amid the pandemic. The project started before the coronavirus hit, but it accelerated in the wake of COVID-19.\nTracking the Pandemic with AI\nOne of the project\u2019s goals is to give policy makers a four-week window to respond before hospitals would reach their capacity.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a critical question with so many people dying \u2014 we\u2019ve seen scenarios in places like Italy, New York and Wuhan where ICUs filled up in the first weeks of pandemic,\u201d Resch said.\n\u201cSo, we will conduct simulations and predictions of the outlook for the pandemic over the next weeks and months, and GPUs will be extremely helpful for that,\u201d he added.\nIt\u2019s perhaps the highest profile of many apps now in the pipeline for the GPU-enhanced engine that will propel Stuttgart\u2019s researchers further down the road on their journey into AI.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Networking | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | COVID-19 | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | NVIDIA in Europe | Science | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Now, ray tracing and DLSS are available to all, having become part of the official Minecraft Windows 10 client! To celebrate, we are releasing 2 new worlds, bringing the total number of official RTX worlds for Minecraft to 15.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo experience incredible sights, accelerated by NVIDIA DLSS, simply download and install the latest version of Minecraft for Windows 10 from the Microsoft Store, head to the Minecraft Marketplace, download a free showcase world and load into it.\nYou can play all ray tracing worlds and maps on Realms and servers with other gamers using cross-platform Minecraft Bedrock game clients (e.g. Minecraft on Nintendo Switch), and everyone can collaborate, build and explore together. Minecraft with RTX players will by default see everything enhanced with a special Physically Based Rendering texture pack, which interplays with the ray-traced effects to further enhance your experience. Players on other platforms will see Minecraft\u2019s standard visuals.\nUsing the power of ray tracing and Physically Based Rendering, you can build incredible scenes with lighting, shadows and effects running at previously-unseen levels of detail and accuracy, helping you craft wondrous worlds that'll make jaws drop.\nTo demonstrate the possibilities of Minecraft\u2019s ray tracing, we\u2019ve collaborated with creators to craft free ray-traced worlds, each with their own unique textures, designs and gameplay mechanics.\nYou can download these from the Minecraft Marketplace in-game. For further details check out our previous articles, here, here, and here.

This incredible level of fidelity makes greater demands on your GPU, however, so NVIDIA has worked with Microsoft and Mojang to add our critically acclaimed NVIDIA DLSS technology for GeForce RTX gamers (other gamers can use Microsoft\u2019s upscaling technology). You can find this option in the Video settings, labeled as Upscaling.\nWith DLSS, we utilize deep learning, AI and the Tensor Cores found exclusively on GeForce RTX GPUs to accelerate performance in Minecraft with RTX by more than double, giving every GeForce RTX player at least 60 FPS at 1920x1080, with unprecedented image quality. And at higher detail levels, GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3090 players can marvel at ray-traced Minecraft at 4K at well over 60FPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS is now available in 30 games, with many more integrations in progress for blockbusters and indie titles alike.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlready Playing The Beta? Follow These Steps\nIf you\u2019ve been playing and testing the Minecraft with RTX for Windows 10 beta, thank you! Your participation has helped find bugs, optimize performance, and introduce new features that have made the experience even more enjoyable. To get back onto the mainline branch of Minecraft, you\u2019ll need to follow a few steps:\n\nBack up your existing worlds, saves and profiles, just in case\nOpen the Xbox Insider Hub application\nNavigate to Insider Content and click on Minecraft\nClick Manage, select \u201cUnenroll\u201d, and then Done\nWait a few minutes, then check for Minecraft updates in the Windows Store app\nIf you haven\u2019t been updated, uninstall Minecraft completely, and install a fresh copy from the Windows Store\nAnd if you\u2019re still having issues, uninstall Minecraft, log out from the Insider Hub, Xbox Companion App, and Windows Store. Restart your PC, then log back into the Windows Store and download Minecraft anew\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConvert Java Worlds To RTX, and Make Your Own PBR Textures\nNow that ray tracing\u2019s out of beta, anyone can begin and craft a ray-traced world. But if you want to make unique PBR textures, you\u2019ll need to learn new tools and workflows. But rather than let you stumble through the dark depths alone, we\u2019ve written an extensive step-by-step guide, now updated for the official release of Minecraft with RTX.\nAdditionally, we\u2019ve detailed how you can bring a Java world over to Minecraft with RTX, enabling it to be enhanced with ray tracing and PBR textures. Check out guide here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWin a GeForce RTX 3080 or RTX 3070!\nWe want to see your unique Minecraft creations with RTX ON! Create a RT-enabled PBR texture pack, build an amazing map, a work of art, or anything you can think of, and post a screenshot or video of it on social media with #Minecraft and #RTXON and you could win a GeForce RTX 3080 or RTX 3070! We\u2019ll be showcasing the best builds on GeForce social channels and GeForce.com. See the full terms and conditions here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo Forth and Craft!\nThe official release of ray tracing and DLSS for Minecraft is the culmination of thousands of hours of work from dozens of engineers at Mojang, Microsoft and NVIDIA. We\u2019re beyond excited to bring ray tracing in the world\u2019s most popular game to millions of GeForce RTX gamers, and cannot wait to see players\u2019 creations.\nBe sure to share your best Minecraft moments, Realms, worlds and projects with us on social media using #Minecraft and #RTXON.\nIf you have any questions about the new update, head on over to the Mojang Studios FAQ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

With a system of positive reinforcement, a pet pooch will in time anticipate that chasing squirrels is less likely to be rewarded than staying by their human\u2019s side.\nDeep reinforcement learning, a technique used to train AI models for robotics and complex strategy problems, works off the same principle.\nIn reinforcement learning, a software agent interacts with a real or virtual environment, relying on feedback from rewards to learn the best way to achieve its goal. Like the brain of a puppy in training, a reinforcement learning model uses information it\u2019s observed about the environment and its rewards, and determines which action the agent should take next.\nTo date, most researchers have relied on a combination of CPUs and GPUs to run reinforcement learning models. This means different parts of the computer tackle different steps of the process \u2014 including simulating the environment, calculating rewards, choosing what action to take next, actually taking action, and then learning from the experience.\nBut switching back and forth between CPU cores and powerful GPUs is by nature inefficient, requiring data to be transferred from one part of the system\u2019s memory to another at multiple points during the reinforcement learning training process. It\u2019s like a student who has to carry a tall stack of books and notes from classroom to classroom, plus the library, before grasping a new concept.\nWith Isaac Gym, NVIDIA developers have made it possible to instead run the entire reinforcement learning pipeline on GPUs \u2014 enabling significant speedups and reducing the hardware resources needed to develop these models.\nHere\u2019s what this breakthrough means for the deep reinforcement learning process, and how much acceleration it can bring developers.\nReinforcement Learning on GPUs: Simulation to Action\u00a0\nWhen training a reinforcement learning model for a robotics task \u2014 like a humanoid robot that walks up and down stairs \u2014 it\u2019s much faster, safer and easier to use a simulated environment than the physical world. In a simulation, developers can create a sea of virtual robots that can quickly rack up thousands of hours of experience at a task.\nIf tested solely in the real world, a robot in training could fall down, bump into or mishandle objects \u2014 causing potential damage to its own machinery, the object it\u2019s interacting with or its surroundings. Testing in simulation provides the reinforcement learning model a space to practice and work out the kinks, giving it a head start when shifting to the real world.\nIn a typical system today, the NVIDIA PhysX simulation engine runs this experience-gathering phase of the reinforcement learning process on NVIDIA GPUs. But for other steps of the training application, developers have traditionally still used CPUs.\nTraditional deep reinforcement learning uses a combination of CPU and GPU computing resources, requiring significant data transfers back and forth.\nA key part of reinforcement learning training is conducting what\u2019s known as the forward pass: First, the system simulates the environment, records a set of observations about the state of the world and calculates a reward for how well the agent did.\nThe recorded observations become the input to a deep learning \u201cpolicy\u201d network, which chooses an action for the agent to take. Both the observations and the rewards are stored for use later in the training cycle.\nFinally, the action is sent back to the simulator so that the rest of the environment can be updated in response.\nAfter several rounds of these forward passes, the reinforcement learning model takes a look back, evaluating whether the actions it chose were effective or not. This information is used to update the policy network, and the cycle begins again with the improved model.\nGPU Acceleration with Isaac Gym\u00a0\nTo eliminate the overhead of transferring data back and forth from CPU to GPU during this reinforcement learning training cycle, NVIDIA researchers have developed an approach to run every step of the process on GPUs. This is Isaac Gym, an end-to-end training environment, which includes the PhysX simulation engine and a PyTorch tensor-based API.\nIsaac Gym makes it possible for a developer to run tens of thousands of environments simultaneously on a single GPU. That means experiments that previously required a data center with thousands of CPU cores can in some cases be trained on a single workstation.\nNVIDIA Isaac Gym runs entire reinforcement learning pipelines on GPUs, enabling significant speedups.\nDecreasing the amount of hardware required makes reinforcement learning more accessible to individual researchers who don\u2019t have access to large data center resources. It can also make the process a lot faster.\nA simple reinforcement learning model tasked with getting a humanoid robot to walk can be trained in just a few minutes with Isaac Gym. But the impact of end-to-end GPU acceleration is most useful for more challenging tasks, like teaching a complex robot hand to manipulate a cube into a specific position.\n\nThis problem requires significant dexterity by the robot, and a simulation environment that involves domain randomization, a mechanism that allows the learned policy to more easily transfer to a real-world robot.\nResearch by OpenAI tackled this task with a cluster of more than 6,000 CPU cores plus multiple NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs \u2014 and required about 30 hours of training for the reinforcement learning model to succeed at the task 20 times in a row using a feed-forward network model.\nUsing just one NVIDIA A100 GPU with Isaac Gym, NVIDIA developers were able to achieve the same level of success in around 10 hours \u2014 a single GPU outperforming an entire cluster by a factor of 3x.\nTo learn more about Isaac Gym, visit our developer news center.\nVideo above shows a cube manipulation task trained by Isaac Gym on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU and rendered in NVIDIA Omniverse.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Explainer | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It has been reported in the Korean news media (via WCCFTech) that Jen-Hsun and Co. has just signed a second contract with Samsung to produce GPUs \"worth hundreds of billions of won.\"For reference, one hundred billion won is about ninety million dollars, so we're not talking about a drop in the silicon ocean either.Nvidia initially contracted Samsung to produce its RTX 30-series cards, and has so far unleashed the 8nm-based GPUs in Nvidia RTX 3080, RTX 3090, RTX 3070, and RTX 3060 Ti trim. The question now is: what is this second contract being put in place for? There has been speculation that it might herald Samsung's involvement in a potential Super series of cards, but that feels a bit premature.It is possible, however, that with more mainstream GPUs, and the tantalising prospect of a 20GB RTX 3080 Ti on the horizon, those could be the chips Nvidia is paying for with this latest contract. You could also argue that it might also now be going public with tasking Samsung to create the GPUs for its upcoming mobile cards, set to launch early 2021.We are expecting virtual CES to be virtually awash with virtual demonstrations of RTX 30-series gaming laptops after all.But I would be very surprised if those mobile and mainstream GPUs weren't part of the original deal between Nvidia and Samsung from earlier in the year. I guess it's possible Nvidia was trialling Samsung with the first batch of chips, and there were recent reports suggesting it was considering switching to TSMC for the rest of its lineup. But if Nvidia wasn't sure of using Samsung's 8nm node it would be odd to test its fabs with the most important GPUs in a couple of generations.Screen queens(Image credit: Future)Best gaming monitor: pixel-perfect panels for your PC\nBest 4K monitor for gaming: when only high-res will do\nBest 4K TV for gaming: big-screen 4K PC gamingGiven the fact there aren't enough RTX 30-series cards out in the wild to satisfy the unprecedented demand which currently exists for them, it would make sense for Nvidia to try and bolster that supply. Grabbing a whole lot more manufacturing capacity from its GPU foundry, Samsung, would therefore be a real smart move.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.However much it has to pay to up the number of GPUs it can get out to customers, it knows there is the appetite out there for pretty much everything it can ship. Whatever Nvidia's paying Samsung it surely knows it can recoup that multiple times over just from the number of people desperate for cards right now.And this is where Nvidia's pick of foundry partner could pay dividends.\u00a0Given the strain on TSMC's 7nm production capacity, with all of AMD's CPUs and GPUs, as well as a host of other customers' products built in its Taiwan fabs, going back to ask for more could be nigh-on impossible. But if Nvidia can simply throw more money at Samsung for more Ampere GPUs it's going to be in a far better position than AMD is with its Big Navi supply.And will therefore make it more likely that when the time comes for you to want a new graphics card you will have far more choice over an Nvidia GPU than an AMD one.\u00a0Still, whatever this latest deal is for, we're not going to see the benefits anytime soon. The trickle-feed of GPUs into retail therefore continues...\n\n\nDave JamesSocial Links NavigationEditor-in-Chief, HardwareDave has been gaming since the days of Zaxxon and Lady Bug on the Colecovision, and code books for the Commodore Vic 20 (Death Race 2000!).

Aiming to solidify dominance in the premium end of the market, the green team has gone for aggressive recommended pricing in light of rival AMD's RX 6800 Series. Purported cost is relatively academic as all high-end cards sell out as soon as meagre levels of stock lands.\r\nNevertheless, the next piece in the Ampere jigsaw is the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, aiming to entice more users to upgrade from older cards. Priced from $399 (\u00a3369), Nvidia adopts a familiar tack in developing this card.

Though occupying the fourth rung of the Ampere ladder, GA104 GPU is still a beast, comprising over 17 billion transistors. Putting that into context, 2017's champion card, GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, harnesses only 12bn transistors, albeit on a larger, less efficient 16nm process. Point is, don't let RTX 3060 Ti's positioning fool you into thinking this is strictly a mid-range solution. It is not.\nCleaving away parts of the RTX 3070 design to achieve a desired price-to-performance ratio is a balancing act. Nvidia opts to lose top-end muscle whilst keeping memory bandwidth the same. Specifically, speaking of GA104 implementations, RTX 3060 Ti drops from 46 SMs to 38. That move has instant ramifications for total shaders, RT Cores and Tensor Cores, which all drop by that 17.4 per cent. Nvidia also reins in frequencies a touch, leading to around 20 per cent less shading potential. This approach is normal when slicing up a GPU for a lower-specced card.\nNvidia, however, keeps the 8GB of GDDR6 memory humming along at 14Gbps, so back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest RTX 3060 Ti will benchmark at between 85-90 per cent of RTX 3070. A fair compromise for the $100 snip. Running at lower clocks and having to keep fewer shaders and cores busy enables Team GeForce to reduce board power to 200W. It is reasonable to think RTX 3060 Ti is built from dies that don't make the requisite 3070 grade.\nIt's becoming increasingly difficult to compare performance between generations as GPU architects focus on boosting performance in ways that are not immediately obvious on the spec sheet. Looking back at RTX 20 Series, Nvidia alludes to this card performing along the same lines as the RTX 2080 Super, which, remember, was introduced at a $699 price point last year in Founders Edition form. In effect, Nvidia is asking $300 less for  similar framerate, at less power. Ordinarily such a move would be met with glee, but things have moved on in the graphics space this year.\nThe introduction of this GPU puts rival AMD into a tight spot for now. Its Big Navi cards don't yet scale down to the $399 (\u00a3369) price point, so the fiscal competition is actually from last year's RX 5700 Series. AMD's not duly worried as even those older cards are selling out like hotcakes, according to our sources. The state of the world, eh?\nA little brother to RTX 3070 opens up Ampere to a few more punters lucky enough to pick up a card this week. Looking like a great solution at QHD and passable at UHD, with class-leading ray tracing and framerate-boosting DLSS technology in tow, you're going to want to see benchmarks before ripping the credit card from the wallet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage Jump:\n ========== \n1 - Introduction\n2 - The Founders Edition\n3 - Test Methodology\n4 - 3DMark Time Spy\n5 - Borderlands 3\n6 - Civilization VI: Gathering Storm\n7 - Far Cry New Dawn\n8 - Forza Horizon 4\n9 - Gears 5\n10 - Shadow of the Tomb Raider\n11 - Relative Performance, Bang4Buck, Bang4Watt\n12 - Ray Tracing\n13 - GPGPU\n14 - Power, Temperature and Noise\n15 - Overclocking\n16 - Conclusion\n\n\n\nNEXT PAGE  \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMY HEXUS\n\n\nSign in for the best HEXUS experience\nLOG IN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALL EVENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINDUSTRY PRESS RELEASES\n\n\n\n1\nIntroducing CORSAIR\u00ae DDR5 Memory\n\n\n\n2\nCORSAIR Announces Full Range of Components\n\n\n\n3\nTwo AOC GAMING mice and a wireless headset.\n\n\n\n4\nAGON by AOC presents three displays aimed at competitive gamers \n\n\n\n5\nPhilips monitors launch the new M3000 and M5000 PC gaming monitor series\n\n\n\n6\nASUSTOR is authorized by the CVE Program as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINFORMATION\n\nAbout us \nAdvertise \nContact us \nHow Competitions work \nHow we test \nAbout Cookies \nWhat our awards mean \nTerms of use\nPrivacy\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\n\nRSS / Alerts / Twitter \nFacebook / Newsletter \nUnsubscribe \n\n\n\nHEXUS Community\n\n\nMembers: 4\nForum posts: 353,396\nForum threads: 39,617\nCurrently active users: 99\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Copyright \u00a9 1998 - 2025, HEXUS.net.

The company hasn't revealed what will be on show, but you can expect new Ampere cards to be announced, with the RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3060 the most likely candidates. \nThe broadcast lands during the online-only Consumer Electronics Show (CES), which runs from Monday, January 11, and Thursday, January 14. Jeff Fisher, senior vice president of Nvidia's GeForce business, will present the event. He was also on stage last year to unveil the RTX 2060 and Max-Q laptops.\nIt's rumored that the successor to that RTX 2060---the non-Ti version of the RTX 3060---will be revealed next month. All rumors point to two versions of the card: one with 12GB and one with 6GB. The latter is thought to have started life as the RTX 3050 Ti before being rebranded by Nvidia.\nA potentially more exciting announcement could be the RTX 3080 Ti. Recent leaks claim that Nvidia had been planning to launch the card in January but decided to delay the release until February, partly due to Big Navi not being as threatening as it expected.\nThe RTX 3080 Ti is thought to feature 20GB of GDDR6X, double that of the vanilla RTX 3080. It could cost $999, putting it in direct competition with the Radeon RX 6900 XT, which packs 16GB of GDDR6. Nvidia's offering also has a 320-bit memory bus, 760 GBps memory bandwidth, 9,984 CUDA cores (78 streaming multiprocessors), and a 320W TDP, according to reports.\n\nIn addition to announcing the GeForce RTX: Game On broadcast, the company revealed four new multiplayer games now support its latency-lowering Nvidia Reflex. CRSED: F.O.A.D. (formerly Cuisine Royale), Enlisted, Mordhau, and Warface are joining the likes of Fortnite, Valorant, and Call of Duty Modern Warfare in offering the feature.

The listing was spotted by TUM_APISAK and shows the next-gen RTX 30 series mobility GPU running in the OpenCL test suite.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Mobility GPU To Feature GA104 GPU With 5120 Cores, 8 GB Memory & 1300 MHz Clock in Max-Q Variant, On Par With An RTX 2080 SUPER\nJust a few days ago, we got to see the first listings for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series mobility lineup along with some preliminary specifications. It seems like those specifications might end up being true since they match the ones from today's leak. Also, based on the clock speeds alone, we can tell that this is the Max-Q variant of the GeForce RTX 3070 instead of the Max-P variant which would offer much higher clock speeds.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nSo coming to the specifications, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Mobility will feature 40 SMs on the GA104 GPU SKU (presumably, the GA104-770). This chip would feature a total of 5120 cores and a maximum clock speed of up to 1300 MHz (~1290 MHz). The graphics card also features 8 GB VRAM which runs across a 256-bit wide bus interface but it remains to be seen if NVIDIA is utilizing 12 or 14 Gbps DRAM modules for its mobility lineup. In the case of 14 Gbps, the GPU will be able to offer a maximum bandwidth of 448 GB/s.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Mobility GPU Lineup:\n\n\n\nGPU NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 ANVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti\n\n\n\n\nProcess NodeSamsung 8nmTSMC 4NTSMC 4NSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nGPU SKUGA107GA107AD106GA107GA106GA104GA104GA104GA103\n\n\nSMs161614203040464858\n\n\nCUDA Cores204820481792256038405120588861447424\n\n\nBase Clock1057 MHz1042 MHzTBD1035 MHz1283 MHz1290 MHz1035 MHz1245 MHz1125 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock1740 MHz1470 MHzTBD1695 MHz1703 MHz1620 MHz1485 MHz1710 MHz1590 MHz\n\n\nMemory Clock12 Gbps14 GbpsTBD12 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps16 Gbps\n\n\nMemory TypeGDDR6GDDR6GDDR6GDDR6GDDR6GDDR6GDDR6GDDR6GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Size4 GB6 GB4 GB4 GB6 GB8 GB8 GB8/16 GB16 GB\n\n\nMemory Bus128-bit96-bit64-bit128-bit192-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit\n\n\nBandwidth192 GB/s168 GB/sTBD192 GB/s336 GB/s448 GB/s448 GB/s448 GB/s512 GB/s\n\n\nTGP35-95W35-95W35-50W35-95W60-115W80-125W80 - 125W80-150W+175W\n\n\nConfigurationsMax-Q\nMax-PMax-Q\nMax-PTBDMax-Q\nMax-PMax-Q\nMax-PMax-Q\nMax-PMax-Q\nMax-PMax-Q\nMax-PMax-Q\nMax-P\n\n\nLaunchQ2 2021Q1 20242024?Q2 2021Q1 2021Q1 2021Q1 2022Q1 2021Q1 2022\n\n\n\n\nPreliminary specifications coming in from NotebookCheck also seem to indicate that the Max-Q variant will feature a TGP between 80-90W while the faster Max-P variant will feature a TGP of 115-150W. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Mobility was tested on an HP Omen 15 laptop which also had the Intel Core i7-10870H and 16 GB of DDR4 memory installed.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Mobility GPU Performance\n\nOpenCL GPU\n\n\n022153443066645988612110765132918\n\n\n\n\n\n022153443066645988612110765132918\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3070 (Desktop)\n\n132.9k\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti (Desktop)\n\n119.3k\n\n\nGeForce RTX 2080 SUPER (Desktop)\n\n113.1k\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3070 Max-Q (Laptop)\n\n110.8k\n\n\nGeForce RTX 2080 (Desktop)\n\n106k\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of performance, the GPU scored 110839 points in the OpenCL test. The score puts the GeForce RTX 3070 mobility on par with the GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER but at the same time, it is slower than the desktop GeForce RTX 3070 by 17% which should be expected since the variant does not only offer lower cores but also comes with much lower clocks being a Max-Q design. It looks like the Max-P variant should close the gap and bring the performance difference below 10 percent but that remains to be seen.\nLaptop makers will also be offering high-end and enthusiast configurations of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Ampere GPUs with AMD's Ryzen 5000H 'Cezanne-H' CPUs and Intel's Tiger Lake-H 11th Gen CPU lineup at CES 2021.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPiper Sandler Sees 10x Increase In NVIDIA\u2019s GPU Capacity And A 35x Decrease In Model Inference Costs As Seeds For The Upcoming \u201cAI Wave 2\u201d\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 & RTX 5060 Ti Specs Leaked: 5060 Ti Gets 4608 Cores & Up To 16 GB G7, 5050 Gets 2560 Cores & 8 GB G6, Both at 128-bit\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n132\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n98\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nM3 Ultra Runs DeepSeek R1 With 671 Billion Parameters Using 448GB Of Unified Memory, Delivering High Bandwidth Performance At Under 200W Power Consumption, With No Need For A Multi-GPU Setup\n\n\n\n42\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Board Partners Silently Increase Prices Of Radeon RX 9070 Series; Base Models Priced At Up To $130 Higher\n\n\n\n41\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGalaxy S26 Ultra Rumored To Arrive With A Camera Feature That Samsung First Introduced When It Unveiled The Galaxy S9 And Galaxy S9 Plus\n\n\n\n28\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\n12V-2\u00d76 Power Connector Cooks At Over 150\u00b0C With A \u201cWater-Cooled\u201d NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090\n\n\n\n2317\nComments\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1526\nComments\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Releases Another Hotfix Driver to Resolve Black Screen Issues, Marking the Firm\u2019s Fifth Attempt to Address The Problem\n\n\n\n1300\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1140\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

It was just a bizarre joke. \nVideo game news for the last few months of 2020 has been dominated by one word: shortages. Whether it be a PS5, Xbox Series X, or even a Nintendo Switch in some parts of the world, certain items have been incredibly hard to come by. Nvidia's new 3070, 3080, and 3090 graphics cards can also be included in 2020's shortages category.\nAs has been the case with consoles old and new this year, Nvidia's new products have been almost impossible to find. If you weren't magically first in the queue on release day, recruited the assistance of a bot, or paid through the nose on a resale site, chances are you don't have one right now. News that 40 boxes of them were stolen from a warehouse in China only angered those without one even more.\nRELATED:\u00a0Henry Cavill Quietly Upgraded His PC Build With An RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvia Shacknews\n\n\n\nWhat's curious is the lack of acknowledgment from Nvidia over why there is a severe lack of stock of the RTX cards when it comes to meeting demand. The company line was that it would be complicated to have more stock ready in time for Christmas, which has now been and gone.\u00a0What appeared to be a new development explained away that silence, but turned out to be a very weird joke.\nSpanish site Geeknetic reported that a South Korean port employee had stumbled upon an unaccounted for shipping container. Inside that container were 500,000 RTX 3000 graphics cards, lost in transit thanks to improper documentation. Except, in reality, none of that ever happened. The article was written as a joke to celebrate Holy Innocents Day, something the site didn't reveal until the day was over, updating the article accordingly.\nFalse or joke news articles are nothing new. However, it's usually pretty clear when an article is having a little fun by making up a story from scratch. The story will be too over the top to be real or published by a site in the business of doing that sort of work. In this instance, neither of those things are the case. It also means that anyone waiting for a new Nvidia graphics card hasn't been blessed by a Christmas miracle.\nNEXT:\u00a0The Term \"Gamer\" Dates Back To 1450 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame News\n\n\n\n\nIndustry\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSteam Gets Second Game In As Many Months That Adds Malware To Your PC\n\t\t\n\n\nSteam\n\nBe careful out there, gamers.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tKingdom Come: Deliverance Writer Comes Under Fire For \"Unprofessional\" Post About Dragon Age: The Veilguard\n\t\t\n\n\nKingdom Come: Deliverance\n\nKingdom Come: Deliverance writer Daniel V\u00e1vra seemingly mocks Dragon Age: The Veilguard in a tweet that is being labelled \"unprofessional\". \n\n\nPosts\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 8, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMarvel Rivals Dev NetEase Is Being Sued For $900 Million\n\t\t\n\n\nIndustry\n\nJeff and Annie Strain are suing NetEase Games for $900 million due to alleged defamation and unfair trade practices.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 day ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tEvery Steam Sale Makes Me More Depressed\n\t\t\n\n\nSteam\n\nThe Steam Summer Sale is on, and it's warping my perception of value. \n\n\nPosts\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJun 30, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSony Is Reportedly Gradually Stopping Production Of Blu-Ray Discs\n\t\t\n\n\nSony\n\nPlease go away physical media. \n\n\nPosts\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJun 30, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tXbox Fans Are Not Happy With The 2TB Series X Price\n\t\t\n\n\nXbox Series X\n\nThat's a whole lot of dollars.\n\n\nPosts\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIs The MCU Going To Cause The Rise Of AI In Films?\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPokemon's Paw Pod Collection Includes A Reasonably Priced Life Size Pawmi Plush\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSwen Vincke Says Single-Player Games Aren't \"Dead\", They Just \"Have To Be Good\"\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin Our Team\nOur Audience\nAbout Us\nPress & Events\nContact Us\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertising\nCareers\nTerms\nPrivacy\nPolicies\n\n\nTheGamer is part of the\n                            Valnet Publishing Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Copyright \u00a9 2025 Valnet Inc.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It uses the AnvilNext 2.0 engine which boosts the draw distance range and delivers a very impressive graphics display.\nWe tested the game at maxed settings with TAA enabled and 16x AF.

In particular, prospective Nvidia RTX 30-Series buyers are all in a muddle\u2014and that's putting it lightly. Even Nvidia is frustrated at the lack of stock, which doesn't bode well at all. Thankfully, there are still some valiant knights out there who, rather than designing reseller bots to screw us all over, have been designing useful tools for us poor GPU-less souls.One such honourable developer, Jef LeCompte, has designed a bot that periodically scours online retailers for 30-series stock, and lets viewers know over the Falcodrin twitch stream when the cards become available.Although it looks to be US and Canada specific, it does sound a helpful alarm when any RTX 30-series cards come in stock across those regions. What's more, it also lets viewers know (visually) when retailers are attempting to extort you out of house and home, with prices in excess of the set $1,900 limit. It also comes with a host of handy best practice guides for attempting to secure an RTX 3080, RTX 3090, RTX 3070, or RTX 3060 Ti in your shopping basket.Your next machine(Image credit: Future)Best gaming PC: the top pre-built machines from the pros\nBest gaming laptop: perfect notebooks for mobile gamingI'd just like to say to you Jef: Thank you, good sir. It's nice to know that not all developers have turned to the dark side. You have done us all a great service\u2014even if we do still have to compete with several thousand of your stream viewers. Actually its a very cute stream chat, lots of helpful people on there giving tech support, and just general camaraderie ensuing. Really nice to see.Here's the link to the live stream directly, or you can join the party via the embed above. And, we have our own handy guide for how and where to buy an Nvidia RTX 3080, RTX 3070, or RTX 3090, in case you'd like some more useful info on the subject.\u00a0The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nTwitch\nNvidia\n\n\nKatie WickensSocial Links NavigationHardware WriterScrew sports, Katie would rather watch Intel, AMD and Nvidia go at it. Having been obsessed with computers and graphics for three long decades, she took Game Art and Design up to Masters level at uni, and has been rambling about games, tech and science\u2014rather sarcastically\u2014for four years since.

Today, we\u2019re looking at the RTX 3060 Ti, and priced at only $399, it\u2019s the most accessible 30-series GPU yet. If history is any indicator, it\u2019s poised to be the most popular card of the generation, but does its performance match its pedigree?Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition5 ImagesNvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti \u2013 Design and FeaturesApart from a minor change in color, the RTX 3060 Ti is identical to the RTX 3070. While the heat fins are still matte black, it now features a silver frame that lends it a visually distinct look that also manages to be quite handsome. Like its more expensive sibling, the RTX 3060 Ti is a compact card that should fit well in any case and really leans into the minimalist look that has typified this generation of Nvidia graphics cards.Like the RTX 3070, it features a modified version of the dual-axial cooler design found on the RTX 3080 and 3090. Instead of mounting fans on opposite sides, it places them on a single side in a much more traditional arrangement. The design is still all about quiet and efficient cooling, however, and its heatsink overlaps the PCB with ample room to exhaust heat from its rear vent. It works well, though not quite as well as the RTX 3080 and 3090, with a peak temperature of 75C and a slightly louder noise profile.Like the rest of the external design, the output capability is also identical. Altogether, it\u2019s able to support up to four displays, broken between three DisplayPort 1.4a outputs and a single HDMI 2.1. Total resolution tops out at 7680 x 4320, also known as 8K.Under the hood, the RTX 3060 Ti carries on the 30-series\u2019 track record of skyrocketing CUDA core counts. Compared to the RTX 2060 Super, the core count has more than doubled, going from 2176 to an impressive 4864 on the RTX 3060 Ti. As with all of this generation, however, this doesn\u2019t mean that you can expect double the performance from last generation. Instead, a portion of these cores are able to flexibly swap processing tasks, so the amount of uplift will vary depending on how the game is programmed.The clock speeds on the RTX 3060 Ti are close to last-gen, but there\u2019s more here than meets the eye. Nvidia quotes a Boost Clock speed of 1665 MHz, only 15 MHz higher than the RTX 2060 Super. Thanks to GPU Boost, however, my sample clocked itself all the way up to 1875 MHz while gaming. Since GPU Boost bases its speed boost on thermal and power headroom, your mileage will naturally vary, but my results were found in a common PC gaming setup: a closed case with a mesh front panel and tempered glass side, several fans drawing cool air in and a rear exhaust, plus a top mounted all-in-one CPU cooler.Nvidia also offers a new way to enhance performance further: Automatic Tuning. Like the OC Boost function in MSI Afterburner or EVGA\u2019s Precision X1, GeForce Experience now offers the ability to intelligently scan the RTX 3060 Ti to apply a custom (and most importantly, stable) overclock. Coming from my review of the AMD RX 6000-series, I appreciate more than ever that this functionality is available in a mainstream card instead of a flagship-only feature. In my testing, the results were conservative but still offered several extra FPS, which enhanced the RTX 3060 Ti\u2019s edge against the RTX 2080 Super.Compared to the RTX 3070 and 3080, the memory configuration here feels surprisingly generous. Despite being the more affordable card, the RTX 3060 Ti features the exact same configuration as the RTX 3070: 8GB of GDDR6 on a 256-bit bus. This brings the total bandwidth up to 448 GB/s. While that arrangement felt like just enough on the RTX 3070, it feels like a much better fit here where gamers aren\u2019t likely to be trying their hand at 4K gaming. AMD still has a major advantage with the 16GB of faster VRAM on its 6000-series, but this arrangement is perfectly sufficient, especially at its lower price point.All of this amounts to some big performance leaps from the RTX 20-series. Looked at in TFLOPS, the numbers don\u2019t lie:16.2 Shader TFLOPS (versus 7.2 on 2060 Super - 2.25x faster)31.6 RT TFLOPS (versus 21.7 on 2060 Super - 1.46x faster)129.6 Tensor TFLOPS (versus 57.4 on 2060 Super - 2.26x faster)47.8 Effective TFLOPS while ray tracing (versus 28.9 on 2060 Super - 1.65x faster)Even though it\u2019s tempting to extrapolate these improvements (especially against the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5), they don\u2019t compare well on multiple levels. Instead, using them as a metric of generation-over-generation improvement, we can see just how far Nvidia\u2019s RTX architecture has evolved. The company has repeatedly stated that Ampere is its biggest generational improvement yet and the RTX 3060 Ti joins each 30-series card before it and bears that claim out.The unique design of Nvidia\u2019s RTX cards and the company\u2019s massive investment in AI at large also offer it another game-changing performance advantage: DLSS. DLSS, or Deep Learning Super Sampling, is Nvidia\u2019s AI-based upscaling technology that allows games to render at a lower resolution and output at a higher one, 1440p to 4K for example. Unlike other upscaling solutions, however, DLSS does away with the usual blur of stretched pixels and manages to deliver a picture that is actually better than native 4K thanks to the deep training of Nvidia\u2019s in-house neural network.Even though this technology is only available in a limited (but growing) number of games, it\u2019s nothing short of a revolution for gaming performance. This is a feature so good, it should be in every game and there\u2019s simply no reason not to use it whenever it\u2019s available. It\u2019s also the gateway to high performance ray traced gaming on a mainstream gaming GPU like this one. If DLSS is available, the RTX 3060 Ti will let you turn everything to ultra, including RTX, and game at 1440p. That\u2019s incredibly impressive at this price.The RTX 3060 Ti also supports a number of other key features for gamers. Competitive gamers will adore RTX Reflex, which instantly reduces input latency in such a way that even I can notice a difference as a casual shooter fan. It\u2019s currently supported in major games like Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone with many others planned for the future. Likewise, RTX IO offers the promise for near instantaneous load times thanks to GPU-based decompression from the SSD. Unlike Reflex, Nvidia IO needs to be integrated by game developers, so support is still coming. With both current-gen consoles offering rapid load times, however, adoption seems like only a matter of time.Content creators can also take advantage of their own suite of features. Nvidia Broadcast is squarely targeted at streamers. AI-powered features like virtual background removal (without a green screen) and AI-noise removal allow content creators ao achieve enhanced audio-visual production at the click of a button. RTX Studio, on the other hand, allows for innovative importing of assets from supported games for custom machinimas, as well as enhanced rendering for larger content creation tasks.For receiving and enjoying content, the RTX 3060 Ti also supports AV1 decoding and HDMI 2.1 for up to 8K displays.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti \u2013 PerformanceTo assess graphics cards, I put each through a rigorous selection of synthetic tests and real world gaming benchmarks. It\u2019s important to examine both to see how each GPU compares against the next in a theoretical \u201cbest case\u201d scenario, as well as where it matters most: in games. Since both AMD and Nvidia offer hardware-level ray tracing, I run RT-capable cards through a selection of RT-specific tests.Test system: Z390 Asus ROG Maximus XI Extreme Motherboard, Intel Core i9-9900K CPU (stock), Corsair H115i PRO RGB 280mm AIO CPU Cooler, 32GB Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro DDR4-3200, 1TB Samsung EVO Plus NVMe SSD, Corsair HX1200 1200-watt power supply.Since the RTX 3060 Ti is positioned below the other RTX 30-series cards released so far, I limited 4K game testing and instead focused on a selection of 1440p and 1080p games. The 3060 Ti also has the distinction of being the first card this generation to really include 1080p as a performance target, I conducted additional 1080p testing with a wider selection of games. Due to publication time, I limited this expanded testing to just the RTX 3060 Ti and will add results from future cards also targeting this performance category.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Synthetic Benchmarks4 ImagesBeginning with synthetic rasterization benchmarks, the RTX 3060 Ti performs remarkably well. In its marketing materials, Nvidia compared it most directly with the RTX 2080 Super and it\u2019s easy to see why. In Unigine Heaven, it slid in just under the Super, but in 3DMark\u2019s Fire Strike Ultra test, it outperformed even the RTX 2080 Ti.Moving onto the ray tracing specific benchmarks, we see a split tale. In the Port Royal, 3DMark\u2019s first ray tracing test, the card slots expectedly at the bottom of Nvidia\u2019s product stack, but also underperforms AMD\u2019s RX 6800. This shifts slightly in 3DMark\u2019s non-animated ray tracing test, where the RTX 3060 Ti gains an edge over the RX 6800 and outperforms the RTX 2080 Super by 18%.Things really differentiate once DLSS comes into play in Surgical Scalpel\u2019s Boundary Benchmark. There, the RTX 3060 Ti nearly doubles even the RX 6800 XT and once more beats out the RTX 2080 Super.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Gaming Benchmarks5 ImagesLooking at the first round of gaming benchmarks, we can see Nvidia\u2019s claims borne out. At 1080p, the RTX 3060 Ti is indeed 2% faster than the RTX 2080 Super. At the same time, it comes in about 26% faster than the RTX 2060 Super at that resolution (our sample is factory overclocked, so it\u2019s likely closer to 30% when compared to the Founders Edition). It was 16% faster than the RX 5700 XT.At 1440p, the RTX 3060 Ti pulls farther ahead of the RTX 2060 Super, extending its lead to 32%. Again, it maintains a slight lead on the RTX 2080 Super too, this time of 1%. Against the 5700 XT, it bests it by a solid 22%. Interestingly, it comes in 14% slower than the RTX 3070 and 16% slower than the RX 6800. That is as it should be given that both of those cards are in a higher performance tier, but it also illustrates the rasterization edge the RX 6800 has over the RTX 3070.When we come to 4K, frame rates drop below 60 nearly across the board. With some modifications to settings, most could be pushed at or near this water mark, however. For comparisons at this resolution, the RTX 3060 Ti holds a 53% lead over the 2060 Super, 7% over the 2080 Super, and 36% over the 5700 XT. It\u2019s only 12% slower than the RTX 3070 here and 6% slower than the RX 6800.Taking a closer look at 1440p performance, we can see consistently high frame rates of 60 or more with the exception of Dirt 5 which did not support DLSS. The RTX 3060 Ti averaged 30% faster than the RTX 2060 Super and 1% faster than the 2080 Super. Its performance was also remarkably close to the RTX 3070 across these games with a cumulative average of only 5% fewer FPS. Since most ray traced games I tested also allowed for DLSS, the 3060 Ti also improved upon the AMD RX 6800 by 29%. With those games removed, however, the RX 6800 pulled expectedly far ahead with a 42% advantage.Finally, at 1080p the RTX 3060 Ti offers excellent frame rates nearly across the board. Compared to the RTX 2080 Super, frame rates were an average of 5% faster, only falling behind in Red Dead Redemption 2, Metro Exodus, at 1% and 3% fewer FPS, and Dirt 5 with 9% fewer FPS. Pitted against the RTX 2060 Super in this larger game selection, the average improvement remained the same at 26% faster overall. Note that two games did not support DLSS, Dirt 5 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider (DLSS is available from 1440p upward).Purchasing GuideThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti has an MSRP of $399 and will be available on 12/2.VerdictThe RTX 3060 Ti is an absolute winner for the mainstream gamer. If you can\u2019t afford an RTX 3070, this is the next best thing, topping even the RTX 2080 Super and blowing the doors off of 1440p, ray traced gaming. If you\u2019re looking for 4K, you\u2019re better off saving your pennies for a more powerful card, but for anything less, this is an absolute banger of a graphics card.

The addition of ray tracing support for NVIDIA's RTX graphics cards transforms the sandbox game\u2019s aesthetics into one that\u2019s, well, shinier. As we said in our hands-on post earlier this year, the realistic lighting, reflections and shadows the feature brings make Minecraft feel more immersive. Yes, the game is still as blocky as ever, but the in-game sunlight looks so real, for instance, and shadows and reflections could make you feel as if you\u2019re inside the virtual world.To be able to experience what ray tracing adds to the game, you\u2019ll need to run it on a PC with one of NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs that\u2019s capable of ray tracing. The improvements it brings will only be visible in worlds and maps that use a special physically based rendering texture pack, but you don\u2019t need to do anything to enable it \u2014 it\u2019s already switched on by default. Other players who don\u2019t have access to the feature will simply see those worlds in the game\u2019s standard visuals.In its announcement, NVIDIA says ray tracing makes greater demands on your GPU, so it uses its DLSS AI rendering technology to ensure Minecraft with RTX can keep running by at least 60 FPS at 1920x1080. More advanced GPU models (RTX 3080 and 3090) can run the game at 4K at over 60FPS.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementYou can download worlds you can enjoy with ray tracing on from the Marketplace or create your own with help from NVIDIA\u2019s starter pack, if you need it. Minecraft and NVIDIA are also releasing two new worlds for free: Colosseum RTX is already available, while Dungeon Dash RTX is coming soon.If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

From autonomous machines in industrial manufacturing to healthcare procedures in the fight against COVID-19, developers are using AI to advance productivity, reliability and safety across industries.\nThe Emerging Jobs Report 2020 from LinkedIn points out that AI, data science and robotics roles are proliferating across nearly every industry. AI specialist is the No. 1 job by annual hiring growth, at 74 percent, followed by robotics engineer with 40 percent annual growth.\nCompanies are realizing there aren\u2019t enough researchers, data scientists and engineers with the level of technical expertise needed to meet demand. Upskilling in AI and robotics is critical to success for organizations in IT, retail, logistics, higher education, consumer electronics and beyond.\nLearning to develop AI and deep-learning applications requires real-world skills only available through hands-on experience. That\u2019s why NVIDIA launched its free Jetson AI Certification program during last month\u2019s GPU Technology Conference.\nThe launch was timed with the release of the Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit, which, at only $59, makes sophisticated AI applications more possible for everyone. The self-paced courses comprise tutorials and video walkthroughs that cover everything from the fundamentals of training and inference to practical applications in autonomous robotics like object following and collision avoidance.\nTwo AI certification tracks are available as part of the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute for educators, students and engineers looking to reskill:\n\nJetson AI Specialist: This certification can be completed by anyone to demonstrate mastery of Jetson and AI concepts using a hands-on, project-based assessment.\nJetson AI Ambassador: This certification is for educators and leaders at robotics institutions and recognizes competency in teaching AI on Jetson using a project-based assessment including an interview with the NVIDIA team.\n\nKudos to the New Class of AI Specialists\u00a0\nThe first batch of Jetson AI Specialists from around the world were granted certification this month based on their demonstrated competency in AI skills, as well as functional and performance validation of their projects.\nBelow is some feedback the new specialists shared about their experience, including why they think certification is important, how they plan to use it in future, and advice for peers interested in learning and teaching AI.\nPaul DeCarlo, principal cloud advocate and manager for IoT Advocacy at Microsoft and adjunct professor at the University of Houston, USA, said: \u201cI would highly suggest this certification for anyone interested in working with applied AI, especially if you have the desire to share the learnings with others. Whether you are currently employed and seeking new skills to share with your team or an educator looking to outfit students with experience in a bleeding-edge field to prepare them for the jobs of tomorrow, the certification process will prepare you to demonstrate working AI solutions and challenge you to then exercise your newly gained capabilities to create AI projects of your own.\u201d\nGoran Vuksic, technical manager at Stratiteq, Sweden, said: \u201cMy advice is to learn what the Jetson Nano is capable of, be creative to start your own project, explore and have fun! The Jetson AI Fundamentals course is highly recommended as a great learning resource for anyone who is starting with Jetson or wants to extend their knowledge. I always try to achieve certification as it motivates me to learn specific things in detail and proves that I really understood the concepts.\u201d\u00a0\nNitin Rai, AI application developer at SmartCow, India, said: \u201cThe AI Fundamentals course is a very well summarized collection of videos, really helpful both for understanding the kind of problems that can be solved with the help of AI and how the NVIDIA ecosystem fits in place to do quick prototyping. This AI Specialist certification helps to affirm understanding about a range of concepts like how an AI pipeline works, how to optimize code to go from development to production, tight integration of multiple models and services to achieve greater results in less time, and a lot more.\u201d\nDohyeong Kim, student at Kyungpook National University, South Korea, said: \u201cThe course is especially useful to beginners familiarizing themselves with deep learning because most of the content consists of GUI rather than terminal. AI certification is important because even though you may have experience with Jetson, sometimes it alone is not enough when looking for jobs in specific fields.\u201d\u00a0\nSang Yuanyuan, teacher and maker at Beijing Middle School No. 109, China, said: \u201cThe course content is suitable for beginners in AI and the combination with the certification also promotes motivation. My advice to anyone learning AI is to share and collaborate with others, including the NVIDIA Jetson community, and compete with yourself!\u201d\nWei-Chih (Joe) Lin, project engineer at iCShop, Taiwan, said: \u201cCertification is a great way to turn learning into an earned achievement and designates the recipient as competent in the associated field of study especially if you want to share with potential employers, colleagues or the world at large. Since my job is to promote robotics and AI in educational institutions from primary school to college, this certificate will let more people discover my teaching methods: learn the basics from the fundamentals and develop understanding through theory and implementation; to allow the students to use their knowledge to improve their life or career.\u201d\u00a0\nMuhammad Uzair Khattak, research assistant at SIGMA and TUKL Deep-Learning Lab, SEECS, NUST, Pakistan, said: \u201cGaining certification enhances my technical profile and I can now deliver workshops and teach AI/DL technologies to my fellows with more confidence. The Jetson Nano 2GB is the perfect choice when it comes to tight budgets and the need for good computing resources and the active Jetson community projects page and technical support make it unique and easier to use.\u201d\u00a0\nKazuyuki Takahashi, AI software/robotics engineer at Forex Robotics Co., Ltd. Japan, said: \u201cThe Jetson AI Fundamentals course provided great content about image-related machine learning. AI technology has accelerated over the past year or two due to price reductions and speedups for AI edge devices such as the Jetson Nano and Nano 2GB. I highly recommend getting certified and encourage everyone to work together to create open source projects that improve the world using NVIDIA Jetson!\u201d\nAhmet Furkan Demir, student at Necmettin Erbakan University, Turkey, said: \u201cI find all of NVIDIA\u2019s courses useful and it makes me happy to do lab lessons with powerful GPUs. This is an important certification for me to receive from a technology leader like NVIDIA. I plan to use this certificate and continue to apply my AI knowledge in my career and business life.\u201d\u00a0\nMario Tovar, Ph.D. student at IER-UNAM, Mexico, said: \u201cI\u2019m passionate about sustainability, very interested in AI applications for intelligent energy management tasks and helping integrate renewable intermittent energy into smart grids. My advice for anyone interested in AI is to get certified because it is a hands-on opportunity to apply deep learning techniques to resolve day to day problems facing us globally.

The RTX 3060 Ti, 3070, 3080, and 3090 vary in price and graphical capabilities, with costs being determined by how improved visuals and performance becomes. Gamers who haven't recently bought a new\u00a0computer or GPU will surely see a big difference once they install one of these new cards, but choosing the right one goes well beyond the price tag. \nFrom\u00a0September to December of this year, Nvidia's new cards have become available for purchase. The RTX 3080 was the first to release on September 17 and\u00a0at $699, it is the second most powerful in the series. The 3090 followed a week later and with it being the most powerful, it comes in at $1,499, double the price of the 3080. Released in October for $499, The 3070 is the second most affordable card. Then there's the RTX 3060 Ti. This was the more recent graphics card to be released and costs just $399. Basically, the higher the series number, the higher the capabilities and the price.\nRelated:\u00a0RTX 3060 Ti Vs. 3090: Nvidia's Cheapest RTX 30 Card & BFGPU Compared\nAll of the RTX 30-Series cards feature ray tracing, deep-learning super-sampling (DLSS), and work with displays up to 7680 by 2340 pixels. Comparing the varied specs, the RTX 3090 leads in nearly every respect. It boasts 10,496 CUDA cores, 24GB of GDDR6X memory, and a 384-bit memory interface width. The 3080 features 8,704 CUDA cores, 10GB of GDDR6X memory, and a 320-bit memory interface width. The 3070 comes with 5,888 CUDA cores, 8GB of GDDR6 memory, and a 256-bit memory interface. Lastly, the 3060 Ti includes just 4,864 CUDA cores,\u00a08GB of GDDR6 memory, and a 256-bit memory interface. The one interesting stat, however, is the max clock speed as the 3070 happens to show the\u00a0highest (1.73 GHz) compared to the 3080 (1.71 GHz), 3090 (1.70 GHz), and the 3060 Ti (1.67 GHz). \n                        Ranking Nvidia's New RTX Graphics Cards\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most recommended card of the series is the RTX 3070. Its\u00a0main selling point\u00a0is the faster load times and yet it only costs a third of the price of the 3090, all while still having more CUDA cores than the RTX 2080 Ti - Nvidia's best card from the 2000 series. The second recommended card is the RTX 3090. While it costs a fortune, it has the capabilities to render the next generation of games beautifully. Third comes the RTX 3060 Ti, as gamers can still get a great boost in power for a smaller investment than a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. Last happens to be the 3080. While it's still a remarkable graphics card, it's neither the strongest, fastest, nor the most affordable in the series. Although if one's budget happens to stretch to\u00a0$699 or more, then it is worth considering.\nAmong the four RTX 3000 graphics cards, three of them have at least one advantage over the others. Whether a gamer wants the cheapest, fastest, or overall best GPU of the bunch, there should be enough details for a clear decision to be made. All four cards are great products that will provide PC games with\u00a0many improvements over previous generation GPUs. The best feature of the new RTX 30-Series is that Nvidia offers a choice\u00a0to suit any gamer looking to upgrade their PC gaming setup and experience.\nMore: iPhone & iPad: How To Stream Nvidia GeForce Now Games\nSource: Nvidia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDoctor Who Season 15 Images Reveal The Doctor & His New Companion Out Of Their Depth Against A Massive Robot\n\t\t\n\n\nDoctor Who\n\nThe Fifteenth Doctor and Belinda find themselves caught up in a futuristic operation in a pair of new images from one Doctor Who season 15 episode.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nNathan Graham-Lowery\n\n\n1 minute ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPredator: Badlands Sounds Awesome, But Now I'm Worried About Prey 2 After Hearing This Update\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nCathal Gunning\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tJurassic Park Fans Won't Want To Miss This Week's Free Game From Epic Game\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nYuliya Geikhman\n\n\n3 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAdolescence's Filming Locations & Drone Shot Explained\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nGreg MacArthur\n\n\n33 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThe Sex Lives Of College Girls Cancelled After Season 3 On Max, Show Will Attempt To Find A New Home\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nAdam Bentz\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tNetflix Is About to Lose The Legend of Korra, And Avatar: The Last Airbender May Be Next\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nZakaria Ali\n\n\n3 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMove Along, Demon Slayer!

Those include some staples: Arnold, KeyShot, Octane, Redshift, and V-Ray, with a little Blender on the side. Many have also been tested with RTX on and off, so read on and see how well each one of these eleven GPUs fare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs 2020 comes to a close, we can reflect on an interesting year for GPUs, even though the vast majority of the action came in the final four months of the year. When NVIDIA launched its Ampere generation in September, we saw incredible performance from the get-go, with clear advantages being seen over Turing.\nFollowing that launch article, we greeted both the RTX 3090 and RTX 3070 launches the same way \u2013 and then a number of updates happened, to Windows, some renderers we test with, and our test platform itself. We recently moved from our Intel Core X rig to an AMD Ryzen Threadripper one for workstation GPU testing \u2013 partly because the Core X machine is aging, and the thought of using a 32-core CPU for our heterogeneous testing has been pretty tempting. Not to mention, only AMD platforms currently offer PCIe 4.0 support. For those wondering why we didn\u2019t go with the 64-core Threadripper, it was so that we could keep clock speeds high for workloads that do not scale completely with high core count CPUs. \nSince our look at rendering performance with the RTX 3070 in October, the move to the new test rig happened, and thus all of the GPUs were retested. With this switch also came an upgrade to KeyShot (10), and Blender (2.91). On the topic of Blender, we\u2019re going to have a modest look at its performance here; if you want a much more in-depth look, check out our dedicated article.\n\nNote that this article exists to cater to those who use a Windows renderer exclusively developed around use on NVIDIA GPUs, as there are (unfortunately) many that lack support for Radeon. We currently believe that Arnold, KeyShot, and V-Ray won\u2019t support Radeon for quite some time (if at all), but we\u2019re hopeful to see Radeon-supported Octane and Redshift for Windows in the new year, as both currently offer betas for macOS.\nFor a refresher on NVIDIA\u2019s current lineup, reference the table below:\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s GeForce Gaming GPU Lineup\n\n\n\nCores\nBase MHz\nPeak FP32\nMemory\nBandwidth\nTDP\nSRP\n\n\nRTX 3090\n10,496\n1,400\n35.6 TFLOPS\n24GB 1\n936GB/s\n350W\n$1,499\n\n\nRTX 3080\n8,704\n1,440\n29.7 TFLOPS\n10GB 1\n760GB/s\n320W\n$699\n\n\nRTX 3070\n5,888\n1,500\n20.4 TFLOPS\n8GB 2\n512GB/s\n220W\n$499\n\n\nRTX 3060 Ti\n4,864\n1,670\n16.2 TFLOPS\n8GB 2\n448 GB/s\n200W\n$399\n\n\nTITAN RTX\n4,608\n1,770\n16.3 TFLOPS\n24GB 2\n672 GB/s\n280W\n$2,499\n\n\nRTX 2080 Ti\n4,352\n1,350\n13.4 TFLOPS\n11GB 2\n616 GB/s\n250W\n$1,199\n\n\nRTX 2080 S\n3,072\n1,650\n11.1 TFLOPS\n8GB 2\n496 GB/s\n250W\n$699\n\n\nRTX 2070 S\n2,560\n1,605\n9.1 TFLOPS\n8GB 2\n448 GB/s\n215W\n$499\n\n\nRTX 2060 S\n2,176\n1,470\n7.2 TFLOPS\n8GB 2\n448 GB/s\n175W\n$399\n\n\nRTX 2060\n1,920\n1,365\n6.4 TFLOPS\n6GB 2\n336 GB/s\n160W\n$299\n\n\nGTX 1660 Ti\n1,536\n1,500\n5.5 TFLOPS\n6GB 2\n288 GB/s\n120W\n$279\n\n\nGTX 1660 S\n1,408\n1,530\n5.0 TFLOPS\n6GB 2\n336 GB/s\n125W\n$229\n\n\nGTX 1660\n1,408\n1,530\n5 TFLOPS\n6GB 4\n192 GB/s\n120W\n$219\n\n\nGTX 1650 S\n1,280\n1,530\n4.4TFLOPS\n4GB 2\n192 GB/s\n100W\n$159\n\n\nGTX 1650\n896\n1,485\n3 TFLOPS\n4GB 4\n128 GB/s\n75W\n$149\n\n\nNotes\n1 GDDR6X; 2 GDDR6; 3 GDDR5X; 4 GDDR5; 5 HBM2\nGTX 1080 Ti = Pascal; GTX/RTX 2000 = Turing; RTX 3000 = Ampere\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s Turing architecture brought forth GeForce\u2019s first RT and Tensor cores, and while initial rollout of supported software took a little while to drop, we can honestly say the wait was worth it. It became clear from our first look at OptiX ray tracing acceleration in Blender that some jaw-dropping improvements could be made with it. The fact that the likes of Autodesk made OptiX default with its Arnold renderer is enough to tell you what vendors think of it.\nWhat we\u2019ve seen from previous articles, and most recently, our Blender 2.91 in-depth look, is that the biggest concern any creator will have with the latest crop of GPUs is the memory limitations. With its 10GB of memory, the RTX 3080 is what we\u2019d call the best go-to GPU if you can swing its price tag. While it grants only 2GB more than the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3070, that makes it a little more \u201cfuture-proof\u201d, if such a thing were to exist.\nWe\u2019ve seen certain occasions where it seemed the extra frame buffer helped the RTX 3080 pull even further ahead of the RTX 3070 than it would have if it too only had an 8GB frame buffer. It would have been great if the RTX 3080 was actually 12GB, but what can you do? The rumor mill claims that other higher density versions of NVIDIA\u2019s Ampere cards are coming, so we may have to revisit this performance look soon enough.\nHere\u2019s an overview of the workstation used in testing for this article:\n\n\n\n\nTechgage Workstation Test System\n\n\nProcessor\nAMD Ryzen Threadripper 3970X (32-core; 3.7GHz)\n\n\nMotherboard\nASUS Zenith II Extreme Alpha\n\n\nMemory\nCorsair Vengeance RGB Pro (CMW32GX4M4C3200C16)\n4x8GB; DDR4-3200 16-18-18\n\n\nGraphics\nNVIDIA RTX 3090 (24GB, GeForce 457.09)\nNVIDIA RTX 3080 (10GB, GeForce 457.09)\nNVIDIA RTX 3070 (8GB, GeForce 457.09)\nNVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti (8GB, GeForce 457.09)\nNVIDIA TITAN RTX (24GB, GeForce 457.09)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti (11GB, GeForce 457.09)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER (8GB, GeForce 457.09)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER (8GB, GeForce 457.09)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER (8GB, GeForce 457.09)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 (6GB, GeForce 457.09)\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti (6GB, GeForce 457.09)\n\n\nAudio\nOnboard\n\n\nStorage\nAMD OS: Samsung 500GB SSD (SATA)\nNVIDIA OS: Samsung 500GB SSD (SATA)\n\n\nPower Supply\nCorsair 80 Plus Gold AX1200\n\n\nChassis\nNZXT H710i Mid-Tower\n\n\nCooling\nNZXT Kraken X63 AIO Liquid Cooler\n\n\nEt cetera\nWindows 10 Pro build 19042 (20H2)\n\n\nAll product links in this table are affiliated, and help support our work.\n\n\n\nOTOY OctaneRender 2020\n\nOTOY\u2019s OctaneRender seems to exhibit the strongest GPU performance scaling across the collection we test with, and fortunately, that scaling carries over to OctaneBench. If you have an NVIDIA GPU, you can download and run the benchmark in a matter of minutes if you want to compare your performance to ours.\nAhead of the Ampere launch, NVIDIA said that the RTX 3070 would beat out the last-gen RTX 2080 Ti, and in many cases, that\u2019s true. However, in gaming, both cards can flip-flop their strengths, whereas in rendering, Ampere cards are able to show great strength even before RT cores get involved. All of the results in the above chart are with RTX on, with the exception of the 1660 Ti, as it doesn\u2019t include dedicated RT cores.\nLet\u2019s see how things transition to the real OctaneRender:\n\n\nOTOY must really care about benchmarks, because despite the fact that OctaneBench serves its purpose well, the company still goes the length to include a separate RTX Off / On test inside of OctaneRender itself. This allows anyone to benchmark their own projects when upgrading from one GPU to another, to easily understand what kind of performance they\u2019re gaining.\nOverall, these OctaneRender tests scale quite well with OctaneBench, and so far, the performance delivered out of NVIDIA\u2019s latest GPUs is going to be undoubtedly alluring to anyone who owns anything less than a top-end GPU of the previous GeForce generation. It is quite something to see a $399 Ampere GeForce outperform the previous generation\u2019s $999 Turing-based 2080 Ti.\nBlender 2.91\n\nAs mentioned earlier, we have a dedicated Blender 2.91 performance article if you want to explore broader results, all of which include AMD\u2019s current crop of graphics cards (except for OptiX testing, naturally). In a basic CUDA and OpenCL rendering test, the Classroom project really highlights AMD\u2019s improved ray traced performance on its RDNA2-equipped GPUs, with the RX 6800 XT placing only just behind the RTX 3080.\nThe Classroom project is an odd one, in that it always seems to favor Radeon more than we\u2019d expect, only because of how we\u2019ve seen other projects scale. Even the Radeon VII would place extremely well in this chart, although we\u2019d never suggest it as an ideal creator card today. Either way, what hurts AMD at this point is NVIDIA\u2019s OptiX ray tracing acceleration, which we\u2019ll see next:\n\nAny renderer that takes advantage of NVIDIA\u2019s RT cores will make it obvious why it\u2019s smart to use over the standard CUDA option, but that doesn\u2019t mean that using the OptiX API will always offer feature parity with its CUDA equivalent. That said, we\u2019re at the point now where it shouldn\u2019t matter unless you are converting older projects. To AMD\u2019s benefit, this OptiX acceleration doesn\u2019t apply to the Eevee render engine:\n\nEven with AMD\u2019s stronger Eevee performance, NVIDIA still ends up coming out ahead in the dollar-for-dollar comparison, and to be honest, based on problems we found in Blender 2.91 with Radeon GPUs, we couldn\u2019t possibly recommend anything other than GeForce right now. The above-linked 2.91 deep-dive article will explore Wireframe viewport modes, due to performance issues we encountered on Radeon, but for here, we\u2019ll just take a look at the Material Preview mode:\n\n\nIn the Controller project, which is the simpler of the two tested, the FPS scales reliably up until the top, when the fastest GPUs can begin tripping over each other. This issue is more pronounced at lower resolutions, where the GPU may not be stressed as hard due to the CPU trying to keep up. In the more complex Racing Car project, we see more expected scaling at the top-end.\nWe should stress that while Radeon GPUs suffer hard in these tests, they perform better in 2.90 \u2013 just not better than NVIDIA. Ultimately, NVIDIA will reign supreme in Blender any way you look at it, but AMD GPUs are capable of a lot more in 2.90. We\u2019re not sure why a degradation occurred, but this is the current reality of Blender if you keep up-to-date.\nChaos Group V-Ray 5\n\nNote that due to performance anomalies with the RTX 2070 SUPER, we had to drop it from the above charts, but it will make a return in the future (our V-Ray license is in limbo, hence we couldn\u2019t just retest). As we\u2019ve seen exhibited a few times up to this point, NVIDIA\u2019s latest crop of GPUs perform really strongly in comparison to the previous generation. Naturally, things only get better once OptiX is enabled:\n\nThe gains with ray tracing acceleration are pretty incredible here, with the RTX 3090 dropping its render time from 98 to 52 seconds \u2013 roughly half. Even the last-gen GPUs fare extremely well here, with the 2060 SUPER also cutting its render time in half with OptiX (RTX) enabled. In most cases, OptiX makes it unnecessary to consider adding the CPU into the mix, but let\u2019s check out that performance anyway:\n\nBear in mind that our workstation PC is equipped with a 32-core processor, so the scaling seen here isn\u2019t likely to align with your CPU unless you happen to have the same one. This is an interesting chart, because the level of benefit really depends on the GPU you\u2019re using. With OptiX, the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 are faster on their own than when combined with the CPU in the CUDA API. But then you can look at the RTX 3070, which actually is faster in the heterogeneous mode than with OptiX.\nDoes any of this mean that you should ever choose a big CPU for V-Ray if you will have a big GPU? Not likely. If you need a many core CPU for other purposes, that\u2019s one thing, but adding a second GPU to the mix is going to show even greater performance gains than we can see here. We even have examples of combining current and last-gen GPUs for V-Ray use, in case you don\u2019t want to get rid of your old GPU when upgrading to a new one.\nSince the last article like this we published, Chaos Group released an updated version of its standalone benchmark, based on the latest engine. That engine upgrade means RTX testing is now included:\n\n\nWhile the results between the CUDA and RTX scores are not comparable to one another (as they are in some other benchmarks, like OctaneRender), we\u2019ve seen proof in many of our other results of the kinds of gains that can be had with ray tracing acceleration being supported. Unlike Arnold, which activates the ray tracing acceleration by default, you will need to change to RTX in V-Ray\u2019s options to take advantage of the speed boost.\nAutodesk Arnold 6\n\n\nWe\u2019ve mentioned Arnold a couple of times in this article so far, so it\u2019s about time we get to tackling GPU rendering performance using it \u2013 inside of Maya. As we\u2019ve seen time and time again, GPUs with less than 8GB of memory are going to suffer in Arnold, at least based on the three projects we have in-house to test with (the two above are the only ones currently benchmarked). Interestingly, the RTX 2060 did manage to pass the E-Type render without fail, but the Sophie project bogs it down hard \u2013 along with the 1660 Ti.\nAt the top-end of the stack, it\u2019s nice to see that choosing RTX 3080 over RTX 3070 will deliver a notable performance uplift. Anything less than a 2080 Ti will see a considerable performance improvement with the move to an Ampere GeForce, assuming you\u2019re not only moving from 2080 Ti to 3060 Ti. Compared to that 2080 Ti, the RTX 3080 outperforms it greatly, and retails for much less this generation (something that\u2019s hard to appreciate with inflated costs all over).\nLuxion KeyShot 10\n\n\nKeyShot is one of the software suites that saw the release of a major update since our last dedicated look at NVIDIA-bound renderers, so the numbers here cannot be compared to those of the past. From the get-go, we can see continued issues with lower-end cards, as anything with 6GB or less will begin to struggle in modern projects.\nThe fact that KeyShot can take advantage of RT acceleration is really obvious at the bottom of the chart, where the 1660 Ti falls flat on its face; taking more than twice the time to render the project than the RTX 2060. If you look back to our CUDA-only test with the Blender Classroom project, you\u2019ll see that both of those GPUs performed closely \u2013 but that\u2019s not close to being the case here in KeyShot.\nAgain, NVIDIA\u2019s top two GPUs do well to separate themselves from the rest of the pack here, while the likes of the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3070 deliver some seriously strong performance for the dollar.\nMaxon Redshift 3\n\nWe had a lot of fun with expiring licenses while putting this article together, so for this performance look at Redshift, we\u2019re sticking to the most recent demo version to get our testing done. Fortunately, even the demo allows you to test with RTX on and off, which is one of our favorite ways to look at rendering performance. Interestingly, the gains with RTX on are not quite as grand in Redshift as they are in other renderers, but nothing is changed about the fact that you\u2019ll want to keep it enabled.\nSimilar to V-Ray, you need to manually enable the RTX in Redshift\u2019s options. We would expect to see the RTX option become default in more renderers the next year as compatibility becomes less and less of an issue.\nPower Consumption\n\nUp until this point, we somehow hadn\u2019t tested the power consumption of our Threadripper machine, at least at idle. In the move from our Intel Core X rig to this Ryzen Threadripper one, the idle wattage jumped quite a bit, from ~90W to 170W on average. Some Threadripper platforms seem to idle with much less wattage, but no change we made to auto-OC options in the EFI would make our idle budge much (we got it as low as 150W without enabling eco modes).\nNonetheless, while our idle results are much different than before, the scaling at peak operation hasn\u2019t seemed to change much at all. The RTX 3080 and 3090 draw quite a bit more power than the rest of the lot, which would suck if not for the fact that the performance uptick justifies it.\n\nAs for the temperatures, all of these GPUs aside from the 1660 Ti are based on \u201creference\u201d designs, so if you have a vendor card that sports a beefier cooler, you\u2019ll likely see improvement. NVIDIA\u2019s latest coolers seem pretty efficient to us, though, especially compared to the previous-gen cards.\nWith these Ampere cards running so quietly, we\u2019ve really noticed now how often the Turing FE cards ramp their fans up during use, something we just don\u2019t hear with the newer cards and coolers. Even though the RTX 3090 is the fastest card of NIVDIA\u2019s bunch, its larger-than-life cooler helps keep temperatures lower at peak than even the RTX 3070.\nFinal Thoughts\nSome conclusions are easier to write than others, and when NVIDIA\u2019s latest-gen GPUs offer such a notable performance improvement over the previous-gen offerings, it makes summarizing what we just saw pretty simple. If you\u2019re buying a new GPU for creator work that heavily involves rendering, then you\u2019ll definitely want to seek out one of the new RTX 3000-series cards. Your biggest concern should be whether or not you can expect an 8GB frame buffer to be a limitation for your work anytime soon.\nBecause most renderers scale with multiple GPUs so well, you also have the option to pair your current GPU with another that you find at a good price, assuming that your current GPU is actually performant to begin with. The biggest problem right now is scarcity, making dual-GPU even less of an option whether you\u2019re trying to buy an old or new GPU. If you don\u2019t mind going the dissimilar GPU route, you could get an impression of improved performance in this article that pairs the RTX 3080 with every last-gen GPU to show what you could expect to gain if you go that route.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s current Ampere GeForce lineup\nIn a world where the pricing NVIDIA says is what you actually pay, both the $399 RTX 3060 Ti and $499 RTX 3070 strike us as a seriously good value for the performance they offer. The 3060 Ti, at $399, manages to beat out the 2080 Ti in many tests, and we can honestly say it\u2019s not often we see a $400 GPU beat out a $1,000 GPU of last-gen quite like this. Naturally, the 8GB frame buffer would be the biggest concern there, but how much of a concern it actually is will be dictated by how memory-hungry your work is.\nRight now, chances are good that you\u2019ll be fine with 8GB for a while longer, but if you do have the means to upgrade to the $699 RTX 3080, you\u2019d be gaining not just some extra memory, but a healthy amount of performance at the same time. As mentioned earlier in the article, NVIDIA is rumored to release a few more GeForces in the months ahead with different memory options, so the overall picture might change before the spring hits.\nIf you are left with a question unanswered, please leave a comment below!\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport our efforts!

Setting a new midrange performance bar at a $399 price point, NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti has been officially unveiled, though rumors and leaks have been circulating for a few weeks now. The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is based on the same NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture that underpins NVIDIA\u2019s new higher-end GeForce RTX 3070 and 3080 cards, though it\u2019s a cut back version aimed at more value-minded gamers.\n\n\nSpecifically, the new GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is built on the same NVIDIA GA104 GPU, but with 4864 CUDA cores, versus a 5888 found in a higher-end RTX 3070, though that\u2019s over twice the number of cores in a previous gen RTX 2060 Super at 2176. There are fewer tensor cores on board at 152 total (272 for an RTX 2060 Super), though those cores are up to 2X faster, according to NVIDIA. Finally, for cutting-edge ray tracing workloads in the latest game engines, the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti sports 38 2nd generation RT cores versus the 2060 Super\u2019s 34 first gen cores, and delivers 31.6 RT TFLOPs, or about 45 percent more available RT throughput versus the company\u2019s previous gen RTX 2060 Super card.\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti PCB - A Very Dense DesignNVIDIA\n\nHere\u2019s what NVIDIA reports as official high-level throughput and performance specs in these areas:\n\n\n\n\nRTX 3060 Ti Programmable Shaders: Increased to 2 shader calculations per clock versus 1 on Turing\u201416.2 Shader-TFLOPS (Ampere \u2013 RTX 3060 Ti), compared to 7.2 TFLOPS (Turing).\nRTX 3060 Ti 2nd Generation RT Cores: Ray-triangle intersection throughput is now doubled so that the RT Core delivers 31.6 RT-TFLOPs (Ampere- RTX 3060 Ti), compared to Turing\u2019s (RTX 2060 Super) 21.7.\nRTX 3060 Ti 3rd Generation Tensor Cores: New Tensor Core automatically identifies and removes less important DNN weights and the new hardware processes the sparse network at twice the rate of Turing\u2014129.6 Tensor-TFLOPS (Ampere \u2013 RTX 3060 Ti) with sparsity, compared to Turing\u2019s 57.4 TFLOPS (RTX 2060 Super).\n\n\nCore clock speeds for these extra silicon resources, however, are largely unchanged, with a 1665MHz GPU Boost Clock for the RTX 3060 Ti versus 1650MHz for an RTX 2060 Super, while both the previous gen and this new Ampere GPU share the same 7000 MHz GDDR6 Memory Clock and 8GB of GDDR6 RAM over a 256-bit memory interface.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti (Foreground) - GeForce RTX 3070 (Background)Dave Altavilla\n\nPhysically, the new Founders Edition GeForce RTX 3060 Ti looks almost completely identical to NVIDIA\u2019s smaller footprint and efficient GeForce RTX 3070 FE card, though it is adorned in a slightly lighter, more silver colored brushed aluminum finish. It also shares the same 12-pin PCIe power connector centrally located on the top edge of the card, though 3rd party board partners will also likely offer standard 8-pin (and dual 8-pin) PCIe power connector configurations.\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti Performance Expectations\nSo that\u2019s how the GeForce 3060 Ti stacks up in terms of the speeds and feeds, but what PC gamers really want to know is how it performs competitively at its $399 price point. Let\u2019s take a quick gander...GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Performance - Metro ExodusHotHardware.comGeForce RTX 3060 Ti Performance - Metro Exodus With Ray TracingHotHardware.comGeForce RTX 3060 Ti Performance - Red Dead Redemption 2 At 1440PHotHardware.com\nIn short, it\u2019s the fastest GPU in this price range currently, sometimes by a significant margin, leaving behind AMD\u2019s now aging Radeon RX 5700 XT virtually across the board, regardless of game title. Check out Marco\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti review at HotHardware for lots more benchmark results. Also, as noted, the RTX 3060 Ti brings with it NVIDIA\u2019s latest generation ray tracing engine, for greater visual fidelity with games that now support the technology, as well as a growing list of next-gen titles that showcase RT effects, like CyberPunk 2077, which is due to launch next week.NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiDave Altavilla\nThe bottom line competitively is that AMD has yet to show its hand on what a \u201cBig Navi\u201d Radeon 6000 Series offering could achieve in this high volume price band, and until that happens it\u2019s game, set, and match for NVIDIA in $400 graphics cards. AMD\u2019s latest generation competitive card currently, the Radeon RX 6800, retails (or is supposed to) for a full $179 more, though it\u2019s significantly more powerful and closer aligned somewhere between NVIDIA\u2019s $499 GeForce RTX 3070 and $699 GeForce RTX 3080. AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 6800 does support ray tracing as well, but currently trails the RTX 3060 Ti generally speaking, largely because NVIDIA has been working with game developers for two generations now with its second generation of ray tracing silicon core technology.\nBeyond these dynamics, the big question will be whether or not consumers will be able to realize enough quantities of these cards to meet demand in retail channels. Demand for this generation of graphics cards, for both NVIDIA and AMD, has been off the hook. However, lower cost offerings like the RTX 3060 Ti typically have better yield and better availability. In fact, it\u2019s likely that the new GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is a solid contributor to NVIDIA\u2019s bottom line in short order, and it will be interesting to check in the company\u2019s calendar Q4 financials early next year.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Other government agencies and many companies are investigating due to SolarWinds\u2019 extensive client list. The Wall Street Journal is now reporting that some big tech companies have been infected, too.Cisco, Intel, Nvidia, Belkin, and VMware have all had computers on their networks infected with the malware. There could be far more: SolarWinds had stated that \u201cfewer than 18,000\u201d companies were impacted, as if that number is supposed to be reassuring, and it even attempted to hide the list of clients who used the infected software. Today\u2019s news takes some of SolarWinds\u2019 big-name clients from \u201cpossibly affected\u2019\u2019 to \u201cconfirmed affected.\u201d At the moment, the big tech companies have the same story, boiling down to \u201cwe\u2019re investigating, but we don\u2019t think this has impacted us.\u201d But as we\u2019ve repeatedly learned in instances like the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s email, it can take a long time for the impacts of a hack to be fully realized. Once hackers are inside a system, it can also be difficult to tell if they\u2019re fully gone. As this Associated Press report explains, it can be difficult to fully trust a network after a hacker has been inside.In this case, investigators have a lot of data to look back through: the hack is still ongoing and has been for months.Exacerbating the issue is that investigators found another hacking group that had broken into SolarWinds using a similar exploit. This attack, dubbed Supernova, was at first thought to be part of the main attack (aka Sunburst), but investigators now think it was executed by a second, less sophisticated group.There are all sorts of reasons why a hacking group might want to get into a big tech company\u2019s systems, including access to future product plans or employee and customer information that could be sold or held for ransom, assuming they actually went looking for that info. But it\u2019s also possible these companies were only collateral damage as these hacking groups went after government agencies, ones that happened to share the same SolarWinds-provided IT management systems. At the moment, it doesn\u2019t seem like any of these companies are particularly worried. Compare that to the US government\u2019s computer security organization, which announced that every federal agency should power down its SolarWinds systems immediately.See More: NewsSecurityTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsLego announces Pok\u00e9mon sets are coming next yearAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

If you own the game, or grab it from Steam for $5 you can (re)experience the entire game in a whole new way, as ray tracing has been applied to the entire game.\u00a0 That goes for AMD GPUs as well, they already support Vulkan Ray Tracing, though without the dedicated RT cores the performance will not match that of an equivalent NVIDIA card.\nQuake II does give anyone who is curious a chance to see ray tracing in action, which is something you should check out if you are still pondering the differences between a new Ampere GPU or a new Navi card.\n \n \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVideo News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviousAIDA64 v6.32 Arrives \n\nNextSapphire NITRO+ AMD Radeon RX 6800 Review \n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\n\n\n \n\nJeremy Hellstrom\nCall it K7M.com, AMDMB.com, or PC Perspective, Jeremy has been hanging out and then working with the gang here for years.
