[+] Santa Clara, California, August 17, 2017. (Photo via Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images).Getty\nNvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) had seen a significant drop this year \u2013 dropping by about 17%, from $236 at the end of 2019 to close to $196 on 16th March 2020, as growing fears around the coronavirus outbreak triggered a sell-off across global equity markets. But with the US government announcing a string of measures to keep businesses afloat, investor sentiment improved over recent weeks \u2013 helping NVDA stock to jump by 78% in the last two and a half months to reach $350 as the market opened on 5th June 2020. The current stock price is close to 50% higher than the level at the beginning of the year, and we believe that NVDA stock could see some downside as the world still awaits the sign of abatement of the pandemic. Our dashboard What Factors Drove 82.5% Change In NVIDIA Stock Between 2017 And Now? provides the key numbers behind our thinking.\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s stock price increased between 2017 and 2019 from $192 to $235. The stock price increase between 2017 and 2019 was primarily driven by 12% growth in revenue between FY \u201918 and FY \u201920 (Nvidia\u2019s fiscal year ends in January), and a 1.36x expansion in the PE multiple. The net income margin in fact dropped from 31.4% in FY \u201918 to 25.6% in FY \u201920. The sharp drop in profits in FY \u201920 was due to increased R&D expenses, as Nvidia ramped up its investment in the data center business. EPS dropped from $5.09 to $4.59 over this period.\n\n\nThe P/E multiple however, rose from 37.7x in 2017 to 51.2x in 2019 largely due to rising investor expectations, owing to the potential of the data center business. Further, the P/E ratio rose in 2020 and stands at over 75x currently. This rise in 2020 despite the impact of coronavirus, is explained below.\n\nSo what\u2019s the likely trigger and timing to this downside?\n\nWith almost all major cities being locked down due to the spread of coronavirus, there has been a slowdown in economic and industrial activity. However, NVDA stock is up roughly 48% since January 31 after the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency in light of the spread of coronavirus. In comparison, during the same period, the S&P 500 index saw a decline of about 3.5%. The ongoing lock down of major cities and economic slowdown should at first look, hamper the company\u2019s business. However, the current lockdown situation in many countries has led to a surge in gaming activities, which should aid Nvidia\u2019s gaming processor revenue (which makes up over 45% of the company\u2019s revenues). Thus, the lockdown could have a somewhat positive impact on the entire business of Nvidia.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORHow To Understand The P/E RatioBy Rob Berger, editorTesla Is Joining the S&P 500. Here\u2019s What That Means For YouBy Taylor Tepper, Forbes Advisor Staff\n\nFurther, for Q1 2021 (quarter ending April 2020), NVDA saw a large 40% rise in revenues while net profit jumped around 2.3x year-on-year. The rise in revenue was mostly from the high-margin data center business, which came in at over $1 billion in quarterly revenues for the first time ($1.14 billion vs $634 million in Q1 \u201920). Gaming revenue too, rose nearly 30% to $1.34 billion. Net income was largely driven by higher gross margins, owing to the data center business and lower R&D expenses (as a % of revenue). Regardless, Q1 only saw a partial impact of the current crisis. Nvidia\u2019s Q2 \u201921 results will likely not be as positive, as impulse purchases of gaming consoles could decline, impacting both revenues and profitability. If there are no signs of containment of the virus by the end of June 2020, NVDA stock could see a sharp drop to below $300 from its current level. Until then, it is unlikely that the stock will see significant upside and in the near term, NVDA stock could hover around $340 to $360 per share.\n\nFor more insights into how Covid-19 could impact Nvidia\u2019s rival AMD, view our interactive dashboard Advanced Micro Devices Downside: How Low Can Advanced Micro Devices Stock Go?.\n\n\nOur dashboard forecasting U.S. COVID-19 cases with cross-country comparisons analyzes expected recovery time-frames and possible spread of the virus.

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) seems to have embarked on a relentless bull run, buoyed by an increase in hyperscale demand and the growing ubiquity of cloud-based solutions amid spatial distancing measures instituted to dampen the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Today, the GPU designer attained another milestone, clocking a fresh intraday high just moments ago.\nAs of 12:05 p.m. ET, NVIDIA shares were up around 1.05 percent, trading at $385.19 \u2013 a new intraday high. After hitting a year-to-date low of $196.40 on the 16th of March, NVIDIA shares have risen by an astonishing 96 percent. Should this trajectory continue, the stock will soon double its price relative to the level at the start of the year.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total CostSo, what\u2019s the stimulus behind the latest upthrust? Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh published a bullish investment note today, noting that the GPU demand remains healthy with further strength expected in the second half of 2020 \"despite some concern over softer 2H WFH and data center demand\". Accordingly, Rakesh maintained a $400 price target and an overall \u2018Buy\u2019 rating for the stock, corresponding to an upside potential of 4.2 percent relative to the current price level.\nIt should be noted that, earlier in May, BMO Capital analyst Ambrish Srivasta had raised NVIDIA\u2019s stock price target by a whopping 49.12 percent to $425 from $285. The analyst had observed in his investment note:\n\u201cWhile no one single event drives the change in thinking, the company's continued execution on the datacenter side, along with the latest product rollout, warrants a more positive stance on the shares.\u201d\nSrivasta had went on to add that NVIDIA can \u201cgrow its data center business to at least a $20B annual run rate versus the $4.8B for this year.\u201d Consequently, the analyst had noted that the company could grow its EPS to a whopping $20 per share over the long-term.\nOf course, stellar Q1 2021 earnings have played an important role in beefing up NVIDIA\u2019s stock price. As a refresher, the company\u2019s revenue for the quarter increased by 39 percent year-over-year to $3.08 billion. Moreover, its revenue from the data center business topped $1 billion for the first time. The icing on the cake, however, came during the earnings call when NVIDIA\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang asserted that the work-from-home trend remains conducive for growth in gaming-related expenditure:\n\u201cI think more and more people are going to work permanently from home. There's a strong movement of companies that are going to support a larger percentage of people working from home. And when people work from home, it's going to clearly increase the single best home entertainment, which is gaming. I think gaming is going to represent a much larger segment of the overall entertainment budget of society.\u201d\nApart from the strength in hyperscale and cloud spheres, NVIDIA has benefited from a number of AAA gaming titles that now support its RTX Ray Tracing technology. Moreover, the GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs have also boosted the company\u2019s top-line metric. However, sales channel disruptions due to the coronavirus-induced lockdowns may have moderated some of the original gains.\nEven as a plethora of companies curtailed their expenditures amid the ongoing macroeconomic weakness, NVIDIA chose to maintain its recent acquisition spree. For example, the company officially completed its acquisition of Israel\u2019s Mellanox Technologies on the 27th of April, capping an arduous process that spanned over 13 months.

That was a nice jump from the prior-year period's market share of nearly 22.7%, which means that NVIDIA has lost substantial ground to its smaller rival.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy AMD is winning the GPU battle\nNVIDIA has been traditionally superior to AMD on the technology curve, but the latter has caught up of late thanks to its Navi family of GPUs, which are based\u00a0on the 7-nanometer RDNA architecture. The Radeon RX 5700 series graphics cards that hit the market nearly a year ago were not only priced aggressively, but they also outperformed their NVIDIA counterparts.\nThat is probably the reason why AMD's market share moved north by a substantial margin in the first quarter of 2020. AMD has been following a tried-and-tested strategy of offering better bang for the buck since 2016 when it launched its Polaris cards aimed at the budget end of the market. The RX 5700 series graphics cards launched last year make it clear that AMD is following a similar playbook in the mid-range\u00a0GPU market, and it seems to be working.\nThe reason why AMD has been able to pack in a solid price-to-performance ratio compared to NVIDIA graphics cards is because of an advanced manufacturing process. The company's RDNA architecture is based on a 7nm process, while NVIDIA's current generation Turing graphics cards are based\u00a0on a 12nm process.\n\n\n\n\n\nA smaller manufacturing node means that the transistors on the chip are smaller and are packed closely together. This leads to a jump in the compute capacity of the chip, reduces power consumption, and lowers manufacturing costs because of a smaller die size.\nHowever, there might be a change in the status quo coming, as NVIDIA is getting ready to launch discrete GPUs based on the new Ampere architecture later this year.\nNVIDIA's upcoming graphics cards will pose a new challenge\nThe Ampere architecture-based consumer graphics cards from NVIDIA could be based\u00a0on a 7nm manufacturing process, though there are rumors suggesting that they may also be manufactured\u00a0using a 10nm process. The Ampere-based graphics cards could\u00a0hit the market close to the fourth quarter of 2020.\nWith this move, NVIDIA is expected to close the technology gap that AMD has enjoyed of late. It is rumored\u00a0that the Ampere cards could be four times more powerful in ray-tracing performance, with the top of the line card expected\u00a0to be 40% faster in terms of overall performance than its predecessor.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt remains to be seen how NVIDIA goes about the pricing of these cards, as the company has been making its offerings pricier of late. But NVIDIA may not have that luxury this time -- AMD looks all set to keep up the heat thanks to its upcoming GPUs based on the RDNA2 architecture, which is expected\u00a0by the end of the year.\nThe RDNA2 architecture is an improved version of AMD's existing 7nm process node, but the company is promising extensive gains over the current graphics cards. According to AMD's estimates, RDNA2 graphics cards could deliver a 50% gain\u00a0in performance per watt over the current ones. They will also come equipped with ray-tracing technology, bringing AMD up to the level of NVIDIA, which has been offering this technology\u00a0for nearly two years now.\nIn the end, things are about to get interesting in the discrete GPU space in the second half of 2020. NVIDIA could stymie AMD's resurgence, thanks to a generational leap that is expected to bring impressive performance gains. However, if AMD can deliver the gains that it is promising and sticks to its strategy of offering high-bang-for-the-buck products, it could keep eating into NVIDIA's discrete GPU dominance and remain a top growth stock.\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Mercedes-Benz, Nvidia deepen autonomous driving alliance           1 / 2 Mercedes-Benz, Nvidia deepen autonomous driving alliance A logo of Mercedes-Benz is seen outside a Mercedes-Benz car dealer, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Brussels    Jane Lanhee Lee and Edward Taylor  Updated 24 June 2020 2 min read       In this article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -3.33%       By Jane Lanhee Lee and Edward Taylor (Reuters) - Semiconductor maker Nvidia Corp <NVDA.O> has struck a deal with Germany's Daimler <DAIGn.DE> to develop and equip Mercedes-Benz cars with a next generation chip and software platform that could eventually be used for autonomous driving functions.  The alliance between a deep-pocketed tech player and the world's oldest carmaker allows Mercedes to jointly develop new automated driving capabilities and software applications at a time when the auto industry is struggling to generate profits. \"We want to launch a ground-breaking software-defined computer architecture for driving assistance and autonomous drive,\" Daimler Chief Executive Ola Kaellenius said during a joint presentation by the two companies on Tuesday. The Nvidia Drive AGX Orin Platform, an autonomous vehicle processor, will be rolled out starting in 2024, allowing Mercedes to update a car's software the same way that smartphones are updated today. \u201cEvery future Mercedes-Benz with the NVIDIA DRIVE system will come with a team of expert AI and software engineers continuously developing, refining and enhancing the car over its lifetime,\u201d Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said. The companies will jointly develop the artificial intelligence (AI) and automated vehicle applications to enable higher levels of automated driving, Daimler said. The new partnership follows Daimler's move last week to pause a development alliance with rival German luxury carmaker BMW <BMWG.DE> in automated driving. Asked how the Mercedes partnership would affect Nvidia\u2019s decade-long collaboration with Audi AG <NSUG.DE>, Nvidia spokesman Danny Shapiro said neither arrangement was exclusive. With Mercedes, there is \u201ca huge dedication, huge energy, huge investment from both companies to bring this to market,\u201d he said. Mercedes sold 2.39 million cars worldwide in 2019. The two companies have been working together on autonomous driving and AI car technology for over five years.

The cars will use Nvidia\u2019s expertise in artificial intelligence-powered autonomous driving technology.\nThe collaboration marks a major step toward Mercedes\u2019 vision of full self-driving. \u201cWith the technology we are going to put on the road with Nvidia, there are endless possibilities from assisted driving all the way to autonomous driving,\u201d Ola K\u00e4llenius, CEO of Mercedes-Benz AG, said in a webcast on Tuesday. \u201cThrough the [software-driven] architecture, customers will be able to update driving experience throughout the lifetime of a vehicle. It will be, in a way, a gift to customers that keeps on giving.\u201d\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang describes future vehicles equipped with this system as \u201cperpetual, upgradeable machines\u201d powered by AI supercomputers.\nSEE ALSO: GM Is Secretly Eyeing a Massive Electric Vehicle Market to Tackle Tesla\n\u201cThe entire product is going to be designed differently,\u201d he said at Tuesday\u2019s event. \u201cIn the past, a car is at its best condition at its point of sales, the moment you take ownership of it. But in the future, [buying] a car is a starting point. There will be thousands of engineers working along with your car for the entire life of the car.\u201d\n\u201cThis is also important for the business model of our company,\u201d K\u00e4llenius added. \u201cMany people talk about modern cars kind of like smartphones on wheels. If you want to take that approach, you really have to look at software architecture from a holistic point of view. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve made the decision to create our own operating system.\u201d\nMercedes says the new system will be available across its fleet in 2024, but didn\u2019t disclose prices for specific software.\nTesla, the first automaker in the industry to introduce advanced driver-assist capabilities, sells its basic Autopilot software package for $2,000. The most advanced \u201cfull self-driving\u201d Autopilot package is available for $7,000 and is scheduled for a $1,000 price increase next month.\nTraditional gas car manufacturers, including General Motors (GM) (GM) and Ford (F), are also investing heavily in developing in-house driverless technologies. GM unveiled its answer to Tesla Autopilot, Super Cruise, in 2017 and is currently available on its high-end Cadillac CT6 sedans. Ford is set to introduce a similar software next year as part of its Co-Pilot360 advanced driver assist system (ADAS).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Filed Under:\nArtificial Intelligence, Electric Vehicles, Business, Technology, Ola K\u00e4llenius, Jensen Huang, Self-Driving Cars, Ford, General Motors, Mercedes Benz, Nvidia, Tesla \n\n\n\n\nSEE ALSO:  Coca-Cola, Breweries and Automakers Prepare for Trump\u2019s Tariffs\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARTS\n\nArt Fairs\nArt Market\nArt Reviews\nAuctions\nGalleries\nMuseums\n\n\nBUSINESS\n\nEnergy\nFinance\nMedia\nPolicy\nTechnology\nClimate\n\n\nENTERTAINMENT\n\nBooks\nDance\nMovies\nOpera\nTheater\nTV Shows\n\n\nLIFESTYLE\n\nAutos\nHotels\nNightlife & Dining\nRestaurants\nStyle\nTravel\n\n\nWEALTH\n\nBillionaires\nParties\nPhilanthropy\nReal Estate\n\n\nEXPERT INSIGHTS\n\nA.I.

section into the Franchising Code of Conduct (Franchising Code) are effective from 1 June 2020.\u00a0 Although the regulations largely follow the Exposure Draft issued in February this year, the 1 June implementation date caught many by surprise.\u00a0 This is particularly the case given the consultation process consistently flagged a 1 July 2020 commencement date and the Exposure Draft itself contained an implementation date of 1 July.\u00a0 It\u2019s unclear whether this was an inadvertent error, or whether the Government was keen to move quickly given the economic conditions currently confronting the automotive sector.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n    \n\nApplication of the changes\n\nThe changes apply to new vehicle dealer agreements entered into on or after 1 June 2020 (New NVDAs), as well as to renewals or extensions of such New NVDAs.1\u00a0\nThe new regulations do not apply to all motor vehicle dealerships, only those that come within a new definition of a \u201cnew vehicle dealership agreement\u201d.\u00a0 This is defined to mean a motor vehicle dealership agreement relating to a dealership that predominantly deals in new passenger vehicles or new light goods vehicles (or both).\u00a0 So agreements dealing with motorcycles, used cars, farm machinery and trucks would typically not be caught.\u00a0 The reason for this policy distinction is not clear, and the word \u201cpredominantly\u201d in the definition is likely to be closely scrutinised by those seeking to avoid the application of the new regulations.\nImportantly, the end of term obligations also apply to renewals or extensions of new vehicle dealership agreements entered into prior to 1 June, 2020 (Existing NVDAs).\u00a0 The obligations contained in clause 18 of the Code are expressed to continue to apply to Existing NVDAs instead of the new obligations unless the Existing NVDA is renewed or extended.2\u00a0 So once an Existing NVDA is renewed or extended, the new end of term notification and wind down management obligations apply to the Existing NVDA.\nThe application of the new capital expenditure obligations to any Existing NVDA is determined in part by the date of creation or updating of the disclosure document.\u00a0 The existing clause 30 of the Franchising Code, rather than the new clause 50, applies to any Existing NVDA entered into, renewed or extended before 1 June 2020.3\u00a0 Clause 30, rather than clause 50, also applies to the renewal or extension of an Existing NVDA if the disclosure document was created, or most recently updated, prior to 1 June 2020.\u00a0 However if the Existing NVDA is renewed or extended after 1 June 2020 and the disclosure document was created or most recently updated after 1 June 2020, clause 50 applies. Clause 51 also applies to such a disclosure document.4\n\n\nNew requirements for franchisors when requesting capital expenditure by dealers\n\nConsistent with the existing provisions of the Franchising Code, clause 50 provides that car manufacturers cannot not require significant capital expenditure by a dealer during the term of the agreement. This prohibition is subject to exceptions, such as where the expenditure is agreed with the dealer, or where such expenditure is disclosed to the dealer prior to the entering the agreement.\u00a0 The key difference between the existing clause 30 in the Franchising Code and the new clause 50 is that clause 30(2)(e) has been replaced by a new clause 51.\u00a0 Under the new provisions, when making capital expenditure disclosure to a dealer prior to signing a new vehicle dealership agreement, car manufacturers must provide as much information as is practicable about the expenditure, including:\u00a0\na.\u00a0 the rationale for the expenditure,\u00a0\nb.\u00a0 the amount, timing and nature of the expenditure;\u00a0\nc.\u00a0 the anticipated outcomes and benefits of the expenditure; and\u00a0\nd.\u00a0 the expected risks associated with the expenditure.\nThe written disclosure must be supplemented by a discussion before the dealer agreement is signed. Matters to be discussed include the likelihood of recoupment of the expenditure, having regard to the geographical area of operations of the dealer.\nThese requirements are a significant compliance burden for manufacturers, particularly as they assume the manufacturer is aware of all elements.\u00a0 It would seem quite challenging to satisfy these obligations without incurring additional risk, such as in relation to projecting \u201canticipated outcomes and benefits\u201d.\u00a0 Section 4 of the Australian Consumer Law provides a person must be able to prove they had a reasonable basis for making any representation as to a future event.\u00a0\n\n\nEnd of term obligations\n\nThe new regulations provide that car manufacturers must notify franchisees in writing of their intention to extend or enter into a new agreement, or do neither. Where the term of the agreement is 12 months or more, the franchisor must give at least 12 months\u2019 notice.5\u00a0 The longer notice period6 is aimed at providing greater flexibility for franchisees to search for another franchise, to sell the site or do whatever is necessary to organise their affairs.\u00a0\nWhere the franchisor gives notice that it intends to not extend the franchise agreement nor enter a new one, a statement of reasons must be provided. The statement of reasons is thought to assist dealers in assessing whether the franchisor has acted in good faith.\u00a0 \u00a0\nIn the event a franchisor provides notice to a franchisee that it intends not to extend the current agreement nor enter into a new agreement, the parties must work together to agree to a written plan with milestones. The plan should include management of the dealer\u2019s stock of new vehicles and parts, and service and repair equipment over the balance of the agreement.\u00a0 The parties must also cooperate to reduce the franchisees stock of new vehicles and spare parts for the remainder of the term. While car manufacturers are typically proactive in managing outgoing dealer stock levels, a requirement to \u201cagree a written plan\u201d may prove challenging, particularly where the relationship has soured.\u00a0\nManufacturers are obliged to implement these arrangements \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d7, and notwithstanding dealers may be reluctant to cooperate.\u00a0 It may therefore be appropriate to consider amending Dealer Agreements to give manufacturers the ability to take charge of the process, and possibly use the default provisions under the Dealer Agreement to ensure dealer compliance.\n\n\nResolving disputes\n\nThe new regulations provide that two or more franchisees \u201cmay ask\u201d the franchisor to deal with the franchisees together about a dispute which is of the same nature. The regulations stop short of mandating that car manufacturers must engage in multi- party dispute resolution, which seems prudent.\u00a0 However manufacturers must still consider and respond to the request having regard to the good faith obligations contained in the Franchising Code.8\nMulti-party dispute resolution may provide a cost effective and efficient approach to resolving disputes, and dealers may feel they have more bargaining power as a group than individually.\u00a0 However there are practical complexities with multi-party dispute resolution, such as the potential for breach of confidentiality obligations and conflicts of interest given the broad variation in dealer size, business structure, locations and businesses.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nAt first glance the regulations look relatively innocuous, and they certainly do not contain some of the more radical amendments requested in some submissions to recent Government inquiries and during industry consultation.\u00a0 However there are important changes that will require manufacturers to review and possibly reconsider their approach to end of term arrangements, capital expenditure and dispute resolution.\nThere will be two regulatory regimes operating in parallel \u2013 the new regulations applying to new vehicle dealership agreements and those applying to the broader category of motor vehicle dealerships regulated by the current Franchising Code.\u00a0 In some situations it will be unclear which regime applies, and care will need to be taken to avoid inadvertently tripping the application of the new regime to existing arrangements.\nManufacturers will need to consider whether they wish to amend their agreements or operating manuals to give greater structure or clarity to end of term arrangements or capital expenditure matters, as the regulations leave plenty to the imagination.\u00a0 The regulations may in fact lead to less disclosure rather than more disclosure in relation to capital expenditure, as it would seem very difficult and high risk to attempt to provide capital expenditure information to the standard required by the new regulations.\u00a0 Another consequence may be to prefer shorter term agreements, or consider other forms of vehicle distribution.\nA review of the operation of the amendments made by the new regulations must be conducted before 1 April, 2024.\u00a0 By that time there is likely to have been major changes to the Australian automotive sector, with major restructuring already under way in some networks and global and local economic conditions the worst in living memory for many manufacturers and dealers.\nTo discuss any aspect of the new regulations, or for more information on automotive industry matters, please contact our specialist team members below.\n\n \n\n\nFootnotes\n\n1\nSee clauses 55(1)(a) and 55(1)(b).\n\n\n2\r\n        See clauses 55(3) and 55(4).\r\n    \n\n3\nSee clause 56(2).\n\n\n4\nSee clause 56(4).\n\n\n5\nSee clause 47.\n\n\n6\nClause 18 of the Franchising Code requires 6 months\u2019 notice, and does not obligate the franchisor to provide reasons.\u00a0\n\n\n7\nSee clause 49(2).\n\n\n8\nSee clause 6 of the Franchising Code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\ufeff\r\n\n\nContacts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStephen Giles\n\nPartner \n\nEmail\nstephen.giles@nortonrosefulbright.com\n\n\nMelbourne\nSydney\n\n\nT:\n+61 3 8686 6965\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarshall Bromwich\n\nPartner | Corporate Team Leader \n\nEmail\nmarshall.bromwich@nortonrosefulbright.com\n\n\nBrisbane\n\n\nT:\n+61 7 3414 2829\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Mulligan\n\nPartner \n\nEmail\npeter.mulligan@nortonrosefulbright.com\n\n\nSydney\n\n\nT:\n+61 2 9330 8562\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMathew Webster\n\nSpecial Counsel \n\nEmail\nmathew.webster@nortonrosefulbright.com\n\n\nSydney\n\n\nT:\n+61 2 9330 8257\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNick Rimington\n\nPartner \n\nEmail\nnick.rimington@nortonrosefulbright.com\n\n\nMelbourne\n\n\nT:\n+61 3 8686 6353\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice areas:\n\n\n\r\n                                        Franchising\r\n                                    \n\n\n\r\n                                        Automotive\r\n                                    \n\n\n\n\nIndustries:\n\n\n\r\n                                        Technology\r\n                                    \n\n\n\r\n                                        Consumer markets\r\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent publications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublication\nNew guidelines from the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions on crypto-asset exposures\nOn February 20, 2025, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) published the Capital and Liquidity Treatment of Crypto-asset Exposures (Banking) -

Twitter users Momomo_us discovered the new SKU, which joins the legion of GTX 1650 variants out there, but this one has something rather surprising under the bonnet - it is a new model based upon the TU106 GPU, the same GPU used for the original RTX 2070.\n\nThere are a lot of GTX 1650 variants out there already, a user replied to Momomo_us's Tweet to list 10 designs, including the new Ultra - there are permutations such as the Super, Mobile, Max-Q, Ti, and GDDR6 editions.\nSo, what is the GeForce GTX 1650 Ultra, and why does it exist? According to the official product page, this Galax branded card is powered by the TU106-125 GPU. This is a cut down version of the GPU behind the original RTX 2070, which was the TU-106-400. The key thing here is that the GTX 1650 Ultra's GPU has significantly fewer CUDA cores than a RTX 2070's GPU would provide; 896 compared to 2304.\n\nTU106-125 GPU\n896 CUDA cores\n1,590MHz GPU boost clock\n4GB GDDR6 VRAM on 128bit bus\n12Gbps memory performance\n\n\nThe cores/clocks/memory configuration makes the GTX 1650 Ultra's nearest neighbour the GTX 1650 GDDR6 version (based upon the TU117-300 GPU). All the specs bullet pointed above align with this SKU, however the GTX 1650 GDDR6 has a TDP of 75W, compared to this Ultra model's 90W.\nIt is quite common for graphics card makers to make use of GPU dies that aren't up to snuff for the intended target product for lower tier products. In this case the TU106-125 GPU doesn't need functioning RTX or Tensor cores, and it has fewer than 60 per cent of the die's CUDA cores in action. Repurposing these GPUs helps minimise waste materials and production cost losses.\n\nIt will be interesting to see the performance of the GeForce GTX 1650 Ultra when these cards become available, but nothing in the spec suggests 'Ultra' performance, or any boost narrowing the margin between standard GTX 1650 and its 'Super' variants. Some may be irked by the use of the 'Ultra' suffix here, as one might consider 'ultra' to be an improvement upon 'super'. The GTX 1650 Super, is a completely different kettle of fish though, with its TU116-250 GPU boasting 1,280 CUDA cores and running at a boost clock of 1,725MHz out of the box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 3 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

Zero innovation (please don't even start with ray tracing), incremental updates at best all to milk customers for their $$$, that's what happens when you have a company run by greedy investors who couldn't care less about what the company is producing or (should be) representing.\n            \n            \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin |\n                Register\n\nA\nA\nA\n\nFull HEXUS Site\n\nAbout Us -\n                Contact Us -\n                Advertise -\n                T&Cs \n\n\n\n\n        Copyright \u00a9 1998 - 2025, HEXUS.net.

Its major shareholders have offered to buy the shares that they don\u2019t already own at S$0.77 per share back in February. That\u2019s a premium of around 20% on the closing price before the announcement was made. The major shareholders include George Quek, his wife, Catherine Lee, and Thai-listed hospitality company, Minor International (BKK: MINT). Together, they own about two-thirds of BreadTalk shares.   There are a couple of other significant shareholders, namely, US-based Paradice Investment, and Square Investment, which is operated by George Quek and Catherine Lee. The two investment vehicles own about 8.7% of BreadTalk. The company\u2019s privatisation offer closed on 20 April, with the offeror\u2019s concert parties owning, controlling or agreeing to acquire 98.03% of BreadTalk shares. The food and beverage giant has seen its share of ups and downs over the years. The group took on quite a bit of debt for expansion, and ended 2019 with around S$247.3 million of gross debt, against S$157.6 million of cash. Difficulties faced A full-year loss for 2019 was incurred, to the tune of S$5.2 million. The loss caps off a tumultuous period for the group that saw its net profit fluctuate wildly over the last five years, from as high as S$22.2 million in 2014 to S$7.6 million in 2015. The group\u2019s Bakery division is also mired in red ink, chalking up a loss before tax of S$13.5 million for 2019. Profit before tax for this division was also steadily declining since 2016, culminating into a full-year loss. This loss, together with losses from the group\u2019s 4orth division, dragged the entire group into the red for the year. Get Smart: Redeploy your capital Perhaps, it is an opportune time for the major shareholders to take the company private. With the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdowns and social distancing, the group is bound to suffer even worse losses and cash burn for both its Bakery and 4orth divisions. Dividends, which were already suspended last year, could take quite a while to be restored. Also, restructuring and cost-cutting can be better achieved without the constant scrutiny that comes with being a listed entity. For long-suffering shareholders, the capital released from the privatisation can be better deployed to other more promising businesses that have been severely beaten down.   After all, successful investing is about putting your capital where it has the best chance of growing over the long-term. Want to know what stocks we like for our portfolio? See for yourself now.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

Malcolm Walker, who founded the supermarket group in 1970, and CEO Tarsem Dhaliwal, have purchased the 63.1% of Iceland owned by South African investment company Brait for 115 million pounds ($146 million).  Iceland Foods is now 100% owned by Walker, Dhaliwal and their related parties. Reuters reported in March that Walker could seek to regain outright ownership. \u201cIt is particularly satisfying to turn this new page in Iceland\u2019s history just before the 50th anniversary of the opening of our first shop on 18 November 1970,\" said Walker. Walker listed Iceland on the London Stock Exchange in 1984. It merged with wholesaler Booker in 2000 and was purchased by a consortium led by Icelandic investor Baugur in 2005. Baugur collapsed after the financial crisis and in 2012 Walker was among those who bought Iceland back from the liquidators of failed Icelandic banks in a deal valuing it at 1.55 billion pounds. Brait, under pressure to reduce debt, said in November it planned to sell its stakes within five years in several British companies, including Iceland. The more than 1,000 store Iceland is Britain's ninth biggest supermarket in overall grocery market share, but it is second only to industry leader Tesco in frozen food and it has benefited from consumers stocking up on products that have a long life during the pandemic. Industry data showed its sales rose 28.6% over the 12 weeks to May 17, giving it a market share of 2.4%, a proportion of sales it last held in 2000.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

Specifically, Mercedes-Benz will be employing NVIDIA\u2019s new DRIVE platform technologies as standard equipment in all vehicles, starting in 2024. This is clearly a huge design win for NVIDIA, as well as a key strategic move for Mercedes-Benz, and it comes with upgradeability features that will be critical to both the evolution of the technology itself, but also new business models that it will help enable as well.\n\n\nNVIDIA and Mercedes are underscoring that this is a \u201csoftware-defined\u201d computing architecture for automated driving. Though Tesla has had the ability to provide new features and capabilities via over-the-air updates to its customers, NVIDIA and Mercedes are emphasizing that this will be a major advantage of the platform, with the ability to configure and purchase features and capabilities for the system, both at time of purchase and later down the road, as a driver\u2019s needs might change.\nNVIDIA's DRIVE Platform To Enable Future Upgrades And Autonomous Driving FeaturesMercedes-Benz And NVIDIA\n\n\u201cWe are excited to work with Mercedes-Benz. It\u2019s the perfect partner for us given its long record of innovation and our strong technical relationship. It\u2019s clear from our extensive discussions with Ola and his team that we share a common vision of the automobile of the future. Together, we\u2019re going to revolutionize the car ownership experience, making the vehicle software programmable and continuously upgradeable via over-the-air updates. Every future Mercedes-Benz with the NVIDIA DRIVE system will come with a team of expert AI and software engineers continuously developing, refining and enhancing the car over its lifetime,\u201d noted Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA.\n\nNVIDIA is also touting the ability to automate driving of regular routes from address to address, as well as SAE level 3 automation. Level 3 driving takes over all control functions of the car in certain areas and conditions, with vehicles moving in the same direction and no pedestrians, as with highway driving, for example. Drivers are still required to be in the vehicle with level 3 automation, though Mercedes has previously pioneered full driverless level 4 autonomy for parking, which will also be enabled on the new NVIDIA platform. The technology Mercedes will be employing is based on NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation DRIVE platform and its new Orin system-on-chip architecture with Ampere GPU-accelerated, AI-powered automation. NVIDIA will also be providing not only a full software stack but also cloud data center GPU compute power as training and inference machine learning infrastructure as well.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\nNVIDIA And Mercedes-Benz Partner In Autonomous Vehicle DevelopmentNVIDIA\n\nAnalyst Take - Why This Is A Big Deal For Both NVIDIA And Mercedes-Benz\nNVIDIA and Mercedes-Benz also noted that NVIDIA\u2019s new technologies will afford Mercedes the ability to build cars with a single automation platform, reducing the number of on-board computers for controlling things like sensors, cameras and infotainment systems, etc. For NVIDIA, this is a huge design win opportunity with one of the top mainstream premium vehicle brands that moves over 2.3 million vehicles a year. If we do the math, the numbers will mean a massive uptick in NVIDIA\u2019s Automotive business.\n\n\nFor Mercedes-Benz it\u2019s also a key partnership that will allow the company to accelerate its efforts to bring autonomous vehicles to market, without having to reinvent the wheel, so to speak, designing an automation platform themselves. In short, NVIDIA\u2019s new DRIVE platform will kick Mercedes-Benz into a much-needed higher gear in the race for autonomous driving, giving chase to Tesla and many others.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Published as version 451.48 \u2013 the first driver out of NVIDIA\u2019s new Release 450 driver branch \u2013 the new driver is the first release from the company to explicitly support the latest iteration of DirectX 12, enabling support for features such as DXR 1.1 ray tracing and tier 2 variable rate shading. As well, this driver also enables support for hardware accelerated GPU scheduling.\nAs a quick refresher, DirectX 12 Ultimate is Microsoft\u2019s latest iteration of the DirectX 12 graphics API, with Microsoft using it to synchronize the state of the API between current-generation PCs and the forthcoming Xbox Series X console, as well as to set a well-defined feature baseline for future game development. Based around the capabilities of current generation GPUs (namely: NVIDIA Turing) and the Xbox Series X\u2019s AMD RDNA2-derrived GPU, DirectX 12 Ultimate introduces several new GPU features under a new feature tier (12_2). This includes an updated version of DirectX\u2019s ray tracing API, DXR 1.1, as well as tier 2 variable rate shading, mesh shaders, and sampler feedback. The software groundwork for this has been laid in the latest version of Windows 10, version 2004, and now is being enabled in GPU drivers for the first time.\n\n\n\nDirectX 12 Feature Levels\n\n\n\u00a0\n12_2\r\n\t\t\t(DX12 Ult.)\n12_1\n12_0\n\n\nGPU Architectures\r\n\t\t\t(Introduced as of)\nNVIDIA: Turing\r\n\t\t\tAMD: RDNA2\r\n\t\t\tIntel: Xe?\nNVIDIA: Maxwell 2\r\n\t\t\tAMD: Vega\r\n\t\t\tIntel: Gen9\nNVIDIA: Maxwell 2\r\n\t\t\tAMD: Hawaii\r\n\t\t\tIntel: Gen9\n\n\nRay Tracing\r\n\t\t\t(DXR 1.1)\nYes\nNo\nNo\n\n\nVariable Rate Shading\r\n\t\t\t(Tier 2) \nYes\nNo\nNo\n\n\nMesh Shaders\nYes\nNo\nNo\n\n\nSampler Feedback\nYes\nNo\nNo\n\n\nConservative Rasterization\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\n\nRaster Order Views\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\n\nTiled Resources\r\n\t\t\t(Tier 2) \nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\nBindless Resources\r\n\t\t\t(Tier 2)\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\nTyped UAV Load\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\n\nIn the case of NVIDIA\u2019s recent video cards, the underlying Turing architecture has supported these features since the very beginning. However, their use has been partially restricted to games relying on NVIDIA\u2019s proprietary feature extensions, due to a lack of standardized API support. Overall it\u2019s taken most of the last two years to get the complete feature set added to DirectX, and while NVIDIA isn\u2019t hesitating to use this moment to proclaim their GPU superiority as the first vendor to ship DirectX 12 Ultimate support, to some degree it\u2019s definitely vindication of the investment the company put in to baking these features into Turing.\nIn any case, enabling DirectX 12 Ultimate support is an important step for the company, though one that\u2019s mostly about laying the groundwork for game developers, and ultimately, future games. At this point no previously-announced games have confirmed that they\u2019ll be using DX12U, though this is just a matter of time, especially with the Xbox Series X launching in a few months.\n\nPerhaps the more interesting aspect of this driver release, though only tangential to DirectX 12 Ultimate support, is that NVIDIA is enabling support for hardware accelerated GPU scheduling. This mysterious feature was added to the Windows display driver stack with WDDM 2.7 (shipping in Win10 2004), and as alluded to by the name, it allows GPUs to more directly manage their VRAM. Traditionally Windows itself has done a lot of the VRAM management for GPUs, so this is a distinctive change in matters.\nAt a high level, NVIDIA is claiming that hardware accelerated GPU scheduling should offer minor improvements to the user experience, largely by reducing latency and improving performance thanks to more efficient video memory handling. I would not expect anything too significant here \u2013 otherwise NVIDIA would be heavily promoting the performance gains \u2013 but it\u2019s something to keep an eye out for. Meanwhile, absent any other details, I find it interesting that NVIDIA lumps video playback in here as a beneficiary as well, since video playback is rarely an issue these days. At any rate, the video memory handling changes are being instituted at a low level, so hardware scheduling is not only for DirectX games and the Windows desktop, but also for Vulkan and OpenGL games as well.\nSpeaking of Vulkan, the open source API is also getting some attention with this driver release. 451.48 is the first GeForce driver with support for Vulkan 1.2, the latest version of that API. An important housekeeping update for Vulkan, 1.2 is promoting a number of previously optional feature extensions into the core Vulkan API, such as Timeline Semaphores, as well as improved cross portability support by adding full support for HLSL (i.e. DirectX) shaders within Vulkan.\n\nFinally, while tangential to today\u2019s driver release, NVIDIA has posted an interesting note on its customer support portal regarding Windows GPU selection that\u2019s worth making note of. In short, Windows 10 2004 has done away with the \u201cRun with graphics processor\u201d contextual menu option within NVIDIA\u2019s drivers, which prior to now has been a shortcut method of forcing which GPU an application runs on it an Optimus system. In fact, it looks like control over this has been removed from NVIDIA\u2019s drivers entirely. As noted in the support document, controlling which GPU is used is now handled through Windows itself, which means laptop users will need to get used to going into the Windows Settings panel to make any changes.\n\nAs always, you can find the full details on NVIDIA\u2019s new GeForce driver, as well as the associated release notes, over on NVIDIA\u2019s driver download page.\n\n\n                Source:\n                NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n58 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nOxford Guy - Wednesday, June 24, 2020 - link\nCompanies are really dropping the ball with product naming.Once upon a time, if a serious revision occurred it would be coupled with a clear name change.DirectX 10 became DirectX 10.1But, now everything is \"super\" and \"awesome\" and \"ultimate\". It's both asinine and confusing.\n\n\n\nDigitalFreak - Wednesday, June 24, 2020 - link\nYou forgot \"turbo\" and \"extreme\".\n\n\n\ntamalero - Wednesday, June 24, 2020 - link\nGT, ULTRA, DELUXE, GOLD, PLATINUM, XT\n\n\n\nByte - Thursday, June 25, 2020 - link\nMillenium, XP, Vista 8.1\n\n\n\nclose - Thursday, June 25, 2020 - link\nHalf of your examples make no sense, Windows Me was named as such for the anniversary of the millennium. That was the whole point, it makes sense. And 8.1... came after 8, pretty straight forward. Vastly different versions, vastly different names. Windows Vista wasn't just called XP Ultimate.But I would argue that when it comes to operating systems, brands lasting upwards of a decade, it matters a lot less. The brand-name of the OS is intentionally used as such so it's easily recognizable by regular people and not a confusing mess of 12_1_2.35 type versions. And from 7 on (so for over a decade) it's more than clear, 7>8>8.1>10, with 10 having versions clearly based on launch date (1503, 1909, 2004).Now Direct X 12 Ultimate is most definitely not in the same category.\n\n\n\nFlukeLSX - Thursday, June 25, 2020 - link\nlol,  I seriously have never met or talked to anyone in the IT field who referred to windows me in a positive way.\n\n\n\nclose - Thursday, June 25, 2020 - link\nYou still haven't. I was clearly talking about the chosen *name* and the occasion for which it was chosen. I have to ask, if someone did speak highly of Windows Me are you sure you would have understood what they meant? ;)\n\n\n\nNZLion - Friday, June 26, 2020 - link\nIt could be argued that even if Millennium made sense as a name for the successor to Win98, it only got called that because the ball was dropped in renaming NT5 to release it as 2000. Both Windows lineages would have made better sense from a naming perspective if 2K/ME were switched.'95 > '98 > 2000 makes sense. NT, ME, XP are all 2 letter names that would have worked as a set.\n\n\n\neek2121 - Sunday, June 28, 2020 - link\nWindows 2000 represented a huge attempt to unify Win9x compatibility with the NT line. They did a fantastic job as well. I ran it on my desktop for years with little issue. I expect that they were force to cut a release early for continued business support, while they needed extra time to make the additional improvements that went into XP. They renamed XP from a year because quite frankly it would have been confusing to have Windows 2000 and then Windows 2001.Honestly, we need another Windows 2000 right now. A slim, stable, fast Windows-Based OS without any BS.\n\n\n\nMFinn3333 - Friday, June 26, 2020 - link\nIt introduced System Restore to the Windows family.

Is it the new Nvidia Ampere, RTX 3000-series GPUs we've been hearing so little about? Nope. So, is it another Ti or Super card from the existing GeForce range? Nope. It's another GTX 1650. But this time it's a GTX 1650 Ultra. Yeah, another suffix for the outgoing Turing...This is the fourth spin of the 1650 and, with almost the exact same specs as the original GTX 1650, apart from the higher 90W TDP and GDDR6, I'll forgive you for being entirely underwhelmed by this news. But it is interesting, honest, and partly because of that higher TDP.What that 90W TDP highlights is the different GPU Nvidia is jamming into the GTX 1650 Ultra card. Instead of the standard TU116 silicon the Ultra gives you the nominally higher-spec TU106 chip. Slight numerical change aside, that's the GPU the green team originally installed into the RTX 2070, and later the RTX 2060 and RTX 2060 Super, and shows that Nvidia is desperate to get rid of the last vestiges of high-end Turing silicon before the new generation of GPUs rolls out.And that potentially shows that mainstream Turing cards will be the only budget game in GeForce town for a good while yet.This is not an uncommon practice, as Videocardz points out, and generally signals the end of a graphics card generation. Higher-end chips cease to be so necessary when there's something as shiny as the RTX 3080 et al looming large on the horizon. The upcoming Ampere cards are drawing everyone's attention and making it hard to drop $400 on a current-gen GPU which feels like it's going to be superseded super soon.Screen queens(Image credit: Future)Best gaming monitor: pixel-perfect panels for your PC\nBest 4K monitor for gaming: when only high-res will do\nBest 4K TV for gaming: big-screen 4K PC gamingSo Nvidia is chopping ray tracing and CUDA core bits out of the TU106 silicon to make it fit the standard GTX 1650 spec and is shipping it out to its partners to make cards that will still be bought. Lower-end GPUs are generally backfilled when a new generation rolls around, so even though we're expecting Nvidia's Ampere to arrive in GeForce trim this year, I'm guessing that's only going to be the high-end cards, with mainstream GPUs likely to follow in 2021.The 'Ultra' suffix doesn't seem like something Nvidia itself is rolling out for the TU106-powered cards, though it also doesn't just look as though it's something only Galax is using to denote the change in GPU. A Palit listing on the EEC database has NE61650U models, which could well be another line of GTX 1650 Ultra cards.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.You probably won't find the 'Ultra' SKU detailed by Nvidia in its own marketing, and we would also expect there to be little actual difference in baseline gaming performance. But that higher TDP, however, could mean there might be a little more headroom in the chip for overclocking if you want to really push the clocks.But at this low level we're big fans of the GTX 1650 Super, that's still the card we'd recommend if you want 1080p gaming performance on a budget.Today's best Geforce GTX 1650 Super deals52 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 No price informationCheck AmazonWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDave JamesSocial Links NavigationEditor-in-Chief, HardwareDave has been gaming since the days of Zaxxon and Lady Bug on the Colecovision, and code books for the Commodore Vic 20 (Death Race 2000!).

Let me show you how to do that.Installing Nvidia drivers in FedoraI am using\u00a0Fedora 39 in this tutorial, but it should be applicable to other Fedora versions.Step 1Before you do anything else, make sure that your system is up-to-date. You can either use the Software Center or use the following command in the terminal: sudo dnf updateStep 2While Fedora does not ship with the Nvidia driver, you have the option to enable third-party repositories during its installation onboarding steps.If you have not enabled it during setup, you can head to GNOME Software and head to manage the \u201cSoftware Repositories\u201d from the menu to proceed to enable the RPM Fusion repository for NVIDIA drivers.Of course, you can manually\u00a0add the RPMFusion repos to your Fedora system to install more programs like VLC or additional multimedia codecs as well.For that, you can use the following command in the terminal:sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpmStep 3Now you need to determine\u00a0what graphics card (or chip) you have in your Linux system. Pull up the terminal and enter the following command:lspci -vnn | grep VGAVideo Card Lookup in FedoraStep 4To proceed to install the latest NVIDIA graphics driver available in the RPM Fusion repo for the Fedora version you are using, enter the following command in the terminal:sudo dnf install akmod-nvidiaOnce you confirm it by hitting \"y\", it will download the packages and again ask for another confirmation. Approve it to proceed installing.Optionally, you can enable CUDA support for the driver, which lets you check the stats for your NVIDIA card from the terminal using nvidia-smi:The command for it is:sudo dnf install xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-cuda\nStep 5To make the changes take effect, reboot your system and login.Fedora with Nvidia driversFor Legacy Graphics CardYou can look up what driver corresponds to a specific chip. You can find a list of the Nvidia chips\u00a0here. Furthermore, you can also use\u00a0this tool\u00a0to search for your device.\ud83d\udccbKeep in mind that there are only three drivers available to install, even though the Nvidia list shows more. Old devices are supported by the nvidia-390 and nvidia-340 drivers.To install the required driver, enter one of the commands into the terminal. The following command is the one I had to use for my card. Update as appropriate for your system.sudo dnf install akmod-nvidia sudo dnf install xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-390xx akmod-nvidia-390xx sudo dnf install xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-340xx akmod-nvidia-340xxNvidia terminal installationBonus TipThis is an optional step but it is recommended. When you add the RPMFusion repos, you get access to multimedia packages that are not available in the regular repos.This command will install packages for applications that use\u00a0gstreamer:sudo dnf groupupdate multimedia --setop=\"install_weak_deps=False\" --exclude=PackageKit-gstreamer-pluginThis command will install packages needed by sound and video packages:sudo dnf groupupdate sound-and-videoHopefully, you find this tutorial useful in installing Nvidia drivers on Fedora.

It uses deep learning to empower medical professionals, including those without prior ultrasound experience, to perform echocardiograms quickly and accurately.\nThe results are images of the heart often worthy of an expert sonographer that help doctors diagnose and treat critically ill patients.\nThe coronavirus pandemic provided plenty of opportunities to try out the first dozen systems. Two doctors who used the new tool shared their stories on the condition that their patients remain anonymous.\nIn March, a 53-year-old diabetic woman with COVID-19 went into cardiac shock in a New York hospital. Without the images from Caption AI, it would have been difficult to clinch the diagnosis, said a doctor on the scene.\nThe system helped the physician identify heart problems in an 86-year-old man with the virus in the same hospital, helping doctors bring him back to health. It was another case among more than 200 in the facility that was effectively turned into a COVID-19 hospital this spring.\nThe Caption Health system made a tremendous impact for a staff spread thin, said the doctor. It would have been hard for a trained sonographer to keep up with the demand for heart exams, he added.\nHeart Test Becomes Standard Procedure\nCaption AI helped doctors in North Carolina determine that a 62-year-old man had COVID-19-related heart damage. Thanks, in part, to the ease of using the system, the hospital now performs echocardiograms for most patients with the virus.\nAt the height of the pandemic\u2019s first wave, the hospital stationed ultrasound systems with Caption AI in COVID-19 wards. Rather than sending sonographers from unit to unit, which is the usual practice, staff stationed at the wards used the systems. The change reduced staff exposure to the virus and conserved precious protective gear.\nBeyond the pandemic, the system will help hospitals provide urgent services while keeping a lid on rising costs, said a doctor at that hospital.\n\u201cAI-enabled machines will be the next big wave in taking care of patients wherever they are,\u201d said Randy Martin, chief medical officer of Caption Health and emeritus professor of cardiology at Emory University, in Atlanta.\nMartin joined the startup about four years ago after meeting its founders, who shared expertise and passion for medicine and AI. Today their software \u201ctakes a user through 10 standard views of the heart, coaching them through some 90 fine movements experts make,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t intend to replace sonographers; we\u2019re just expanding the use of portable ultrasound systems to the periphery for more early detection,\u201d he added.\nCoping with Unexpected Demand Spike\nIn the early days of the pandemic, that expansion couldn\u2019t come fast enough.\nIn late March, the startup exhausted supplies that included NVIDIA Quadro P3000 GPUs that ran its AI software. In the early days of the global shutdown, the startup reached out to its supply chain.\n\u201cWe are experiencing overwhelming demand for our product,\u201d the company\u2019s CEO wrote, after placing orders for 100 GPUs with a distributor.\nCaption Health has systems currently in use at 11 hospitals. It expects to deploy Caption AI at several additional sites in the coming weeks.\nGPUs at the Heart of Automated Heart Tests\nThe startup currently integrates its software in a portable ultrasound from Terason. It intends to partner with more ultrasound makers in the future. And it advises partners to embed GPUs in their future ultrasound equipment.\nThe Quadro P3000 in Caption AI runs real-time inference tasks using deep convolutional neural networks. They provide operators guidance in positioning a probe that captures images. Then they automatically choose the highest-quality heart images and interpret them to help doctors make informed decisions.\nThe NVIDIA GPU also freed up four CPU cores, making space to process other tasks on the system, such as providing a smooth user experience.\nThe startup trained its AI models on a database of 1 million echocardiograms from clinical partners. An early study in partnership with Northwestern Medicine and the Minneapolis Heart Institute showed Caption AI helped eight registered nurses with no prior ultrasound experience capture highly accurate images on a wide variety of patients.\nInception Program Gives Startup Momentum\nCaption Heath, formerly called Bay Labs, was founded in 2015 in Brisbane, Calif. It received a $125,000 prize at a 2017 GTC competition for members of NVIDIA\u2019s Inception program, which gives startups access to technology, expertise and markets.\n\u201cBeing part of the Inception program has provided us with increased recognition in the field of deep learning, a platform to share our AI innovations with healthcare and deep learning communities, and phenomenal support getting NVIDIA GPUs into our supply chain so we could deliver Caption AI,\u201d said Charles Cadieu, co-founder and president of Caption Health.\nNow that its tool has been tested in a pandemic, Caption Health looks forward to opportunities to help save lives across many ailments. The company aims to ride a trend toward more portable systems that extend availability and lower costs of diagnostic imaging.\n\u201cWe hope to see our technology used everywhere from big hospitals to rural villages to examine people for a wide range of medical conditions,\u201d said Cadieu.\nTo learn more about Caption Health and other companies like it, watch this webinar on healthcare startups working against COVID-19 and stay up to date with the latest healthcare news from NVIDIA.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | COVID-19 | Embedded Computing | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | Machine Learning | Quadro | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Ross23 Jun 20203 min read\n        NVIDIA's Orin is a system-on-a-chip (SoC), which consists of 17 billion transistors and delivers 200 trillion operations per second.\n    \n        Image: NVIDIA\n    The idea of tomorrow's car as\u00a0a computer on wheels is ripening apace. Today, Daimler and Nvidia announced that Daimler\u2019s carmaking arm, Mercedes-Benz, will drop Nvidia's newest\u00a0computerized driving system into every car\u00a0it sells, beginning in\u00a02024.The system, called the Drive\u00a0AGX Orin, is a system-on-a-chip that was announced in December and is planned to ship in 2022. It\u2019s an open system, but as adapted for Mercedes, it will be\u00a0laden with\u00a0specially designed software. The result, say the\u00a0two companies, will be\u00a0a\u00a0software-defined car:\u00a0\u00a0Customers will buy a car, then periodically download new features, among them some that were not known at the time of purchase. This capability will be enhanced by using software instead of dedicated hardware\u00a0in the form of a constellation of electronic control units, or ECUs.\u201cIn modern cars, there can be 100, up to 125, ECUs,\u201d said Danny Shapiro, Nvidia\u2019s senior director of automotive. \u201cMany of those will be replaced by software\u00a0apps. That will change how different things function in the car\u2014from windshield wipers to door locks to performance mode.\u201dThe plan is to give cars a degree of self-driving competence comparable to Level 2\u00a0 (where the car assists the driver) and Level 3 (where the driver can do other things as the car drives itself, while remaining ready to take back the wheel). The ability to park itself will be Level 4 (where there\u2019s no need to mind the car at all, so long as it\u2019s operating in a predefined comfort zone).In all these matters, the Nvidia-Daimler partnership is following a trail that\u00a0Tesla blazed and others have followed. Volkswagen plainly emulated Tesla in a project that is just now yielding its first fruit:\u00a0an all-electric car that will employ a single master electronic architecture that will eventually power\u00a0all of VW\u2019s electric and self-driving cars. The\u00a0rollout was slightly delayed because of\u00a0glitches in\u00a0software, as\u00a0we reported last week.\u00a0Asked whether Daimler\u00a0would hire a horde of software experts, as\u00a0Volkwagen is doing,\u00a0and thus become\u00a0something of a software company, Bernhard Wardin, spokesman for Daimler\u2019s autonomous driving and artificial intelligence division, said he had no comment. (Sounds like a \u201cyes.\u201d) He added that though a car model had been selected for the debut of the new system,\u00a0its name was still under wraps.One thing that strikes the eye is the considerable muscle of the system. The AGX Orin\u00a0has 17 billion transistors, incorporating\u00a0what Nvidia says are new deep learning and computer vision accelerators that\u00a0\u201cdeliver 200 trillion operations per second\u2014nearly 7 times the performance of Nvidia\u2019s previous generation Xavier SoC.\u201d\u00a0It\u2019s interesting to note that the Xavier itself began to ship\u00a0only last year, after being\u00a0announced toward the end of 2016. On its first big publicity tour, at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show, the Xavier was touted by\u00a0Jen-Hsun Huang, the CEO of\u00a0Nvidia. He spoke together with the head of Audi, which was going to use the Xavier in a \u201cLevel 4\u201d car that was supposed to hit the road in three years. Yes, that would be\u00a0now.So, a chip 7 times more powerful, with far more advanced AI software, is now positioned to power a car with mere Level 2/3 capabilities\u2014in 2024.None of this is meant\u00a0to single out\u00a0Nvidia or Daimler for ridicule. It\u2019s meant to ridicule\u00a0the entire industry, both the tech people and the car people, who have been busy walking\u00a0back expectations for self-driving for the past two years. And to ridicule us tech journalists, who have been backtracking right alongside them.Cars that help the driver do the driving are here already. More help is on the way. Progress is real. But the future is still in the future: Robocar tech is harder than we thought.self drivingcreditsnvidiaprocessorsmercedes-benzdaimlerPhilip E. RossPhilip E. Ross is a senior editor at IEEE Spectrum.

Hardware Leaks, run by Twitter leakster RoGame, asserts that he unearthed an Nvidia Ampere gaming card in the 3DMark databases and its performance is pretty impressive - over 30 per cent faster in the DirectX 12 benchmark than a stock Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Founders Edition.\n\nAs per usual for a pre-release graphics card, 3DMark's reporting of its specs are a bit skew-whiff. While the vendor (Nvidia) and GPU boost clock (1,935MHz) will likely be reliable, the memory clock of 6.0GHz, doesn't fit into line with any memory type currently out there. RoGame says that in his experience such odd numbers come from pre-release drivers and/or a new type of memory subsystem in use.\n\nAbove you can see a useful 3DMark Time Spy benchmark result comparison chart which puts the mystery Nvidia CPU into perspective. Given the relatively low-ish reported GPU boost speed the result is impressive. If this is a Founders Edition under test you can see an 30+ per cent uplift in DX12 gaming-type performance at this pre-release stage.\nRoGame says he is \"100 per cent\" sure that the 3DMark Time Spy result he discovered and represented in the chart is authentic. It was a 'private result', a run completed by an Nvidia employee - but of course he doesn't want to disclose the employee name in case of repercussions.\n\nOther recent Twitter leaks and gossip firm up the theory that Nvidia is testing three GA102 GPU-powered graphics card variants as follows:\n\n2nd Gen TITAN RTX: GA102-400-A1, 5376 CUDA, 24GB GDDR6X, 17Gbps, 384bit, 816GB/s\nRTX 3090: GA102-300-A1, 5248 CUDA, 12GB GDDR6X, 21Gbps, 384bit, 1008GB/s\nRTX 3080: GA102-200-Kx-A1, 4352 CUDA, 10GB GDDR6X, 19Gbps, 320bit, 760GB/s\n\nRemember to take the above rumours and leaks with a pinch of salt. I'm sure there will be plenty more spills on the path to the first Ampere-based GeForce official product reveal which could be as soon as 2 or 3 months from now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 17 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

On the other hand, if this is a 2080 (super, non-ti) replacement, then maybe.\n            \n            \n            \n\n\n\n\n                    Posted by deleted - Mon 22 Jun 2020 13:39\n                \n\n\n\n\n            well if a athlete improved 30% year over year, that would be helluva impressive.So i do think keeping this jump are still a feat though it is only electrons doing the running, and as seen elsewhere in computer hardware it is not a feat anyone can pull off year after year.Even if i dont need it, then if AMD do a trade in of old GFX cards for new ones, and the new ones are in a similar price range as my 5700XT but 30% better, then i would consider this even if then i will have a full cover head for the 5700XT to sell.\n            \n            \n            \n\n\n\n\n                    Posted by deleted - Mon 22 Jun 2020 14:02\n                \n\n\n\n\n            That would be a 30% compounding uplift which is tasty from my 1080ti. But probably around the \u00a31,500 mark.

Today, we released a new NVIDIA Studio Driver that provides the best performance and reliability for content creators working with these new app and OS updates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectX 12 Ultimate Defines Next Generation 3D Graphics\nIn 2018, NVIDIA RTX graphics cards launched with numerous \u201cworld\u2019s first\u201d graphics technologies: hardware-accelerated ray tracing, variable rate shading, mesh shading and more.\nThese technologies represent the biggest leap in graphics since the invention of programmable shaders in 2002, bringing real-time, cinema-quality reflections, shadows, and lighting to both games and 3D content creation tools.\nMicrosoft recently began rolling out the DirectX 12 Ultimate graphics API alongside the Windows 10 Version 2004 update, codifying NVIDIA RTX\u2019s innovative technologies as the standard for multi-platform, next-generation 3D graphics.\nWith the new NVIDIA Studio Driver, DirectX 12 Ultimate is fully supported on RTX GPUs running Windows 10 operating systems using version 2004 or newer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further details on the ray tracing, variable rate shading, mesh shading and sampler feedback technologies in DirectX 12 Ultimate, head on over to this in-depth article.\nThe Studio driver also brings support for another new capability in Windows 10 Version 2004 update \u2014 hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling. This feature lets the GPU directly manage its video memory, enabling improved performance and lower latency in certain 3D and video applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX-Accelerated Creative Apps\nThe new Studio driver is validated against the latest GPU-accelerated creative app releases including Chaos V-Ray 5, Corel Painter 2021, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Substance Alchemist and Blender Cycles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChaos V-Ray 5\nChaos Group just released V-Ray 5 for Autodesk 3ds Max, with support for out-of-core geometry for rendering using NVIDIA CUDA to improve performance for artists and designers working with large scenes that aren\u2019t able to fit into the GPU\u2019s memory \u2014 and a host of new GPU-accelerated features for lighting, materials and color management that include:\n\nLightMix - to freely experiment with lighting changes after you render, save out permutations, and push back improvements you\u2019d like to have in your scene.\nLight Path Expressions - to make customer render elements using the physical behavior of light.\nSun & Sky model - for adding the subtleties of twilight when the sun is near the horizon.\nLayer Compositing - to fine-tune and finish your images directly in the V-Ray frame buffer \u2014 without the need for a separate post-processing app.\nExpanded Materials - including Coat and Sheen layers in V-Ray Material, multiple texture randomizing options, and new V-Ray Dirt weathering abilities.\nACEScg support - for the most demanding color management needs.\n\nV-Ray GPU 5 adds a number of features that were previously only available on the CPU-only version, including 2D Displacement, OSL patterns, Phoenix Particle Shader, tyFlow support, improved shadow catching, and IBL ground projection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorel Painter 2021\nThe newly released Corel Painter 2021 brings a whole suite of updates to artists including double the number of GPU-accelerated brush engines than in Painter 2020. Corel Painter is now up to 15x faster on a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti than a desktop CPU, allowing you to paint with smooth stutter-free brushes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdobe Premiere Pro\nWith the new Adobe Premiere Pro 14.2 update, video creators gain massive time-savings with new GPU-accelerated encoding. Adobe and NVIDIA have optimized Premiere Pro for the built-in NVIDIA hardware encoder on NVIDIA Quadro and GeForce GPUs with staggering results. Editors can now export high-resolution videos up to 5x faster when using popular H.264 or H.265 / HEVC codecs. Less time exporting means more time for editing content and quicker turnarounds on projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdobe Substance Alchemist\nSubstance Alchemist, Adobe\u2019s newest material creation tool, received a recent AI upgrade. Their Image to Material feature allows artists to capture a photo of real-world surfaces and create textures for 3D that can be used in content creation. When run on NVIDIA RTX GPUs, the tool leverages an AI algorithm that recognizes shapes and objects in a photograph. It automatically generates a higher quality, accurate texture map that includes base color, height and normal, allowing artists to focus on creativity instead of time-consuming map refinement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlender Cycles\nReleased earlier this month, Blender 2.83 gives artists the power of AI when denoising \u2014 a process that predicts final images from partially rendered results \u2014 while they\u2019re designing in the viewport. This allows users to explore new ideas and quickly iterate on design choices with full confidence in how it will turn out. It\u2019s one of many recent game-changing advancements in Blender that RTX acceleration brings to 3D artists and designers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven More Performance\nTested across RTX GPUs running Windows 19H2, the latest driver provides up to 18% increase in creative performance. A few examples can be seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew RTX Studio Laptops Available Now\nLooking for a laptop that can handle the latest RTX-accelerated creative apps? There are some great new options available:\nDell XPS 17 was designed to handle intensive creative projects, gaming and VR with up to GeForce RTX 2060 graphics. Packing this much performance into an RTX Studio laptop of this size required engineering ingenuity to keep the system running smoothly. Under the hood is a brand new proprietary thermal design that provides more overall airflow and higher sustained performance to fuel the most demanding projects. It\u2019s also accelerated by NVIDIA Studio Drivers and features up to 19 hours of battery life.\nHP recently released the ENVY 15 RTX Studio laptop that can be configured with up to a GeForce RTX 2060 GPU for the ultimate in creator performance featuring an all-aluminum chassis with 82.8 percent screen-to-body ratio, up to a 4K OLED VESA DisplayHDR 400 True Black display with touch interface display, 10th gen Intel processors, and gaming-class thermals.\nCheck out the full catalog of RTX Studio laptops here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay Up-to-Date with NVIDIA Studio\nTo get the latest performance optimizations and support for the new July creative app updates, download the new Studio Driver (release 451.48) today through GeForce Experience or from the driver download page.

TOP500 Speeds Up, Saves Energy with NVIDIA\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA accelerates eight of the 10 fastest supercomputers. NVIDIA Selene debuts as the fastest industrial system in the U.S. with leading energy efficiency.\t\t\t\n\n\nJune 22, 2020 by Dion Harris \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  The new ranking of the TOP500 supercomputers paints a picture of modern scientific computing, expanded with AI and data analytics, and accelerated with NVIDIA technologies.\nEight of the world\u2019s top 10 supercomputers now use NVIDIA GPUs, InfiniBand networking or both. They include the most powerful systems in the U.S., Europe and China.\nNVIDIA, now combined with Mellanox, powers two-thirds (333) of the overall TOP500 systems on the latest list, up dramatically from less than half (203) for the two separate companies combined on the June 2017 list.\nNearly three-quarters (73 percent) of the new InfiniBand systems on the list adopted NVIDIA Mellanox HDR 200G InfiniBand, demonstrating the rapid embrace of the latest data rates for smart interconnects.\nThe number of TOP500 systems using HDR InfiniBand nearly doubled since the November 2019 list. Overall, InfiniBand appears in 141 supercomputers on the list, up 12 percent since June 2019.\nA rising number of TOP500 systems are adopting NVIDIA GPUs, its Mellanox networking or both.\nNVIDIA Mellanox InfiniBand and Ethernet networks connect 305 systems (61 percent) of the TOP500 supercomputers, including all of the 141 InfiniBand systems, and 164 (63 percent) of the systems using Ethernet.\nIn energy efficiency, the systems using NVIDIA GPUs are pulling away from the pack. On average, they\u2019re now 2.8x more power-efficient than systems without NVIDIA GPUs, measured in gigaflops/watt.\nThat\u2019s one reason why NVIDIA GPUs are now used by 20 of the top 25 supercomputers on the Green500 list.\nThe best example of this power efficiency is Selene (pictured above), the latest addition to NVIDIA\u2019s internal research cluster. The system was No. 2 on the latest Green500 list and No. 7 on the overall TOP500 at 27.5 petaflops on the Linpack benchmark.\nAt 20.5 gigaflops/watt, Selene is within a fraction of a point from the top spot on the Green500 list, claimed by a much smaller system that ranked No. 394 by performance.\nSelene is the only top 100 system to crack the 20 gigaflops/watt barrier. It\u2019s also the second most powerful industrial supercomputer in the world behind the No. 6 system from energy giant Eni S.p.A. of Italy, which also uses NVIDIA GPUs.\nNVIDIA GPUs are powering gains in energy efficiency for the TOP500 supercomputers.\nIn energy use, Selene is 6.8x more efficient than the average TOP500 system not using NVIDIA GPUs. Selene\u2019s performance and energy efficiency are thanks to third-generation Tensor Cores in NVIDIA A100 GPUs that speed up both traditional 64-bit math for simulations and lower precision work for AI.\nSelene\u2019s rankings are an impressive feat for a system that took less than four weeks to build. Engineers were able to assemble Selene quickly because they used NVIDIA\u2019s modular reference architecture.\nThe guide defines what NVIDIA calls a DGX SuperPOD. It\u2019s based on a powerful, yet flexible building block for modern data centers: the NVIDIA DGX A100 system.\nThe DGX A100 is an agile system, available today, that packs eight A100 GPUs in a 6U server with NVIDIA Mellanox HDR InfiniBand networking. It was created to accelerate a rich mix of high performance computing, data analytics and AI jobs \u2014 including training and inference \u2014 and to be fast to deploy.\nScaling from Systems to SuperPODs\nWith the reference design, any organization can quickly set up a world-class computing cluster. It shows how 20 DGX A100 systems can be linked in Lego-like fashion using high-performance NVIDIA Mellanox InfiniBand switches.\nInfiniBand now accelerates seven of the top 10 supercomputers, including the most powerful systems in China, Europe and the U.S.\nFour operators can rack a 20-system DGX A100 cluster in as little as an hour, creating a 2-petaflops system powerful enough to appear on the TOP500 list. Such systems are designed to run comfortably within the power and thermal capabilities of standard data centers.\nBy adding an additional layer of NVIDIA Mellanox InfiniBand switches, engineers linked 14 of these 20-system units to create Selene, which sports:\n\n280 DGX A100 systems\n2,240 NVIDIA A100 GPUs\n494 NVIDIA Mellanox Quantum 200G InfiniBand switches\n56 TB/s network fabric\n7PB of high-performance all-flash storage\n\nOne of Selene\u2019s most significant specs is it can deliver more than 1 exaflops of AI performance.\nThese results are critical at a time when AI and analytics are becoming part of the new requirements for scientific computing.\nAround the world, researchers are using deep learning and data analytics to predict the most fruitful areas for conducting experiments. The approach reduces the number of costly and time-consuming experiments researchers require, accelerating scientific results.\nFor example, six systems not yet on the TOP500 list are being built today with the A100 GPUs NVIDIA launched last month. They\u2019ll accelerate a blend of HPC and AI that\u2019s defining a new era in science.\nTOP500 Expands Canvas for Scientific Computing\nOne of those systems is at Argonne National Laboratory, where researchers will use a cluster of 24 NVIDIA DGX A100 systems to scan billions of drugs in the search for treatments for COVID-19.\n\u201cMuch of this work is hard to simulate on a computer, so we use AI to intelligently guide where and when we will sample next,\u201d said Arvind Ramanathan, a computational biologist at Argonne, in a report on the first users of A100 GPUs.\nAI, data analytics and edge streaming are redefining scientific computing.\nFor its part, NERSC (the U.S. National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center) is embracing AI for several projects targeting Perlmutter, its pre-exascale system packing 6,200 A100 GPUs.\nFor example, one project will use reinforcement learning to control light source experiments, and one will apply generative models to reproduce expensive simulations at high-energy physics detectors.\nResearchers in Munich are training natural-language models on 6,000 GPUs on the Summit supercomputer to speed the analysis of coronavirus proteins. It\u2019s another sign that leading TOP500 systems are extending beyond traditional simulations run with double-precision math.\nAs scientists expand into deep learning and analytics, they\u2019re also tapping into cloud computing services and even streaming data from remote instruments at the edge of the network. Together these elements form four pillars of modern scientific computing that NVIDIA accelerates:\n\nSimulation: In the fight against COVID-19, researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory are simulating over 2 billion compounds in 24 hours, running AutoDock on GPUs on the Summit supercomputer.\nAI and data analytics: GPU acceleration for Spark 3.0 now delivers speedups for the critical and time-consuming front-end of the machine-learning pipeline.\nScientific edge streaming: CERN recently announced that NVIDIA GPUs will enable a 500x reduction in the huge amounts of data produced by particle collision events within its Large Hadron Collider.\nVisualization: NVIDIA\u2019s IndeX and Magnum IO software help power a visualization of the Mars Lander, the world\u2019s largest interactive, real-time volumetric visualization.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a broader trend where both researchers and enterprises are seeking acceleration for AI and analytics from the cloud to the network\u2019s edge. That\u2019s why the world\u2019s largest cloud service providers along with the world\u2019s top OEMs are adopting NVIDIA GPUs.\nIn this way, the latest TOP500 list reflects NVIDIA\u2019s efforts to democratize AI and HPC. Any company that wants to build leadership computing capabilities can access NVIDIA technologies such as DGX systems that power the world\u2019s most powerful systems.\nFinally, NVIDIA congratulates the engineers behind the Fugaku supercomputer in Japan for taking the No. 1 spot, showing Arm is becoming more real and now a viable option in high performance computing. That\u2019s one reason why NVIDIA announced a year ago it\u2019s making its CUDA accelerated computing software available on the Arm processor architecture.\nEditor\u2019s note: This post has been updated to remove a reference to a preliminary benchmark.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Networking | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | Data Science | Energy | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | NVIDIA A100 | NVIDIA DGX | Science \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This acceleration is built using our domain-specific CUDA-X libraries for data analytics such as cuDF, cuML and cuGRAPH, along with I/O acceleration technologies from Magnum IO.\nThese libraries contain millions of lines of code and provide seamless acceleration to developers and users, whether they\u2019re creating applications on the desktops accelerated with our GPUs or running them in data centers, in edge computers, in supercomputers, or in the cloud.\nSimilarly, we accelerate over 700 HPC applications, including all the most widely used scientific applications.\nNVIDIA accelerates all frameworks for AI, which has become crucial for tasks where the information is incomplete \u2014 where there are no first principles to work with or the first principle-based approaches are too slow.\nAnd, thanks to our roots in visual computing, NVIDIA provides accelerated visualization solutions, so terabytes of data can be visualized.\nNASA, for instance, used our acceleration stack to visualize the landing of the first manned mission to Mars, in what is the world\u2019s largest real-time, interactive volumetric visualization (150TB).\nOur deep domain libraries also provide a seamless performance boost to scientific computing users on their applications across the different generations of our architecture. Going from Volta to Ampere, for instance.\nNVIDIA\u2019s also making all our new and improved GPU-optimized scientific computing applications available through NGC for researchers to accelerate their time to insight\nTogether, all of these pillars of scientific computing \u2014 simulation, AI and data analytics , edge streaming and visualization workflows \u2014 are key to tackling the challenges of today, and tomorrow.\nStay up to date with the latest healthcare news from NVIDIA.\n\n\nCategories: Accelerated Analytics | Cloud | Data Center | Deep Learning | Networking | Software | SupercomputingTags: COVID-19 | Data Science | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Science \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But another technology has transformed the task of forecasting and simulating the weather: supercomputing.\nWeather and climate models are both compute and data intensive. Forecast quality depends on model complexity and high resolution. Resolution depends on the performance of supercomputers. And supercomputer performance depends on interconnect technology to move data quickly, effectively and in a scalable manner across compute resources.\nThat\u2019s why many of the world\u2019s leading meteorological services have chosen NVIDIA Mellanox InfiniBand networking to accelerate their supercomputing platforms, including the Spanish Meteorological Agency, the China Meteorological Administration, the Finnish Meteorological Institute, NASA and the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute\u200b.\n\nThe technological advantages of InfiniBand have made it the de facto standard for climate research and weather forecasting applications, delivering higher performance, scalability and resiliency versus any other interconnect technologies.\nThe Beijing Meteorological Service has selected 200 Gigabit HDR InfiniBand interconnect technology to accelerate its new supercomputing platform, which will be used for enhancing weather forecasting, improving climate and environmental research, and serving the weather forecasting information needs of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.\nMeteo France, the French national meteorological service, has selected HDR InfiniBand to accelerate its two new large-scale supercomputers. The agency provides weather forecasting services for companies in transport, agriculture, energy and many other industries, as well as for a large number of media channels and worldwide sporting and cultural events. One of the systems debuted on the TOP500 list, out this month.\n\u201cWe have been using InfiniBand for many years to connect our supercomputing platforms in the most efficient and scalable way, enabling us to conduct high-performance weather research and forecasting simulations,\u201d said Alain Beuraud, HPC project manager at Meteo France. \u201cWe are excited to leverage the HDR InfiniBand technology advantages, its In-Network Computing acceleration engines, extremely low latency, and advanced routing capabilities to power our next supercomputing platforms.\u201d\nHDR InfiniBand will also accelerate the new supercomputer for the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Being deployed this year, the system will support weather forecasting and prediction researchers from over 30 countries across Europe. It will increase the center\u2019s weather and climate research compute power by 5x, making it one of the world\u2019s most powerful meteorological supercomputers.\nThe new platform will enable running nearly twice as many higher-resolution probabilistic weather forecasts in less than an hour, improving the ability to monitor and predict increasingly severe weather phenomena and enabling European countries to better protect lives and property.\n\u201cWe require the best supercomputing power and the best technologies available for our numerical weather prediction activities,\u201d said Florence Rabier, director general at ECMWF. \u201cWith our new supercomputing capabilities, we will be able to run higher resolution forecasts in under an hour and enable much improved weather forecasts.\u201d\n\u201cAs governments and society continue to grapple with the impacts of increasingly severe weather, we are also proud to be relying on a supercomputer designed to maximize energy efficiency,\u201d he added.\nThe NVIDIA Mellanox networking technology team has also been working with the German Climate Computing Centre on optimizing performance of the ICON application, the first project in a multi-phase collaboration. ICON is a unified weather forecasting and climate model, jointly developed by the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Meteorologie and Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD), the German National Meteorological Service.\nBy optimizing the application\u2019s data exchange modules to take advantage of InfiniBand, the team has demonstrated a nearly 20 percent increase in overall application performance.\nThe design of InfiniBand rests on four fundamentals: a smart endpoint design that can run all network engines; a software-defined switch network designed for scale; centralized management that lets the network be controlled and operated from a single place; and standard technology, ensuring forward and backward compatibility, with support for open source technology and open APIs.\nIt\u2019s these fundamentals that help InfiniBand provide the highest network performance, extremely low latency and high message rate. As the only 200Gb/s high-speed interconnect in the market today, InfiniBand delivers the highest network efficiency with advanced end-to-end adaptive routing, congestion control and quality of service.\nThe forecast calls for more world-leading weather and climate agencies to announce their new supercomputing platforms this year using HDR InfiniBand. In the meantime, learn more about NVIDIA Mellanox InfiniBand HPC technology.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Networking | SupercomputingTags: Public Sector | Science | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The company uses NVIDIA GPUs to generate and evaluate petabytes of data to accelerate drug discovery, which is a dramatic improvement over the traditional process of slow and expensive lab work.\nThe company works with all 20 of the biggest biopharma companies in the world, several of which have standardized on Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s platform as a key component of preclinical research.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for a more efficient and effective drug discovery process. To that end, the company has joined the global COVID R&D alliance to offer resources and collaborate. Recently, Google Cloud has also thrown its weight behind this alliance, donating over 16 million hours of NVIDIA GPU time to hunt for a cure.\n\u201cWe hope to develop an antiviral therapeutic for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in time to have treatments available for future waves of the pandemic,\u201d Lorton said.\nAdvanced Simulation Software\nThe pharmaceutical industry has long depended on manually intensive physical processes to find new therapeutics. This allowed it to develop many important remedies over the last 50 years, but only through a laborious trial-and-error approach, Lorton said.\nHe makes the comparison to airplane manufacturers, which formerly carved airplane designs out of balsa wood and tested their drag coefficient in wind tunnels. They now rely on advanced simulation software that reduces the time and resources needed to test designs.\nWith the pharmaceutical industry traditionally using the equivalent of balsa, Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s drug discovery platform has become a game changer.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make preclinical drug discovery more efficient,\u201d said Lorton. \u201cThis will enable the industry to treat more diseases and help more conditions.\u201d\nExploring New Space\nFor more than a decade, every major pharmaceutical company has been using Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s software, which can perform physics simulations down to the atomic level. For each potential drug candidate, Schr\u00f6dinger uses recently developed physics-based computational approaches to calculate as many as 3,000 possible compounds. This requires up to 12,000 GPU hours on high-performance computers.\nOnce the physics-based calculations are completed for the original set of randomly selected compounds, a layer of active learning is applied, making projections on the probable efficacy of a billion molecules.\nLorton said it currently takes four or five iterations to get a machine-learning algorithm accurate enough to be predictive, though even these projections are always double-checked with the physics-based methods before synthesizing any molecules in the lab.\nThis software-based approach yields much faster results, but that\u2019s only part of the value. It also greatly expands the scope of analysis, evaluating data that human beings never would have had time to address.\n\u201cThe thing that is most compelling is exploring new space,\u201d said Lorton. \u201cIt\u2019s not just being cheaper. It\u2019s being cheaper and finding things you would have otherwise not explored.\u201d\nFor that reason, Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s work focuses on modeling and simulation, and using the latest high performance computing resources to expand its discovery capabilities.\nBayer Proving Platform\u2019s Value\nOne customer that\u2019s been putting Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s technology to use is Bayer AG. Schr\u00f6dinger software has been helping Bayer scientists find lead structures for several drug discovery projects, ultimately contributing to clinical development candidates.\nRecently both companies agreed to co-develop a novel drug discovery platform to accelerate the process of estimating the binding affinity, as well as other properties, and synthesizability of small molecules.\nBayer can\u2019t yet share any specific results that the platform has delivered, but Dr. Alexander Hillisch, the company\u2019s head of computational drug design, said it\u2019s had an impact on several active projects.\nDr. Hillisch said that the software is expected to speed up work and effectively widen Bayer\u2019s drug-discovery capabilities. As a result, he believes it\u2019s time for NVIDIA GPUs to get a lot more recognition within the industry.\nIn a typical drug discovery project, Bayer evaluates binding affinities and other properties of molecules such as absorption and metabolic stability. With Schr\u00f6dinger software and NVIDIA GPUs, \u201cwe\u2019re enumerating millions to billions of virtual compounds and are thus scanning the chemical space much more broadly than we did before, in order to identify novel lead compounds with favorable properties,\u201d he said.\nDr. Hillisch also suggested that the impact of holistic digital drug discovery approaches can soon be judged. \u201cWe expect to know how substantial the impact of this scientific approach will be in the near future,\u201d he said.\nThe drug design platform also will be part of Bayer\u2019s work on COVID-19. The company spun off its antiviral research into a separate company in 2006, but it recently joined a European coronavirus research initiative to help identify novel compounds that could provide future treatment.\nTailor-Made Task for GPUs\nGiven the scope of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s task, Lorton made it clear that NVIDIA\u2019s advances in developing a full-stack computing platform for HPC and AI that pushes the boundaries of performance have been as important to his company\u2019s accomplishments as its painstaking algorithmic and scientific work.\n\u201cIt could take thousands, or tens of thousands, or in some crazy case, even hundreds of thousands of dollars to synthesize and get the binding affinity of a drug molecule,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can do it for a few dollars of compute costs on a GPU.\u201d\nLorton said that if the company had started one of its physics calculations on a single CPU when it was founded in 1990, it would have taken until today to reach the conclusions that a single GPU can now deliver in less than an hour.\nEven with the many breakthroughs in compute speed on NVIDIA GPUs, Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s discovery projects require thousands of NVIDIA T4 and V100 Tensor Core GPUs every day, both on premises and on the Google Cloud Platform. It\u2019s this next level of compute, combined with continued investment in the underlying science, that the company hopes will change the way all drug discovery is done.\nStay up to date with the latest healthcare news from NVIDIA.\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Data Center | SoftwareTags: COVID-19 | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

On November 19th, the Polish studio is releasing their new game, Cyberpunk 2077, which as one of the year\u2019s most anticipated titles needs little introduction \u2013 you\u2019re V, a mercenary in an open world sci-fi megalopolis, and how you look and experience the action-adventure-RPG is up to you.\nIn addition to featuring CDPR\u2019s fantastic open-ended gameplay, Cyberpunk 2077 is also blessed with jaw-droppingly beautiful, cutting-edge graphics with unprecedented levels of detail, and stunning sights. And on PC, things will look even better thanks to a NVIDIA \u2013 CD PROJEKT RED technical partnership that\u2019s bringing four immersive ray-traced effects to the game, along with performance-enhancing NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 tech, and the ability to play Cyberpunk 2077 from the day of its release on GeForce NOW.\nTo learn more, and to see a brand new ray-traced trailer and screenshots from Cyberpunk 2077, keep reading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX-Powered Ray Tracing\nLast year, we announced the inclusion of ray tracing in Cyberpunk 2077, and shared some amazing in-game screens with the tech enabled. Now, there will be four ray-traced effects in the game, further improving image quality, realism, and immersion.\nRay-Traced Diffuse Illumination - This captures sky radiance as well as emissive lighting from various surfaces, which is difficult to achieve with traditional rendering techniques. When enabled, billboards and other illuminated surfaces and objects will brighten their surroundings with naturally colored lighting, and the sun and moon will realistically illuminate Night City.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Reflections - In Cyberpunk 2077, ray-traced reflections are used on all surfaces and can trace ranges for up to several kilometers, enabling realistic reflections across vast view distances. They are present on both opaque and transparent objects and surfaces to simulate the way light reflects from glossy and metal surfaces by tracing a single bounce of reflection rays against the scene.\nUnlike screen space techniques that only reflect what\u2019s on screen, ray-traced reflections incorporate the entire scene around the character and can accurately represent objects outside the camera view or facing away from the camera. In addition, ray-traced reflections have vastly improved fidelity, and don\u2019t suffer from other immersion-harming image quality artifacts and issues seen when using screen space techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Ambient Occlusion - Ambient occlusion is a shading and rendering technique used to calculate how exposed each point in a scene is to ambient lighting, which results in the rendering of new AO shadows that ground objects and naturally darken surfaces, objects, and other game elements. In Cyberpunk 2077, ray-traced ambient occlusion can be used with local lights to approximate local shadowing effects where shadows are missing, greatly improving the quality of the ambient occlusion effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Shadows \u2013 Ray tracing enables developers to bring pixel-perfect shadows to games, free from the compromises and limitations of shadow maps. In Cyberpunk 2077, directional shadows from sun and moon light are added to the game, based on the strength of light, scattering of light through clouds, and other factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of these effects is powered by DirectX 12 Ultimate\u2019s DXR Raytracing API, and are optimized for GeForce RTX graphics GPUs and their dedicated ray tracing cores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 2.0 Comes To Cyberpunk 2077\nPowered by dedicated AI processors on GeForce RTX GPUs called tensor cores, NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 is a deep learning neural network that boosts frame rates while generating beautiful, crisp game images. It gives gamers the performance headroom to maximize ray tracing settings and increase output resolutions.\nThis critically acclaimed technology is already in several games, and we\u2019re pleased to announce that it will also be available in Cyberpunk 2077.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay Cyberpunk 2077 In The Cloud On GeForce NOW\nGeForce NOW is NVIDIA's game streaming service that delivers real-time gameplay from world-class NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud. Playing PC games on GeForce NOW provides members with instant access, and the latest Game Ready Drivers for the best performance. Since you\u2019re playing on high-performance GPUs in the cloud, even gamers on low-powered hardware can now play at amazing levels of fidelity.\nUsing the GeForce NOW app on PC, Mac, SHIELD TV, and Android devices, gamers can play their favorite PC titles already purchased from popular digital stores like Steam, Epic Games Store and Uplay. And because these are real PC games, GeForce NOW members experience their titles the way you intended, with and against millions of other PC players, at 1080p 60 FPS.\nWhen Cyberpunk 2077 launches later this year, it will be available on GeForce NOW, with support for ray-tracing effects and DLSS 2.0. So even if you\u2019re playing on an old PC, a Mac, or an Android device, you can experience Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p 60 FPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further details about GeForce NOW, head here, and stay tuned to the GeForce NOW social pages to learn about other new games coming to the service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay Tuned For More\nWe\u2019ll have much more to say and show about Cyberpunk 2077 in the coming months, so stay locked to GeForce.com for all the details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This is the most notable driver release from NVIDIA since the release of the May Windows 10 update, as it enables official support for DirectX 12 Ultimate, the most up-to-date version of DX12 that will require the right hardware to take advantage of.\nThere\u2019s a good unbiased look at DX12 Ultimate at Microsoft\u2019s DX developer blog for those who want to explore all of what it brings to the table. Most importantly, it enables full support for DirectX ray tracing (DXR), Variable Rate Shading, Mesh Shaders, and Sampler Feedback. At the moment, only NVIDIA\u2019s RTX graphics cards can accommodate all of these features.\n\nSome of these mentioned features have been seen in the past, but brand-new is Hardware-accelerated GPU Scheduling, which is said to improve memory management when multiple things are going on \u2013 such as playing a game while watching a YouTube or Netflix video. Fortunately, this works without concern to the graphics APIs being used, so the benefit should be system-wide.\nThe DX12 Ultimate feature set is one that\u2019s going to be shared between the PC and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Series X, which is something that should improve the likelihood of games becoming cross-platform (or, at least reduce the amount of headache for developers.) To see if DX12 Ultimate is active, you can run dxdiag and see if the current WDDM version is 2.7. If so, you\u2019re golden. Remember: you also need the latest version of Windows in addition to this new driver to fully reflect the update.\nOne thing we noticed is that the driver now displays which variant is currently installed:\n\nThis is a helpful change, but admittedly, we\u2019ve been hoping for the past while that NVIDIA would use this space to say whether or not a driver is Standard or DCH. You can click \u201cSystem Information\u201d at the bottom to check that, but that\u2019s just another step. Of course, it\u2019d be even better if one driver installer applied to both, but we\u2019re imagining NVIDIA isn\u2019t keeping them separate because it loves complexity.\nThe Quadro version of the 451.48 driver has another more subtle change lurking: it\u2019s replaced the nView desktop management tool of old with Quadro View. The functionality and goals remain the same \u2013 to let people create desktop profiles and easily move between them \u2013 but the UI has been completely overhauled to match Quadro Experience. Speaking of, we toured Quadro Experience a few weeks ago, so check that out if you want to see why you should (probably) have it installed.\n\nIn addition to all of this, NVIDIA has also released support for nine new G-SYNC Compatible monitors, and while we could list them here, we\u2019ll instead point you to the entire list so you can scour for your exact model. Lastly, NVIDIA has also rolled out one-click optimization support for a variety of new games, including AoE III: Complete Edition, Mafia II: Definitive Edition, Roblox, and Streets of Rage 4.\nYou can grab the latest driver of your choice at the official download page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRob Williams\nRob founded Techgage in 2005 to be an 'Advocate of the consumer', focusing on fair reviews and keeping people apprised of news in the tech world.

The combination gives users a choice of ingredients to power data centers that are accelerated, disaggregated and software-defined to meet the exponential growth in AI, cloud and high performance computing.\nThe data center is rapidly evolving into the new unit of computing. It\u2019s built on a distributed network of compute and storage resources users need to program to address their changing workloads and expanding datasets.\nThat\u2019s why Cumulus is a key part of NVIDIA\u2019s networking vision. It provides a popular suite of networking software from operating systems to analytics that gives users choice in how they deploy and automate their data centers.\nDriving the Open Road in Networking\nCumulus supports more than 2,000 customers using 130 hardware platforms that run Cumulus Linux, its operating system for network switches. Likewise, Mellanox has been giving users a choice of networking software under its Open Ethernet strategy, forged in 2013.\nSince 2016, our ultrafast Mellanox Spectrum switches have shipped with Cumulus Linux and SONiC, the open source offering forged in Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud and managed by the Open Compute Project. And today, the ONIE environment Cumulus created is a software foundation for Mellanox\u2019s switches.\nIn addition, Mellanox supports DENT, a distributed Linux software framework for retail and other enterprises at the edge of the network. And our Onyx operating system continues to expand, especially in Ethernet Storage Fabrics.\nAll of today\u2019s major network operating systems, including Cumulus Linux, SONiC and DENT, are built on Free Range Routing (FRR), the open-source software for Ethernet routing that Cumulus helped create. NVIDIA will continue Cumulus\u2019 work maintaining and advancing FRR for the Linux community as a key plank of open networking.\nOur history of support for choice in networking software and hardware continues and expands. For example, our network analytics and management software, Cumulus NetQ, will continue to embrace and extend innovations for open networking.\nA Programmable Network Orchestrates GPUs, DPUs\u00a0\nUsers need rich choices in networking software to orchestrate the evolving elements of the data center.\nThe rise of AI and data analytics has made GPU accelerators a key ingredient. Meanwhile, data processing units (DPUs) have emerged in SmartNICs like the Mellanox BlueField-2 to handle networking, security and storage tasks.\nThe combination of hardware and software provides unique opportunities. For example, analytics programs could identify issues that AI software could automatically address in self-healing networks.\nIt\u2019s the kind of advance that requires companies that can innovate across the stack from chips to analytics in networking and accelerated computing with GPUs and DPUs.\nNetworking hardware and software must go hand in hand so AI, cloud and HPC workloads can run flexibly across any part of the entire data center. With the demand for this kind of elastic computing, there\u2019s no going back to the past where each network system had its own proprietary programming environment.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re glad to welcome Cumulus today as part of NVIDIA. We look forward to the innovations we\u2019ll deliver to customers together.\n\n\nCategories: NetworkingTags: Artificial Intelligence | Cloud Services | High-Performance Computing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It's officially open season for NVIDIA's upcoming RTX 3000 series of GPUs. The company is planning to launch these cards by holiday 2020, so you should see these launch either at the virtual Computex conference later this year or around that time. Interestingly, a leaked picture from the assembly line was the first item to leak for the RTX 2000 series lineup as well.\nNVIDIA's RTX 3080 graphics card features bold new design with bi-directional fans, irregular PCB and curved heatsink\nNVIDIA's new RTX 3080 features a very cyber-punk yet whimsical design whose inspiration I can't seem to put a finger on. I for one love the symmetric and futuristic looking shape (the graphics card isn't actually blue by the way, that is just the packaging film on it. It is still very much polished metal). The materials used seem to be very high quality although I cannot tell from the picture whether the edges used are still aluminum like the RTX 2080 or the company has reverted back to plastic.\nNVIDIA's bold new design for the RTX 3000 series GPUs.\nHere are some key design considerations of the new NVIDIA RTX 3080 graphics card:\n\nThe fans are bi-directional. One fan has an open-intake at the bottom while the other has an open-intake at the top. While it is hard to judge the exact direction of each fan I would assume the bottom one to be a static pressure fan while the top one throws air out in an attempt to keep air flowing through the fins.\nThe heat sink is curved. This is a very interesting design because normally it would disrupt airflow but NVIDIA seems to be attempting a push full configuration which would rely on pressure differentials to keep the air flowing and might work wonders with this design philosophy.\nThe PCB is irregularly shapes and ends when it touches the heatsink. In the image below, only the grey plastic part of the RTX 3080 houses the PCB, the fan section does not. This confirms previous rumors that had indicated a small and irregular shaped PCB for NVIDIA's upcoming Ampere GPUs.\nThis is almost certainly a Founder's Edition (if NVIDIA still wants to call these that) GPU. A design like this would be incredibly hard to tool and machine and AIBs would almost certainly prefer to go with their traditional Heatpipe and triple fan designs if NVIDIA allows them. Unless we see some form of packaging with NVIDIA supplying these parts (not going to happen) what you are looking at is almost certainly a founders edition run in limited quantity (and very high MSRP).\n\nAccording to old rumors the RTX 3080 will ship with a GA104 GPU, and replace the existing RTX 2080 with 48 SMs (3072 CUDA cores). This is very slightly more than the RTX 2080 at 46 SMs. Coupled with higher performance throughput and improved RTX cores you are looking at a significant performance increase if this turns out to be true - in fact, it is estimated to be just slightly less in performance than the RTX 2080 Ti current generation flagship. The RTX 3080 GPU will be coupled with 8GB/16GB of vRAM and a 256-bit bus width. Edit: New rumors have indicated that the card may actually ship with a GA102 core that is extremely powerful.\nWhile there is no word on pricing yet, we have a feeling NVIDIA will take a much more lenient approach with MSRP (at the very least for the custom AIB parts) this time around as compared to Turing considering the fact the former was very slow to gain traction due to its large price tag. The company is also shifting to the 7nm process with the Ampere series so it will have access to significant cost savings - some of which it should pass on to consumers.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think of NVIDIA's new RTX 3080 design?\n\n\n Love it!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Hate it!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Reserving judgement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n160\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Primary features will be the ability to drive regular routes from address to address autonomously and Level 4 automated parking, in addition to countless safety and convenience applications. These capabilities will continue to be better, as AI technology advances at lightning rates.\n\u201cAt no time in history has so much computing power been put into a car,\u201d Huang said.\n\u201cThis is a field that has so many opportunities, it will make driving much safer on the road to fully autonomous driving,\u201d said K\u00e4llenius. \u201cBy using an architecture from NVIDIA that makes it possible to update through the life of the vehicle, there will be endless possibilities.\u201d\nCentralizing and unifying computing in the car will make it easier to integrate and update advanced software features as they are developed. Just like a mobile phone, which periodically gets software updates, these software-defined vehicles will be able to do the same.\nWith over-the-air updates, vehicles can constantly receive the latest autonomous driving and intelligent cockpit features, increasing value and extending the joy of ownership with each software upgrade.\nHuang said: \u201cThe definition of a car will change forever. No longer will the best moment of your car be at the point of sale. The Mercedes-Benz partnership is the starting point, and behind it are thousands of engineers. They\u2019re your own personal software and research lab, who will stay with you over the life of the car.\nThis will revolutionize the way cars are sold and enjoyed.\u201d\n\nState of the Art at Any Age\nBreakthroughs in AI and computing are opening future fleets to dramatic new functionality, fundamentally transforming the vehicle architecture for the first time in decades.\nAnd this transformation is occurring rapidly. The market for AI hardware, software and in-car services is worth about $5 billion today. By extending these capabilities to a fleet of about 100 million vehicles, the market has the potential to grow to $700 billion.\nLike all modern computing devices, these intelligent vehicles are supported by a large team of AI and software engineers, dedicated to improving the performance and capability of the car as technology advances.\nThis software-defined architecture is also opening up new business models for automakers. Mercedes-Benz can add capabilities and services over the air at any time through the life of not just one customer, but across customers through the life of the car.\n\u201cMercedes-Benz customers who love Mercedes-Benz will have a new way of enjoying their car,\u201d said Huang. \u201cThis is a level of scale that has never been achieved before.\u201d\nAn Amped Up Architecture\nMercedes\u2019 next generation of automotive innovation will be developed with AI from end to end.\nThis development begins in the data center. Both companies will work together to validate intelligent new autonomous driving experiences using NVIDIA DRIVE Infrastructure solutions.\nDRIVE Infrastructure encompasses the complete data center hardware, software and workflows needed to develop and validate autonomous driving technology, from raw data collection through validation. It provides the building blocks required for DNN development and training as well as provides necessary validation, replay and testing in simulation to enable a safe autonomous driving experience.\nNVIDIA\u2019s complete DRIVE Software stack (including DriveWorks, Perception, Mapping and Planning) will run on Mercedes-Benz\u2019 new, centralized compute architecture using the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Orin platform. This next-generation AI compute platform delivers 200 trillion operations per second (TOPS) for the entire Mercedes-Benz lineup, from entry level to high end.\nBy developing an architecturally coherent and programmable fleet, Mercedes-Benz will again redefine what it is to be a mobility company, nurturing a growing installed base to offer software upgradeable applications and subscription services for the entire life of its upcoming fleet.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The previous best AMD system, built on Opteron CPUs, was Titan, which held the #1 spot in 2012 but slowly dropped out of the top 10 by June 2019. Now, in June 2020, AMD scores a big win for its Zen 2 microarchitecture by getting to #7. But there\u2019s a twist in this tale.\nMeasuring success by the TOP500 list is not so much for scoring revenue, but for scoring prestige. On the database are systems that were built over a decade ago, so a chance to put something into the list on the latest and greatest at a fraction of the size and power ends up being a big promotional opportunity for the company whose hardware is involved (as well as where it ends up being based). Obviously since AMD started introducing its new Zen-based processors, as a return to the high-end of performance\u00a0after several years, we\u2019ve been wondering how long it would take for a large scale AMD deployment.\nAMD has had HPC success in the past, most notably with the Titan supercomputer, built on a mixture of Opteron 6274 CPUs paired with NVIDIA K20x accelerator cards. The machine hit #1 in 2012, and still sits at #12 today. This was a sizeable deployment, coming in at 17.6 PetaFLOPs for 8.2 MegaWatts.\nAnand back in the day event went for a look around:\nInside the Titan Supercomputer: 299K AMD x86 Cores and 18.6K NVIDIA GPUs\n\nBack in 2012\nWhen it comes to AMD\u2019s Zen designs, the two main CPUs we have to look for are Naples (1st Gen EPYC) and Rome (2nd Gen EPYC). That latter has been getting a lot of attention for having up to 64 high performance cores as well as a lot of memory bandwidth and heaps of connectivity for storage and add-in cards.\nHowever, the first Zen system on the top 500 was technically neither of those.\nThe Hygon joint venture actually provided the first Zen based supercomputer to join the list in November 2018 at #38. This was a system built at Sugon, the company distributing the Hygon systems, to showcase the hardware. It used 5120 of the Hygon 32 core CPUs. We\u2019ve reviewed and done a deep dive into the Hygon hardware. The Hygon joint venture has since dissolved, but the supercomputer it's based on is still running at #58.\nIt wasn\u2019t until late 2019 that systems based on AMD EPYC show\u00a0up. In November\u2019s list that we saw two AMD Naples and two AMD Rome systems push AMD\u2019s total up to six (5 based on EPYC, one on older Opterons). For the June 2020 announcement this week, another seven AMD Rome systems are in the list, making Rome the 10th most popular processor family for supercomputers. But it\u2019s Selene at #7 that\u2019s making the headlines.\n\nSelene is the name of the new supercomputer sitting at #7. For host processors, it is using AMD\u2019s Rome 7742 parts, which are the highest performing commercial parts available that aren\u2019t for specialized markets \u2013 technically a list price of $6950 each. What makes Selene a bit odd for an AMD win is that it is part of a supercomputer built with NVIDIA A100 accelerators. And it\u2019s also built for NVIDIA to use at NVIDIA.\n\nWhen NVIDIA announced its new A100 Ampere accelerator card for compute, it also announced the concept of a DGX A100 \u2018SuperPod\u2019, connecting 140 DGX A100 nodes and 1120 A100 GPUs to supply up to 700 PetaOPs of AI-based performance. It turns out that this concept of a SuperPOD also just happens to hit #7 in the TOP500 supercomputer list, which uses more traditional LINPACK FP64 FLOPs, straight off the bat. Each of the DGX A100 nodes contains two AMD EPYC CPUs and eight A100 accelerators.\nSelene scores a performance of 27.6 PetaFLOPs of FP64 throughput, for 1.3 MegaWatts of power. Compared to the previous Titan supercomputer, which had Opterons and K20x accelerators, that\u2019s 57% more performance for only 16% of the power, making it almost 10x more efficient. Selene uses NVIDIA\u2019s Mellanox HDR Infiniband for connectivity, and has 560 TiB of memory installed.\n\nAt launch, NVIDIA said that a DGX A100 node would cost $199k. This makes the hardware deployment for Selene (minus switches, install cost, cabling) somewhere around $28 million. It\u2019s worth noting that this is technically only 280 EPYC CPUs paired with 1120 A100 GPUs, combined together for 277760 \u2018cores\u2019. It seems odd to suggest that 'this is all that is needed' to reach #7.\nThe wins for AMD on Zen are now (with Rmax):\n\n#7, Selene, an EPYC 7742 + A100 system for NVIDIA (27.6 PF)\n#30, Belenos, an EPYC 7742 system for Meteo France\u00a0(7.7 PF)\n#34, Joliot-Curie Rome, an EPYC 7H12 system for CEA in France (7.0 PF)\n#48, Mahti, an EPYC 7H12 system for CSC in Finland (5.4 PF)\n#56, Betzy, an EPYC 7742 system for Sigam2 AS in Norway (4.44 PF)\n#58, PreE, a Hygon C86 system for Sugon, China (4.32 PF)\n#124, Freeman, an EPYC 7542 system for ERDC DSRC (2.5 PF)\n#172, Betty, an EPYC 7542 system for the US Army Research Laboratory (2.1 PF)\n#268, Cara, an EPYC 7601 system for German Aerospace Center (1.75 PF)\n#292, an EPYC 7501 + Vega 20system for Pukou Advanced Computing Center, China (1.66 PF)\n#483, Spartan, an EPYC 7H12 system for Atos, France (1.26 PF)\n\nAll of which are new in the past year, except for #58 the Hygon system.\nThe two main upcoming supercomputers for AMD are both part of the US Exascale project.\nFrontier is set to have 1.5 ExaFLOPs of EPYC and Radeon Instinct in a 30 MegaWatt design at Oak Ridge, built by Cray (HPE), for 2021.\nEl Capitan is set to 2.0 ExaFLOPs of EPYC and Radeon Instinct in a 30 MegaWatt design at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, built by Cray (HPE), for early 2023.\nThe other US Exascale project in the US is Aurora, with 1.0 Exaflops of Xeon and Xe, for the Argonne National Laboratories, due in late 2021.\n\n\n\nUS Department of Energy Exascale Supercomputers\n\n\n\u00a0\nEl Capitan\nFrontier\nAurora\n\n\nCPU Architecture\nAMD EPYC \"Genoa\"\n\t\t\t(Zen 4)\nAMD EPYC\n\t\t\t(Future Zen)\nIntel Xeon Scalable\n\n\nGPU Architecture\nRadeon Instinct\nRadeon Instinct\nIntel Xe\n\n\nPerformance (RPEAK)\n2.0 EFLOPS\n1.5 EFLOPS\n1 EFLOPS\n\n\nPower Consumption\n<40MW\n~30MW\nN/A\n\n\nNodes\nN/A\n100 Cabinets\nN/A\n\n\nLaboratory\nLawrence Livermore\nOak Ridge\nArgonne\n\n\nVendor\nCray\nCray\nIntel\n\n\nYear\n2023\n2021\n2021\n\n\n\nAMD is still fervent in meeting its goal of hitting 10% market share for EPYC by the middle of the year.

I would imagine if you want a supercomputer with the most processing power you'd want it to have CPUs with the highest core count, and AMD wins that by a landslide. I don't really think the fact that AMD competes with them in a different department would make them pass on the best choice for what they're doing.\n\n\n\njeremyshaw - Monday, June 22, 2020 - link\nWell, if was purely core count, there are other CPUs. We have to include performance (on top of I/O). With 2 CPUs, Rome gives 128PCIe4.0 lanes (and 128 cores), though 128 lanes aren't enough for 8 GPUs + (several) NIC + NVMe, it is a lot better than anything short of 256 lanes PCIe3.0. Why is it a lot better? I'd hate to route 256 PCIe 3.0 lanes, nevermind the switch chips, and the accelerators only have 16 lanes max - PCIe 3.0 loses half of the bandwidth. This is especially important for the 200GBps+ NICs.IBM POWER9 may have the I/O, but it doesn't have the cores nor much remaining acceptance in the community. IBM tried to bid for two of the exaflop projects, with and without Nvidia, and lost both (I don't know if Nvidia had any serious bids on their own). Nvidia has their own arm CPUs with PCIe4.0 and NVLink, but those are scaled for embedded systems, not HPC. Ampere and Cavium/Marvell, like Nvidia, didn't have the full arm infrastructure at the time of the contracts, anyways (they seem to have it now).We also have Fujitsu with their A64FX arm-SVE CPU, but historically, Japanese CPUs have failed to gain traction outside of Japan. They seem to be making a serious push for exports this time around, however. But either way, it would have been too late for the exaflop contracts.In the end, I agree AMD won this part of the supercomputer by a landslide, just for different reasons than core count alone. :D\n\n\n\ninighthawki - Monday, June 22, 2020 - link\nGood points!\n\n\n\nWafflefries128 - Tuesday, June 23, 2020 - link\nTwo 7742 CPUs equate to 256 pcie lanes.With 8 gpus at x16 that's 128 pcie lanes for the GPUs, leaving an additional 128 lanes for storage, networking and other peripheral hardware.\n\n\n\nWafflefries128 - Tuesday, June 23, 2020 - link\nWoops forgot about infinity fabric...nevermind you're right!\n\n\n\nschujj07 - Tuesday, June 23, 2020 - link\nIn a dual socket system, Gen 2 Epyc can be configured to have up to 160 PCIe 4.0 lanes. This is done by reducing the IF lanes from 128 to 96 and adding the extra lanes to IO. Even in the 96 lane configuration, Gen 2 Epyc has more 50% more CPU-CPU bandwidth than it did in Gen 1.\n\n\n\nDeicidium369 - Tuesday, June 23, 2020 - link\nNo.  Each Epyc CPU has 128 Lanes.  64 of those lanes are used to connect to a 2nd CPU - leaving only 128 Lanes.  Epyc tops out at 2 sockets.Intel has QPI/UPI to facilitate multi socket systems - and does not use PCIe Lanes\n\n\n\nDeicidium369 - Tuesday, June 23, 2020 - link\nEpyc has 128 PCIe4 lanes - 64 of which are used to connect to a 2nd CPU - there are no 4 or 8 socket Epyc\n\n\n\nDeicidium369 - Friday, June 26, 2020 - link\nNVSwitch connects the 8 to 16 GPUs together into a single GPU - the AMD system is just a traffic cop and IO.  There are no direct CPU to individual GPU connection - the AMD connects to the 8/16GPU Cluster.  The AMD system does not provide any compute performance to the mix - much as the previous DGX systems.

It had been anticipated for some time as Nvidia had made only small changes to the original hardware from 2015. Shield TV is still considered by many the best Android TV device on the market. Google's operating system is also found in Sony, Philips, TCL, Hisense and Sharp TVs but Shield has more powerful hardware under the hood and comes with built-in gaming services, including GeForce Now.\r\n\r\nCan Nvidia push the Shield TV forward with the 2019 upgrade? Is this the ultimate fusion of a media player and game console that Nvidia promised in 2015? We have been testing the most affordable tube-version of Shield 2019 for some time. Here is our in-depth review.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrice and retailers:US retailer UK retailer DE retailerNvidia Shield 2019 - specifications4K Ultra HD resolutionHDR: HDR10 & Dolby Vision (HxWxD)4 x 4 x 16.5 cm0.137 kgHDMI (1x 2.0b)Ethernet (Gigabit)microSD card readerTegra X1+8GB (16GB in Pro version)Dolby Atmos, Dolby TrueHD, Dolby Digital PlusDTS:X (passthrough), DTS-HD (passthrough)WiFi (2.4 & 5GHz \u2013 n + ac standard + MIMO)Bluetooth 5.0 LEMPEG2MPEG4HEVCVP9-1Android TV 9.0 (Pie)Chromecast built-inGeForce NowNvidia RemoteBluetooth game controllersNvidia RemotePower cable Subscribe to our Newsletter, Facebook, twitter or RSS to receive notice when new reviews are published\r\n\r\nFirst impressionsWe reviewed the original Nvidia Shield in 2015. Back then, it came with a more conventional box design. You can still get this design if you pick the 'Pro' version of Nvidia Shield 2019 but the standard version is now a tube-shaped device, which is almost as long as the remote control that it comes bundled with.\r\n\r\nIt is a strange form factor and it does not help that you must connect the power cable at one end and the HDMI cable at the other end. You end up with a thing that is so long that it gets a little unruly, and it takes up more space than you would think.\r\n\r\nInside the tube you have 8GB of storage capacity but a good chunk is reserved for the operating system and Nvidia's apps. You can expand storage via a microSD card. There is also an Ethernet port for wired internet, WiFi 5 (ac) and Bluetooth 5.0 LE, which is a step up from the original Shield  (2015) and the 2017 refresh. If you want USB ports you must buy the Shield Pro 2019. Nvidia giveth and taketh away. The HDMI connection is HDMI 2.0b - no HDMI 2.1 this time. We will get back to that later.\r\n\r\nIn the box we also found a new remote control and it is worth noting that this is a strategy shift from a company who initially sold Shield as a game console with a game controller. The remote control was optional. Now the game controller is optional. Shield 2019 is now first and foremost a streaming player.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUser experience & featuresSetting up Nvidia Shield has become much easier, mostly as a consequence of Google having streamlined the Android TV set-up process. You can now log in via a mobile app, so you no longer have to use the on-screen keyboard. During the process you have to accept various privacy-intrusive clauses.\r\n\r\nThe set-up process could be streamlined further, however, and it does not match the set-up process of Apple TV where you just place your iPhone on top of the box and use bluetooth triangulation to verify login and get started. This is harder to achieve on Android because Apple does not allow an Android device to pull such data from iPhone and because Android phones come with incongruent hardware specs that complicate compatibility. After setting up Shield we were asked to update the software/firmware, then the remote control firmware, and then pre-installed apps. These steps could have been streamlined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTalking about the user interface and experience of using Nvidia Shield is mainly a discussion about Google's 'Android TV', the version of Android intended for TV devices. Shield is a \"stock\" Android TV device, meaning that it does not have layers on top such as the tuner sections in Sony, Philips, TCL and Sharp TVs or set-top boxes from distributors of TV channels. Shield has the clean Android TV user interface. As a streaming player manufacturer Nvidia is not allowed to modify the user interface, unlike set-top box makers that are allowed by Google to skin the interface. TV makers like Sony are not allowed to skin the app section of Android TV either but they are allowed to implement their own interface for tuner-based TV channels.\r\n\r\nIn short, Shield's user interface is dictated by the Android TV operation system inside. You will see the exact same user interface in a device like Xiaomi Mi Box.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the original Shield from 2015 Google has introduced a revamped user interface based on the concept of content rows. Netflix and YouTube can each have their own content row on the home screen in which they can push recommendations or other content. This is a change from the original concept where recommendations were bundled in a single row at the top while other icons on the home screen were simply app shortcuts. We like the new concept but there are obvious limitations as many app developers, especially developers of local apps, have yet to implement the API, meaning that many apps do use the content row feature in any way.\r\n\r\nThe original Nvidia Shield 2015 has also gained this new user interface as part of Nvidia/Google's continuous updates since launch; one reason many consider Nvidia Shield the best Android TV device. Shield started on Android 5 Android 5 (Lollipop) and is now on Android 9 (Pie), which is in line with the history of tvOS updates for Apple TV. However, even a \"stock\" Android TV device like Shield is subject to long delays. Google will release Android 11 soon but Android 10 (released for TVs in December 2019) has yet to reach Shield. More worrying is the fact that the latest security patch for Shield is from December 2019 - Sony Android TVs have more recent security patches. All-in-all Nvidia does a decent job in terms of updating software, with room for improvement. As for Android 10 it includes official AV1 video decoding support as well as OS-level support for game controllers like Sony's DualShock 4, Microsoft's Xbox controller, and even Nintendo's Switch Pro controller. However, you can already connect lots of controllers, including DS4 and Xbox, to Shield via Nvidia's own drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou cannot talk about a TV user experience without talking about the remote control, and in this area Nvidia has really upped its game with Shield 2019. The remote is now triangular and made from cheap, black plastic but it fits well in our hand. It is the functionality side of things that excite us. The remote relies on bluetooth so it is not directional. It may seem trivial in 2020 but many TV remote controls still rely on directional infrared. The big news is that Nvidia has managed to largely match what Apple is doing with the Siri remote for Apple TV, meaning a well-implemented HDMI CEC system that allows you to turn on/off the TV via Nvidia's remote, which is now equipped with an on/off button.\r\n\r\nFrom a sub-menu you can also set-up Nvidia's remote to control audio volume on the TV. Ideally, it should have been set-up automatically or be part of the set-up process but nevertheless Shield identified the TV as an LG TV and did the necessary after which we could control audio volume on the TV. The system falls back on infrared, which is also implemented in Nvidia's remote, so for volume control the remote must be pointed towards the TV. The remote has in other words been programmed to use the TV's infrared commands. After these steps everything was smooth sailing and Nvidia Shield can effectively take over as the TV's new operating system, allowing you to put away the TV's convoluted remote control (unless you want to use the tuners in the TV).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Nvidia has added a couple of other buttons to its remote, including a sponsored Netflix button, which is becoming more common. It would have been optimal if it had been a user-configurable buttons but luckily there are hack solutions to solve it. There is also a user-configurable button in the top right corner. The remote has backlit buttons that turn on when your viewing environment is dark and you pick up the remote.\r\n\r\nNvidia Shield can also be controlled with the official remote app for Android TV. Unfortunately, the app is subpar and frustrating. Besides having to re-pair all the time, it is slow to connect and has delayed text input. The keyboard in the app can be useful when you need to enter login credentials but it often inputs letters twice. The letters in the app's input field do not always correspond to what you are getting on the TV screen either. Google should fix this mess of an app. Perhaps as a result of this, Nvidia has developed its own free app, which provides a better experience. It can also be used to find the physical remote by having it play a sound.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to use other Bluetooth-based remote controls or universal remote controls, including those from Logitech.\r\n\r\nLike other Android TV devices, Shield supports Google's voice assistant, although most languages remain unavailable on TV devices - evne languages that are supported in Assistant on mobile. If you are using Assistant in English you can ask for weather reports or search for content. \"Play House of Cards\" was recognized and Assistant opens Netflix. At least when it works... We often encountered errors where it would do nothing at all. Sometimes Google Assistant did not even work on Shield. Other times Assistant sent us to the relevant app but nothing else happened. Voice recognition was also very spotty, with movie titles often being recognized as more commonly used words. Whether this is related to the remote's microphone or Google's Assistant system is unclear but in our view Assistant is of very limited use on Nvidia Shield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShield 2019 comes with pre-installed apps from Google and Nvidia, but you can customize the home screen by hiding apps. New apps and games can be downloaded from the official Google Play store where only apps designed and optimized for the TV screen are available - no mobile Android apps. If you want to load in a mobile app it can be side-loaded. It is rarely a good idea since many of them are not optimized for remote control input. See the 'Shield as a media player' section for more details.\r\n\r\nWe were not impressed with the performance of the Shield 2015, which despite its powerful hardware was slow, inconsistent and full of errors. The user interface felt unpolished and the user experience as a whole was bad. Subsequent Android updates have made it much, much better and similarly the Shield 2019 provides an overall much smoother and nicer user experience. Google is promising further performance improvements as part of Android 10 and 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasurementsIn the measurement section we will include all measurements. If you want to learn more about our test methodology click here.\r\n\r\nNvidia Shield 2019 has a power consumption of approximately 2W in stand-by, less than half compared to the original version from 2015. Power consumption (average) in active use has also decreased, which is a consequence of the new Tegra X1+ chip that has been manufactured on a 16nm process, meaning that it runs more energy efficient.\r\n\r\nPower consumptionWatt Standby1.9 WMenus3.2 W4K HDR streaming6.9 WGaming5-11 WVideofile / sourceSpecs Status  Netflix 4K HDR4K (3840x2160 pixels) \u2013 10 bit colors - Rec.2020 color space \u2013 4:2:0 subsampling \u2013 HEVC 4K works HDR10 worksDV works YouTube 4K HDR4K (3840x2160 pixels) \u2013 10 bit colors - Rec.2020 color space \u2013 4:2:0 subsampling \u2013 Up to 60fps \u2013 VP9 Profile2 4K worksHDR Fails Google Play Movies4K (3840x2160 pixels) \u2013 8 bit colors - Rec.709 color space \u2013 4:2:0 subsampling \u2013 VP94K worksDV fails Japan AV1 video clip1080p (1920x1080 pixels) \u2013 8 bit colors - Rec.709 color space \u2013 4:2:0 subsampling \u2013 AV1Fails Cymatic Jazz AV1 video clip1080p (1920x1080 pixels) \u2013 10 bit colors - Rec.2020 color space \u2013 4:2:0 subsampling \u2013 AV1Fails\r\n\r\nShield as a game consoleRegardless of whether you are buying the tube or Pro version of the Shield 2019 you get the remote control only. If you want to play games you must buy and connect a bluetooth-based game controller. The good news is that Shield is compatible with many popular controllers, including DualShock 4 and Xbox One controllers. If you have another controller lying around just try to see if you can pair it.\r\n\r\nGame consoles: Graphical performanceApple TV HD0.1 TFlopsPlayStation 30.23 TFlopsXbox 3600.24 tflopsApple TV 4K0.5 tflops (est.)Nvidia Shield (2019)0.5 tflopsXbox One1.3 TFlopsXbox One S1.4 tflopsPS41.8 TFlopsThe original Shield box was sold and promoted as a game console. It is clear that Nvidia's original vision never materialized in earnest. One component of its vision was Android-based games and Nvidia imagined that not only mobile games but also PC games could be ported to Android TV and the (back then) relatively powerful Shield, with its Tegra X1 processor. Shield 2019 is equipped with a Tegra X1+, which according to the company is 25% faster. We have found no evidence to support such claims. The chip is now manufactured on a more advanced node process (16nm versus 20nm). This allows it to deliver similar performance with lower power consumption. It is an optimization but it does little to elevate graphical performance in a TV box that is not restricted by a battery component. The fact that Shield 2019 performs largely in line with the previous chip can be confirmed by benchmarking Shield 2019. In some tests, it exceeds the original chip's performance whereas it struggles to keep up in other tests, depending on what you are benchmarking (1, 2, 3). Tegra X1+ is by the way the same chip as the one found in the latest game consoles from Nintendo; Switch Lite and the latest revision of Switch, although in a throttled version in Nintendo's devices. Tegra X1/X1+ is on paper specified to deliver 512 GFlops of graphical performance, which is roughly on par with the A10X in Apple TV 4K (and the 2017 iPad Pro) but in our benchmark tests, Apple's A10X (in iPad Pro) came out significantly ahead of Nvidia's Tegra X1 (see results).\r\n\r\nAnother factor here is that the tube version of Shield 2019 is equipped with only 2GB of RAM, meaning that several of our benchmark tests could not run at all. It also runs Android in 32-bit mode as opposed to 64-bit in the 2019 Pro version. Android TV is today a 64-inch operating system with 32-bit backwards compatibility (secured by Google requiring all apps to run on 32-bit too). However, there are no guarantees that this will continue in coming years. Apple for example has already ditched support for 32-bit in tvOS and iOS. This limitation of 32-bit in Shield may impact performance later in the lifecycle - not only for games. A few games from the original Shield cannot run on the tube version of Shield 2019 but this is due to them requiring a minimum of 3GB RAM. Titles include Metal Gear Solid 2 og 3, Doom 3, Borderlands 2, Portal, Resident Evil and Tomb Raider from 2013. Add to that the fact that the tube version has only 8GB of storage capacity, with only 4.5GB being available after set-up (a little more can be released by removing pre-installed apps).\r\n\r\nHmmmmmm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHas Nvidia given up on its vision to make Shield TV a game console? After 4-5 years, we have roughly the same chip but with downgrades in other hardware areas. You may argue that the Pro version is a better choice but it still comes with only 16GB of storage although it allows you to connect external storage via USB. However, an ecosystem is not defined by the top level or custom configuration options but rather the solutions made available to the masses.\r\n\r\nWe think it is fair to say that Nvidia has at least given up on the idea that Android games can serve as the foundation under a game console. Compared to Apple TV 4K, which recently gained Arcade with its growing library of decent-quality games - but not console-quality games - the game library of Google's Play store is more uninspiring, despite a handful of good titles.\r\n\r\nOne example that is worth highlighting here is Oddmar, which is a great little game that will cost you 5 dollars on Apple TV. On Android TV the game is free but unplayable unless you accept to share your private data, specifically data to \"associate you with your personal info on Google\", meaning cross-sharing of data to build out your Google profile, which can be used for targeted ads. Games for Android TV are not built on a sustainable model, which is Google's responsibility, and it affects everyone involved including Nvidia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstead Nvidia has launched its own gaming services on top of Android TV - and only available in Shield. The names and concepts have changed over time - from Nvidia Grid to GeForce Now, from local PC streaming to cloud streaming - so many times that it is hard to keep track but with the official launch of the new GeForce Now game streaming service in February 2020, we finally have a service that could turn out to be successful and help establish Nvidia Shield as a hardware platform for gaming.\r\n\r\nA selection of games:Tomb RaiderAssassin's Creed OdysseyFar Cry 5FortniteBioShock RemasteredLeague of LegendsTrine 4The official launch of GeForce Now (in its current form) is also one of the reasons why we postponed this review. We tried to get submitted to the beta but without luck. So what is GeForce Now? It is a streaming service for games, much like Google Stadia but with one important difference. It is not \"Netflix for games\". GeForce Now is instead a technology platform that allows the user to stream games (over the internet) via existing storefronts such as Steam and Epic. Games can be streamed to select devices, including the Shield box, PCs or Android devices. There is a free tier with limitations. A $5 dollar per month subscription plan will give you prioritized access to Nvidia's servers.\r\n\r\nGame streaming is not a new concept or technology but it is still in its infancy. The main advantage with game streaming is that the game runs on powerful hardware somewhere in a server park, allowing you to use almost any device with a screen to receive the video stream. On the other hand game streaming typically involves some level of latency and the video will also be compressed. It is still not an option for competitive gaming but with continued investment, iteration, and the roll-out of fiber internet it may turn into a solution for the masses sometime in the future. GeForce Now would technically allow Nvidia to scale-down the hardware in Shield even further and still promote high-quality AAA games. A Chromecast Ultra-like device would be enough, which is also what Google is currently using for its competing game streaming service, Google Stadia. Speaking of Stadia, there is still no official word on when the service will be available as an official app for Android TV (and Nvidia Shield).\r\n\r\nWe have played several games on GeForce Now and if you are used to playing on a game console the service may work as an alternative. Picture quality is not as good due to video compression and quality fluctuates (latency too) but when it runs optimally it allows you to fully enjoy lots of great games. The user interface is, however, a mess as you are thrown from one platform to the next (for example Steam), and GeForce Now is probably more suitable for experienced PC gamers rather than the next platform for \"two billions players\", which is Microsoft's vision for its game streaming platform, tentatively named xCloud, which has yet to launch officially.\r\n\r\nGeForce Now shows potential and it is a great solution for a TV box connected to the largest screen in the home. Mobile gaming is great - we use it a lot ourselves - but PC games should be enjoyed on the big screen with great picture and sound.\r\n\r\nBut at the same time you are left with the impression that game streaming is not yet mature as a technology, concept or platform. Game streaming, although in more crude form, was also available in the original Shield from 2015 and from other now-defunct services even earlier than 2015. Google is similarly struggling to get Stadia off the ground. There are also technical limitations with GeForce Now as it is currently capped to 1080p60. 4K and HDR are not supported at this time - unlike Google Stadia. The company recommends a broadband connection of minimum 30 Mb/s but ideally 50 Mb/s. Just as important is your local network and we recommend a wired connection to Shield if you want to use GeForce Now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bad news is the GeForce Now since launch in February 2020 has lots support from multiple major game studios and publishers. First Activision Blizzard (Overwatch, Call of Duty) and Bethesda (Fallout, The Elder Scrolls), and later studios like Xbox Game Studios and Warner Bros IE. This is in addition to EA, Rockstar and Square Enix who were not participating at launch. The situation can be summed up as legal matters. Some game studios say that Nvidia lacks the rights to distribute the games. Nvidia's argument is that it is just a technology facilitator and that the distribution deals with Steam etc. already apply. The battles are fought in this legal grey zone but it casts dark shadow over GeForce Now and due to the current situation we would be cautious to recommend Shield as a game console.\r\n\r\nLike with the original Nvidia Shield, you can also stream games from a PC over your local network. The system is called Nvidia GameStream and it supports up to 4K60 if your PC is equipped with an Intel Core i7 CPU and GeForce RTX/GTX 1080, or higher. HDR is supported from the GeForce GTX 10 Series and up. A competing system is SteamLink from Valve/Steam that is also available as an app for Android TV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShield as a media playerNvidia Shield runs Android TV, which gives you access to the Google Play catalog of apps and games, optimized for the TV. Mobile apps are not available from Google's TV store but advanced users can side-load them. Just be aware that side-loaded mobile apps rarely work well on the large screen and with remote control input. Also be aware that mobile apps identify themselves as running on a mobile device so streaming services will serve lower-quality streams (resolution and bitrate).\r\n\r\nDepending on where you live in the world you may have access to a comprehensive or lacking app catalog on Android TV. In our region, the leading streaming service is still missing in action on Android TV and we hear that similar limitations exist in other local markets. You should check if all your preferred apps are available before buying. Unsupported streaming services can often be served via built-in Chromecast instead but then you have to control it from your smartphones.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Android TV has a rich selection of advanced media player apps, including Kodi, Plex, and VLC. Kodi has become one of the most popular solutions because it supports advanced features as well as plugins - unlike Kodi forks on Apple TV. This gives you flexibility to expand it in various ways.\r\n\r\n\r\nKodiKodi (formerly XBMC) has become one of the community favorites as a full media player solution for TV that supports many advanced video formats and features. It can be modified to your liking with 'skins' and on Shield you can also expand Kodi functionality through plugins of various kinds. Kodi on Shield supports automatic frame rate switching, including to 24fps. \r\n\r\nThe user interface is not as user friendly and polished as some other media player apps but that is fine as Kodi aims to serve more advanced users who like to tweak things.\r\n\r\nKodi is the app on Shield if you have a large library of ripped movies stored in local or network-enabled storage.PlexPlex is available on most platforms and used to be more comparable in style to Kodi, although with a more streamlined look and fewer customization options. To use Plex you would set-up a local file server on your PC/Mac or some network-attached storage. The server would handle video transcoding.\r\n\r\nPlex has later expanded to include many other features, including cloud services and storage, online music streaming, and a library of movies that can be enjoyed for free with (too many) ads.\r\n\r\nPlex today is very different from Plex 5-10 years ago but it is still an excellent media player that many continue to use with great satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to use online streaming you will find most major services including Amazon, Netflix, Disney+, HBO, and YouTube. Some apps will look identical to their counterparts on other TV platforms whereas others will be scaled-down versions that feel more like a 'home page' than a native app, which is often what they are. One implication is that the app user experience can at times feel subpar and inconsistent on Android TV. Some apps are excellent while others feel slow and laggy, despite the relatively powerful hardware in Shield. Some apps slide elegantly to the background whereas other apps insist on asking you if you really, really want to close it (for example Amazon). As the platform owner, we hope that Google will start to exercise a little more control to provide users with a more consistent and pleasant user experience on Android TV. At least in terms of major streaming services (let Kodi be Kodi).\r\n\r\nA bigger source of irritation, however, is that Shield 2019 is incapable of keeping apps in memory, most likely due to its limited RAM. There are a few situations where you can be lucky to have for example the Netflix app resume when you jump back in but most of the time it has to load from scratch again, with its splash screen and profile picker. This is hugely disruptive to the user experience and it also creates 'distance' between the app interface and the home screen where content is highlighted and featured. For this concept to work seamlessly you should be able to jump into an app almost instantly and start enjoying the content. It feels wrong to call Shield underpowered but in terms of RAM it is - like the majority of other Android TV devices - and such hardware limitations affect the Android TV ecosystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the launch of Shield 2019, Nvidia has implemented two new video features in the form of Dolby Vision support and 'match frame rate' (in beta). Although not related per se, there are some situations were they get intertwined so let us start by zooming way out. \r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, content ecosystems were sharply defined. TV channels were broadcast in specific formats (30/60Hz in the US, 25/50Hz in Europe) so all content was converted to fit before being broadcast. Movies were - or are - designed for cinema, which means 24fps, so a Blu-ray player's job was to present movies in this way. It meant that you could design a set-top box or a Blu-ray player based on the ecosystem paradigm.\r\n\r\nStreaming technology provides us with new means for distribution, and more flexibility. With streaming distribution, the provider does not have to settle beforehand on a single distribution format - like with TV channels. The provider can simply put yet another version of a movie online on the server, to be served to compatible devices. Netflix, for example, has all of its titles stored in SD, HD and sometimes 4K resolution, with or without HDR10 and with or without Dolby Vision, and in multiple bitrates for each combination. Of course, providers can still convert content - and some do - but there is no good reasons to do it any longer (most conversions will degrade video quality or introduce judder). It follows that a Smart TV or a streaming player should be flexible and built on a foundation that makes all of this possible. Streaming players should open doors, not close doors. Unfortunately, most Smart TVs and streaming players are not built on such a foundation. It is not easy either as there are still technical limitations (in HDMI etc). If you add SDR/HDR to the mix, the situation becomes even more complex so streaming players have be even more flexible.\r\n\r\nThe solution to the challenge is so-called match functions where the player matches its video pipeline and output to the content's frame rate (24, 25, 50, 60 etc) and dynamic range (SDR / HDR). The goal is to let video pass without converting it in any way. A match function can be manual or automatic. It can work on the app or system level. The optimal situation is an automatic solution implemented on the system level, which means that it will work automatically in apps running on the operating system.\r\n\r\nSince 2017, Apple TV 4K has - as the only TV platform - offered automatic, system-level match functions for both frame rate and dynamic range. It works with all apps that use the standard video player in tvOS but apps taking advantage of a custom video player must implement the API. However, Apple's match functions are off by default so the user must activate them first. This decision was most likely made because frame rate switching from an HDMI source involves a brief black screen every time it changes the frame frequency. This is a limitation in the HDMI standard (until HDMI 2.1's QMS). Google's Android TV platform supports frame rate switching but the important distinction here is that it is not supported on the system level and that it is not automatic. Instead, it is offered as an API - a tool for developers - that can be implemented in apps. Unfortunately, the vast majority of streaming providers are ignoring the API at this time.\r\n\r\nNvidia has developed its own solution. It is a step in the right direction but unfortunately not a complete solution. The match function is manual, not automatic, so you have to manually click 'match' every time you start a new video stream. And even though the feature can be mapped to the top button on the remote control, limitations apply. Some apps crash when you try to use the match function and probably for the same reason Nvidia characterizes it as 'beta'. When it works, it works well (and also supports 24.000), but a manual function is not a solution to the challenge and it will not help 99% of users. If you opt not to use the match features you will encounter judder due to frame rate conversion in the box, depending on what you have set default output to. If you select 4K 60Hz output, European content (25/50Hz) will have judder. If you select 4K 50Hz output, American content, including movies and TV series (24fps), will have judder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is where Dolby Vision and the match functions collide. Dolby Vision support is a nice addition to Nvidia Shield but useless on a handful of Dolby Vision-compatible TVs, including our LG E6 OLED TV that was used for this test. The reason is that some TVs support Dolby Vision in up to maximum 30Hz. To get Dolby Vision on Nvidia Shield to function with these TVs you must set Nvidia Shield's default output to for example '4K 23.976Hz Dolby Vision and HDR10 Ready' or alternatively lower the resolution for the entire system (meaning also streaming services), for example to 1080p HD resolution. Both solutions will give you Dolby Vision but in the first example Android TV menus and all app user interfaces will be rendered in 24fps, which is unendurable, while the other example is a very big picture quality compromise. With TVs that support Dolby Vision in up to 60Hz it works as intended.\r\n\r\nWe could discuss other nuances of Nvidia's match functions but the point is that as long as it does not work automatically on the system level, and as long as there are technical limitations, it is not viable solution. Unfortunately. A few apps, including Kodi, have their own match functions implemented so if you stick to using that app only you are good, but it does nothing to rectify the situation for the rest of the streaming services on the platform. Our recommendation is therefore that you set Nvidia Shield to 4K 50Hz output if you watch primarily European content or 4K 60Hz if you watch primarily American content, movies and TV series. And then try to remember to use the manual match function whenever it makes sense.\r\n\r\nAnother new feature in Nvidia Shield 2019 is 'AI Upscaling', which works with content in up to 1080p HD and 30fps. For a decade or more, upscaling has been marketed as almost a magical ability in TVs and it would seem that many users still lack basic knowledge about why upscaling is necessary. It is really very simple. Without upscaling you would not get a full-screen picture. All TVs employ upscaling. Otherwise 1080p video would take up only a fourth of the screen in a 4K TV - 720p only a sixth. Like so many other things these days that are named \"AI\" - artificial intelligence - the system in Nvidia's box has been developed with machine learning (that has generated an image database). In practice, such \"AI\" system often just modify their upscaling approach slightly depending on the frame rate or type of content. And the processes that do this are in fact not upscaling processes but rather picture enhancement processes. It is important to distinguish between the two concepts if we want to have a meaningful discussion about upscaling. As the industry found out more than a decade ago, it helps to just put everything into a pot, cook it, and sell it as \"upscaling\".\r\n\r\nThis approach to \"AI\" upscaling is not even new either. It has been employed in TVs since the launch of the very first 4K TVs from Sony in 2012. Only later did manufacturers start to refer to it as \"AI\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo how does it work? Exactly as expected. It changes the characteristics of the picture and makes it appear more 'digital'. The main approach is to add contrast lines around sharply defined objects, for example a human face or a flower, or to add pixel noise in-between color/contrast transitions. From a distance this will, for some time, give the impression of a sharper picture. It is one of the tricks that are commonly used on TVs in \"shop mode\" as an eye-catcher. It may look impressive at first (just like heavily oversaturated colors) but once you realize how it works, it is hard to ignore the negative effects, e.g. that it changes the picture and makes it look more artificial and digitalized. With heavily compressed video it makes the picture look even more compressed - not less. In some scenes it even changes the color tone of an object, which has absolutely nothing to do with upscaling. In other scenes Nvidia's system (also observed with some other systems in TVs) wrongly try to make blurred backgrounds or objects come into focus, which alters the perspective or depth of the scene. If similar upscaling is engaged in the TV, you get a double effect. There is demo mode in Shield that you can enable to check how it looks with any compatible content. Notice how it alters edges, objects, and color/contrast transitions in the picture.\r\n\r\nWe fundamentally believe that any player or TV should, in its default mode, refrain from applying picture enhancements. You can call it the mindset of a purist but the truth is that if content creators really wanted such effects to be applied, they would just do it in the studio or later in the chain; when the content is edited, when it is compressed/prepared etc. Studios could also apply it much more effectively earlier in the chain. In a TV or a device like Shield it has to happen in real time. Even the smallest amount of picture analysis adds video latency, which can lead to issues with picture / audio syncronization. It would not work well with gaming either. Even if you do not accept this premise you should know that the concept is neither new or unique. Many modern TVs can do the same and you should deactivate it, if you want enjoy the content as the creator intended. Picture enhancements are like sugar; it feels good to eat and you are tempted to eat more. You are not able to look at it from a perspective and see that it may not benefit you until after you stop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to true picture quality metrics. At this time, Android TV / Shield supports 4K and/or HDR10/Dolby Vision from streaming services like Amazon Video, Netflix, Google Play Movies, Disney+ and YouTube.\r\n\r\nGoogle Play Movies has been offering movies in 4K and HDR10 for some time and recently started rolling out Dolby Vision. Nvidia Shield does not support it at this time but we hope to see support roll out later.\r\n\r\n Also read: First Dolby Vision titles appear in Google Play Movies\r\n\r\nYouTube is supported in 4K - not HDRYouTube on Nvidia Shield 2019 can be enjoyed in 4K resolution but is still limited to SDR. HDR is not supported. The reason is that Shield lacks support for both VP9-2 (it has VP9-1) and AV1 decoding in hardware. It is a strange situation when the standard bearer for Google's Android TV platform, Nvidia, lacks support for a several years old format (VP9-2) developed by Google.\r\n\r\nThe industry, including Apple, Google, Netflix, Microsoft and Nvidia, are now collaborating to promote the royalty-free AV1 video format. It is still a relatively new format and codec but Netflix and YouTube have started transitioning to it. Considering that both Google and Nvidia are members of the alliance, it is a strange omission in Shield 2019.\r\n\r\nWe had hoped that AV1 support was hidden in the box. Officially, AV1 will not be supported until Android 10 but of course Nvidia could have enabled it in other ways. Initially, we found that Nvidia Shield 2019 was capable of decoding an AV1 video clip in 1080p (24fps SDR) through the VLC app, but it appears to be a solution where AV1 is decoding in software. The clip would not play in other apps (Kodi including). Any AV1 video in higher resolution or frame rate would produce tons of playback errors or simply not play. To exclude other error factors, we sourced the same video clip in AV1 and VP9, all other video parameters unchanged. The VP9 clip worked on Shield 2019, while the AV1 clip failed. YouTube did not pull down AV1 video either even though the same video would play in AV1 through Chrome on a PC or a compatible Smart TV. There is nothing to suggest that AV1 support is hidden in Shield 2019.\r\n\r\nAs for audio support, Nvidia Shield excels in this area where other streaming players such as Apple TV 4K lack some capabilities that enthusiasts value. Specifically the option to bitstream Dolby Atmos and DTS:X in lossless audio codecs Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD MA. At this time, all streaming services serve Dolby Atmos in Dolby Digital Plus (E-AC-3) and Dolby has more than suggested that the next step for streaming will be AC-4 (codec for audio compression). Dolby TrueHD is the lossless codec used for Atmos on Blu-ray and UHD Blu-ray discs. Of course, Nvidia Shield is not a disc player but if you have ripped versions of your Blu-ray movies Shield can play them with apps like Kodi. Support for higher audio quality may be an important factor for users with a large library of ripped movies. If you use streaming services there are no benefits to be had at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the previous versions of Nvidia Shield are capable of handling certain aspects of Dolby Atmos, they lack official support for Atmos (a license from Dolby). Shield 2019 is the first to offer Atmos decoding, meaning that you can pull down Atmos from streaming services like Netflix.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Nvidia Shield (and Android TV) lacks flexibility in audio. There are signs that Android TV devices can soon be used as playback destinations in Google's multi-room system but at this time the feature is not active in our Shield. It is not possible to wirelessly connect Chromecast-compatible speakers to Nvidia Shield (or any Android TV device) either. Such functionality is currently exclusive to Apple TV (with AirPlay speakers) and Roku TVs (with Roku speakers).\r\n\r\nAnother new development is HDMI 2.1 along with its optional features like ALLM (Auto Low Latency Mode), QMS (Quick Media Switching) and VRR (Variable Refresh Rate). None of these are supported in Nvidia Shield 2019, which is a shame considered that TV makers are now starting to transition to HDMI 2.1.\r\n\r\nThe timing of the launch of Shield 2019 seems to suggest that Nvidia is not yet ready to transition to the 'next generation', i.e. AV1 and HDMI 2.1. If the company was on the verge of releasing a new Tegra chip with AV1 and a new hardware platform with HDMI 2.1, we doubt that it would have launched the 2019 box.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusionNvidia Shield 2019 is story about improvements in software more so than improvements in hardware. Since the original Shield in 2015, Google's Android TV platform has been redesigned around the concept of content rows. The user interface is more inviting and everything more polished so Shield no longer caters only to enthusiasts (with Kodi, Plex etc) but also a wider subset of users who primarily use streaming services. Some streaming apps are still missing though.\r\n\r\nAd:It is surprising how little improvement there is in Shield's 2019 hardware compared to the 2015 box. The new tube-design for Shield (with 8GB of storage) is not a succes in our opinion whereas the new remote control represents - besides its cheap plastic enclosure - a major step forward. The remote now configures itself to control your TV (on/off, volume after manual set-up). At the same time Nvidia has realigned its focus to center on streaming. Shield now comes bundled with the remote control rather than the game controller, which is optional. That is a reversal from the market positioning of the original Shield. The Tegra X1+ is fundamentally the same chip as the 2015 version, and there is no support for VP9-2, AV1 or HDMI 2.1 in the new box. Nvidia has also opted to reduce storage capability so Shield now starts at 8GB (4.5GB free after OS, apps), which is sad. 8GB is far from enough and we were constantly forced to remove apps and games.\r\n\r\nAs a platform for gaming, Android TV has so far failed to live up to its potential as a bridge to bring mobile games to the TV screen. Nvidia is now focusing on GeForce Now, its own streaming services for games. It is unique to Shield as it has not been made available for other Android TV devices. The quality of apps is generally lower than on some competing TV platforms and one big source of frustration is that Shield 2019 is constantly dropping apps from memory, meaning that an app has to load again almost every time you open it - even if it was open a minute ago. Nvidia's manual match frame rate function (in beta) is not up to par with Apple TV 4K's automatic, system level match functions, and it makes Dolby Vision in Shield 2019 useless with some TVs. Official Dolby Atmos support (decoding) is a nice addition.\r\n\r\nNvidia Shield 2019 offers a much improved user experience compared to the original version but these improvements are mainly a result of continuous software releases for Android TV - updates that are also available for the original box. You are left with an impression of lack of progress in the 4-5 years that have passed, and the timing of the launch suggests to us that Nvidia will not be a first-mover in the areas of HDMI 2.1 and AV1, both of which are starting to emerge in some market segments. Nevertheless, Shield 2019 is a good media player and the best Android TV device on the market, albeit pricey. \r\n\r\n\r\nPrice and retailers:US retailer UK retailer DE retailer\r\n How the score system works Apps is an evaluation of the app catalogue and the quality / user friendliness of the apps Features is an evaluation of the built-in functionality and how useful it is, as well as build quality User experience is an evaluation of user friendliness and the general use of the box, including the remote control Total score weighted as: 40% Apps, 30% Features, 30% User experience.

The reserve price for The Arcade of SGD780 million translates to an estimated land rate of SGD2,833 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr). The 20-storey office and retail property sits on a 2,035.4 square metre (approx. 21,909 square feet) site with a 999-year land tenure (effective from 20 April 1826).  Under the Draft Master Plan 2019, The Arcade site is zoned Commercial with a Gross Plot Ratio of 15. Subject to relevant approvals, the site could potentially be redeveloped into an integrated development, comprising a hotel, residential units, office and retail space. Tang Wei Leng, Managing Director at Colliers International, said, \u201cThis is a golden opportunity to lay claim to a historic site in an ever-evolving Raffles Place, the heart of Singapore\u2019s bustling commercial district. The Arcade is a landmark site that has borne witness to the remarkable transformation of Singapore and its economy over the past 50 years. Developers will now get the rare chance to redevelop the site \u2013 creating a new focal point of interest \u2013 and reshape the Singapore city skyline.\u201d Given its prime location in the city centre, proximity to wide-ranging amenities, and excellent transport connectivity, the site boasts great potential for the development of a mixed-use project. The developer could potentially redevelop the site to offer a 50-storey iconic, modern skyscraper, with panoramic views of the Marina Bay, and spectacular skyline of the new Downtown.  The site enjoys prominent dual frontage onto Raffles Green \u2013 a popular gathering place of executives and professionals in Raffles Place \u2013 as well as Collyer Quay, a main arterial road that connects to other parts of Singapore. It is also well-served by public transport with convenient access to the Marina Coastal Expressway, Pan Island Expressway and other major expressways. Additionally, the site has immediate access to the Raffles Place MRT interchange station, which connects the East-West and North-South Lines. According to a report by PWC and the Urban Land Institute, Singapore now offers the best real estate investment prospects in the Asia Pacific region. The Emerging Trends in Real Estate Asia Pacific 2020 report noted that sentiment for Singaporean assets has rebounded. It added that the office sector has largely absorbed the oversupply, and with vacancies at an all-time low and limited supply in the pipeline, confidence in medium-term prospects has returned.   Story continues Ms. Tang previously said, \u201cGlobal capital continues to seek quality assets in safe gateway cities. We expect investor interest in Singapore commercial real estate to remain robust, owing to the country\u2019s position as a global financial hub, its stable political environment, and pro-business policies. Within Raffles Place, there are probably no other redevelopment opportunities and we believe The Arcade site, with a 999-year land tenure, will be highly sought-after.\u201dThe Arcade is surrounded by many prominent buildings \u2013 including Ocean Financial Centre, Republic Plaza, One Raffles Place, OUE Bayfront and the upcoming CapitaSpring \u2013 which house renowned financial institutions and large corporations. A myriad of retail and dining options are also within easy reach in the Raffles Place area as well as the nearby Boat Quay leisure and entertainment hub.Currently, The Arcade comprises 127 office and retail units. Depending on the size of their property, each owner could stand to receive between SGD700,000 and SGD29.9 million from the successful sale of the development.The collective sale tender for The Arcade will close at 3pm on 7 July 2020.This is the second time that The Arcade has come up for collective sale. When it was first listed for en bloc sale in November 2019, Mr. Moeez Hatim Nakhoda, Chairman of The Arcade Collective Sale Committee, said, \u201cThe Arcade has a fantastic location in the heart of the CBD. It is highly visible and attracts heavy pedestrian traffic. Unfortunately, the building is ageing and fallen behind the times. As Raffles Place continues to evolve and surrounding buildings undergo revamp, the owners feel that it is time that The Arcade gets a complete makeover as well.\u201dThe previous collective sale tender for The Arcade closed on 8 January 2020.With the winding down of the success of residential en bloc sales, commercial properties are now trying to join in the bandwagon but the Covid-19 pandemic makes such deals even more difficult. Many commercial en bloc sale attempts fail because the asking prices are often too high. Two critical factors affecting the success of commercial sites going en bloc are pricing and location. Older commercial buildings especially, may see a need to catch the current wave as an exit strategy as their rental yields come under pressure due to competition from newer commercial buildings.One report said investors looking for alternatives to park their money in the wake of property cooling measures, would divert their attention to the strata office and shophouse markets as they are not subjected to this round of purchase or sales restrictions/encumbrances.Mr Paul Ho, chief mortgage officer at iCompareLoan, said: \u201cThe Arcade is a very prominent location in the very heart of District 1. As such, it will appeal to a lot of savvy investors.\u201dHe added, \u201cEven with the global economic uncertainties, Singapore remains an attractive location for investments to flow into, and properties like The Arcade are prime real estates worthy of investment.\u201dThe post The Arcade put up for collective sale again at $780 million appeared first on iCompareLoan Resources.

These technologies represented the biggest leap in graphics since the invention of programmable shaders in 2002, bringing cinema-quality reflections, shadows, and lighting to games.\nMicrosoft has recently released the DirectX 12 Ultimate graphics API alongside the Windows 10 May 2020 update, codifying GeForce RTX\u2019s innovative technologies as the standard for multi-platform, next-gen games.\nWith the release of today\u2019s new GeForce Game Ready driver, DirectX 12 Ultimate and its features are fully supported on GeForce RTX GPUs on Windows 10 operating systems using version 2004 or newer. To download and install this new driver, simply fire up GeForce Experience and click the \"Drivers\" tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectX 12 Ultimate gives developers a large, multi-platform install base of hardware to target, and ready-made tools and examples to work from -- all backed by time-saving middleware. This makes game development faster and easier, and enables more developers to add these innovative technologies to their games. Many developers have already crafted next-gen experiences featuring these technologies--there are over 30 DirectX Raytracing games shipping or announced--and now with the launch of DirectX 12 Ultimate, adoption of them is set to increase rapidly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith GeForce RTX, the first and only PC platform with support for these game-changing features, gamers are ready for the most advanced and graphically intensive games today and in the coming years.\nFor further details on the Ray Tracing, Variable Rate Shading, Mesh Shading and Sampler Feedback technologies in DirectX 12 Ultimate, head on over to this in-depth article.\nFurthermore, in addition to introducing support for DirectX 12 Ultimate, the Windows 10 May 2020 Update also added a new feature called Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling. This new feature can potentially improve performance and reduce latency by allowing the video card to directly manage its own memory.\nTo enable hardware scheduling, you can open \u201cGraphics Settings: Change Default Graphics Settings\u201d. Simply toggle the feature on and restart the system and you\u2019ll reap the full benefits of the feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRounding out support for the latest graphics APIs, this Game Ready Driver is also the first public driver from NVIDIA to provide full Vulkan 1.2 support and functionality on GeForce and TITAN GPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport For Newly Validated G-SYNC Compatible Displays\nOur newest Game Ready Driver driver adds support for 9 new G-SYNC Compatible displays - gaming monitors that deliver a baseline Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) experience that makes your gaming smoother, clearer, and more enjoyable. Included in the list is Samsung\u2019s new 2020 Odyssey gaming monitors, headlined by the 49\u201d 5120x1440 Odyssey 2020 G9, which is available from today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManufacturer\nModel\nSize\nLCD Type\nResolution\nVRR Range\n\n\nAOC \nAG273F1G8R3 \n27\u201d \nIPS \n1920x1080 \n48-240Hz \n\n\nASUS \nVG27AQL1A \n27\u201d \nIPS \n2560x1440 \n48-144Hz \n\n\nDell\nS2421HGF\n24\u201d\nTN\n1920x1080\n48-120Hz\n\n\nLenovo \nG24-10 \n24\u201d \nIPS \n1920x1080 \n48-144Hz \n\n\nLG \n27GN950 \n27\u201d \nIPS \n3840x2160 \n48-144Hz \n\n\nLG \n32GN50T/32GN500 \n27\u201d \nIPS \n1920x1080 \n60-165Hz \n\n\nSamsung \n2020 Odyssey G9 \n49\u201d \nVA \n5120x1440 \n60-240Hz \n\n\nSamsung \n2020 Odyssey G7 \n27\u201d \nVA \n2560x1440 \n60-240Hz \n\n\nSamsung \n2020 Odyssey G7 \n32\u201d \nVA \n2560x1440 \n80-240Hz \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThese newly-validated monitors give gamers even more choice when searching for a great gaming display.

As such, owners are now able to sell these units on the resale market.  Buyers have been willing to purchase units at premium prices following Zoom virtual viewings, says Adelyn Chan, associate division director at PropNex and founder of the D3 Dawson Team. Chan\u2019s team exclusively handles the resale of HDB flats and private properties in District 3, namely, the city-fringe areas of Alexandra, Bukit Merah, Commonwealth, Queenstown and Tiong Bahru. During the two months of the \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d that ended on June 1, some buyers were willing to commit to a purchase after having viewed the properties via virtual tours only. For instance, last month, a 669 sq ft, three-room flat at SkyVille and another similar-sized unit at SkyTerrace were sold after just one virtual viewing. The units were sold at around $650,000 to $700,000 each. Virtual open houses of these flats received more than 10 attendees each time, says Chan. Despite the more cautious sentiment and an expected recession for Singapore this year, there will be more \u201cmillion-dollar flats\u201d entering the market in the Dawson area, notes Chan.    Adelyn Chan, founder of PropNex\u2019s D3 Dawson Team (13th from right) and her fellow agents (Photo: Adelyn Chan) Associate division director Dena Sandras and James Ho, associate group director at PropNex, also brokered the sale of a five-room flat in Tanglin Halt for close to $900,000 at the end of May\u00a0through virtual means. The 1,184 sq ft unit is in a 12-year-old HDB block that is located within a short walk of the Commonwealth MRT Station on the East-West Line. Not being able to conduct its usual roadshows and sales canvassing, Chan\u2019s team sends periodic updates to residents through emails and phone messages, and conducts frequent virtual viewings. \u201cI used to think that virtual viewing worked more for new-launch projects which were sold off-plan rather than resale apartments because buyers wanted to inspect the condition of the actual completed units,\u201d says Chan. \u201cBut that has changed.\u201d  Even when the economy resumes fully, Chan expects home buyers to continue browsing for a home online to shortlist the properties that they are interested in visiting physically. \u201cBuyers can view as many units as they want online,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe are now conducting intensive training on virtual selling for our agents.\u201d   Story continues Earlier in April, PropNex\u2019s D3 Dawson team also brokered the sale of a 1,055 sq ft, five-room, maisonette flat at SkyTerrace @ Dawson for $1.01 million. The buyer had viewed the flat physically just before the circuit breaker kicked in on April 7.Ho handled the sale together with his colleague, Diane Ong, associate marketing director of PropNex. By having colleagues collaborate through their \u201cSwing system\u201d, the agents can split advertising cost as well as the commission among themselves. The system allows up to 60 agents to market their units collectively and handle enquiries more quickly.Upcoming HDB projects in the area that are scheduled to be completed by end of this year are SkyResidences, SkyParc and SkyOasis, provided there have not been any construction delays as a result of remaining Covid-19 measures and outbreak of infections among construction workers at the foreign workers\u2019 dormitories.These new developments are the result of the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) programme in the Tanglin Halt and Margaret Drive area announced six years ago as part of an effort to renew the Queens-town HDB estate, one of Singapore\u2019s oldest.  \"Sky\" developments incorporate landscaped gardens and communal spaces. They are also conveniently linked to the 1.3km Alexandra Canal Linear Park, which connects to Robertson Quay and Clarke Quay (Photo: EdgeProp Singapore)The new HDB projects \u2014 Sky-Residences, SkyParc and SkyOasis \u2014 are part of a new generation of public housing developments that incorporate landscaped gardens and communal spaces within the development. They will also be linked to the 1.3km Alexandra Canal Linear Park which connects with Robertson Quay and Clarke Quay along the Singapore River. HDB is also building a 200m-long Dawson eco-corridor from Dawson Road to Tanglin Road, which is slated for completion by the end of this year. These HDB flats are located near the Queenstown MRT Station.More Build-To-Order (BTO) developments will join these \u201cSky\u201d developments in the near future.HDB launched a traffic impact assessment study last October with plans to build about 5,000 new HDB flats in the area by 2027. The first 2,060 BTO flats on two sites could be launched by 2021 and 2022. These flats will likely be near amenities such as Queensway Shopping Centre, Alexandra Hospital and Ikea, and are expected to be sought-after when they are launched for sale.Read also:7,800 BTO flats will be offered in August 2020 [UPDATE] Property sector in limbo as projects\u2019 sales galleries stay closed Million-dollar HDB unit at SkyTerrace @ Dawson sold during circuit breaker Post-Covid-19 recovery in private residential market expected to be similar to post-H1N1 rally Expanded Covid-19 temporary measures offer relief for buyers of new homes See Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools Million-dollar HDB unit at SkyTerrace @ Dawson sold during circuit breaker  Expanded Covid-19 temporary measures offer relief for buyers of new homes Resale HDB volume drops 7% in 1Q2020, worse performance expected for next quarter HDB resale price index remains unchanged for 1Q2020 En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

Like other top oil firms, Aramco has cut capital spending for 2020 after the pandemic brought an unprecedented drop in oil demand and hammered crude prices. Oil majors have cut workforces by 10% to 15% to cuts costs and as part of restructuring plans.  Most of those who lost jobs at Aramco were foreigners, the sources said. One source estimated that 500 people had been laid off, adding that the job losses were mostly based on performance and similar actions took place each year. Aramco has more than 70,000 employees. \"Aramco is adapting to the highly complex and rapidly changing business environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We constantly review and revisit our operating expenditures where necessary to continue driving operational excellence and profitability,\" Aramco said in a statement. \"We are not providing information regarding the details of any action at this time, but all our actions are designed to provide us more agility, resilience and competitiveness, with a focus on long-term growth,\" it said. Bloomberg was first to report the job cuts. Qatar Petroleum, one of the world\u2019s biggest energy companies, has also laid off foreigners and cut its spending plans to cope with the slump in oil and gas demand which has hit global economies, industry sources have told Reuters. Kuwait, a key Gulf oil producer, plans to stop hiring foreigners for its oil sector for a year, the Kuwaiti oil minister said this month.

The property was originally scheduled to be put up for sale at an owner\u2019s auction in March, but the owner decided to hold it off due to concerns over Covid-19, says Edmund Tie, which is handling the sale of the property. As property auctions still have not been allowed to continue, the unit is being marketed under private treaty. Spanning 947 sq ft, the one-bedroom unit is located on the second floor of Loft @ Stevens. It is well-maintained and in a move-in condition, describes Joy Tan, head of auction and sales at Edmund Tie.    The unit for sale has a very unique layout, and is the only unit in the development with a private pool (Credit: Edmund Tie)\u00a0 The owner first purchased the property as an investment in March 2011 for $1.3 million ($1,299 psf), and now wants to sell it to diversify his property portfolio. The price tag of the unit, being below $2,000 psf, is attractive, says Tan. \u201cRecent new launches in the area have surpassed $2,000 psf, such as Dalvey Haus, just a minute walk away, [in which one unit] transacted at $3,228 psf; and Kopar at Newton, which launched at an average price of $2,350 psf,\u201d she explains.  Typical one-bedroom units in Loft @ Stevens have been rented out at between $2,000 and $2,500 per month, says Tan. However, she believes this unit could fetch a higher rent as \u201cit has a very unique layout with a private pool\u201d. It is in fact the only unit in the development with a private pool, according to Tan.    The living and dining area, with a kitchenette (Credit: Edmund Tie) Tan believes the strongest draw of the property is its prime location along Stevens Road, which is off Bukit Timah Road. It is a two-minute walk to Stevens MRT Station on the Downtown Line. The development is also near schools such as Singapore Chinese Girls\u2019 School and St Joseph\u2019s Institution. Residents at Loft @ Stevens also have easy access to amenities at Balmoral Plaza, a five-minute drive away. The unit on the market is suitable for couples or small families, for their own stay, or for investment purposes, says Tan. \u201cAs it is near several prestigious schools and a stone\u2019s throw to Orchard Road, it would attract both families with school-going children looking to enter the schools, and tenants working in the Orchard Road area.\u201d    View from the bedroom (Credit: Edmund Tie)   Story continues Loft @ Stevens was completed in 2013, and comprises 44 freehold units. The most recent transaction at the development was in September 2019, when a 355 sq ft unit on the second floor changed hands for $760,000 ($2,140 psf).Prior to that, another 377 sq ft unit on the fifth floor sold for $760,000 ($2,017 psf) in June 2019.Read also:Edmund Tie\u2019s auction team rakes in $10 mil in sales during circuit breaker A pair of two-bedders at Seahill priced below $1.3 mil each Freehold strata terraced house at Este Villa going for $2.35 mil See Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools Freehold three-bedder at Dynasty Lodge going for $2.99 mil Edmund Tie\u2019s auction team rakes in $10 mil in sales during circuit breaker A pair of two-bedders at Seahill priced below $1.3 mil each Transaction volume by foreign home buyers fall 26.1% in 1Q2020 En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

We factored in that the market\u2019s cost of deposits have fallen, hence allowing us to lower our deposit rates and cost of deposits so that we can maintain our floor rate at 0.1%,\u201d said Mr Victor Lee, CEO of CIMB Bank Singapore. CIMB Bank Singapore made the decision to stay their floor rate after a group of individuals who were affected by banks\u2019s recent decision to increase mortgage rates raised objections. In asking how CIMB Bank Singapore could raise its mortgage rates during Covid-19 pandemic, the group said: \u201cWhen signing up for a mortgage that is based off an industry benchmark rate such as SIBOR or SOR, it is common for there to be a floor rate in the mortgage document. Typically, it say something like this: \u201cIn the event that the [rate] falls below 0.10%, the [rate] shall be fixed at 0.10%.\u201d    Story continues The group asked those affected by the CIMB Bank Singapore to go direct to Financial Industry Dispute Resolution Centre (FIDREC). FIDREC is an industry-funded organisation aimed at making the resolution of financial dispute affordable.\u201cSeveral of us have already individually gone to Fidrec and we recommend that you should too. However, for the particular case of the CIMB floor hike, we still do not think that this is a long-term solution. What CIMB has done is so egregious and against any reasonable person\u2019s understanding of the Letter of Offer that this practice needs to be stopped at the root. Even if an individual case goes through mediation or arbitration by Fidrec, it will not stop CIMB or any financial institution from writing an unfair contract. Ironically, it creates a strong incentive for CIMB to write unfair contracts. If only 10% of people raise a case to Fidrec, CIMB will still be able to continue to exploit the other 90% of people \u2013 which is an attractive bet if the bank wishes to act against the interests of consumers. Even if an individual is successful in his case in Fidrec, it will not make CIMB\u2019s practices illegal.\u201d Mr Paul Ho, chief mortgage officer at iCompareLoan, said: \u201call affected individuals are eligible for a two-year fixed rate package of 0.9% or a three-year fixed rate loan package of 1.1%. \u201d He added, \u201cThe eligibility period is till unclear and the bank should provide more clarity on this.\u201dThe affected group of customers said they \u201caccept CIMB\u2019s apology. Homeownership is not possible without fair and honest mortgages. We look forward to CIMB reviewing their terms and conditions to ensure their mortgages are indeed honest. Our website HonestMortgages.sg will remain accessible as a learning point for consumers going forward.\u201dThe post CIMB Bank Singapore maintains its floor rate after customers complain appeared first on iCompareLoan Resources.

The shares are part of a $5 billion recapitalisation package announced on Tuesday to help the airline weather the coronavirus crisis, which the International Air Transport Association estimates will cost the industry a record $84 billion in 2020.  The notes carry a coupon rate of 3% for the first three years, rising to 5% in year four, 7% in year five and 9% in year six, giving the airline an incentive to redeem them. \"We would certainly be expecting to repay that over a 3-5 year period,\" Chief Financial Officer Martin Murray said in an analyst briefing posted to the airline's website late Tuesday. Murray said the package, which also includes a HK$11.7 billion rights issue to current shareholders including Swire Pacific Ltd <0019.HK>, Air China Ltd <601111.SS> and Qatar Airways, would more than halve the airline's gearing levels. \"That in turn restores access to both the equity and debt market and allows us to tap that market later in the year or next year for equity and debt,\" he said. The Hong Kong government could gain a 6% stake in Cathay via HK$1.95 billion of warrants convertible to shares. Finance Secretary Paul Chan said on Tuesday it was not the goverment's intention to remain a long-term shareholder in Cathay. Swire, which owns 45% of Cathay, has agreed to remain a controlling shareholder for as long as the government owns preference shares or any amount of a HK$7.8 billion bridging loan remains outstanding. Daiwa analyst Kelvin Lau told clients he expected the airline's share price to come under pressure because of the potential 43% dilution from the recapitalisation package.

According to Aaron Wan, group district director at PropNex Realty and the seller's\u00a0agent, the 1,410 sq ft unit will go for $2.85 million ($2,021 psf) when the option to purchase is eventually signed. Wan says the transaction marks a new record psf price for a three-bedroom unit at the freehold development.    The Sea View is a freehold development on Amber Road. (Picture: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore)\u00a0 The Sea View, located on Amber Road, is a 546-unit development with one- to three-bedroom units. Three-bedders range from 1,518 to 2,928 sq ft, while other units are 527 to 1,410 sq ft. According to URA caveats, the previous record price for a three-bedroom unit at The Sea View was for a 1,647 sq ft unit on the 19th floor, which changed hands for $3.2 million ($1,943 psf) in January 2018.  According to Wan, the buyer was looking to purchase a new home in the East Coast area and was exploring available resale properties and new projects. \u201cThe Sea View stood out for him, given that the development sits on a relatively large site area of 185,580 sq ft. It is also rare to find a high-floor, sizeable, three-bedroom unit in District 15 on the resale market these days,\u201d he says. Separately, Wan was a cobroke agent who represented a buyer that purchased a pair of adjacent bungalows in Pasir Ris on June 4, also during Phase One of the reopening. The two 99-year leasehold properties at 114 and 114A Pasir Ris Road each sit on a 5,000 sq ft plot, and were sold after virtual viewings. The two-storey bungalows have a built-up area of 6,500 sq ft each. According to Wan, the two properties were jointly sold for close to $7 million in total, which is at a land rate of about $700 psf and about $3 million below their valuation. While Wan represented the buyers, Charlotte Ang and Elena Ang of OrangeTee & Tie were the exclusive agents for the developer of the bungalows.    A pair of bungalows on Pasir Ris Road was sold for close to $7 million on June 4. (Picture: Aaron Wan/PropNex Realty) \u201cGiven the challenging market situation at the time, the owner felt that it was more prudent to find a buyer who could offer a reasonable price, so that he could realise a significant part of the value of his property,\u201d says Wan. \u201cThe price of $7 million is also a reasonable offer, especially since the property will become home to a large multi-generational family.\u201d He adds that the buyer plans to knock down the dividing wall on the ground floor to allow access between the two houses.   Story continues Anecdotally, Wan says that buyers and sellers in the resale market have grown more comfortable in relying on virtual home viewings to close deals, especially after the two-month \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d period. He adds that the extra hurdles during the sales process meant that only serious investors and home buyers were active in the resale market in the past few weeks, and they were more likely to close deals if the property met their expectations and the price was realistic.\u201cSome buyers still expect to see more fire sales appear on the market in the coming months, and cash-rich investors hunting for investment properties in prime Districts 9, 10, and 11 are moving quickly to secure deals when the properties are realistically priced,\u201d says Wan.See Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools Hong Kong\u2019s Weave Co-Living to invest $500 mil in Singapore via JV  Seller of 11 Amber Road unit makes $1.05 mil profit From clicks to bricks - Alan Tan of Alan Photo diversifies into property development HDB market stages price turnaround in 4Q2019, climbing 0.5%  En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

(Photo: JAY DIRECTO/AFP via Getty Images)   By David Finnerty June is shaping up to be a good month for Southeast Asia\u2019s currencies, with every one gaining. The rebound is narrowing coronavirus-induced losses sustained by just about every foreign exchange in the region this year. While the Indonesian rupiah, Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit all showed improvement, the Philippine peso is by far the best-performing currency in 2020 with its 1% gain. The rupiah, which has surged 15% this quarter, may be positioned to challenge the peso given strong foreign demand for the nation\u2019s debt. Here\u2019s a closer look at the main factors influencing the region\u2019s FXs in the second half.   (Source: Bloomberg)   Peso The peso\u2019s outperformance is partially due to an improving current account, with imports in April down by the most since 2009 as the nation was under lockdown. However, it is facing growing headwinds from declining oversees remittances. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has also signaled concern over the appreciation by intervening to stop further gains. Investors will be awaiting guidance on the currency from BSP\u2019s policy meeting on Thursday. The central bank is expected to keep rates unchanged after slashing rates by 125 basis points this year. Rupiah Foreign funds have returned for local debt, attracted by the second-highest yields in Asia, after selling about $9.5 billion of government bonds in February and March. There have just been $996 million of inflows since then, indicating potential for further rupiah gains. Bank Indonesia still considers the currency as undervalued amid low inflation in Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy, and expectations that the current account deficit will narrow to 1.5% this year. However, near-term gains maybe limited as the central bank cut its key rate by 25 basis points last week, opening the door for further easing. Baht The Thai baht rose 5.8% this quarter, narrowing the year\u2019s loss to 3.4%. The nation\u2019s current account surplus has given it a boost, but it\u2019s dwindling in the absence of tourism revenues in the lockdown. However, rising gold prices have provided some support for the bullion trading hub. Headwinds to baht\u2019s further gains are likely to come from the Bank of Thailand. It warned this month it\u2019s ready to take steps to ensure the currency\u2019s strength doesn\u2019t hurt the economy. Investors will be monitoring the Wednesday policy meeting, where it\u2019s widely expected to keep its key rate unchanged at 0.5%, to see there are currency-related measures. Singapore Dollar The Monetary Authority of Singapore manages the currency against major trading partners as a policy tool, rather than using interest rates like other central banks. While the nation\u2019s relaxation of virus-related curbs last week is positive for the local currency, data on Tuesday is forecast to show core inflation has deteriorated further in May.   Story continues That\u2019s likely to support the MAS\u2019 current stance of allowing for a weaker currency to spur the trade-reliant economy. The Singapore dollar is down more than 3% this year.RinggitVolatile oil prices and political turmoil have weighed on the ringgit, leaving it at the bottom of the region\u2019s currency rankings so far this year. After falling more than 5% in the first three months, it\u2019s barely up 1% in the second quarter. The ringgit may struggle given FTSE Russell has kept Malaysia on a watchlist for possible exclusion from its World Government Bond Index.Inflation data on Wednesday is expected to provide cues on Malaysia\u2019s economy and any disappointment could set the stage for additional rate cuts.Below are the key Asian economic data and events due this week:Monday, June 22: RBA\u2019s Lowe on panel, New Zealand credit card spending, China 1-year and 5-year loan prime rate, South Korea 20-day export/import Tuesday, June 23: Japan PMI\u2019s and machine tool orders, South Korea PPI, Singapore CPI Wednesday, June 24: Australia skilled vacancies, RBNZ rate decision, Bank of Japan summary of opinions, China 1Q BoP current account balance, Malaysia CPI, Thailand customs, trade balance and Bank of Thailand rate decision Thursday, June 25: Australia job vacancies, New Zealand trade balance, Japan all industry activity index, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas rate decision Friday, June 26: New Zealand consumer confidence, Tokyo CPI, South Korea consumer confidence, Singapore industrial production \u00a9 2020 Bloomberg L.P.

(Photo: EMMANUEL DUNAND/AFP via Getty Images)   By Dan Murtaugh An Israeli startup is hoping a new engine design can help bring power to remote outposts in Asia. Aquarius Engines Ltd. announced a partnership with Nokia Oyj on Monday for a small-scale electrical generator using its unique low-maintenance design. The company is targeting far-flung locations in Asia to power remote populations and telecommunications centers. The field test in the Philippines is expected to begin this year and run several months, providing the company with feedback as it prepares for mass production, said Gal Fridman, Aquarius\u2019s chairman.  The generators can power commercial and industrial sectors that need around-the-clock electricity in remote spots, or help support wind and solar generation when the sun goes down or breezes halt. It underscores the increased attention businesses are paying to off-grid power, which drew nearly $1 billion in corporate investments during the previous two years combined, according to Wood Mackenzie Ltd. The engine \u201ctechnology enables us to open huge markets that were once totally off-limits,\u201d said Stuart Hendry, vice president of Nokia Enterprise, Asia Pacific. \u201cWe will have the ability to supply power to those residing in extremely isolated areas such as remote islands, high in the mountains or deep in the jungle. Aquarius, headquartered in Rosh Ha\u2019ayin in central Israel, uses what it calls a free piston linear engine, in which a single piston rod moves back and forth between two engine heads. It still uses fossil fuels such as gasoline, diesel or LPG, but it\u2019s a fraction of the size of competing models and doesn\u2019t need lube oil, reducing the need for maintenance.  That last part is important, because traditional generators can require maintenance and oil changes every 200-400 hours, which becomes expensive when technicians need to take long truck, boat or helicopter rides to reach them. Aquarius engines need maintenance once every 1,000 hours or so, according to the company\u2019s website. \u201cThere\u2019s no oil and just one moving part,\u201d Fridman said. It\u2019s much more \u201cefficient than any conventional engine today.\u201d The company didn\u2019t disclose where in the Philippines the generators would be tested, only that it\u2019s a two-hour boat ride from the nearest grid connection. The partnership deal will see Nokia offer cloud computing support to the generators to enable real-time monitoring, while also potentially distributing the equipment to its enterprise clients in Asia. Telecommunications companies could be a key user as they roll out high-powered towers and equipment to upgrade networks to 5G standards, Fridman said.   Story continues Fridman sees generators as just the first step so the company can begin generating cash. Eventually he sees applications in other industries, such as acting as range extenders for electric vehicles.\u201cWe\u2019re intending to to change the whole system of engines,\u201d he said.\u00a9 2020 Bloomberg L.P.

Put your staff in a cardboard box. That is the advice of a British company making social distancing screens from recycled cardboard to help businesses open up after lockdown while keeping staff safe. \"As people have started to come back to work we've switched to making a range of distancing-at-work products such as free-standing screens, counter screens and desk partitions,\" Iain Hulmes, Chief Executive at Pallite, told Reuters.  The company, 70 miles (112km) northwest of London, used to make recyclable cardboard pallets and boxes for industry but has now developed an entirely new range of products to cope with new workplace demands in the wake of the pandemic including wall screens, desk and table dividers with clear polyester film windows, free-standing signs and even pop-up desks for homeworkers. \"One of our workers at home found that she was struggling to work at home so we created a pop-up desk. That desk has sold over 5000 units in just five weeks with nothing but 5 star reviews,\" Hulmes said. Three sizes of desks, all made from laminated honeycomb paper, can hold 50kg of weight and can be assembled in less than a minute. A desk for an adult costs 26 pounds. Not far from Pallite's Wellingborough factory is Concept Conversions who sent all their staff home for the lockdown apart from four people all working in separate rooms. Director, Ralph Allen, says he is trying to have some fun with themes and colours while using Pallite social distancing measures to keep his staff safe as they return to the office. \"It's pretty extreme to put your staff into cardboard boxes so the reason for cutting the windows and trimming them in those colours was because I've got a Manchester United supporter sitting at my desk and I support Liverpool. Well, that could become Liverpool again couldn't it?\" he said referring to the red trim.

Find out more about how we test.\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce Now is finally out of beta. Finally, after sitting there for such a lengthy period and kind of getting lost in time, it\u2019s now available for everyone with a membership to use, offering a free account as well as a paid Founders membership with added privileges like Priority Access and an extended session length.Nvidia GeForce Now was kind of a thing before we heard word one about Google Stadia or Mcrosoft xCloud. And, despite its launch delays, hitting the streets a few months after the other two services, it\u2019s the only free game streaming service on the market. That should lead to more folks trying it out.Now that Nvidia GeForce Now is out in the wild, let\u2019s take a look at what the service offers its members, both free and paid, to see if it\u2019s worth signing up for.(Image credit: Nvidia)Price and availabilityNvidia GeForce Now is out right now and is available in two different tiers: Free and Founders. The Free plan is, you guessed it, free, and will allow users to play games in their existing PC game library for up to an hour at a time. There's another catch, too: Free users just have \"standard access,\" this means that when the servers are feeling particularly congested - think launch conditions - you'll have to deal with a queue to play your games.\u00a0The Founders version gets rid of this server queue, giving paying members \"Priority Access\", four hours to play at a time and, turning on ray tracing in games - something Google Stadia just can't do. This plan will set users back $4.99 a month, though this price will only be in place for 12 months. We're not sure what the price will jump to after the first year, but we can easily see it doubling to $9.99 a month.\u00a0When you compare the pricing to Google Stadia, GeForce Now is an extremely attractive offer. Not only does Nvidia's service actually have a free tier that's available now, but you also don't have to drop $129 upfront to get into the service. If you're curious about online streaming and want to try the tech out, GeForce Now is objectively the most accessible way to do it.\u00a0(Image credit: Nvidia)Design and interfaceOne thing that Google Stadia has is a user interface that's easy to use and pleasant to look at, even if it does have some issues. The same can't really be said of Nvidia GeForce Now.Rather than being able to launch the service from Google Chrome, you're going to have to install the GeForce Now client. From there, you'll have to either pick one of the featured games on display or type in the game you're looking for in the search bar at the top of the UI.\u00a0Once you add the game you're looking to play, you can launch it, and it will take you to the store it's located on. However, this can get a little complicated. For instance, when we tried to add Wolfenstein Youngblood to our account, there were two options that came up. The first one that we added to the account took us to the Bethesda launcher, where we did not own the game and therefore couldn't play it. So, we had to quit all the way out and add the game to our library again, but clicked the second option this time, which fortunately was located on Steam.\u00a0It's a minor annoyance, to be sure, but if you already own a game on a specific platform and it's available elsewhere, you could be in for some tedium.\u00a0And, of course, we can't talk about selecting games without mentioning the games that are incompatible with the service. Many games from huge publishers like Square Enix and Rockstar Games are simply missing. Now, we tried to get around this by launching a different game and launching something like Shadow of the Tomb Raider or Final Fantasy XV from there but it failed. GeForce Now practically yelled at us saying \"You can't play this game right now.\" You can only play the game you launch from the GeForce Now app, even if it sends you to the Steam library UI.There are some settings you can adjust through the UI, though they aren't super plentiful. You can adjust streaming quality to favor performance, saving data or a balance between the two, enable Discord integration and toggle a network status indicator.\u00a0The user interface might be the area where Nvidia GeForce Now could use the most improvement. It's not, like, unusable, but it can be difficult to navigate efficiently.\u00a0(Image credit: Nvidia)PerformanceA hot topic when it comes to game streaming services these days is obviously going to be performance. There are a lot of folks, us included, that are a bit skeptical about streaming's takeover in the world of games, so this is the one thing that Nvidia GeForce Now has to nail if it's going to succeed.\u00a0And in our experience, it's fine. Now, full disclosure: so far we've only really played games on the service at home on a gigabit wired internet connection, so if you have a more modest internet connection your experience is definitely going to vary.\u00a0While at home on that fast internet connection though, we don't experience any hiccups at all. Playing through The Witcher III: Wild Hunt for the gazillionth time is an excellent experience, with Nvidia's servers easily able to handle the game at 1080p with all the settings maxed out, including the dreaded Nvidia Hairworks. It is a shame that this is the max resolution and aspect ratio that the service supports, but that's not enough to really knock it, especially at this introductory price.\u00a0However, once we moved on from a wired internet connection the experience sours a bit. We installed GeForce Now on a 2018 13-inch MacBook Pro and played a bit of Wolfenstein Youngblood. Now, the game absolutely looked amazing, thanks to the enabled RTX features, but something just wasn't right.\u00a0We can't put our fingers on it, but the fast-paced shooter doesn't feel quite as quick as it does when it's running on our PC. We don't have a way to scientifically measure the lag, but there was something, though it was pretty minor. It's likely that lag is just something that nascent streaming services like Google Stadia and GeForce Now will have to grow out of as the technology matures, but for now we'd much rather play on our own PC.After all, GeForce Now uses our existing PC game library, so we don't have much of a reason to use this service when we have a more capable gaming PC at our disposal. However, for folks that have an extensive PC game library but are either in between gaming PCs or can't afford one, this service might be the most affordable way to get your game on for cheap.\u00a0(Image credit: Nvidia)Early verdictNvidia GeForce Now is the best game streaming service around right now, but only because its competition is so weak. Performance is passable and the UI is messy, but the vast library and the more affordable pricing tiers make it much more appealing.\u00a0GeForce Now will likely evolve quite a bit over the next few years and we could see it becoming the de facto way to play your PC games while you're on the road. We can't wait to see what the future of this platform looks like.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nJackie ThomasSocial Links NavigationJackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN.

It may be just a few moments, or a few hours. The important thing is we have been able to play with it ourselves and can give you some sense of what it's like to use, even if it's only an embryonic view.

The new architecture will put the German luxury brand in a position to offer the latest in advanced driver assistance systems as well as the development of autonomous driving.\nNvidia Chairman Jensen Huang called it a \u201conce in a lifetime partnership\u201d that he believes will change the face of the automotive industry.\n\n(BMW, Mercedes suspend AV development deal.)\nWhat the partnership calls for is, essentially, Nvidia to provide an architecture with computing power that is much more powerful than what will be needed in 2024 so that Mercedes vehicles can be updated over-the-air with new technology for decades.\nNvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang said the new software architecture makes the Mercedes \u201cperpetually upgradeable.\u201d\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019re going to revolutionize the car ownership experience, making the vehicle software programmable and continuously upgradeable via over the air updates,\u201d Huang said. \u201cEvery future Mercedes-Benz with the Nvidia Drive system will come with a team of expert AI and software engineers continuously developing, refining and enhancing the car over its lifetime.\u201d\nA primary feature will be the ability to automate driving of regular routes from address to address. In addition, there will be numerous future safety and convenience applications. Customers will be able to purchase and add capabilities, software applications and subscription services through over-the-air software updates during the life of the car.\nIf that doesn\u2019t sound entirely like the cutting edge of development, i.e. Tesla has been using over-the-air updates for years and other automakers are also currently doing it, Huang was quick to address the comparison.\n(Nvidia expands advanced driver technology for cars.)\n\u201cSurely they deserve a great deal of credit for pioneering and pushing autonomous driving, software upgradable features and, most importantly, inventing and discovering this new business model that is proven to be quite successful,\u201d he said, adding that selling software and other features that way was a model that, until now, had not been viable. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take this one giant step forward \u2014 unlike anything that\u2019s been done before.\u201d\nThe new architecture will be made available on every Mercedes in the line-up starting in 2024.\nFor Mercedes, it puts the company at the leading edge of development. The technological capability will be focused on safety initially with the ADAS component, according to Mercedes CEO Ola K\u00e4llenius. However, in an increasingly competitive luxury market where return-on-investment is critical, the ability to develop an additional revenue stream is an opportunity too good to ignore.\n\u201cWe took the first few baby steps of this over-the-air downloadability a couple of years ago,\u201d he said, \u201cand we can see in our app store that the interest is growing. This revenue stream is also growing.\n\u201cThe electric architecture that comes later this year with the new S Class makes that domain so much wider. So we see the opportunity here now to grow and with this partnership it\u2019s like we\u2019re taking the ultimate step, dovetailing with the overall software-driving architecture to open up the whole vehicle.\u201d\n(Nvidia unveils plans for higher powered processor.)\nBecause the 2024 models will come \u201cjuiced\u201d with more computing power than is necessary, a 10-year-old Mercedes could still be considered a cutting-edge vehicle, from a technological standpoint. This has far-reaching implications, including the value of a used Mercedes, which will ultimately impact the sticker price on the new models.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n            How to Care for Your Car\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheap Car Warranty\n\n\nEditor's Choice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Extended Car Warranty\n\n\nEditor's Choice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Recently Published\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rearview Mirror: A Sports Car from a Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of\n\n\n\n                        Sept. 30, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysts Predict Declining Tesla Sales in Q3\n\n\n\n                        Sept. 29, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverlanding is the New Hotness\n\n\n\n                        Sept. 29, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Load More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

(Photo by Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images)   By Claire Jiao Airlines operating in the Philippines called for swifter and more aggressive government support as a stilted restart to flights this month has done little to bring in much-needed revenue. Philippine Airlines Inc., Cebu Air Inc. and the local unit of AirAsia Group Bhd have only been able to fly about 10% to 15% of their flight schedules despite pent-up demand among stranded travelers and returning migrant workers, company officials said.  Lingering concerns over the novel coronavirus outbreak have kept half of regional airports closed, while others have restricted flights to only once a week, Philippines AirAsia Inc. Chief Executive Officer Ricardo Isla, said in an interview with Bloomberg News. Most of the Philippines\u2019 Covid-19 infections are in the major travel hubs of Metro Manila and Cebu City. Lengthy and changing local-government approval processes have forced last-minute flight cancellations, while jam-packed quarantine venues in the capital region have led to caps on international arrivals, said Jose Enrique Perez de Tagle, vice president of Philippine Airlines, which has resumed flights to the U.S., Canada, U.K., Australia and Japan. \u201cIt\u2019s a tedious process,\u201d said Rosario Logarta-Lagamon, Cebu Air\u2019s communications head. \u201cWe will not end the problem of stranded passengers if we do not add frequency today.\u201d Airlines across the world have been pushed to the brink as flights were grounded and countries shut borders to control the spread of Covid-19, prompting governments to throw a lifeline to the industry. The International Air Transport Association estimates the Philippines could take a $4.5 billion revenue hit from the pandemic and shed nearly 550,000 jobs this year.  The country\u2019s Air Carriers Association is pinning its hopes on Congress passing a 1.3-trillion-peso ($26 billion) stimulus bill by August, which would offer credit guarantees, loan facilities and fee waivers for the airline sector. Providing access to capital is more urgent and less costly than a separate government proposal that would allow state lenders to invest in distressed firms, the group\u2019s vice chairman Roberto Lim said. \u201cIt takes time to organize the government\u2019s financial institution, then subject the company to the due diligence and the valuation process,\u201d Lim said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the solution for liquidity, which is the problem today,\u201d While waiting for government support, Cebu Air is renegotiating with Airbus SE on the delivery of four new aircraft set for this year, and Philippine Airlines is reviewing whether it can postpone orders of seven to eight new aircraft initially scheduled for 2023, officials said. AirAsia Philippines\u2019 initial public offering, meanwhile, is now unlikely in the next two years and its order of three to five aircraft will be postponed to 2021, Isla said.   Story continues \u201cThe more this is unattended, the bigger the damage to the industry,\u201d Lim said.\u00a9 2020 Bloomberg L.P.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: JDSP_)\n\n\n\n\nNew rumors have emerged that Nvidia is gearing up to launch its RTX 3000 series of next-gen graphics cards this September with the widely-expected GeForce RTX 3080 going on sale alongside a rather unexpected addition \u2013 the RTX 3090.The rumors come from Igor\u2019s Lab (and reported by Wccftech), which is based on a timetable reportedly provided by its reliable sources. According to the rumors, Nvidia will be starting mass production of the GPUs in August, with a reveal and media event (including first official benchmarks) in September 2020.Find the best Nvidia GPU for youCheck out all the\u00a0best PC gamesWe'll show you\u00a0how to build a PCAs Wccftech points out, with this timetable, it\u2019s likely that Nvidia could show off the GPUs a bit earlier than the media event at a public event, possibly at Gamescom 2020 \u2013 which is going digital-only this year.Surprise RTX 3090While we\u2019ve been expecting the Nvidia RTX 3080 to launch around that time, one thing that stands out about this new rumor is the mention of an RTX 3090 launching at the same time.We\u2019ve heard a few rumors about an RTX 3090 before now, but if Nvidia actually does release a GPU by that name, it\u2019ll still come as a bit surprise.This is because Nvidia hasn\u2019t released a x90 chip since the GTX 690 back in 2012. Before then, an x90 GPU was a dual-chip card \u2013 and that\u2019s something Nvidia hasn\u2019t made since the Titan Z in 2014.Instead, Nvidia\u2019s flagship consumer cards are the Ti cards, like the RTX 2080 Ti. At first we dismissed the idea of an RTX 3090, and assumed that previous rumors were either false, or they were mistakenly talking about the RTX 3080 Ti.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.However, the persistence of RTX 3090 rumors is giving us second thoughts. What we don\u2019t know is that if (and that\u2019s a big \u2018if\u2019) the RTX 3090 exists, will it be a step above the RTX 3080 Ti, or will it simply replace it?Also, would the RTX 3090 once again be another dual-chip GPU?Nvidia going back to the x90 naming convention would certainly be an odd choice \u2013 and could end up confusing people.Wccftech actually has an interesting theory about why Nvidia may be embracing the x90. With both AMD and Intel releasing \u20189\u2019 series enthusiast products (the Ryzen 9 and Core i9 respectively), could Nvidia be aligning its products as well?If consumers are beginning to associate products with a \u20189\u2019 in their names with high performance, enthusiast, components, then that could be an explanation.Either way, we shouldn\u2019t have too long to wait to find out, if this new rumor is to be believed.Today's best Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti deals938 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $799View $876 $839.99View No price informationCheck WalmartShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesThese are the best gaming laptops of 2020\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nMatt HansonSocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, Core TechMatt is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Core Tech, looking after computing and mobile technology.

The new graphics card is based on the Turing architecture & features the TU106 core which is one of the reasons it is referred to as the Ultra edition.\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ultra Graphics Card With TU106 GPU Core & 4 GB GDDR6 Memory Spotted\nNote - The 6 GB listing could be an error in GALAX's database as it lists down the GTX 1660 Ultra model. However, the rest of the specifications as listed are different from the GTX 1650 Ultra.\nRelated Story NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDPThe NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 graphics card has seen so many variants that its literally insane just mentioning all of them again. We got to see the original GeForce GTX 1650 with the TU117 GPU, the GeForce GTX 1650 D6 with TU117 GPU, GeForce GTX 1650 SUPER with the TU116 GPU, & we're now getting a fourth variant, the GeForce GTX 1650 Ultra with TU106 GPU. The GeForce GTX 1650 Ti and the mobility lineup are also made up of various revisions and refreshes but the main focus is here is the desktop GeForce GTX 1650 discrete graphics card.\nComing to the specifications of the graphics card, GALAX (via Momomo_US) has so far been the first to list down the GeForce GTX 1650 Ultra along with its technical specs. The card features the TU106-125 GPU so its making use of the same chip that's featured on the GeForce RTX 2060 and the GeForce RTX 2070, except, the 125 SKU is cut-down significantly. The GPU houses 896 CUDA cores so that's a 14 SM unit design. The core clock for the chip is maintained at 1410 MHz base and 1590 MHz boost clock.\n\nThe 4 GB memory comes in GDDR6 flavor and is featured along a 128-bit bus interface at 12 Gbps. So that's a total bandwidth of 192 GB/s which should be enough to keep the card running with further room for memory overclock as the GDDR6 chips tend to overclock to around 14 Gbps with relative ease.\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX \"Turing\" Family:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 D6NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Rev 2.0NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 UltraNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 SUPERNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 SUPERNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti\n\n\n\n\nGPU ArchitectureTuring GPU (TU117)Turing GPU (TU117)Turing GPU (TU116)Turing GPU (TU106)Turing GPU (TU116)Turing GPU (TU116)Turing GPU (TU116)Turing GPU (TU116)\n\n\nProcess12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN\n\n\nDie Size200mm2200mm2284mm2445mm2284mm2284mm2284mm2284mm2\n\n\nTransistors4.7 Billion4.7 Billion6.6 Billion10.8 Billion6.6 Billion6.6 Billion6.6 Billion6.6 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores896 Cores896 Cores896 Cores896 Cores1280 Cores1408 Cores1408 Cores1536 Cores\n\n\nTMUs/ROPs56/3256/3256/3256/3280/3288/4888/4896/48\n\n\nGigaRaysN/AN/AN/AN/AN/AN/AN/AN/A\n\n\nCache1.0 MB L2 Cache1.0 MB L2 Cache1.0 MB L2 Cache1.0 MB L2 Cache1.0 MB L2 Cache1.5 MB L2 Cache1.5 MB L2 Cache1.5 MB L2 Cache\n\n\nBase Clock1485 MHz1410 MHz1410 MHz1410 MHz1530 MHz1530 MHz1530 MHz1500 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock1665 MHz1590 MHz1590 MHz\n1635 MHz (OC)1590 MHz1725 MHz1785 MHz1785 MHz1770 MHz\n\n\nCompute3.0 TFLOPs3.0 TFLOPs3.0 TFLOPs3.0 TFLOPs4.4 TFLOPs5.0 TFLOPs5.0 TFLOPs5.5 TFLOPs\n\n\nMemoryUp To 4 GB GDDR5Up To 4 GB GDDR6Up To 4 GB GDDR6Up To 4 GB GDDR6Up To 4 GB GDDR6Up To 6 GB GDDR5Up To 6 GB GDDR6Up To 6 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Speed8.00 Gbps12.00 Gbps12.00 Gbps12.00 Gbps12.00 Gbps8.00 Gbps14.00 Gbps12.00 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Interface128-bit128-bit128-bit128-bit128-bit192-bit192-bit192-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth128 GB/s192 GB/s192 GB/s192 GB/s192 GB/s192 GB/s336 GB/s288 GB/s\n\n\nPower ConnectorsN/AN/AN/AN/A6 Pin8 Pin8 Pin8 Pin\n\n\nTDP75W75W75W75W100W120W125W120W\n\n\nStarting Price$149 US$149 US$149 US$149 US?$159 US$219 US$229 US$279 US\n\n\nPrice (Founders Edition)$149 US$149 US$149 US$149 US?$159 US$219 US$229 US$279 US\n\n\nLaunchApril 2019April 2020July 2020June 2020November 2019March 2019October 2019February 2019\n\n\n\n\nGALAX GeForce GTX 1650 Ultra Graphics Card:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe GALAX GeForce GTX 1650 Ultra features a single 6-pin power connector to boot. It has a rated TDP of 90W. The card itself features a standard dual fan, dual slot cooling design with a large heat sink block running beneath the shroud. Display outputs include a single DVI, HDMI & Display Port.\n\nUltrabase clock 1410\ntime spy score3700\n\u2014 APISAK (@TUM_APISAK) June 29, 2020\n\nIn terms of performance, TUM_APISAK has already dug up a Time Spy result for the said graphics card and stated that it scores 3700 points which is a 12% increase over the standard GTX 1650 in the same benchmark. Some interesting thoughts about this GPU include its release time frame as its a couple of months prior to the release of the Ampere based GeForce RTX 30 series lineup. The green team won't be launching a entry-tier or mainstream Ampere product anytime soon but this marks another milestone in the clearance spree that we've been seeing for the Turing based entry level GPUs.\nWe can't say for sure whether this card will be released worldwide or if it will be kept exclusive to the Asian Pacific market. The GTX 1650 and GTX 1650 SUPER already retail at $149 & $159 US each so if the GTX 1650 Ultra is to enter the market, NVIDIA and its AIB partners would have to adjust its pricing segment of the GTX 1650 (non-SUPER) cards accordingly.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Rolls Out GeForce Driver 572.60 To Fix Black Screen Issues Related To RTX 50 Series GPUs\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n153\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n115\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n82\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n43\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nA Mac Studio Cluster Of Four Units, All Featuring Apple\u2019s Latest M3 Ultra, Consume Less Than Half The Power Of A Network Switch When Running At Idle\n\n\n\n37\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n857\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

As AImotive is a small company with no silicon fabrication capabilities, the licensing model is likely to be the more successful path as lons as the aiWare accelerator matches the claims made for it. Those claims are quite lofty with up to 4 TOPS [trillion operations per second] performance at just 1 W power consumption. By combining more cores, it is possible to scale up to 16 TOPS. Like many lower power accelerators, this scale up is handled in part by downscaling neural networks to a lower resolution.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n9.

Since launching its first internally designed SoC, the A4 in the iPad and iPhone in 2013, Apple has built a reputation as one of the best chip design firms in the world...The A-series SoCs are renowned among their competitive set for providing an excellent combination of low power consumption and high performance...The most recent generations of the A-series, the A11 Bionic and A12 Bionic, include a dedicated neural engine core optimized for ML [machine learning] applications on device. Apple claims this neural engine is capable of 5 TOPS in a smartphone.\n\"A version of this neural engine scaled up for an AD application could potentially match or exceed the performance of competing chips from Nvidia and Intel. If Apple can retain its power efficiency, it could help to address one of the issues with AVs, a significantly reduced range for EVs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n8.

The chips do potentially have a place in ADAS [advanced driver-assistance system] applications as well as for the secondary compute requirements for ADVs...Toyota is using Renesas R-Car chipsets in its upcoming partially automated system, Highway Teammate, that is expected to debut in 2020. However, in mid-2019, Toyota also announced a chip joint venture with Denso expected to launch in 2020. It is unknown at this time if the joint venture will utilize technology or expertise from Renesas.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n7.

Many of the dozens of electronic control units in modern vehicles are powered by NXP microcontrollers...Following a failed acquisition of NXP by Qualcomm in 2018, NXP partnered with Kalray to use Kalray's Massively Parallel Processor Array AI chips in combination with its own S32V SoC for an AD development compute platform. As the industry gets into second and third generation ADVs with more optimized sensor suites and software stacks, an opportunity for NXP to get a share of the market for these systems is expected, particularly if the Kalray partnership yields more powerful AI processing...In the near term, NXP's strong customer relationships in the automotive sector are expected to provide an opening for it to supply lower power secondary compute platforms for AD systems.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n6.

This internally developed system, dubbed the Full Self-Driving (FSD) computer, was unveiled at an investor event in April 2019. Using two custom ASICs [application-specific integrated circuits] and substantially upgraded sensor input bandwidth with up to 2.5 billion pixels/sec from the eight cameras, the FSD computer is a substantial improvement from the previous Nvidia platform. According to Tesla, the FSD computer is capable of 144 TOPS compared with 30 TOPS for the Nvidia Xavier.\n\"A performance level of this magnitude provides an improvement in image frame processing of 21 times when compared with the older Nvidia-powered Autopilot compute platform, with a claimed power consumption increase of just 25%. (The older compute platform used two Nvidia Parker SoCs and one Pascal GPU.)\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n5.

Throughout the years, Waymo has transitioned from using mostly off-the-shelf sensing and compute hardware to internally designed and manufactured components...Waymo has publicly acknowledged the use of Intel CPUs in its compute platform as well as unidentified GPUs. Waymo is also believed to be utilizing internally designed tensor processing units (TPUs) as part of its platform. TPUs are ASICs specifically designed to handle neural network computing workloads more efficiently and are widely used in various Google ML applications in its data centers...With high speed image processing and localization on high definition maps being an important component of AD, the use of TPUs in the Waymo compute platform potentially gives the company a significant boost in performance.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n4.

FPGAs are generally more costly than traditional CPUs but they offer a special combination of performance and flexibility. As AD remains relatively immature and the software is evolving rapidly, the silicon has not yet been optimized for these applications. As AD companies determine the best combination of silicon for the long term and AV volumes remain low, FPGAs like those produced by Xilinx can provide necessary performance without investing in custom ASICs that may prove to be short lived.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n3.

The new Snapdragon Drive Pilot platform is based on two chips, the ADAS Application Processor and the Autonomous Driving Accelerator. The application processor is based on Qualcomm's 8155 SoC, which combines ARM cores, GPU, and neural engine cores. The accelerator consists of additional neural engine cores. Configurations with a single ADAS SoC are targeted at the growing market for ADAS in mainstream vehicles. A configuration with dual SoCs is claimed to provide sufficient performance for level 2 or level 3 partially or conditionally automated systems.\n\"Adding the accelerator to a pair SoCs can potentially deliver up to 400 TOPS of performance at about 60 W-75 W of power consumption. This consumption level is considered enough for level ADVs, only requiring air cooling. Qualcomm claims about 33%-50% better performance per watt than NVIDIA's Orin SoC. Accelerator chips began sampling in late 2019 with the SoCs sampling in mid-2020. The goal is to have production programs by 2023.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n2.

Mobileye has been the leading developer of machine vision for ADAS and is a major power in that market segment. In 2018, Mobileye introduced its EyeQ4 chip and is currently producing sample quantities of the EyeQ5 for internal testing and customers (expected to go into volume production by 2021). The combination of two EyeQ5 chips with an Intel Atom CPU is expected to deliver 48 TOPS at the same 30 W as the NVIDIA Xavier. However, moving up to Level 4 AD is expected to require at least a XEON-class CPU similar to those used in data center servers and the combination of multiple XEON and EyeQ5 chips may not have an advantage over Pegasus.\n\"Most AD companies are using software with a combination of traditional deterministic algorithms that run well on the X86 CPU architecture with ML algorithms that work well on FPGAs and GPUs. In this way, Intel is likely to have a significant market share in combination with these other chips.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n1.

Using two Xavier and two Turing GPUs, the Pegasus processes 320 TOPS at an estimated 400 W. A number of AD development companies are using Pegasus for testing, and its architecture might be the basis for upcoming car computer systems from Volvo and Daimler...At the 2019 GTC China developer conference, Nvidia announced the launch of its Orin processor. This next-generation chip offers nearly 7 times the performance of Xavier...Orin processors are expected to be in production by late 2021...One of the claimed advantages of using Nvidia platforms is they all use the same basic architecture and software written for any particular variant can be scaled up or down as needed for a given application. Not all AD companies are sold on relying exclusively on Nvidia silicon, but many are using Nvidia GPUs in conjunction with Intel CPUs and in some cases FPGAs from Intel or Xilinx.\"\n\nRead more:\nExperts rank ChargePoint and 14 other major players in the world of electric-vehicle charging\nNikola Motors, a Tesla competitor with zero revenue, is worth $23 billion.

The latest of these reveals some alleged juicy details about the three launch cards, including a flagship model that features 24GB of GDDR6X and 350W TDP. There's also some news about those recent photographs of the GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition. \nThe report comes from Igor's Lab, which claims that the leaked images of the RTX 3080 Founders Edition are legitimate. Nvidia is said to be furious about the leak and is conducting an internal investigation to find the culprit. The top suspects are Foxconn and BYD (Build Your Dreams), both of which build the Founders Edition cooler.\n\nIgor Wallossek believes not even Nvidia's own product and sales manager had knowledge of the new Ampere Founders Edition design. Now that people know what to expect---and not everyone likes what they see--- Wallossek says the design is likely to change before release. With Nvidia's (and AMD's) next-gen cards rumored to arrive in September, that doesn't give team green a huge amount of time for a redesign.\nAnother interesting piece of info involves the cost of manufacturing. It was predicted that this would be higher than Turing's, but the FE's cooling system alone costs up to $150, meaning we can expect them to carry a hefty price tag. Additionally, the Founder's Edition is reportedly using a completely different PCB to the boards going out to manufacturers such as MSI, which will use a more rectangular shape.\n\n\n\nPart\nPCB\nChip\nModel\nExtension\nMemory\nInterface\nTBP\nConnectors\n\n\nSKU10\nPG132\nGA102\nRTX 3090\n(Ti/Super)*\n24 GB GDDR6X\n (Double-Sided)\n384-bt\n350 W\n3x DP, HDMI\n NVLink\n\n\nSKU20\nPG132\nGA102\nRTX 3080\n(Ti/Super)*\n11 GB GDDR6X*\n352-bit*\n320 W\n3x DP, HDMI\n\n\nSKU30\nPG132\nGA102\nRTX 3080\nnone\n10 GB GDDR6X\n320-bit\n320 W\n3x DP, HDMI\n\n\n\nMoving onto the specs, all three launch cards are said to be based on the GA 102 GPU, rather than each using a different GPU, as was the case with the RTX 2080 Ti, RTX 2080, and RTX 2070.\nThe three products will all use GDDR6X memory, with the GeForce RTX 3090 (Ti or Super) featuring a monster 24GB and a 384-bit memory interface, which suggests it could be marketed as a Titan RTX successor. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Asus raises RTX 5090 and RX 9070 prices, making graphics cards even more expensive \n\n\n\n Arm considers acquisition of data center chipmaker Ampere \n\n\n\nEven if the RTX 3090 is aimed squarely at enthusiasts with deep pockets, the RTX 3080 (Ti or Super) and RTX 3080 boast 11GB GDDR6X/352-bit and 10GB GDDR6X/320-bit, respectively, with both cards having a 320W TDP.\nAs with all leaks and rumors, take this one with a pinch of salt, but it goes without saying that these flagship Ampere cards will have to be beastly to compete with AMD's Big Navi, and high performance often means high prices.\nIn other Nvidia news, AMD recently revealed more details about its rival's DGX A100 system, for which it provides two Epyc 7742 processors.\n\n\n\n\n 50 comments\n \n4.6K likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows Defender misidentifies key driver, disrupting popular PC monitoring tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

(Image Credits: creper9000 at Reddit)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn unknown NVIDIA Ampere GPU, likely the RTX 3080, has had its 3DMark Time spy performance leaked courtesy of HardwareLeaks. While the benchmark could be either of the RTX 3080, 3080 Ti/Super or the RTX 3090, we have reason to believe it is the RTX 3080. The gaming performance shown here absolutely blows away the last generation flagship and showcases that NVIDIA is going to have a spectacular RTX 3000 series launch later this year.\nNVIDIA RTX 3080 gets Time Spy benchmark score - 31% faster than RTX 2080 Ti FE\nThe benchmark posted by _rogame shows NVIDIA's Ampere GPU scoring a very impressive 18257 points in Time Spy graphics test which is just under Kingpin's insane 2.38 GHz clocked RTX 2080 Ti variant. A traditional RTX 2080 TI FE variant clocks around 13939 points and the spotted Ampere GPU is roughly 31% faster than this. The question then becomes what exactly are we looking at? The NVIDIA RTX 3080, RTX 3080 Ti/Super or the RTX 3090? Well, I am fairly certain this isn't the RTX 3090/Titan because of several reasons (although I am not a 100% sure, just to be clear).\n\n\nBefore we get into why I think that way, let's look at the logged specifications of the benchmark. The GPU clock was detected at 1935 MHz and the memory clock, interestingly was only a meager 6000 Mhz. This is almost certainly a misread by the software due to the fact the card is using brand new GDDR6X memory (as memory clocks shown usually need to be multiplied by 8 to get the actual speeds but this is obviously wrong). This is indicative of an early engineering sample and performance as well as detection will likely improve as things go closer to launch.\n\nSo let's put on our [speculation] hats now and try to figure out what card we are looking at. NVIDIA is planning to launch three variants of the GA102 chip at launch. These are the SKU 10, 20 and 30. These will have 10, 12 and 24 GB of memory respectively and will likely form the RTX 3080, RTX 3080 Ti/Super/3090, and RTX 3090 / Titan cards. Considering NVIDIA is moving to a smaller process with the Ampere series of cards, we are expecting a big performance jump (from the improved clock speeds, core count and of course, IPC).\nSo here is what I did. I took the scores of the RTX 2080 Ti FE and Lightning Z and calculated a \"3DMark Time Spy\" variable that could roughly predict their score. You do this by taking their known stable boost clocks (as NVIDIA cards usually stay much higher than their advertised boost speeds) and forming the following equation = Core*CLock*3DMark Variable = Score. With the FE at a known stable boost of 1860MHz and Lightning Z at a known stable boost clock of 1995 Mhz, we can solve for the variable and get the following result = 0.001729.\nNow if you assume that nothing changed IPC wise between this generation and that, you can solve backward for the core count using the clock speed and score and will arrive at the following estimated core count:\u00a0 5455. You can also add in an IPC improvement of 20% to get a core count of 4546. Interestingly both of these rough core counts are close to leaked configurations of the GA102 with the SKU 10, 20 and 30 being 4352, 5248 and 5376 respectively. Considering there will almost certainly be *some* IPC improvement with Ampere, I am almost certain this is not SKU 30 or the top end card. In my opinion, what you are looking at, is the RTX 3080 or the RTX 3080 TI/Super/3090 mainstream flagship and not the 3090/Titan HEDT flagship. In other words, in order of probability - this is SKU10 or at a stretch SKU20, and probably not SKU30.

For the PCIe interface, the NVIDIA A100 is an Ampere generation GPU that is set to be a popular option for many markets. This move was widely expected as PCIe GPUs are still extremely popular. While the company\u2019s SXM modules, such as the ones we saw used in servers such as the Inspur NF5488M5 and\u00a0Gigabyte G481-S80 servers can utilize GPU to GPU NVLink, the PCIe GPUs are easy to integrate into existing servers.\nNVIDIA A100 PCIe Add-in Card Launched\nThe new NVIDIA A100 GPUs are rated for up to 250W operation. They are also based on PCIe Gen4. While they will work with current-generation Intel Xeon systems, they will need AMD EPYC 7002 Series \u201cRome\u201d CPUs to realize their full host facing bandwidth.\nNVIDIA A100 PCIe Launch Specs\nNVIDIA has a number of new technologies that came forward to this generation. With the NVIDIA A100 built on 7nm technology with 40GB of Samsung HBM2, the company was able to push transistor counts and add new acceleration for both existing FP32/ FP64 workloads as well as acceleration for new AI workloads. NVIDIA highlights a 20X gain in their slide, but that is looking at some fairly specific areas where new accelerators were introduced.\nNVIDIA A100 Specs SXM And PCIe\nWith a 250W TDP, the card does not have the same power and thermal headroom to run as the SXM variants. As the SXM power rises to 400W, there is a growing delta between the performance of PCIe and SXM based solutions. In the official specs, peak performance is listed as the same, but we would expect sustained performance to vary due to TDP.\nFinal Words\nPCIe cards are more important for the reseller and VAR community in this generation. With the\u00a0NVIDIA A100 4x GPU HGX Redstone Platform and the\u00a0NVIDIA DGX/ HGX A100 NVSwitch platform, server OEMs control the market for NVIDIA GPU servers more than in previous generations. With the PCIe cards, a VAR can purchase a system and integrate the GPUs separately. That is a subtle nuance but one of the most important changes to the NVIDIA A100 data center sales and distribution model.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n TAGSA100AmpereGPUNVIDIA \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleHPE Superdome Flex 280 2-8 Socket Server Arriving SoonNext articleSupercomputer Fugaku by Fujitsu and RIKEN Revealed at No. 1 Cliff RobinsonThey call me \"the STH news guy\" for a reason.  \n \nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAcemagic F3A an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 Mini PC with up to 128GB of RAM \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASUS ESC8000A-E13P Review an 8x PCIe GPU Server \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASRock Rack 4U8G-TURIN2 A Fresh Take on a Classic AI Server Design \n\n  \n\n\n\n2 COMMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIgor\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            June 22, 2020\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            8:35 am                                            \n\n\n\nWhat \u2013 if anything \u2013 is known about pricing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nemerth\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            June 22, 2020\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            10:05 am                                            \n\n\n\nWhat Igor said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEAVE A REPLY\n\n\nPlease enter your comment!\n\n\nPlease enter your name here\n\n\n\nYou have entered an incorrect email address!\nPlease enter your email address here\n\n\n\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign me up for the STH newsletter! \n\n\u0394 \nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Now Nvidia is rolling out drivers to match.\u00a0 \nThese latest drivers, available via GeForce Experience, bring DirectX 12 Ultimate support to Nvidia's RTX range of graphics cards. \n\nUpcoming PC games: The best new games to look forward to\n\n\nDirectX 12 Ultimate is intended to make it easier for game developers to make the most of next-generation graphics technologies, including ray tracing, variable-rate shading (VRS), mesh shading and more. This should make it easier for developers to craft new games using these technologies.\u00a0\u00a0\nNvidia says that this tech also gives devs a \"...multi-platform install base of hardware to target, and ready-made tools and examples to work from -- all backed by time-saving middleware. This makes game development faster and easier, and enables more developers to add these innovative technologies to their games.\"\n\n\n\nWhat does that mean for us gamers? Well, we should see the list of ray traced games grow for a start. There are already 30 games on that list and it'll continue to grow too.\nMicrosoft is also keen to point out that \u00a0DirectX 12 Ultimate will lead to an \"unprecedented alignment between PC and Xbox Series X\" in terms of graphics technologies.\u00a0\nIn the meantime, the combination of the support for DirectX 12 Ultimate in the Windows 10 May 2020 Update and Nvidia's new graphics drivers mean that PC gamers get access to a new feature designed to improve gaming performance.\u00a0\nKnown as Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling, this setting can be accessed via your \"Graphics Settings\" menu (search for that by pressing the Windows key) and, when activated, can potentially improve performance and reduce latency by giving your GPU more control over its memory.\u00a0\nIf all that's not enough, then you'll be pleased to hear that the latest Game Ready Driver also adds support for 9 new G-SYNC Compatible displays with a baseline Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) and smoother gaming experience. That includes support for the gargantuan and magnificent Samsung Odyssey G9 - a 49-inch gaming monster.\u00a0 \n\nBest gaming monitors: Top 4K, ultrawide and ultra fast monitors to buy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGames\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support Pocket-lint.

[+] January 7, 2018. / AFP PHOTO / Mandel Ngan        (Photo credit should read MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images)Getty\nNo automaker has a longer history of technological innovation than Mercedes-Benz. From the first drive that Karl Benz took on his Patent Motorwagen in 1886, the brand has frequently been the first to introduce new technologies to the auto industry including diesel, direct injection, electronic ABS and stability control. But the 21st century has seen new entrants like Tesla\nTSLA\n upending the industry with the shift to electrification and continuous updates through software. With the help of Nvidia\nNVDA\n, Mercedes-Benz is now aiming to catch up and hopefully surpass its new competitors like Tesla.\n\nOla Kallenius, Chairman of the Board of Management Daimler AG and Mercedes-Benz AG, talks about ... [+] future innovation of the car maker at the world premiere of the Mercedes-Benz Vision AVTR concept car announcement during the Daimler Keynote before the CES tech show Monday, Jan. 6, 2020, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin)ASSOCIATED PRESS\nDaimler CEO\u00a0 Ola K\u00e4llenius and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made a joint announcement today from their respective headquarters about the software-defined future of Mercedes-Benz vehicles. Starting in 2024, all new Mercedes-Benz models would incorporate a new electronic architecture powered at least in part by Nvidia\u2019s upcoming Orin system-on-a-chip (SoC).\u00a0\n\nThe Nvidia Orin system-on-a-chip family scales from a 10 TOPS/5W part for driver assist systems to ... [+] 2,000 TOPS/800W platform for fully automated vehicles.Nvidia\nInitially announced in December, 2019, Orin is the next-generation SoC designed by Nvidia around the recently revealed Ampere GPU architecture. Nvidia is planning a family of Orin chips ranging from a lower power unit with 10 trillion operations per second (TOPS) performance for driver assist systems to a 200 TOPS unit for highly automated vehicles.\u00a0\n\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nWith this announcement, Mercedes-Benz becomes the first automaker to announce it\u2019s intent to utilize the Orin platform. Mercedes-Benz also plans to utilize this architecture in every redesigned vehicle it builds from 2024. The new electronic architecture will be adopting the trend of consolidating the dozens of smaller electronic control units (ECU) found in most modern vehicles down to a few large computers that can handle virtually all functions. In the case of high-end Mercedes-Benz vehicles, that ECU count can approach 150.\u00a0\n\nMercedes-Benz EQS conceptMercedes-Benz\n\n\nCurrent electronic architectures were not designed to support over-the-air (OTA) updates to most systems, but the architecture that will be developed by Daimler and Nvidia will provide this capability. Mercedes-Benz and Nvidia couldn\u2019t provide specific details about the new architecture, except to say that it wouldn\u2019t be a single central compute platform. Most likely, it will be built around three to four main computers. Mercedes-Benz would also only confirm that the computer that runs the automated driving and ADAS features would be powered by Orin. It\u2019s possible that other domain controllers may utilize chipsets from other vendors.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMany automakers are now moving aggressively direction software-defined vehicle architectures. EV startups like Nio in China have already incorporated this capability but traditional automakers are also launching updateable vehicles this year. Tens of millions will likely be on the road by the time the first example from Stuttgart arrives in 2024.\u00a0The GM Digital Vehicle Platform includes support for over-the-air software updates on all vehicles ... [+] launched from 2020General Motors\nGM\u2019s Digital Vehicle Platform (also known as Global B) debuted in late 2019 on the Cadillac CT5 and Chevrolet Corvette C8 and is going into all redesigned GM vehicles going forward. The GM architecture doesn\u2019t utilize centralized compute, but it\u2019s internal networking and security features are designed to support regular updates and the automaker has already committed to updates for its second-generation Super Cruise system.\u00a0Ford CEO James Hackett (R) and a team member reveal the company's first mass-market electric car the ...

(Photo by Mark RALSTON / AFP) (Photo by MARK RALSTON/AFP via Getty Images)AFP via Getty Images\nSimilarly, the Ford Mustang Mach-E that goes on sale later this year has an architecture designed around three domain control computers and the automaker has said that virtually every system in the vehicle can be updated remotely. Just a week ago, Ford announced that its hands-free Active Drive Assist system would be enabled by an OTA update and it is planning a regular cadence of feature updates for Mach-E owners after it launches later this year. Ford is planning to add similar capabilities to other yet to be announced vehicles.\u00a0\nThe partnership between Nvidia and Mercedes-Benz goes well beyond just being a chip supplier. The two companies will collaborate closely on the entire architecture design and Mercedes-Benz will also utilize Nvidia\u2019s full Drive AGX software stack to power its automated driving systems.\u00a0 This will include partially automated level 2 and 3 systems as well as highly automated level 4 self-parking.\nWhile Mercedes-Benz declined to specify this as the reason for last week\u2019s announcement that it was pausing its automated driving partnership with BMW, it should be noted that BMW has a close relationship with Nvidia\u2019s primary rivals in this segment, Intel\nINTC\n and Mobileye. It\u2019s possible that the two German companies could not reach a consensus on the compute platform to use for its planned shared system.\u00a0\nUtilizing the Drive AGX software and a full suite of sensors that includes cameras, radar and lidar, Mercedes-Benz plans to offer what the companies call \u201caddress to address automated driving.\u201d Unlike the separate partnership that Daimler has with supplier Bosch which is targeting the shared services market including robotaxis, this program is focused on retail consumer vehicles. However, even the Daimler-Bosch partnership is using Nvidia compute platforms including the Drive AGX Pegasus.Guidehouse Insights Automated Driving Compute Platform leaderboardGuidehouse Insights\nIn Guidehouse Insight\u2019s recent Automated Driving Compute Platform leaderboard report, Nvidia was ranked first overall ahead of Intel/Mobileye and Qualcomm\nQCOM\n. Nvidia recently announced that Chinese EV startup Xpeng is using its Xavier SoC for its Xpilot 3.0 driver assist system. Numerous other automakers including Volvo are also using Nvidia chipsets and the company best known for its high-powered computer graphics cards is likely to grab a significant share of the automotive market in the coming years.\u00a0Xpeng P7 electric sedan uses Nvidia Drive Xavier SoC to power its Xpilot 3.0 systemXpeng\nThe partnership with Mercedes-Benz is the first that ties Nvidia much more deeply into a production automated driving program that also uses its software capabilities to such a large degree. Besides just automated driving, Mercedes-Benz and Nvidia also highlighted the new revenue opportunities that will be available from a software-defined vehicle platform.\u00a0\nJust as Tesla has been able to significantly boost its margins over the past five years by selling its \u201cfull self-driving\u201d package, other automakers are hoping to leverage vehicles that are connected and updatable to add functionality long after the customer takes delivery. At this stage, it\u2019s too early to tell exactly what added capabilities Mercedes-Benz might offer, but the possibilities are endless.\u00a0\nWhether customers will actually step up to pay for yet more services in an era where they are already starting to question how many subscription services they are paying for every month is another story. There are certainly some features that would be compelling to have available right in the vehicle such as paying for parking, charging or tolls. Those are all possibilities for automakers to take a slice of the revenue.\u00a0\nEven though the first software-defined Mercedes-Benz is coming a full dozen years after Tesla launched this effort, the real business opportunities are just starting to get underway now.\nFollow me on\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

However, if the latest leaked images of Nvidia's next-gen GPUs are to be believed, the RTX 3080 could be a lot closer to release than we might think. And hoo boy does it look weird.\n\nOver the weekend, the first alleged image of Nvidia's RTX 3080 GPU emerged on the forum Chiphell, which you can see below. The pictures show the front and back of the supposed Nvidia Ampere GPU, including that all important name of RTX 3080, seemingly confirming that Nvidia's next generation graphics cards will indeed follow an RTX 3000 series naming convention. \n\nThe design is quite unusual, with fans on both sides of the alleged RTX 3080. Normally, GPUs only have fans on one side of the card to help cool the circuit board underneath, so to have a cooler design that includes fans on both the front and back of the graphics card is very strange indeed. \nNow, you might think that perhaps the top GPU with the blue trim is just the same graphics card but with the RTX 3080 plate removed, but take a closer look and you'll see that isn't the case. On the lower graphics card, there's a bracket next to the RTX 3080 logo, for example, while the top one has the bracket next to the fan, suggesting that there are indeed fans on both sides of this supposed RTX 3080.\nNaturally, 3D artists have jumped at the chance to try and imagine some more official looking images of this apparent RTX 3080, the best probably being the renders from Reddit user JDSP (one of which I've included up top in the header). \nI mean, I don't hate it, if I'm being honest, but I also don't think it's nearly as good looking as the Founders Editions of Nvidia's existing RTX cards either. I was quite fond of the dual fan design of the original RTX cards with their name plonked in between them, and this supposed RTX 3080 design just isn't quite on the same level for me. \nStill, a leaked image being a leaked image, there's a good chance this isn't in fact the final design of the RTX 3080, so until Nvidia announce the RTX 3080 properly we'll just have to sit and wait and hope they come up with something a bit more attractive.

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series will be featuring a brand new graphics architecture and other key driving features for faster gaming performance in next-generation AAA titles.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, RTX 3080 & Titan RTX With Ampere Gaming Graphics Cards Allegedly Feature GA102 GPUs\nThere are several rumors going on around the GeForce RTX 30 series since the coolers leaked out last month. But almost everywhere we're hearing one thing consistently which is that the GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3090 will be the first cards featuring the Ampere Gaming GPUs. Latest version of specifications come from KatCorgi and Kopite7kimi (via Videocardz) who have not only shared the same specs in the current month but Kopite7kimi was accurate with his previous leaks for the A100 GPU.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPSNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Graphics Card fan-made render. (Image Credits: creper9000 at Reddit)\nBased on that, let's see what latest details do these two leakers have to share with us but most importantly, since all of this is unconfirmed at the moment, it will be wise to treat this rumor with a grain of salt until we recieve more information.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 - The Fastest Ampere Gaming Graphics Card\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 is an interesting graphics card based on its naming scheme. I already talked around the nomenclature of this card in my previous post mentioning why NVIDIA would be choosing this particular naming scheme that was previously reserved for dual-chip graphics cards. It is highly likely that the RTX 3090 could be an internal codename for the RTX 3080 Ti but if we dive to much into those details, we will just be moving away from today's topic.\nSo let's call it the GeForce RTX 3090 for now. According to the details, the GeForce RTX 3090 will feature the GA102-300-A1 GPU. This is one of the three SKUs that we will be talking about in this particular post. The GA102-300-A1 GPU is said to be comprised of 5248 CUDA cores or 82 SMs. In total, that's a 20% increase in cores over the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. No details such as clock speeds, TMU/ROP counts is provided and we can't take the Ampere A100 die as a reference since gaming and HPC parts share a different configuration hierarchy.\n\nMoving on to the memory side, things start to look interesting as it is stated that the card will get up to 12 GB memory with speeds of up to 21 Gbps. Since that's a 384-bit bus we are looking at, it will be able to offer up to 1 TB/s bandwidth. This overclocked memory design is being referred to as GDDR6X and there's no such information available yet by any graphics DRAM vendor unlike the previous GDDR6 DRAM which was officially reported months before its integration on the Turing graphics cards.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 - GA102 For High-End Gaming\nMoving on to the GeForce RTX 3080, the rumor reports that the card will be featuring the GA102-200-Kx-A1 SKU. This cut down SKU will feature the same 4352 CUDA cores as the RTX 2080 Ti that will be arranged in a total of 68 SMs. The card is reportedly going to feature 10 GB of memory that is also going to be GDDR6X, running at 19 Gbps across a 320-bit bus interface with a bandwidth of 760 GB/s.\nThe switch to GA102 from TU104 on the RTX 2080 is definitely an interesting one. A high-end SKU would also result in higher wattage and thermals but I believe this could be done to raise the bar up on the sub $500 segment which should comprise of GA104 based RTX 3070 and RTX 3060. If that's the case, than we can expect a good performance jump in that segment which we recently talked about in one of our article.\nNVIDIA 2nd Gen Titan RTX - Based on Unlocked Ampere GA102 GPU\nFinally, we have reports on a 2nd Generation Titan graphics cards. The card is stated to be a 2nd generation Titan RTX card but like the Titan X and Titan X(p) before it, the new card would make use of the Ampere GA102-400-A1 GPU. The GPU will be composed of 84 SMs for a total of 5376 CUDA cores.\n\nThe card is said to feature 24 GB of GDDR6X memory across a 384-bit bus interface and a memory bandwidth of 816 GB/s which although is lower than the RTX 3090 due to a slower pin speed of 17 Gbps but will be compensated by the enhanced memory compression architecture plus you will be getting twice the memory buffer as the RTX 3090.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series 'Ampere Gaming GPU' Rumored Specifications:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameGPUCores (SMs)MemoryMemory BusBandwidth\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Titan RTX (2nd Gen)Ampere GA102-4005376 (84)24 GB GDDR6X384-bit~816 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA Titan RTX (1st Gen)Turing TU102-4004608 (72)24 GB GDDR6384-bit672 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti / NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090Ampere GA102-3005248 (82)12 GB GDDR6X384-bit~1.00 TB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 TiTuring TU102-3004352 (68)11 GB GDDR6352-bit616 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080Ampere GA102-2004352 (68)10 GB GDDR6X320-bit~760 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Turing TU104-4002944 (46)8 GB GDDR6256-bit448 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiAmpere GA104-4003072 (48)8 GB GDDR6X256-bit~512 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPERTuring TU104-4102560 (40)8 GB GDDR6256-bit448 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ampere GA104-3002944 (46)8 GB GDDR6256-bit~512 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070Turing TU106-4002304 (36)8 GB GDDR6256-bit448 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiAmpere GA106-400TBDTBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPERTuring TU106-4102176 (34)8 GB GDDR6256-bit448 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ampere GA106-300TBDTBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Turing TU106-2001920 (30)6 GB GDDR6192-bit336 GB/s\n\n\n\nAccording to Jensen, all next-generation products will be featuring the same NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture. The first outing of Ampere will be for the cloud and research segment in the form of the Ampere GA100 GPU which is designed solely for the HPC environment. The gaming cards will definitely feature Ampere GPUs but will come later.\nAmpere will eventually replace Nvidia\u2019s Turing and Volta chips with a single platform that streamlines Nvidia\u2019s GPU lineup, Huang said in a pre-briefing with media members Wednesday. While consumers largely know Nvidia for its videogame hardware, the first launches with Ampere are aimed at AI needs in the cloud and for research.\n\u201cUnquestionably, it\u2019s the first time that we\u2019ve unified the acceleration workload of the entire data center into one single platform,\u201d Huang said. -\u00a0Market Watch\nNVIDIA's GeForce RTX 30 series is expected to launch in the coming months with September being touted as a potential launch window. On the other hand, AMD is also planning a big Radeon revival with its upcoming Big Navi graphics cards which are also expected around late Q3 2020.\n\n\n\nWhich NVIDIA GeForce 'Ampere' GPU are you waiting for the most?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n160\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The pair will build the software-defined architecture based on Nvidia's Drive AGX Orin system-on-chip (SoC) platform, and it will be a standard feature in the next fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles from 2024.  \"This new platform will become an efficient, centralised, and software-defined system in our future Mercedes-Benz vehicles,\" said Ola K\u00e4llenius, chairman of the board of management of Daimler and Mercedes-Benz. \"Nvidia's AI computing architecture will help us streamline our journey towards autonomous driving. These new capabilities and upgrades will be downloaded from the cloud, improving safety, increasing value, and extending the joy of ownership for all Mercedes-Benz customers.\" Nvidia's Orin SoC platform is based on its recently announced supercomputing architecture. The Nvidia Drive platform features a software stack featuring automated driving AI applications, including DriveWorks, Perception, Mapping, and Planning. The pair said the new system would enable level two and three driving autonomy, as well as automated parking functions of up to level four. This would mean, according to the two companies, vehicles would have the ability to \"automate driving of regular routes from address to address\".  Customers will also be able to purchase and add software applications and subscriptions through the over-the-air software updates, the companies said, assuring that the new system would have a \"total focus on safety\".  \"Every future Mercedes-Benz with the Nvidia Drive system will come with a team of expert AI and software engineers continuously developing, refining and enhancing the car over its lifetime,\" Huang said. During the company's debut of its Drive AGX Orin platform at the end of last year, Nvidia announced that Didi Chuxing had plans to use Nvidia GPUs and AI technology to develop autonomous driving and cloud computing solutions.\u00a0 The company plans to use GPUs in the data centre to train machine learning algorithms, as well as the Nvidia Drive platform for inference on level four autonomous vehicles.\u00a0 DiDi will also be deploying Nvidia AI in the DiDi Cloud, using Nvidia technology for internal use cases, such as traffic and monitoring applications. The company is also launching virtual GPU cloud servers for cloud rendering, computing and gaming.\u00a0  \tRelated Coverage Softbank closes $500 million funding round for Didi's autonomous driving unitThe funding will be invested to develop autonomous vehicles for Didi's ride-hailing service. The car of the future is connected, autonomous, shared, and electricThe automotive industry is undergoing massive digital transformation. By 2030, cars will be more connected, autonomous, shared, and electric.

Traditional automakers have historically added ECUs as they have added more technology, a practice that has introduced complexity and cost as well as limitations that newer rivals like Tesla happily avoid.\nToday, Mercedes-Benz and Nvidia announced a partnership aimed at eliminating the complexity while boosting the performance and automated driving capabilities of a new generation of vehicles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe upshot is a software-centric computing architecture based on Nvidia\u2019s Drive AGX Orin computer system-on-a-chip. The underlying architecture will be standard in Mercedes\u2019 next generation of vehicles, starting sometime toward the end of 2024, Ola K\u00e4llenius, chairman of the board of management of Daimler AG and head of Mercedes-Benz AG, said during a live stream of the announcement.\nNvidia\u2019s Orin SoC is based on its recently announced Nvidia Ampere supercomputing architecture. The Nvidia Drive platform will include a full software stack designed for automated driving AI applications. The two companies will jointly develop the AI and automated vehicle applications that include Level 2 and Level 3 driver assistance functions, as well as automated parking functions up to Level 4. (Society of Automobile Engineers [SAE] has designated five levels of automation. A Level 2 system means two primary functions are automated and still have a human driver in the loop at all times. Level 4 means the vehicle can handle all aspects of driving in certain conditions without human intervention.)\nThe Nvidia Orin SoC delivers 200 trillion operations per second. (Image Credits: Nvidia)\nThis new in-vehicle computing architecture will also support over-the-air (OTA) software updates, a technological strategy that Tesla has employed for years to continually upgrade the features and functions of its electric vehicles. This means the owner of a 2024 model Mercedes might see the advanced driver assistance system of their vehicle improve months and even years after their initial purchase.\nThe move to this new computing platform is important for the business model of our company, K\u00e4llenius said Tuesday.\n\u201cMany people talk about the modern car, the new car as kind of the smartphone on wheels. If you want to take that approach you really have to look at source software architecture from a holistic point of view,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the most important domains here is the driving assistant domain. That needs to dovetail into what we call software-driven architecture, to be able to (with high computing power) add use cases for the customer, this case the driving assistant autonomous space.\u201d\n\nK\u00e4llenius added that this helps add recurrent revenue streams to its business. The new in-vehicle computing platform will move Mercedes vehicles to a software app-based system. This would theoretically let Mercedes introduce third-party apps to its vehicles, which is what K\u00e4llenius was likely referring to when he mentioned new revenue streams. A software-based app system would let customers purchase and add capabilities, software applications and subscription services through over-the-air software updates during the life of the car.\nThis isn\u2019t just a one-off or pilot. This software-centric computing system will be standard across Mercedes\u2019 next generation of vehicles. And if Mercedes follows the same strategy as it did with its next-generation infotainment system called MBUX, that could mean that its A Class and not its flagship S Class vehicles will be among the first to get this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nMercedes-Benz, nvidia, Transportation \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tKirsten Korosec\t\n\n\n\nTransportation Editor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

New GPU releases rarely innovate much on the cooling front. But if this image is real, then Nvidia has something special, or at least especially perplexing, in the works. \nThe design of this GPU pair is immediately strange. First, there's one fan on the bottom of the GPU and one fan on the top. Second, the power connector isn't visible, which implies it's on the rightmost surface of the card (on the bottom prototype) which can't be seen from the photos. That's actually where the Quadro GPUs have theirs. But third, and this must be the strangest, the PCB is only two-thirds the length of the chassis and has a triangular cutout to fit the bottom fan.\nObserve, however, that these GPUs are in pretty rough nick. The colors are dull, the heat sinks are misaligned and unfiled, and there's no branding apart from the 'RTX 3080' and 'GeForce RTX' logos. They're more likely to be from a minor OEM than be Nvidia reference models. There may be no Ampere GPU in there at all, and these might be pre-emptive designs prototyped ahead of hardware shipments. So although these photos indicate an imminent release schedule at first sight, there's really no telling where Nvidia is in the development cycle.\nIs unconventional good or bad?\n\nThe PCB is the funny looking shape at the bottom, and the power connector is at the top right. Credit: Cloud via Twitter\nThis cooling solution isn't as unconventional as it looks but is nonetheless quite remarkable. The arrangement of the heatsink fins prevents airflow from traveling laterally across the PCB, which is the opposite of how a normal GPU cooler works. The left fan - which is to sit above the position of the power supply in a regular chassis - pulls air up onto the GPU die then exhausts it out the rear of the chassis (that's normal). The rightmost fan appears to suck air up from the bottom of the case and through a heatsink before exhausting it at the approximate location of the RAM.\nThis technique is unlikely to provide a direct cooling advantage relative to existing designs. However, because it directs airflow through standardized pathways within the computer chassis, approximately drawing air in from the bottom-front of a case and exhausting it out the top-left, it can use other cooling fans within the computer much more effectively. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Razer Blade 16 pricing leaks: $2,000 for RTX 5060 model \n\n\n\n Developer breaks Akira ransomware encryption in hours using cloud GPUs \n\n\n\nHolistically, then, this design could keep the GPU and the air within the chassis cooler than existing designs do if it is well executed. This may be an attempt to differentiate from AMD, or it could signify that these GPUs run excessively hot. This latter theory would contradict rumors that Ampere will offer significant efficiency improvements but supports leaks that suggest flagship Ampere GPUs will have a very high power draw.\nWait, what needs cooling?\nCooling is all well and good, but what needs cooling is more interesting. When it comes to the specifics of the RTX 3080, details are still sparse, or at least well-evidenced details are. But there are two leakers with good track records that deserve recognition: kopite7kimi and KkatCorgi.\nA year before its announcement, Kopite leaked the rough die size, transistor count, and memory configuration of the Nvidia A100. By February this year, KkatCorgi knew the exact die size and between the two of them, they created an accurate picture of the A100's final core count. It was impressive.\n\nFake news 1: I'm not sure, but the PCB of the Ampere game card may be designed to an irregular shape.\n--- kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) January 20, 2020\n\nRegarding the RTX 3080, they both predicted the unusual PCB months ago. They both believe that the RTX 3080 will have 10 GB of memory operating at a minimum of 18 Gbps, relative to 8 GB and 14 Gbps on the RTX 2080. Kopite speculates that the RTX 3080 will have 4,352 CUDA cores like the RTX 2080 Ti. Nothing either of them say can be verified, however, so it would be unwise to place bets.\n\n\n\n\n 38 comments\n \n480 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows Defender misidentifies key driver, disrupting popular PC monitoring tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

That means that the vehicle will be able to, by and large, fit itself into parking stalls without any help from the human driver. There will still need to be a human on hand in case things go catastrophically sideways, but under normal conditions, there won\u2019t be much call for them to intercede.What\u2019s more, the computing system, which is based on NVIDIA\u2019s DRIVE platform, will be able to \u201cautomate driving of regular routes from address to address,\u201d according to the release. The most intriguing future feature however will be over-air updates, enabling customers to buy and remotely install additional safety and convenience features, software applications, and subscription services for as long as they own the vehicle. This is similar to how Tesla sells its Enhanced Autopilot upgrades.\u201cWe are excited to work with Mercedes-Benz,\u201d Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA said. \u201cTogether, we\u2019re going to revolutionize the car ownership experience, making the vehicle software programmable and continuously upgradeable via over-the-air updates. Every future MercedesBenz with the NVIDIA DRIVE system will come with a team of expert AI and software engineers continuously developing, refining and enhancing the car over its lifetime.\u201dIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

In 2001, no one predicted that the same processor architecture developed to draw realistic explosions in 3D would be just the thing to power a renaissance in deep learning. But when Nvidia realized that academics were gobbling up its graphics cards, it responded, supporting researchers with the launch of the CUDA parallel computing software framework in 2006.Since then, Nvidia has been a big player in the world of high-end embedded AI applications, where teams of highly trained (and paid) engineers have used its hardware for things like autonomous vehicles. Now the company claims to be making it easy for even hobbyists to use embedded machine learning, with its US\u00a0$100 Jetson Nano dev\u00a0kit, which was originally launched in early 2019 and rereleased this March with several upgrades. So, I set out to see just how easy it was: Could I, for example, quickly and cheaply make a camera that could recognize and track chosen objects?AI Engine: The Jetson Nano is the cheapest of a number of AI development kits made by Nvidia. Like many AI development boards it has hefty power requirements, so users are encouraged to buy an external power adapter that can supply at least 4 amperes. Lots of power in necessarily means lots of heat out, so the kit is dominated by a large heat sink which has screw holes for adding a fan if desired. The Nano has lots of input/output options for displays, USB\u00a0peripherals, camera modules, and a Raspberry Pi\u2013compatible 40-pin general purpose input/output header.Illustration: James ProvostEmbedded machine learning is evolving rapidly. In April 2019, Hands On looked at Google\u2019s Coral Dev AI board which incorporates the company\u2019s Edge tensor processing unit (TPU), and in July 2019, IEEE Spectrum featured Adafruit\u2019s software library, which lets even a handheld game device do simple speech recognition. The Jetson Nano is closer to the Coral Dev board: With its 128 parallel processing cores, like the Coral, it\u2019s powerful enough to handle a real-time video feed, and both have Raspberry Pi\u2013style 40-pin GPIO connectors for driving external hardware.Multilayered AnalysisThe\u00a0software suite provided by Nvidia makes it easy to download many popular pretrained neural-network architectures that are suited for different tasks, such as identifying pedestrians or household objects. The ResNet-18 network pictured below can identify 1,000 such objects. You can make the network identify new, similar, objects by reconfiguring the final classification layer, which attaches labels to objects, and partially retraining the network.Illustration: James ProvostBut the Coral Dev board is designed to provide the minimal amount of support needed to prototype embedded applications. Its Edge TPU is on a removable module that can be plugged directly into target hardware as development progresses. The Coral carrier board that the processor module sits on has only one large USB port and is generally intended to be operated over a remote connection via a USB-C or Ethernet connector rather than being plugged in to a keyboard and screen directly.The Jetson Nano has a similar module-and-carrier board approach, but its carrier board has a lot more going for stand-alone experimentation. It has four USB 3.0 ports for peripherals, HDMI and DisplayPort connectors, a Micro-USB port to supply power or allow remote operation, an Ethernet port, two ribbon connectors for attaching Raspberry Pi\u2013compatible camera modules, and a barrel jack socket for providing the additional power needed for intensive computations. (I appreciated this last touch, because the Coral Dev board uses two USB-C ports side by side, one for power and the other for data, and I was always confusing the two.)Nvidia\u2019s \u201cGetting Started\u201d instructions stepped me through downloading a customized version of the Ubuntu operating system designed for the Nano. This includes things like a Nano version of the established Raspberry Pi\u00a0Rpi.GPIO library for accessing the GPIO header from Python scripts.Then, as per the instructions, I began the free \u201cWelcome to Getting Started With AI on Jetson Nano!\u201d course. This includes an introductory primer on neural networks, followed by details on how to use the Nano in remote mode. In this mode, the Nano runs a local Web server that hosts a Jupyter notebook, the tool of choice for many researchers because it allows explanatory text and images to be intermingled with Python code.Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t connect to the Nano\u2019s server: After some poking around online, it turns out that the Ubuntu version required for the \u201cWelcome\u2026\u201d course is different from the version linked in the \u201cGetting Started\u201d instructions. There are actually a few places where Nvidia\u2019s generally excellent documentation, videos, and other tutorials have this kind of rough edge: Sometimes it\u2019s because things haven\u2019t been updated for the new board; other times it\u2019s mistakes [but see Author\u2019s Note below], such as a sample script used for testing the output of the GPIO header that tries to import the original Rpi.GPIO library rather than the Jetson.GPIO library.But soon I was up and running with the well-known ResNet-18 pretrained neural network, which can classify 1,000 objects. Through a provided notebook it is easy to modify the last layer of the network so that it recognizes just two things\u2014say, thumbs-up and thumbs-down gestures\u2014using images directly captured from the USB camera, and then retrain the network for gesture recognition.Then I tried something a little more ambitious. Following along with Nvidia\u2019s suggested \u201cHello AI World\u201d tutorial, I was soon running a 10-line Python script directly on the Nano\u2019s desktop that did real-time recognition with the ResNET-18 network. With a little bit of tweaking, I was able to extract the ID and center coordinates of every object recognized. A little more modification and the script toggled four GPIO pins to indicate if a particular type of object\u2014say a bottle, or person\u2014was above, below, left of, or right of center in the camera\u2019s view.I hooked up an Arduino Uno with a motor shield to drive the two servos in a $19\u00a0pan/tilt head that I bought from Adafruit. I mounted my USB camera on the pan/tilt head and wired the Arduino to monitor the Nano\u2019s GPIO pins. When the Nano senses an off-center object and turns on the appropriate GPIO pin, the Arduino nudges the pan/tilt head in the direction that should bring the object toward the center of its field of view.I was genuinely surprised how quickly I was able to go from opening the Nano\u2019s box to a working autonomous tracking camera (not counting the time I spent waiting for various supporting bits and pieces to arrive in the mail while isolated from my usual workbench at the Spectrum office!). And there are plenty of avenues for further expansion and experimentation. If you\u2019re looking to merge physical computing with AI, the Jetson Nano is a terrific place to start.\u00a0*Author\u2019s note, 25 June 2020: Since this article was published, the folks at Nvidia reached out about this specific issue. The Nano should be configured so that if either the RPi.GPIO or Jetson.GPIO modules are specified in a Python script, the correct underlying module is called. I tested this on my Nano, and it now works as predicted: we have been unable to determine why it didn\u2019t in my original setup, and why the sample\u00a0script only worked for me\u00a0when I specified the Jetson.GPIO module; in fairness, it\u2019s\u00a0possible\u00a0there was a loose connection in my\u00a0test circuit, although I believe\u00a0the hardware didn\u2019t change\u00a0between tests. So this falls under the category of unreproducible bug rather than simple error in the script! Thanks to the Nvidia team for being so helpful trying to track the problem down.This article appears in the July 2020 print issue as \u201cNvidia Makes It Easy to Embed AI.\u201dnvidiarobot aiaihands onmachine learningStephen CassStephen Cass is the special projects editor at IEEE Spectrum.

With this feature enabled, Windows users will benefit from increased performance and decreased latency, allowing games to run more smoothly with potentially better FPS.\nTo enable GPU Scheduling in Windows 10 2004, you can go to Settings > System > Display and click on Graphics Settings.\nIf you are using a supported GPU and driver, like today's version 451.48, you will see an option to enable 'Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling.'\n\nIt should be noted that some users who tested this feature in earlier Windows Insider builds\u00a0have stated\u00a0that enabling this feature could impact FPS in certain games.\n\nSource: Guru3D\nBelow is a video illustrating the poor performance a user had in GTAV when GPU scheduling was enabled.\n\nTo resolve this issue, the user turned off GPU Scheduling, and the game began to work correctly again.\nIf you encounter similar FPS/stuttering issues in games with GPU scheduling enabled, disable the setting and see if it works properly again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\u00a9 Techniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\nMicrosoft: March Windows updates mistakenly uninstall CopilotNew Akira ransomware decryptor cracks encryptions keys using GPUsMicrosoft: Recent Windows updates make USB printers print random textWindows 10 KB5053606 update fixes broken SSH connectionsWindows 10 KB5052077 update fixes broken SSH connections\n\n\n\n\nDriver\nGPU\nGPU Scheduling\nMay 2020 Update\nNVIDIA\nWindows 10\nWindows 10 2004\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLawrence Abrams   \n              Lawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.

Now we need a list of what works with it and what doesn't.  What if it lowers performance by like 5-10 fps... You might not think to disable the feature but that 5 fps could be the difference between a locked 4k60 or not.\r\nHonestly unless it improves performance across the board is rather not have the feature.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3080 and the potential GeForce RTX 3090 are set to get a serious boost in ray-tracing performance thanks to a rumored dual-sided design.\u00a0A video by Coreteks detailed how the next-generation GeForce graphics card based on Nvidia\u2019s Ampere architecture will have the main GPU on one side of the printed circuit board (PCB) and a co-processor on the other side. That co-processor will supposedly be dedicated to powering ray-tracing rendering, building upon the dedicated ray-tracing cores the current GeForce RTX 20-series graphics cards have.\u00a0Our picks for the\u00a0best gaming laptopsLooking for a desktop? Check out the\u00a0best gaming PCsYikes: Look out, PC gamers: Hackers want your passwords and accountsThere\u2019s very little to back up this rumor, though Coreteks has a proven to be a reliable tech tipster in the past. But we\u2019d still suggest you take this alleged information with a degree of skepticism, because so far the leaked images of the GeForce RTX 3080 don\u2019t necessarily show a graphics card with a dual-sided PCB.\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\nWatch On \nBut WCCFtech pointed out that Nvidia has patented traversal co-processors to aid in ray-tracing back in 2018. So there\u2019s a case for the next GeForce series of graphics cards to come with co-processors, which would do the job of ray-tracing cores while avoiding the need to fit them all into the GPUs die.\u00a0All of this should translate into better ray-tracing performance for Nvidia\u2019s next-generation GeForce graphics cards. Such a boost in performance is to be expected, but a hike in ray-tracing performance could be significant for the gaming world.\u00a0That\u2019s because the PS5 and Xbox Series X are coming with ray-tracing support to usher in games with much more realistic lighting that can transform the look of a game. Consoles with ray-tracing capabilities give developers a larger audience that can support the advanced rendering technique.\u00a0As a result, that\u2019s likely to mean more games with ray-tracing; how those will run on PS5 and Xbox Series X hardware has yet to be seen. But if the GeForce RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 greatly boost ray-tracing performance, it could make running such titles at very high resolutions and at high frame rates a distinct possibility for PC gamers. \u00a0Sign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.We still don't have any official info on the RTX 3080, but Nvidia is rumored to unveil its new GPU as soon as August.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia Turing Silicon (Image credit: Nvidia)Nvidia has outdone itself this time, even by the chipmaker's own standards. AIDA64 (via @momomo_us) has just added support for two new unreleased variants of the GeForce GTX 1650 graphics card, increasing the number of different versions to four.The original GeForce GTX 1650, which landed last year, debuted with the TU117 silicon. The graphics card's 896 CUDA cores were complemented by 4GB of 8 Gbps GDDR5 memory across a 128-bit memory interface.\u00a0A little less than a year later, Nvidia rolled out the GeForce GTX 1650 GDDR6, and, as the name implies, the graphics card came with faster 12Gbps GDDR6 memory. Although the GDDR6 variant features lower clock speeds, the swap to GDDR6 memory allowed the graphics card to deliver up to 50% higher memory bandwidth. \u00a0The upgrade contributed to a real-world performance improvement of up to 14% over the vanilla version.\u00a0AIDA64's latest changelog shows that Nvidia isn't quite done with the GeForce GTX 1650 yet.Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 SpecificationsSwipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 GeForce GTX 1650 TU106*GeForce GTX 1650 TU116*GeForce GTX 1650 GDDR6GeForce GTX 1650GPU ArchitectureTuring (TU106)Turing (TU116)Turing (TU117)Turing (TU117)Shading Units896896896896Texture Units56565656ROPs32323232Base Clock Rate1,410 MHz1,410 MHz1,410 MHz1,485 MHzBoost Clock Rate1,590 MHz1,590 MHz1,590 MHz1,665 MHzMemory Clock12 Gbps12 Gbps12 Gbps8 GbpsMemory Capacity4GB GDDR64GB GDDR64GB GDDR64GB GDDR5Memory Bus128-bit128-bit128-bit128-bitMemory Bandwidth192 GBps192 GBps192 GBps128 GBpsL2 Cache1MB1MB1MB1MBTDP75W75W75W75WTransistor Count10.8 billion6.6 billion4.7 billion4.7 billionDie Size445 mm\u00b2284 mm\u00b2200 mm\u00b2200 mm\u00b2*Specifications are unconfirmed.AIDA64 refers to the two new variants as the GeForce GTX 1650 TU116 and GeForce GTX 1650 TU106. It's pretty much the same formula as the GDDR6 version that denotes the type of memory in the model name. On this occasion, the suffixes designate the silicon that's used inside each refreshed model.In the case of the GeForce GTX 1650 TU116, the TU116 die is the same one that Nvidia employs in the the other GeForce GTX 16-series SKUs, including the GTX 1650 Super, GTX 1660, GTX 1660 Super and GTX 1660 Ti.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The TU106 die, on the other hand, is a very interesting selection, and the one that raises many questions. For context, the TU106 is present inside Nvidia's GeForce RTX 20-series models, such as the GeForce RTX 2060, RTX 2060 Super and RTX 2070. Unlike the TU116 and TU117 silicons, the TU106 does house Nvidia's Tensor and RT cores. Has Nvidia finally caved in and decided to bring ray tracing to a GTX 16-series graphics card? Unfortunately, we don't know for the time being. AIDA64 didn't give any hints on the specifications. Nonetheless, the base specifications should be the same for both new variants.The new versions of the GeForce GTX 1650 probably aren't a coincidence. Nvidia is likely just reprocessing defective dies that don't meet the requirements for higher tier models and using them in the GeForce GTX 1650. Alternatively, the chipmaker might just be getting rid of leftover Turing silicon to make space for Ampere, which is heavily rumored to debut in September. In any event, it's easy to see why Nvidia chose the GeForce GTX 1650 in particular.\u00a0According to the Steam Hardware Survey for May 2020, the GeForce GTX 1650 was the fifth most popular graphics cards among Steam gamers. If there was a fast way to dispose of unused silicon, the GeForce GTX 1650 would be the best candidate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce\nCUDA\ngtx\nAIDA64\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (10)\n\n\n\nZhiye LiuSocial Links NavigationNews Editor and Memory ReviewerZhiye Liu is a news editor and memory reviewer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

We'll have to wait for benchmarks to see if this yields some 2060KO-style improvements from changes that don't show up in raw specs numbers.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplissandro\n\n\nMaybe there's no 1650-grade card planned for Amp\u00e8re so they flood the market with cheap 1650 variants because next gen will have 1660+ grade at the very bottom? Or maybe the 1650 is the best selling of the turing cards so they want to make sure people won't go for Radeon cards on that price point just because it sold out or something.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCo BIY\n\n\nI'd say that the 1650 is the Hot Dog of graphics cards.\n\nThe butcher can make them out of whatever they have and the crowd will buy them because they are fun and priced right.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiroro\n\n\nIt doesn't seem likely to me that the best they can do with a cut-down 2060 is a 1650, unless that is also an indicator that the whole GTX 16xx lineup might have TU106 as a possibility. \n\nI could understand it if they wanted some entry-level quadro card with RTX or Tensor enabled, or maybe they are playing with the idea of some kind of RTX 2050/2030... But calling it a 1650 without also finding a way to squeeze more out of the silicon for a higher asking price? That isn't really passing the smell test to me. \n\nBut if it does exist at the same price point, that is at least possibly exciting for overclocking or maybe even firmware hacking.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvalidError\n\n\nGiroro said:It doesn't seem likely to me that the best they can do with a cut-down 2060 is a 1650It may not be the best they can do but it could be the best they can sell - Nvidia may be running out of people willing to spend $300+ on GPUs and decided to burn its excess TU106/116 dies on GTX1650 SKUs instead of nuking 1660/2060 retail prices.\n\nKind of proves the point I was making months ago that GPUs only cost as much as they currently do because we have a stagnant duopoly situation where both vendors have implicitly agreed on arbitrarily inflated prices.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVorador2\n\n\nNobody on their right mind is spending 300$ and up for a GPU that's going to be obsolete soon. So if they need to get a replacement, they get the \"best bang for the buck\" model. The 1650.\n\nAlso, i'm pretty sure nVidia will hike their prices again for Ampere, so lowering the price now for the RTX models would work against them.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKing_V\n\n\nNvidia managed to really muscle in on AMD's dominance of the 1080p tier with the 1650 Super. \n\nEven the 1650 GDDR6 (non-Super) is matched/slightly exceeded by the older and cheaper RX 570.\n\nIf the use of TU106/TU116 somehow boosts its performance enough, AND they keep it priced lower than the 1650 Super, down at RX 570 levels or below, then it'll sell well.\n\nThe confusing naming for multiple slightly different products might help them rake in a few bucks, but as things stand, the 1650 Super is the only place where Nvidia is outdoing the archaic AMD cards in price/performance. I'm curious to see what the performance of these new 1650 variants are like, and what steps, if any, Nvidia takes to make sure a customer will know what performance level/which 1650 they're getting.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 10 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm debuts new Snapdragon G handheld gaming PC chips to compete with Intel and AMD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina to spend $55 billion on R&D in 2025 \u2014 Semiconductor, AI and quantum computing fields to benefit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBambu Lab Announces New Printer: H2D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotherboard dies after marathon 100-hour BIOS update process, vigil attended by thousands online\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD boasts its Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is up to 12.2x faster than Lunar Lake in AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreeware image editor GIMP 3.0 arrives after seven years of incubation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle's Gemini 2.0 Flash is reportedly capable of removing watermarks \u2014 Also found to generate AI celebrity photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi and ChatGPT bring AI conversations to your retro rotary phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI Afterburner update enables RTX 50 series owners to push their GDDR7 VRAM up to 36 GT/s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD manager reports 45% GPU retail market share in Japan \u2014 Eyes 70% as the next target\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Page 1 of 3. 27 Comments.\n\nGoing back to the end of 2018 was initial open-source \"Nouveau\" driver work on RTX 2000 / Turing GPUs as of Linux 5.0. But due to the lack of signed firmware images at the time, there was no actual hardware acceleration but just display/modesetting. The accelerated Turing support has come together recent so now here are benchmarks showing the open-source GeForce RTX 2060 and RTX 2080 performance of this open-source driver compared to the proprietary official driver.\n\nThe accelerated RTX 2000 series support on the kernel side came at the start of the year for Linux 5.6 with the necessary changes in place. That came as NVIDIA finally published their signed, binary-only firmware for the GeForce GTX 1600 and RTX 2000 series GPUs.\n\nBeyond Linux 5.6+ and the binary blobs in linux-firmware.git, only as of earlier this month did Mesa's NVC0 Gallium3D driver finally see Volta and Turing support merged for allowing 3D (and basic compute) to work on these newer NVIDIA GPUs. That Nouveau Gallium3D support is there for Mesa 20.2 due to be released at the end of August.\n\nFor your pleasure today are benchmarks of Linux 5.7 paired with Mesa 20.2-devel Git as of this weekend and linux-firmware.git for providing the basic open-source NVIDIA Turing support offered at this point by the open-source community. But there are several important caveats:\n- The most pressing limitation remains that has been in place since the GTX 900 \"Maxwell\" series since NVIDIA began requiring signed firmware images... There isn't any re-clocking support yet. That means for GTX 900 through RTX 2000 series, the Nouveau kernel driver is bound to running at the boot clock frequencies that are generally very low due to not being able to properly handle power management with the graphics cards due to the signed firmware restrictions. We'll see if NVIDIA has a solution to announce soon or not, but right now this is the number one limitation for this open-source driver as you will see from the results.\n- There isn't any open-source Vulkan driver (yet). So for right now you just have the OpenGL driver while many newer Linux games require Vulkan or the likes of DXVK with Vulkan for a better Steam Play gaming experience. There is some work going on that will help in the Vulkan direction like Nouveau's NIR support coming together, but for right now there is no Nouveau Vulkan driver for end-users.\n- The Nouveau support is only exposing OpenGL 4.3 pending formal compliance with newer versions of the specification.\n\nMeanwhile using NVIDIA's official but proprietary Linux driver will yield full support for the GPU. These benchmarks are putting the NVIDIA 440.82 proprietary driver against the Linux 5.7 + Mesa 20.2-devel open-source driver stack with various OpenGL games and other test cases. The GeForce RTX 2060 and RTX 2080 graphics cards were used for reference purposes.\n\n\n27 Comments \u00a0 - \u00a0 Next Page\n\nTweet\n\n\n \n\nPage 1 - IntroductionPage 2 - Closed-Source vs. Open-Source DriversPage 3 - Closed-Source vs. Open-Source Drivers\n\n\nPage:  \u00a0 1 \u00a0  \u00a0 2 \u00a0  \u00a0 3 \u00a0  \u00a0 Next Page \u00a0  \n\n\n\nRelated Articles\nIntel Battlemage Showing Off Nice OpenCL Gains With Newest Open-Source Compute StackWindows 11 vs. Linux Benchmarks For Intel Arc B-Series \"Battlemage\" Shows Strengths & WeaknessesIntel Compute Runtime 24.45 vs. AMD ROCm 6.3 vs. NVIDIA R565 Linux GPU Compute BenchmarksNVIDIA's Open-Source Linux Kernel Driver Performing At Parity To Proprietary DriverRADV vs. AMDVLK Radeon Vulkan Ray-Tracing Performance For Mid-2024AMD vs. NVIDIA Vulkan Ray-Tracing Performance On Linux With Breaking Limit\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Linux News\nBLAKE3 1.7 Turns To Intel's oneTBB For Parallelizing C Code - Similar Perf To Rust+Rayon\n\n\nFinal Draft Of PCI Express 7.0 Specification Published\n\n\nBlender 4.4 Released With Vulkan Improvements & AMD HIP RT No Longer Experimental\n\n\nOpenJDK Java 24 Released With Garbage Collector Improvements, Deprecating x86 32-bit\n\n\nFedora 42 Beta Released With Countless Improvements\n\n\nLinux Kernel's Zstd Code Gets A Co-Maintainer\n\n\nARM64 SMT Run-Time Controls Staged Ahead Of Linux 6.15\n\n\nTheora 1.2 Beta Released After 16 Years\n\n\nollama 0.6.2 Released WIth Support For AMD Strix Halo\n\n\nNginx Rejects Dark Mode Support For Error Pages\n\n\nBig Rust Update Merged For GCC 15 - Lands The Polonius Borrow Checker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Your Support, Go Premium\nPhoronix Premium allows ad-free access to the site, multi-page articles on a single page, and other features while supporting this site's continued operations.\n\n\nLatest Featured Articles\nAMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D Linux Performance\n\n\nAMD's 3D V-Cache Optimizer Driver For Squeezing More Ryzen 9 9950X3D Performance\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D Delivers Excellent Performance For Linux Developers, Creators & Technical Computing\n\n\nAMD EPYC 9845 Makes For A Persuasive Upgrade With Performance & Energy Efficiency\n\n\nSiFive HiFive Premier P550 RISC-V Linux Performance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSupport Phoronix\nThe mission at Phoronix since 2004 has centered around enriching the Linux hardware experience.

In addition to announcing video games, it's also announce something that fans of the service in Europe may want to take advantage of. When GeForce NOW first launched in Europe, there were two membership tiers available, including the Free and Founders tiers. NVIDIA says that after the successful launch, the Founders tier reached capacity, and the memberships were discontinued.\r\n\nOver the last several weeks, NVIDIA has been working to increase capacity and is now offering Founders memberships for \u00a34.99 per month for the first 12 months. The memberships are available at the GeForce NOW website and give fans longer session lengths, front of the line access, and RTX On for supported games. NVIDIA is adding 19 games this week, including Satisfactory, which launched this week alongside its official launch on Steam.\r\n\n\n\nThe game sounds like a rather strange, but interesting title, that offers players an open-world, first-person factory building game that has exploration and combat. Players explore an alien planet as they create multi-story factories alone or with friends. A number of games are also returning to GeForce NOW, the full list games includes:\r\n\n\nSatisfactory (day-and-date release with Steam launch\u2013 6/8)\nBlack Squad (returning to GeForce NOW)\nFarm Together (returning to GeForce NOW)\nMinion Masters (returning to GeForce NOW)\nSCUM (returning to GeForce NOW)\nTerminator: Resistance (returning to GeForce NOW)\nXERA: Survival (returning to GeForce NOW)\nAnno 2070 (Uplay)\nCloudpunk\nFar Cry 4 (Epic Games Store)\nFar Cry 5 (Epic)\nLeft 4 Dead\nRayman Legends (Epic and Uplay)\nRules Of Survival\nSouth Park: The Stick of Truth (Uplay)\nSouth Park: Fractured But Whole (Uplay)\nTale of Wuxia\nTom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist (Uplay)\nTotally Reliable Delivery Service\n\nAnother interesting update is a change to the NVIDIA Highlights feature that adds smart pattern and image recognition from cloud servers to detect key moments in games. When a pivotal moment is detected, the NVIDIA Highlights service automatically captures and saves the highlight. PC users will start to gain support for the feature with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive as the first title.\nAdditional games will gain support for Highlights over time, and support will come to the Mac as well. NVIDIA GeForce NOW continues to grow its library with cool and interesting games and features. One of the more interesting games that NVIDIA has added in recent memory was the shark simulation game Maneater, added in late May.\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, Gaming, geforce now, nvidia geforce now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX Spark,...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To Supercharge...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's Dream...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing Watermarks...\nBeep-Beep!

These renders show off the design in every angle (kudos to JDSP_) and, to my eye at least, seem very accurate when compared to the leaked images. These 3D visualizations will give readers a much better look at the overall aesthetic of the card instead of just one pov and angle that we saw previously. User tor6770 also pitched in with his variants so we have a very good collection of 3D renders of the NVIDIA RTX 3080 GPU here.\nNVIDIA RTX 3080 Gets Impressive 3D Renders Created By Fans\nThese collections of renders (click on the image to see it in full resolution) by user tor6770 showcase the card in excellent lighting and visibility. We can see the top and bottom of the card. Unlike the leaked pictures, we can clearly see the difference between the all-metal face and the plastic-covered face (that houses the PCB. The heating is absolutely massive and pretty much covers the entire body of the card (we had already learned that the PCB is pretty short and the heatsink actually protrudes outwards like AIB variants).\n\nThe thing I want to know is whether this is a vapor chamber heatsink (a massive one) or just a plain heatsink. The latter would seem unlikely given the lack of heat pipes unless NVIDIA has found a way to sneakily hide them somewhere (or innovated away their need). He also correctly figured out that the power connectors must be placed on the front face of the card as they are not present on the three sides visible in the leaked pictures. The RTX 3080 will likely have two 8-pin connectors and is shaping up to be an absolute monster.\nOh and by the way, the crossbars in the middle are clearly aluminum-based. I originally mentioned that we aren't sure if they are plastic or metal but we are now. There is a detail in the original leaked images (which these renders don't show) that confirms that. The RTX 3080 crossbar has a tiny engraved NVIDIA logo - something not possible with plastic. Considering this is a founder's edition card (or whatever NVIDIA ends up calling these) premium materials and design are still core to their build philosophy. We are also hopeful that these will feature high-quality power circuitry and VRM design than last generation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nIf you want to get the full impact of the card's massive heatsink, however, look no further than JDSP_'s beautiful renders which showcase the heatsink in all its glory. The crisscrossing design was expertly recreated and shows just how much cooling surface area the card possesses. Unless the RTX 3080 outputs a ton of heat, this likely means that the card will be capable of running cool and quiet yet being exceptionally powerful. The latest word on the vine is that the RTX 3080 will have 50% more performance than the RTX 2080. If this turns out to be true, then we will be looking at an absolute monster of a card in the $699 price range.\nNVIDIA is shifting to the 7nm with their RTX 3000 series lineup as well and considering their history, we expect great things from them. The original RTX series was incredibly powerful and pretty pricey and sales weren't as spectacular as the 1000 series launch which is why we [opinion] expect NVIDIA to take a more lenient approach to pricing with their RTX 3000 series graphics cards [/opinion]. In any case, the company is expected to launch these near fall 2020 (maybe around the time of the virtual Computex conference - although this is not confirmed) and around the same time as AMD's Big Navi launch.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think of NVIDIA's new RTX 3080 design?

HawkinsJun 23, 2020, 7:07 PM UTCLinkFacebookThreadsAndrew J. Hawkins is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.Mercedes-Benz is teaming up with Nvidia to develop a next-generation computing platform for vehicles that will support everything from over-the-air software updates to automated driving. The German automaker said it plans to begin rolling out the new technology across its fleet starting in 2024.The new platform will be based on Nvidia\u2019s system-on-a-chip Orin technology and will also use the San Jose-based company\u2019s full Drive AGX software stack. Nvidia first unveiled Orin at CES in December 2019, and aside from top-line specifications such as the ability to deliver up to 200 trillion operations per second while using less power, the company has yet to provide any further details.The new platform includes a full system software stack that can support a variety of automated driving applications, including advanced driver assist systems like Tesla\u2019s Autopilot and Cadillac\u2019s Super Cruise, as well as driverless parking functions like Tesla\u2019s Smart Summon.The new platform includes a full system software stack that can support a variety of automated driving applicationsIt will also enable smartphone-style over-the-air software updates on all Mercedes vehicles starting in four years. Legacy automakers have struggled to catch up to Tesla, which has long been the leader in shipping over-the-air (OTA) updates to its customers to change everything from its Autopilot driver assistance system to the range of its electric vehicles. It\u2019s similar to how Apple or Samsung, for example, can update or repair the software on a smartphone.Nvidia\u2019s Drive system can track a driver\u2019s head and eyes to assess when they\u2019re paying attention to the road, and it can monitor blink frequency to assess drowsiness. Depending on a manufacturer\u2019s preferences, Nvidia says the system can alert the driver using audio, visual, or haptic warnings to return their focus to the road. Drive IX can also monitor the environment outside the vehicle. If a driver is about to exit the vehicle without looking as a bicyclist approaches alongside, Nvidia says Drive IX provides an alert or physically prevents the door from opening until the bicyclist has safely passed.GM was one of the first major automakers to introduce an OTA system after Tesla. Ford said recently it would start rolling out software updates for its 2020 models. Now Daimler is ready to join the fray.Daimler is ready to join the OTA fray\u201cBy downloading new functions and upgrades from the cloud, we want to continuously bring the system up to date, thereby increasing the value of the vehicle,\u201d Daimler CEO Ola K\u00e4llenius said on Tuesday in a joint statement with Nvidia.The announcement is coming on the heels of the news that Mercedes\u2019 parent company Daimler and BMW were ending their automated driving partnership \u2014 a fact that didn\u2019t escape some industry analysts. The two German auto giants announced in early 2019 plans to spend over $1 billion on a joint mobility effort that spans autonomous cars, ride-hailing, electric scooters, car-sharing, and electric car charging. But this week, the two companies said the autonomous vehicle portion of the alliance would be put on hold.According to Auto News, Daimler said the BMW cooperation would have meant Mercedes would not be able to use the technology as quickly as it should be able to now with Nvidia.\u201cI think it\u2019s no coincidence,\u201d said Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at Guidehouse, on the timing of the announcement. \u201cI suspect that the two automakers couldn\u2019t agree on a platform to use and right now, Orin looks like a much more powerful solution than anything coming from Intel/Mobileye.\u201d (BMW is part of a super group, which includes Intel, Mobileye, and Fiat Chrysler, that is working on the development of semi-autonomous and fully autonomous technologies for production vehicles.)Abuelsamid noted that it\u2019s unclear how well the Nvidia software stack will perform compared to other solutions. \u201cNvidia is very focused on neural network software,\u201d he said, \u201cand most of the industry [is] shifting back to a mix of deterministic and probabilistic (AI) algorithms.\u201dNvidia, one of the world\u2019s best known manufacturers of computer graphics cards, has for several years been engaged in a high-stakes venture to build the \u201cbrains\u201d that power self-driving cars in the hopes of selling them to major automakers like Volvo, Volkswagen, and Daimler. The Santa Clara-based company wants to be the go-to supercomputer for those who may balk at the enormous expense associated with becoming a \u201cfull stack\u201d AV operator.See More: Autonomous CarsCarsMercedes-BenzNewsTechTranspoMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Follow AuthorsJun 22, 2020, 05:24pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.The annual International Supercomputer Conference (ISC), held virtually this year, kicked off today. Not surprisingly, NVIDIA has already made a few announcements of note. Especially of interest to me was the announcement of Selene, NVIDIA\u2019s in-house 1+ Exaflop AI supercomputer, which ranks as the fastest industrial system in the USA and #7 overall in the Top 500. NVIDIA also announced a new PCIe version of the A100 accelerator, six A100-based supercomputer wins and a new Mellanox UFM Cyber AI platform to predict and detect security threats and predict network failures. Still, Selene was the star of the show.\n\nSelene: A deep competitive moat\n\nMost people think of CUDA when someone mentions NVIDIA\u2019s competitive defenses. Certainly, the high-performance software is a significant advantage for NVIDIA, even 13 years after its introduction. CUDA enables HPC and AI applications to run efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs, and is embraced by programmers around the world. It supports thousands of applications on millions of GPUs. However, Selene may form an even more formidable defensive moat than the venerable CUDA libraries and tools.\u00a0\n\n\nLet\u2019s look at Selene. It is comprised of 280 NVIDIA DGX A100 servers, each with 8 Ampere GPUs, interconnected by over 490 200Gb Mellanox Switches. Supercomputers typically require up to a year to be installed, but NVIDIA engineers assembled and tested the platform in under one month\u2014a testament to the DGX platform\u2019s plug-and-play ease of installation.\nFigure 1: the Selene supercomputer was built in under a month and will provide a level of ... [+] computational capacity that can form a serious competitive weapon for NVIDIA.NVIDIA\n\nBack in 2017, NVIDIA announced the V100, along with the company\u2019s Saturn V in-house supercomputer. A top-30 supercomputer built to enable research and development of NVIDIA software and hardware, the platform has been used to increase the performance of many AI and HPC workloads at scale. Additionally, it was used extensively in the development of the new Ampere-based products.\u00a0 Having such a supercomputer available to NVIDIA engineers and partners can form a strategic competitive advantage in several areas.\u00a0\nFirst, it provides a state-of-the-art platform for software optimization and model development. Figure 2 shows that NVIDIA doubled the performance of the V100 across a wide range of HPC applications in the two years following that chip\u2019s introduction. Furthermore, the release of the mlperf benchmarks showed than NVIDIA quadrupled performance for AI, all without a single change to the hardware.\u00a0\u00a0\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\nFigure 2: NVIDIA has been able to apply its compute resources and talent to doubling or even ... [+] quadrupling the performance of their silicon after it is launched.NVIDIA\n\nSecond, a platform like Saturn V or Selene creates an powerful opportunity for research and collaboration. An example here is the development of Megatron, a billion-plus parameter natural language model extension to BERT (Bi-directional Encoder Representations from Transformers) that NVIDIA and Microsoft pioneered to advance conversational AI. Not many researchers and developers in the industry have a world-class supercomputer at their disposal to tackle such leading-edge research projects, but NVIDIA and its partners enjoy this capability. I have toured the Saturn V facility in Santa Clara, and it is truly impressive. I believe Selene will take this to the next level.\n\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, an in-house supercomputer uniquely provisions NVIDIA engineers with a massive AI platform to speed and improve product development. As I have covered previously, the use of AI is emerging as a powerful approach to speed chip development and improve the final product. Synopsis clients, for example, have used AI to explore billions of possible physical layouts, in order to produce chips that consume less power, deliver more performance, require less die area and get to market faster with fewer engineers. NVIDIA engineers working on Ampere had access to Saturn V for nearly three years, using a system that would cost tens of millions of dollars for a rival to build. The Ampere chip is the impressive result.\nConclusions\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang famously says, \u201cThe more you buy, the more you save,\u201d and applies this philosophy to his company\u2019s investments in HPC and AI for his engineers. What\u2019s good for the goose, is good for the gander, right? Consequently, NVIDIA engineers are able to produce better products, and collaborate with researchers and partners more readily than any of NVIDIA\u2019s would-be competitors (at least for now). A startup would struggle mightily to array the resources to match this level of dedicated compute capacity, and I suspect larger companies like Intel are realizing that having a system like Selene will become table stakes for those who wish to enter the game.\u00a0\nDisclosure:\u00a0Moor Insights & Strategy, like all research and analyst firms, provides or has provided research, analysis, advising and/or consulting to many high-tech companies in the industry, including NVIDIA.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I'm a senior tech contributor who writes about science and technologyFollow AuthorJun 26, 2020, 02:09pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.Mercedes-Benz Diamler\nMercedes-Benz and NVIDIA want to make the world's most advanced autonomous cars. They plan to implement an in-vehicle computing system and artificial intelligence (AI) computing infrastructure that will roll out across the next-generation Mercedes-Benz fleet starting in 2024.\n\n\nOla K\u00e4llenius, CEO of Mercedes-Benz AG and NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, made the announcement at a digital media event\u00a0on June 23, 2020.\n\nThe new infrastructure will enable perpetually upgradeable automated driving functions and the ability to automate driving of regular routes from address to address. Every next-gen model will have the highest performance NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Orin solution and be capable of a wide range of automated and assisted modes from day one and during the car's lifespan.\n\n\n\u201cFor consumers, having a fundamentally upgradeable car means [..] they will be able to enjoy their vehicle a lot longer than before,\u201d said Bernhard Wardin, a spokesperson for autonomous driving and artificial intelligence at Mercedes-Benz. \u201cIt becomes more desirable and is even able to improve on safety. We truly believe, that added functionalities over time will be a significant value proposition to our customers.\u201d\n\nDanny Shapiro, Senior Director of Automotive at NVIDIA, said that all modern devices are software-defined and upgradeable today.\n\"Think of your smartphone, tablet, or laptop. Why shouldn't the same be true for your car? The car of the future must be software-defined,\" said Shapiro. \"It starts with having a high-performance computing platform in the vehicle that runs a complex software stack enabling the most advanced features today, and is ready to run future applications that may have not even been envisioned yet.\"\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nShapiro says that with over-the-air software updates, vehicles can continuously receive the latest automated driving features. This means the cars will be state-of-the-art longer, no matter the year of the model.\n\n\"For consumers, this will bring more value over the entire lifetime of the car,\" said Shapiro.\nAs for the fate of the automated car, Shapiro says this a watershed moment for the industry.\n\n\n\"Breakthroughs in AI and computing are opening future fleets to dramatic new functionality, fundamentally transforming the vehicle architecture for the first time in decades,\" said Shapiro. \"This transformation is occurring rapidly, as the market for AI hardware, software and in-car services is worth about $5 billion today.\"\nShapiro says that by extending these capabilities to a fleet of approximately 100 million vehicles, the market can grow to $700 billion.\n\"This software-defined architecture is also opening up new business models for automakers. Mercedes-Benz can add capabilities and services over the air at any time through the life of not just one customer but also across customers through the life of the car,\" said Shapiro.\nShapiro also believes that new business models will open up for any carmaker that adopts a software-defined architecture.\n\"Revenues can be realized at the point of sale, as well as any time during the life of the vehicle. New features may be free of charge, single charge, pay by use, or subscription-based,\" said Shapiro. \"Customers have shown that when they see the value, they are more than willing to pay for new apps and services.\"\nShapiro said that the collaboration is the iPhone moment for the auto industry.\n\u201cThe shift from fixed functions of mobile phones to app-based smartphones dramatically changed the competitive landscape and created a developer ecosystem, as a result of this, consumers have benefited from the continual technology innovation,\u201d said Shapiro.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

However, while some of the rumors surrounding the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 and other potential graphics cards like it seem extremely solid, others skew to the ridiculous side of the spectrum.\u00a0There is one particular Nvidia Ampere rumor that keeps appearing that gets my attention, however: a supposed Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090. But here's the thing: it's probably not going to happen.\u00a0It'd be easy to just point at the Nvidia Turing lineup and say \"hey, there was no RTX 2090, so there won't be an RTX 3090\", but it runs a bit deeper than that. So, let's do a nice bit of deconstruction.(Image credit: Nvidia)Back to the 90sThe last Nvidia graphics card we got with the xx90 name was the Nvidia GeForce GTX 690 all the way back in 2012. The 690, just like the GTX 590 before it, was a dual-GPU card, which basically meant that users could have a sick SLI configuration while only taking up one PCIe slot.\u00a0Nvidia wasn't alone in releasing graphics cards like this back then, as AMD was in on the action too. The AMD Radeon HD 7990, for instance, came out in 2013, and was probably the last dual-GPU card that could be considered mainstream \u2013 with products like the R9 295x2 being way too expensive for everyday users to even consider.\u00a0It's not a coincidence that Nvidia dropped the xx90 naming scheme after the 690, either. It wasn't Nvidia's last dual-GPU card, that honor would go to the Nvidia Titan Z, but again, that card, along with the rest of the Titan lineup, is meant for creative workloads, rather than gaming.\u00a0Some may point to the AMD Radeon RX 590, of course, as that GPU launched just a few years ago. But again, that card was essentially just an AMD Radeon RX 580 with faster memory and an overclock.\u00a0Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.If you want to know more about the history of these dual GPU graphics cards, here's a video from Tech Showdown that goes into some pretty exhaustive detail, going all the way back to the Voodoo II:(Image credit: Future)That single GPU lifeSince the AMD Radeon HD 7990 and Nvidia GeForce GTX 690, it seems like any dual GPUs that came out were separate from the main graphics card lineup from either GPU manufacturer, and there's definitely a reason for that.\u00a0I reached out to Nvidia and it told me that the question ultimately boils down to diminishing returns. I was told that \"dual GPUs are expensive to produce and require adequate cooling and thermal/acoustics. There\u2019s also a limited market for them.\"\u00a0The best graphics cards are already getting more and more expensive \u2013 you just have to look at the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti for evidence of that. That graphics card launched at $1,199 (\u00a31,099, AU$1,899), with a whopping 250W TDP. Nvidia even had to adopt a dual-fan design with its Founders Edition cards with this generation, and in our testing, temperatures still get super-hot.\u00a0But, it's a bit more complicated than \"it's expensive and hot\". Games are built differently then they were a decade ago, and with the advent of DirectX 12, the onus is on developers to bake in support for multi-GPU configurations.\u00a0When I asked Nvidia about this I was told \"SLI was a huge hit for us when we launched it 16 years ago. At that time however, there were no APIs to support game scaling, so NVIDIA did all of the heavy lifting in our software drivers.\" In fact, SLI was even successful and \"folks were eager to pair two GPUs in their system using the SLI bridge. A dual GPU like the 690, is essentially the same thing, just on a single PCB (board).\"But because of the change in software support, things have changed, and that comes from APIs changing from implicit mGPU support to explicit mGPU support. With the former, multi GPU support came down to Nvidia: it would update graphics drivers with profiles for different games, making sure that SLI configurations worked well. However, with explicit mGPU, that shifts over to the game developers, who have to bake support straight into the game engine \u2013 while Nvidia still has to do a lot of heavy lifting on its end, too.\u00a0So, as Nvidia puts it: \"explicit mGPU is rarely worth the time for the developer since the scaling result isn\u2019t worth the investment. Plus, as our GPUs have become more powerful, and capable of doing 4K over 60fps as an example, there\u2019s really no compelling reason to build a card with two GPUs.\"It's impossible to completely rule out a future dual-GPU card entirely, but it doesn't seem very likely that we'll see one again in the near future, at least until 8K gaming becomes a thing, which will probably be a long time.\u00a0(Image credit: Nvidia)Does it have to be dual GPU?Now that we're back in the world of speculation, it's possible that Nvidia will just put out a single-GPU card with xx90 branding and call it a day. I don't think that's going to happen either.\u00a0One of my colleagues pointed out the Intel Core i9-9900K and AMD Ryzen 9 3900X as an example, saying that could point to a shift in the components industry to having the number \"9\" as branding. But I think there's some important context missing here.\u00a0Now, this is entirely my interpretation of the Coffee Lake Refresh release, but the Core i9-9900K appeared after AMD Ryzen 2nd generation processors like the Ryzen 7 2700X started threatening Intel's long standing desktop superiority.\u00a0The Intel Core i9 branding was around before that, but only on HEDT processors like the Intel Core i9-7980XE \u2013 there was no 8th-generation X-series chips... oops. However, when faced with AMD's rising competition and a manufacturing process that was \u2013 and still is \u2013 stagnant, Intel had to bring in the big guns with the Core i9-9900K.\u00a0And, in turn, AMD responded with the AMD Ryzen 9 3900X and the Ryzen 9 3950X, both of which remain unchallenged by Intel nearly a full year after Ryzen 3000's initial launch.\u00a0While the Core i9 and Ryzen 9 branding is probably here to stay, that moment hasn't really happened in the graphics card market yet. AMD RDNA 2 is somewhere off on the horizon promising to bring ray tracing and 4K gaming to AMD Radeon users, but it's not here yet. Assuming both AMD and Nvidia are dropping new graphics cards this year, Nvidia doesn't really have much of a reason to shift up that branding.\u00a0The biggest rumor pointing to the RTX 3090 revolves around the idea that there will be three graphics cards using the top-end GA102 GPU, but, like Nvidia Titan is a thing. If I had to just guess what those three graphics cards would be, I'd suggest an RTX 3080 Ti, and if anything two Titan cards.\u00a0Nvidia has been going all-in on creators over the last couple years, especially with its RTX Studio program, so my money is still on one halo flagship gaming card, with any other GA102 GPUs \u2013 if that's even what it's called \u2013 being reserved for pro-level Nvidia Titan graphics cards.\u00a0Still, this is all speculation. So, if this is wrong, Nvidia \u2013 prove it.\u00a0We'll show you how to build a PC\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nBill ThomasSocial Links NavigationBill Thomas (Twitter) is TechRadar's computing editor.

But there's at least one hunk of positivity to come out of this (besides a better game and happier devs, but that's a different story). Yes, if you've been keen to experience Cyberpunk 2077 at its absolute best come November 19, you may now have the chance to do so with next-generation Nvidia and AMD silicon.But which graphics card do you choose: Nvidia Ampere or AMD Big Navi? There's a good chance you'll have your pick of the bunch by the time CD Projekt Red's sci-fi epic hits the shelves.\u00a0AMD is convinced that it will get RDNA 2 graphics cards out of the door before the year's up, and Nvidia is rumoured to be readying a GeForce-grade RTX 30-series Ampere graphics card announcement this August, with a view to get these cards into the market in September. That's the general scuttlebutt, anyways.We're not certain of the exact dates for either company's next-gen kit yet, but you can be sure that, if we are to see these cards in 2020, they'll be available before November 19.AMD RDNA 2 will be the first architecture from the company to introduce real-time ray tracing acceleration under the hood, yet Cyberpunk 2077 is already confirmed with Nvidia RTX support, suggesting Nvidia Ampere's touted ray tracing gusto alone will be best able to deliver on the game's promised ray-traced ambient occlusion and diffused illumination.That feels like a big win for Ampere, but don't rule out team Radeon just yet. The ray-traced future might be green, but we're optimistic for Big Navi to challenge Nvidia's 4K dominance and offer a genuine alternative in the high-end\u2014one which should be competitive in price, too.The RDNA architecture represented a significant shake-up over the GCN architecture when it was introduced last July, and we're expecting further gains for the gaming-first architecture with its second iteration. Of course, as PC gaming enthusiasts, we're most enthused by Big Navi, the promising high-end 4K card, but the architecture will also make its way into mid- and entry-level graphics cards.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.(Image credit: CD Projekt)While we don't know how demanding Cyberpunk 2077 will be of your PC parts on release, it certainly looks to be quite demanding in scope and scale alone. Colossal textures and ray tracing beget mammoth GPUs, and likely increased costs, and the Nvidia Ampere generation, or what we expect of it so far, sure sounds like it is able to deliver in swathes\u2014we may even see a brand new SKU, the RTX 3090 Ti, join the fray at launch.So which GPU will be your gateway to Night City and all that Cyberpunk 2077 has to offer? The prestigious title of best graphics card may be hotly-contested come November, but there's one component we're sure will make the cut: AMD Ryzen 4000 CPUs.\u00a0Despite on-again, off-again rumours aplenty, which you'd do well to dismiss for the most part, AMD has confirmed that Zen 3 CPUs are heading our way before the year's up too. While Intel still holds the lead with its recently released Comet Lake CPUs, and its top chip, the Core i9 10900K, we're desperately awaiting AMD Ryzen 4000's arrival.These fresh chips, hot off of the TSMC 7nm manufacturing line, will surely be the chip of choice come November, and we're betting it will take pride of place within many a Cyberpunk 2077 build, too.What's your ideal Cyberpunk 2077 PC build? An AMD Ryzen 4950X and Nvidia RTX 3090? Yeah, we thought as much. The combination is sure to get any enthusiast salivating, but I'm also aware such a puissant PC build would likely deal my bank account a mortal blow. Here's hoping for generous 1440p performance on a budget come November.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\nRDNA\n\n\nJacob RidleySocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, HardwareJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

It's the first time we've seen a GPU in a performance bracket like this - if you discount the below photo that leaked a couple weeks back - with a performance output in 3DMark that appears to be up to 26% faster than the RTX 2080 Ti. \nLet's plunge into the numbers. The GPU achieved a score of 18,257 in the graphics component of 3DMark's Time Spy benchmark. That score could be considered proof enough that this is a new GPU. A Titan RTX can't generally get that high without exotic cooling like liquid nitrogen.\nRelative to the average scores that 3DMark provides, it's 21% faster than the Titan RTX and 26% faster than the RTX 2080 Ti. Thumbs up, Nvidia.\nYou should note, this ain't no run-of-the-mill GPU - this is an alien from the exotic GA102 species. That'll be the flagship die that a different set of GPUs could use: the next Titan, a stack of Quadro cards, and some gaming graphics cards potentially called the GeForce RTX 3080 and RTX 3090.\nA few leakers are confident that the GA102 will have up to 5,376 cores, but there's no verdict on the precise core configurations of specific models, although strangely, everyone agrees on the memory capacities as specified in the tweet below...\n\n2nd Gen NVIDIA TITAN\nGA102-400-A1 5376 24GB 17Gbps\nGeForce RTX 3090\nGA102-300-A1 5248 12GB 21Gbps\nGeForce RTX 3080\nGA102-200-Kx-A1 4352 10GB 19Gbps\n--- KatCorgi (@KkatCorgi) June 19, 2020\n\nParties that approximately agree with these numbers include: Rogame, Kopite7kimi, and Igor's Lab. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Asus raises RTX 5090 and RX 9070 prices, making graphics cards even more expensive \n\n\n\n Razer Blade 16 pricing leaks: $2,000 for RTX 5060 model \n\n\n\nIt's been assumed that this next-gen GPU is the flagship RTX 3090 because of how well it performs, but it could also be the RTX 3080. That will all depend on how Nvidia decides to position and market the GPUs ahead of release.\n\nOther things to note: 3DMark recorded a 1935 MHz clock speed during the benchmark, a 25% increase over the RTX 2080 Ti's 1545 MHz. In other words, the upcoming GPU doesn't necessarily need a higher core count than the RTX 2080 Ti to reach that performance bracket. However, it is expected that Nvidia will release at least one card that does have a higher core count, most likely by the end of the year.\nDark times await AMD Radeon fans, unless big Navi delivers, of course.\n\n\n\n\n 87 comments\n \n6.5K likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows Defender misidentifies key driver, disrupting popular PC monitoring tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

I was also very excited thanks to the preview I was able to do during Gamescom last year.\nWhat wasn't really talked about, but was clearly on display during today's Night City Wire is some of the tech that the game will support. This is where NVIDIA steps in, revealing some of the features to be found within what was shown today. Specifically, the game will use ray tracing and will support NVIDIA DLSS 2.0.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total CostHere are some of the ray-traced features that you can expect to find in Cyberpunk 2077 at launch:\n\nRay-traced ambient occlusion - Ambient occlusion is a shading and rendering technique used to calculate how exposed each point in a scene is to ambient lighting. The result is a diffuse shading effect that darkens enclosed and sheltered areas and enhances the rendered image's overall tone. In Cyberpunk 2077, ray-traced ambient occlusion additionally can be used with local lights to approximate local shadowing effects where shadows are missing.\nRay-traced diffuse illumination - This technique is used to capture sky radiance as well as emissive lighting from various surfaces, which is difficult to achieve with traditional rendering techniques.\nRay-traced reflections - In Cyberpunk 2077, ray-traced reflections are used on all surfaces and can trace ranges for up to several kilometers. They are present on both opaque and transparent objects to simulate the way light reflects from glossy and metal surfaces by tracing a single bounce of reflection rays against the scene. This includes smooth natural mirrors like window glass, but also rougher surfaces like brushed metal. Unlike screen space techniques which can only reflect what\u2019s on screen, ray-traced reflections incorporate the entire scene around the character, and can accurately represent objects outside the camera view or facing away from the camera.\nRay-traced shadows - Cyberpunk 2077 preview supports directional shadows from the sun and the moon. These shadows aim to be physically accurate and even account for light scattering from clouds. Shadows may be enhanced in the final release to support other types of light sources where it is needed.\n\nEverything will be supported when Cyberpunk 2077 launches on the 19th of November, which is a big positive. Jason Paul, vice president of GeForce platform marketing at NVIDIA had this to say:\nCyberpunk 2077 is one of the most anticipated games of all-time. Combined with CD PROJEKT RED\u2019s incredible story-telling and stunning artistry, RTX-powered ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 help to make Cyberpunk 2077 a \u2018must-play\u2019 game of 2020.\nIf you want to check out the trailer and the Night City Wire feature, check out our piece and Nate's take from it. It's well worth the watch.

The information comes from Igor, who has been an incredibly reliable source of leaks in the past and we have also independently confirmed the same. In other words, the TGP and its breakdown is not a rumor, although we are still not a 100% sure on the nomenclature (NVIDIA may decide to call it something other than an RTX 3090 or play around etc).\nNVIDIA's Flagship GPU RTX 3090 Gets TGP Breakdown, GPU Core TDP Itself Is 230W\nNVIDIA has usually played nice with power consumption on its graphics cards for the sake of power efficiency but gamers don't usually care for the same. I don't know of any gamer that would rather have a power-efficient card instead of a powerful one in the same price. This is why this particular leak is very interesting.\nBefore we go any further, however, let's contextualize this leak: the RTX 2080 Ti had a maximum TGP of 260W on some custom variants. The RTX 3090 (or whatever NVIDIA decides to call it) will have a TGP of 350W and a TDP (GPU only) of 230W. This is a massive increase in power consumption - one that will likely be accompanied by some truly phenomenal performance gains.\n\nThis also explains the heatsink we saw in leaks earlier because you would need an absolutely mammoth cooling solution to tame this beast. It would appear that NVIDIA is planning to go out guns blazing with a chip that is designed to run extremely fast and output a ton of heat. Jensen is clearly missing his record quarters and it is showing. The complete breakdown of wattages (approximated to a few watts) is given below:\n\n\n\nEstimated Power Consumption / Losses\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Graphics Power TGP350 Watts\n\n\n24 GB GDDR6X Memory (GA_0180_P075_120X140, 2.5 Watts per Module)-60 Watts\n\n\nMOSFET, Inductor, Caps NVDD (GPU Voltage)-26 Watts\n\n\nMOSFET, Inductor, Caps FBVDDQ (Framebuffer Voltage)-6 Watts\n\n\nMOSFET, Inductor, Caps PEXVDD (PCIExpress Voltage)-2 Watts\n\n\nOther Voltages, Input Section (AUX)-4 Watts\n\n\nFans, Other Power-7 Watts\n\n\nPCB Losses-15 Watts\n\n\nGPU Powerapprox. 230 Watts\n\n\n\nThe RTX 3090's GA102 GPU core itself will draw roughly 230 watts of power with the memory drawing 60 watts. The MOSFETs will consume a further 30 watts of power with the fan coming in at 7 watts. PCB losses are expected to be in the range of 15 watts and input section consumption will be around 4 watts. All of this totals to a total board power of 350 watts for the RTX 3090 and keep in mind this is the FE. The custom boards are likely going to go even higher.\nSo what exactly is happening here? Well, what you are seeing is NVIDIA unleashing all of its fury in one single product. Shifting to the 7nm node will actually lower power consumption - all things held constant - but clearly NVIDIA wants to trade away the power efficiency gains from 7nm and instead roll out an absolute beast of a GPU. We have already heard rumors that they have up-specced the RTX 3080 (and pretty much all their lineup) so users will be looking at double-digit performance gains (think 40-50%) going from the RTX 2000 series to the 3000.\nI also have a very strong suspicion [opinion] that you are going to see NVIDIA slash performance per dollar pricing across the board as well. The RTX 2000 series was relatively deadpanned compared to the reception of the GTX 1000 series and I think NVIDIA will likely want to capitalize on the opportunity of the new process by increasing their Total Available Market (TAM).\nSince Computex is canceled, NVIDIA will likely be going with a virtual event again although we expect the timeline to be unaffected (still around September). With the next-gen consoles rocking 10+ TFLOPs of power, NVIDIA will also be feeling a lot of pressure to not only offer higher performance but in a comparable price bracket. All this is very good for the consumer. That said, I am still fairly certain that the NVIDIA premium will remain higher than Radeon counterparts - just not as high as the RTX Turing series [/opinion].\n\n\n\nWhich GPU in the NVIDIA Ampere lineup are you most excited for?\n\n\n RTX 3090/Titan (flaghsip)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n RTX 3080 Ti/Super\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n RTX 3080\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n RTX 3070 Ti/Super\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n RTX 3070\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n AMD's Big Navi for me\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX 3080 GPU Prices Fall Of A Cliff Overnight In Australia, Global Prices Should Follow\n\nUsman Pirzada\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlleged Nintendo Switch 2 Specs Leak Out: Powered by NVIDIA Ampere GPU With Ray Tracing & DLSS 2.2 Support\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA To Unveil GeForce RTX 3080 12 GB Graphics Card on 11th January\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Launches A2 Tensor Core GPU, An Entry-Level Design Powered By Ampere GA107 GPU & 16 GB GDDR6 Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n79\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n40\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n34\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n27\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n23\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\n12V-2\u00d76 Power Connector Cooks At Over 150\u00b0C With A \u201cWater-Cooled\u201d NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090\n\n\n\n1360\nComments\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Releases Another Hotfix Driver to Resolve Black Screen Issues, Marking the Firm\u2019s Fifth Attempt to Address The Problem\n\n\n\n1300\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1285\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The center of the heatsink forms an 'X' intersection with the fins extruding outwards. There also seem to be at least four massive heat pipes running through all 4 heatsinks. The heatsinks are pictured from the front and you can see the placement for one of the two fans which will be featured on the graphics card.\nNVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3080 heatsink has leaked out showcasing an all-aluminum fin design and four massive heatpipes. (Image Credits: Videocardz)\nThe design is interesting in the sense that not only does it goes all out with a fin and heat pipe design, the first design of its kind since the original Founders Edition launch back with NVTTM on the GeForce GTX 780 but it also comes with two unique fan placements, one on the front and one at the bottom. This push and pull fan design which as it is referred is yet to be tested in the field on a graphics card but it's definitely one unique implementation.\nIt will be particularly interesting to see how the Founders Edition cooling system performs against the onslaught of custom designs that one can expect from a major NVIDIA graphics card launch. I have been told by two manufacturers that they already have designs well underway for NVIDIA's next-generation GeForce graphics cards but they are yet to reach final assembly line given that the green team hasn't disclosed details of these cards such as clocks, TDPs and PCB designs to its AIB partners.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Fan-Made Renders (via JDSP_ @ Reddit):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nNVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3080 is expected to launch in the coming months with Gamescom 2020 in August looking like a potential venue for NVIDIA to host the launch of its next-generation GeForce RTX 30 series lineup. We have definitely heard some specifications from the rumor mill but personally, I would wait to see more credible leaks which won't be long now since the cards have already leaked out. Expect more details in the coming months.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n160\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Not only that, it is looking increasingly likely that what we saw just a few short days ago is what will end up shipping to consumers, as opposed to being a prototype design.\n\n\nOf course, nothing is set in stone\u2014we are still dealing with leaks and speculation, and even if everything up to this point has been real, NVIDIA could still decide to change things up and go in a different direction. So, there is your multi-layered disclaimer.\n\n\nThis newly leaked photo (shown up top) shows a set of heatsinks with the cooling shrouds and fans removed. As we have seen before, the unique design positions the two cooling fans on opposite sides\u2014one would blow directly on top of the GPU, and the other would be situated on the backside at the other end of the card.\n\n\nThe finned designed is interesting, and a little perplexing. Obviously the finned heatsink helps facilitate the removal of heat from the GPU, RAM, and other components, with air channels in between. But what is less obvious is the airflow scheme at play. We have to think that NVIDIA engineered a functional design rather than one that simply looks different.\n\n\nAdding to the intrigue is the push-pull configuration of the cooling fans. It has been suggested by a user on Reddit (where this image was posted) that since the fans push air into the card from different sides, hot air gets exhausted in the middle section where there the diagonal fins are positioned.\n\n\nIt is an interesting theory, particularly since the previously leaked photo (and subsequent fan-made renders) of the GeForce RTX 3080 with the shroud attached shows that the middle section would be partially blocked. Or at least that is the case on the side of the card. The angled fins, however, would channel hot air to the top and bottom.\n\n\nThis essentially means your case would need excellent airflow itself, since the hot air would be expelled above and below the card. And if NVIDIA sticks to the same blueprint for its Founders Edition models, these will be overclocked cards to boot.\n\n\nHopefully we have some clarity soon. Rumor has it NVIDIA will launch its Ampere-based consumer graphics cards (including a GeForce RTX 3090) in September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, (nasdaq:nvda), ampere, geforce rtx 3080\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX Spark,...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To Supercharge...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's Dream...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing Watermarks...\nBeep-Beep!

Amazon and Google's cloud services have roughly the same amount of options as well.\nIT departments should educate themselves on the technical differences of AMD vs. Nvidia and what kind of workloads they are best suited for.\n\nHow do different GPU offerings work?\nFrom a virtualization perspective, GPU-based offerings are primarily aimed at remote visualization and encoding. These offerings provide a GPU-based desktop or application to remote end users.\nAMD and Nvidia have been working on GPU cards specifically suited for AI, and deep learning-based workloads such as the popular machine learning engine Tensorflow. These GPUs are also the preferred choice of hardware to accelerate computational workloads in modern high-performance computing-based offerings.\nFor remote visualization workloads on traditional hypervisors, there are three options available to provide GPU capabilities to a virtual machine:\nPass-through. Mapping a physical GPU card directly to a virtual machine through the hypervisor. Technologies that use this method include VMware DirectPath I/O, XenServer GPU Passthrough and Hyper-V Discrete Device Assignment.\nVirtual Shared Graphics. Hypervisor-based sharing of GPUs to virtual machines. Technologies that use this method include VMware vSGA and the previous feature in Hyper-v RemoteFX vGPU.\nVirtual GPU (vGPU). GPU-based virtualization, having virtual GPU profiles attached to each virtual machine. Technologies that use this method include Nvidia vGPU and AMD MxGPU.\nThe main differences between these three delivery models are scale and compatibility with the different GPU capabilities to the virtual machine.\nPass-through mode provides full graphics compatibility, which means the end user can access the full functionality of the GPU attached to the machine. However, this approach does not provide scale because the GPU cards are locked to one virtual machine.\nThis can also mean that resources are not being used most efficiently. Organizations typically use pass-through mode for specific workloads that require more dedicated capacity.\nWith the second option of shared vGPU, the GPU capacity is split into multiple virtualized instances that can be attached to multiple virtual machines. The vGPU method also provides full functionality, but it ensures that each virtual machine has access to a certain amount of the underlying GPU resources.\nThe third option, regular vGPU, has been the most common deployment model for visualization workloads. For example, IT can run Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktop or VMware Horizon to provide GPU capabilities to multiple end users.\n\n\nAMD vs. Nvidia comparison of vGPU products\nBoth AMD and Nvidia provide vGPU-based products, but there is a difference in their delivery models that organizations must understand before they choose a vendor.\n\n\n\n    Nvidia's vGPU offerings are based on installing host drivers within the hypervisor, which allocates the virtual graphics cards to the guest VMs.\n   \n\n\n\nNvidia's vGPU offerings are based on installing host drivers within the hypervisor, which allocates the virtual graphics cards to the guest VMs. AMD is, however, a fully hardware-based approach with its MxGPU offering, based on the hardware feature called single root input/output virtualization (SR-IOV).\nBoth vendors also take different approaches from the hardware side. Nvidia implements Timeshare Scheduling in its GPU. This means that each user accessing the GPU gets access to all physical cores on the GPU for a time-slice. On the other hand, AMD allocates a portion of the GPU cores to each machine directly.\nNvidia's approach works well in situations when all users don't need full access to the GPU at all times. This approach allows users to share the resources with less friction. Nvidia's architecture also allows for live migration of virtual machines running with vGPU, which is not possible with AMD's MxGPU feature, but this feature comes at a cost.\nYears after Nvidia released its vGPU offering, it altered its sales model to require a software license on top of their GPU cards. In addition to the Nvidia hardware, customers also need to buy a license to access software upgrades and activate the vGPU features.\nAMD, on the other hand, does not require customers to buy any additional licenses to activate their MxGPU offering. Additionally, the MxGPU offering allows customers to provide virtualized graphics on top of the different cloud providers because it is hardware-based.\nAMD MxGPU instances are now available in Microsoft Azure and they are one of the default options when choosing GPU-based VDI on Amazon AppStream.\nNvidia still has a larger footprint within major cloud providers such as Amazon, Google Cloud, Azure and even Oracle Cloud. However, this is only on virtual machines with dedicated GPU cards, which come at a much higher cost compared to AMD offerings, depending on the use cases.\u00a0\nMany of the most popular virtualization products with libraries for machine learning, deep learning and even statistical workloads have built-in support for the compute unified device architecture model. This model is only available on NVIDIA GPU cards.\n\n\nAMD vs. Nvidia comparison: The verdict\nBoth Nvidia and AMD have evolved over the past couple of years and have their strengths and weaknesses. While AMD has been less visible in the public cloud market, they are well positioned to gain momentum now that more cloud vendors are adopting their MxGPU Offering.\nMxGPU-powered desktops will always be cheaper than Nvidia's GPUs for both on-premises or cloud-hosted desktops. However, organizations that want the best performance and may want to support machine learning or other high-performance workloads should go with Nvidia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDig Deeper on Virtual and remote desktop strategies\n\n\n\nAssign GPUs to virtual machines with VMware vGPU mode\n\n\n\n\nBy: Stephen\u00a0Bigelow\n\n\n\n\nWhat do GPUs do in your data center?\n\n\n\n\nBy: Allyson\u00a0Larcom\n\n\n\n\nNvidia vs. AMD: Compare GPU offerings\n\n\n\n\nBy: Daniel\u00a0Robinson\n\n\n\n\nYou can now run a Nvidia vGPU on VMware infrastructure\n\n\n\n\nBy: Allyson\u00a0Larcom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored News\n\n\nPrivate AI Demystified\n\u2013Equinix\n\n\nFlexible IT: When Performance and Security Can\u2019t Be Compromised\n\u2013Dell Technologies\n\n\n3 Transformative VDI Use Cases for Hybrid Work\n\u2013Dell Technologies\n\nSee More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRelated Content\n\n\nGPU virtualization evolves with new chip types on the...\n\u2013 Search IT Operations\n\n\nGPU virtualization eases system workloads, boosts ...\n\u2013 Search IT Operations\n\n\nHow to handle increasing VDI graphics processing needs\n\u2013 Search Virtual Desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest TechTarget resources\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEnterprise Desktop\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCloud Computing\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVMware\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch Enterprise Desktop\n\n\n\n\nHow to deal with unmanaged devices in the enterprise\nUnmanaged devices present numerous risks, but how did they gain access to the network without any management in place?

With NVIDIA's global leadership in accelerated computing and Mercedes-Benz's experience in the manufacturing of premium cars,\u00a0together,\u00a0they plan to create a new software-defined\u00a0vehicle\u00a0that\u00a0includes\u00a0in-vehicle computing systems and AI computing architecture. Mercedes-Benz and NVIDIA plan on rolling out the first fleet of cars with this architecture\u00a0starting in\u00a02024.\u00a0\u00a0On a call with investors, NVIDIA CEO\u00a0Jensen Huang called this \u201cthe single biggest\u00a0business model transformation\u201d in the history of the company, allowing the two companies to share recurring revenues for future feature purchases and subscriptions.\u00a0\n\n\nNVIDIA is primarily known for its gaming GPUs, but it is no stranger to making silicon for autonomous vehicles. At\u00a0CES 2018,\u00a0the company\u00a0revealed its partnership with Volkswagen and Uber to put AI technology and\u00a0AV\u00a0capabilities into their cars as well as the release of\u00a0the\u00a0Xavier processors as part of its DRIVE\u00a0AGX\u00a0Pegasus platform. At\u00a0CES\u00a0a year later, NVIDIA unveiled the world's first commercially available Level 2+ automated driving system.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAt\u00a0GTC\u00a0this year, NVIDIA announced that it is putting its Ampere technology in the NVIDIA DRIVE platform. The newest SoC,\u00a0called Orin,\u00a0will be offered in advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), L2+autopilot, and\u00a0L5\u00a0robotaxi systems, as the\u00a0platform has several scalable solutions. NVIDIA also announced at this event all the partners\u00a0they\u2019re\u00a0working with to advance AV,\u00a0from automotive companies that specialize in trucks to\u00a0digital\u00a0mapping companies. Orin is the SoC that Mercedes-Benz and NVIDIA's software-defined architecture will be based\u00a0on.\u00a0\n\nNVIDIA's Orin SoC consists of 17 billion transistorsNVIDIA\nNVIDIA and Mercedes-Benz have an AV leadership\u00a0mentality\u00a0\n\nOne of the reasons this is such great news is because it puts the infant AV industry into a competitive state. If you have read any of my previous posts on AV, specifically\u00a0here, you would know that Tesla is largely ahead of the game when it comes to automating its vehicles fully. In the post above, I mention that NVIDIA's automotive computing solutions (ACS)\u00a0supply\u00a0the firepower for other companies like Mercedes-Benz to compete with Tesla. While Tesla is doing the work of NVIDIA and Mercedes Benz in terms of manufacturing its vehicles and ACS, NVIDIA can partner with automotive manufactures to bring the technology to\u00a0different parts of the industry. With that being said, we\u00a0have to\u00a0look at why the partnership between NVIDIA and Mercedes is beneficial.\u00a0\u00a0\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nMercedes-Benz sold nearly 2.4 million passenger cars last year and more than 438,000 vans worldwide. It is a pioneer\u00a0in innovation and says that it aspires to be a leader in the\u00a0fields of connectivity, automated driving, and alternative powertrains. Mercedes-Benz is one of the largest, if not\u00a0the\u00a0largest seller of\u00a0premium vehicles\u00a0in the world. When we look at new technology, we always\u00a0have to\u00a0start somewhere, and that usually means starting from the top.\u00a0But according to Mercedes, they plan to enable every car in their fleet starting in 2024.\u00a0\n\nNVIDIA's founder and CEO Jensen Huang and Chairman of the Board of Management of Daimler AG and Head of Mercedes-Benz AG Ola\u00a0K\u00e4llenius, already\u00a0appear to\u00a0have a good relationship\u00a0from previous partnership activities.\u00a0This\u00a0deal should build on that rapport.\u00a0\n\n\nVariables NVIDIA and Mercedes-Benz have already thought through\u00a0\nThere are many problems and\u00a0speed\u00a0bumps that NVIDIA and Mercedes-Benz are going to face.\u00a0Jensen and Ola addressed\u00a0some of those\u00a0hurdles\u00a0in their press release\u00a0here. Jensen acknowledged that it would take time to make all cars autonomous on the road.\u00a0It\u00a0is not an endeavor that will take just a couple of years but could take even a decade. Making all cars autonomous will involve many\u00a0obstacles\u00a0that are\u00a0hard to imagine now.\u00a0\nOla mentioned that putting autonomous hardware into a vehicle is like making a smartphone on wheels. To that, he is right, and it brings up some interesting points. When we look at the history of smartphone devices, smartphones rarely\u00a0last longer than two to three years. Vehicles, on the other hand, can last somebody a lifetime. So how can NVIDIA take this differentiation into account to make a car's autonomous hardware last? That is where the vehicle's ability to be upgradeable is so\u00a0essential and what I think is a major reason Mercedes-Benz is intelligently partnering with NVIDIA. NVIDIA has the experience of upgradeability in the gaming industry.\u00a0NVIDIA and Mercedes-Benz have a long history of innovation in engineering in their respective ... [+] fields.Mercedes-Benz\nMercedes-Benz and NVIDIA plan on making their cars perpetually upgradeable, including software that is developed on supercomputers and then uploaded\u00a0to\u00a0the vehicle. Ola addressed a question with the upgradeability solution concerning people driving around in 20-year-old designs with the newest hardware.\u00a0He\u00a0said it\u00a0shouldn't\u00a0be a problem, and I agree with him on that. Many people\u00a0upgrade their vehicles for more than just the reason\u00a0for\u00a0it not working. Imagine if iPhones were supported for a whole decade rather than only five years. There will be some users who keep their phones, but\u00a0more often than not, consumers will continuously buy the newest model, as they do now.\u00a0\u00a0\nSome higher road bumps the AV will have to face\u00a0\nThere are\u00a0industry-changing aspects of this automotive transformation as well. Cars will keep their value as they continuously receive updates rather than losing value as soon as they roll\u00a0off the lot. It will\u00a0open up\u00a0a new market for application and automotive developers.\u00a0Also,\u00a0cars will\u00a0increasingly\u00a0be on\u00a0the cutting\u00a0edge with 5G support. I am interested to hear from Jenson and Ola how 5G will be a factor in all of this. I believe it has the power to implement better safety precautions, more efficient traffic-related routes, updates, etc.\u00a0\u00a0\nDuring the press event,\u00a0Jensen and Ola talked about recurring revenue\u00a0for both companies\u00a0from software sales and subscriptions.\u00a0While they\u00a0didn\u2019t\u00a0discuss numbers,\u00a0this has got to represent a sizable upside in potential revenue.\u00a0They even intimated that the secondhand owner of one of these supercomputer-enabled cars could continue to purchase updates and add-ons.\u00a0The question is which updates will be for a one-time payment and which will be subscription-based.\u00a0\u00a0\nAutonomous vehicles not only need to continue to be more technologically advanced, but they also bring up ethical dilemmas and moral arguments that will\u00a0be\u00a0in the heart and the code of the AI.\u00a0Vehicle safety is going to\u00a0face\u00a0heavy criticism until\u00a0we have complete street autonomy.\u00a0At that point, will there be laws facing those who desire to drive themselves? Are people infringing on other people's rights to safety when they desire to drive themselves? I think these problems will be far down the road,\u00a0but\u00a0they are\u00a0challenges that should be thought of and addressed from the beginning.\u00a0\nGoing back to ethical dilemmas and moral arguments for safety, how will NVIDIA and Mercedes-Benz program its software when it faces a car crash? Will my car be programmed to always\u00a0prioritize\u00a0my life\u00a0over others\u00a0in a car crash, all lives\u00a0even at the possible cost of my life\u00a0or others'? And, who decides to program our fate and who gets the responsibility of the outcome? These questions are going to have incredible implications in the future of the AV industry. I\u00a0don't\u00a0think these are\u00a0bumps in the road\u00a0and problems that NVIDIA and Mercedes-Benz will have to face alone. I do commend them both for being bold enough to be one of the first, however.\u00a0\u00a0\nWrapping up\u00a0\nDuring the live-streamed joint press event,\u00a0Huang said, \u201cThis is the biggest partnership of its kind in the transportation industry that\u2019s ever happened.\u201d Indeed,\u00a0I want to\u00a0come\u00a0back to this post four years\u00a0from now\u00a0when Mercedes-Benz rolls out its first line\u00a0of\u00a0vehicles with NVIDIA's software-defined architecture. I believe this partnership between NVIDIA and Mercedes-Benz is going to be beneficial for consumers, partners, and even Tesla, as a competitive market always sparks innovation. With NVIDIA's leadership\u00a0in accelerated computing and Mercedes-Benz's global leadership in luxury consumer vehicles, I think\u00a0autonomous\u00a0vehicles have a bright future.\u00a0\n\nNote: Moor Insights & Strategy co-op Jacob Freyman contributed to this article.\u00a0\nDisclosure: Moor Insights & Strategy, like all research and analyst firms, provides or has provided paid research, analysis, advising, or consulting to many high-tech companies in the industry, including Amazon.com, Advanced Micro Devices,\u00a0Apstra,\u202fARM Holdings, Aruba Networks, AWS, A-10 Strategies,\u00a0Bitfusion,\u202fCisco Systems, Dell, Dell\u202fEMC, Dell Technologies, Diablo Technologies, Digital Optics,\u00a0Dreamchain, Echelon, Ericsson, Foxconn, Frame, Fujitsu, Gen Z Consortium, Glue Networks, GlobalFoundries,\u202fGoogle,\u202fHP\u202fInc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Huawei\u202fTechnologies,\u202fIBM, Intel, Interdigital, Jabil Circuit, Konica Minolta, Lattice Semiconductor, Lenovo, Linux Foundation, MACOM (Applied Micro),\u00a0MapBox,\u00a0Mavenir, Mesosphere,\u202fMicrosoft,\u202fNational Instruments, NetApp, NOKIA, Nortek,\u202fNVIDIA, ON Semiconductor, ONUG, OpenStack Foundation, Panasas,\u00a0Peraso, Pixelworks, Plume Design,\u00a0Portworx, Pure Storage,\u202fQualcomm, Rackspace, Rambus,\u00a0Rayvolt\u00a0E-Bikes, Red Hat, Samsung Electronics, Silver Peak, SONY,\u00a0Springpath, Sprint, Stratus Technologies, Symantec, Synaptics, Syniverse,\u00a0TensTorrent,\u00a0Tobii\u00a0Technology, Twitter, Unity Technologies, Verizon Communications,\u202fVidyo, Wave Computing,\u00a0Wellsmith, Xilinx, Zebra, which may be cited in this article.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

It detects performance degradations, usage and profile changes over time, and provides alerts of abnormal system and application behavior, and potential system failures. It can also perform corrective actions.\u201dGilad Shainer, Mellanox's senior marketing VP at Nvidia said that Cyber-AI \"allows system administrators to quickly detect and respond to potential security threats and address upcoming failures, saving cost, and ensuring consistent service to customers.\u201dNvidia's bought Mellanox for almost $7bn back in April.A deal that was 13 months in the making, the acquisition of the networking hardware provider was announced more than a year ago but received final regulatory approval from the Chinese government.\"This is a home run deal,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC's, Jim Cramer. \"Man, I\u2019ve been dreaming about this.\"GPU maker Nvidia beat out rival offers by Intel, Microsoft, Xilinx, and others to acquire Mellanox, whose Ethernet and InfiniBand equipment is used in more than half of the world's top 500 supercomputers.\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20 Apr 2020\n\n\n\n\nChina approves Nvidia's $6.9bn Mellanox acquisition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22 Jun 2020\n\n\n\n\nLenovo announces new AI servers for intense workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14 May 2020\n\n\n\n\nNvidia announces performance leap with new A100 GPU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nUFM Cyber-AI\n\n\nUFM Telemetry\n\n\nMellanox\n\n\nGilad Shainer\n\n\nJensen Huang\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

Over at 3DMark, there is a private listing for an unnamed NVIDIA graphics card, which is likely a GeForce RTX 3090 or GeForce RTX 3080 of some sort, and it blows a typical GeForce RTX 2080 Ti out of the water.\n\n\nBefore we get to the benchmark data, let's talk about Ampere. The next-generation GPU represents NVIDIA's shift to a 7-nanometer node. It already debuted last month in machine learning form (A100), and it is widely expected NVIDIA will launch Ampere in consumer form later this summer, or early fall (August or September-ish).\n\n\nProminent leak detectives have been sleuthing the situation for hints of what is to come. According to Rogame (@_rogame on Twitter and founder of HardwareLeaks), there are three Ampere GPUs headed to PCs. They include a GA102-400 with 24GB of RAM, a GA102-300 with 12GB of RAM, and a GA102-200 with 10GB of RAM.\n\n\nThere have been various graphics card names thrown around. Speculation is they will fall under these three possible tiers...\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3090 or RTX Titan\nGeForce RTX 3080 Ti or 3080 Super\nGeForce RTX 3080\n\nWe will have to wait and see how things actually shake out. In the meantime, Rogame found a private listing on 3DMark, which he claims to have identified as being uploaded by an NVIDIA employee. Here is how the mystery card stacks up...\n\n\n\n\nSource: 3DMark via Rogame/HardwareLeaks\n\n\n\nIt is very likely that the 6,000MHz frequency for the memory is incorrect\u20143DMark is probably just not reading the vitals correctly, which is not unusual for an unreleased part. It is also shown with a 1,935MHz GPU clock (boost?).\n\n\n\nSpecifications aside, we see some monster performance out of this part. As in, the mystery card performs around 31 percent better than a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, which is NVIDIA's top gaming card at the moment (the Titan RTX is not strictly a gaming card, it straddles the line between gaming and professional chores). The only exception is EVGA's aggressively overclocked Kingpin variant.\r\n\n\n\nThis is an impressive showing, especially if it ends up being a GeForce RTX 3080 variant. But even if this is the top card (GeForce RTX 3090), things are looking good for Ampere on the consumer side. Also consider that performance should only go up from here (assuming this leak is legit) as NVIDIA's driver team polishes things up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, (nasdaq:nvda), ampere, geforce rtx 3080, geforce rtx 3090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX Spark,...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To Supercharge...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's Dream...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing Watermarks...\nBeep-Beep!

Lately, we've been talking a lot about the service as it has been adding a lot of new games and is coming to more Android TV devices. Today, NVIDIA is announcing 19 new games along with the expansion of the Highlights feature and reopening of Founders memberships in Europe. \nFirst, let's talk about games. NVIDIA added a bunch of games to GeForce NOW last month and they continue to be committed to bringing more to the platform each week. 19 games in total are coming to GeForce NOW this week. Satisfactory was already released on Monday and six games are being brought back to the platform after opting-in to streaming. \n\n                                        Satisfactory (released 6/8/20)\n                        \n\n                                        Black Squad (returning)\n                        \n\n                                        Farm Together (returning)\n                        \n\n                                        Minion Masters (returning)\n                        \n\n                                        SCUM (returning)\n                        \n\n                                        Terminator: Resistance (returning)\n                        \n\n                                        XERA: Survival (returning)\n                        \n\n                                        Anno 2070 (Uplay)\n                        \n\n                                        Cloudpunk\n                        \n\n                                        Far Cry 4 (Epic Games Store)\n                        \n\n                                        Far Cry 5 (Epic)\n                        \n\n                                        Left 4 Dead\n                        \n\n                                        Rayman Legends (Epic and Uplay)\n                        \n\n                                        Rules Of Survival\n                        \n\n                                        South Park: The Stick of Truth (Uplay)\n                        \n\n                                        South Park: Fractured But Whole (Uplay)\n                        \n\n                                        Tale of Wuxia\n                        \n\n                                        Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist (Uplay)\n                        \n\n                                        Totally Reliable Delivery Service\n                        \n\n\"Highlights\" is a GeForce Experience feature that many developers have implemented into their games. It makes it easy for players to capture and share moments from gameplay. The full list of GeForce NOW games that support Highlights can be found here. The latest update adds smart pattern and image recognition from NVIDIA's cloud servers. It can now automatically detect and save key moments for you.\nWhen GeForce NOW was made available to everyone in February, it launched with two tiers: Free and Founders. The Founders tier includes longer session lengths, front of the line access, and RTX ON for supported games. New memberships were later paused in Europe, but now sign-ups are back with a limited-time introductory price of \u00a34.99/5,49\u20ac per month for the first 12 months.

However, what\u2019s going in favor of this leak is that the image shows underneath the shroud and the exposed heatsink (plus cooling pipes), and it looks to be pretty much an exact fit compared with the previous pics which were spilled.(Image credit: LeeJiangLee (Reddit))Find the best Nvidia GPU for youCheck out all the\u00a0best PC gamesWe'll show you\u00a0how to build a PCIn that respect, the image would seem to add to the evidence that this is indeed the new design for the RTX 3080 \u2013 evidence which also includes a major leak from Igor\u2019s Lab on the spec of the graphics card (and other top-end Ampere models which may include an alleged RTX 3090) whose sources also insisted that this is indeed the new look Nvidia is going for with the Founders Edition.Still, we obviously need to be very careful about leaping to anything that feels like a firm conclusion here.On track?Naturally, there are lots of airy potential conclusions which can be drawn, though, including that this is starting to look like a finished product, and so Nvidia may just be on track for that rumored September release date (and a potential face-off against AMD\u2019s Big Navi).As we\u2019ve discussed before, the sheer size and beefiness of this cooling solution also backs up speculation around Nvidia\u2019s next-gen graphics cards being quite the power guzzlers, with TDPs purportedly reaching 350W for the top-end model, while the RTX 3080 will allegedly demand 320W from your power supply.If these cooling solution and power usage leaks turn out to be on the money, or at least near it, while the GPU might stay suitably cool with Nvidia\u2019s purported new design, the worry could be around noise levels, and the potential racket that such a graphics card might make with demanding games at full load.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Again, though, we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves with the speculation really, but if a launch is on track for a few months\u2019 time, at least we don\u2019t have very long to wait to find out the truth behind Nvidia\u2019s Ampere graphics cards.These are the best graphics cards of 2020Via PC Gamer\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

These are the first fully-certified DirectX 12 Ultimate drivers, but they also add support for WDDM 2.7\u2014that's Windows Display Driver Model 2.7. New to Windows 10 with the May 2020 update, and now supported with Nvidia's drivers, is hardware scheduling. This new feature shows up in the Windows display settings, at the bottom under the Graphics Settings, provided you have a Pascal or later generation Nvidia GPU. Could this help the best graphics cards perform even better and maybe shake up the GPU hierarchy? Probably not, but we decided to find out with empirical testing.First, it's important to note that this is not a new hardware feature but rather a new API feature. GPUs, at least as far as we understand things, have been able to support GPU hardware scheduling for some time. The description from Microsoft is vague as well.\u00a0Enabling the feature is simple. In the Windows Settings section, under Display, you can click \"Graphics settings\" to find the toggle. It says, \"Reduce latency and improve performance. You'll need to restart your PC to have your changes take effect.\"Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Information circulating on the web suggests GPU hardware scheduling could be quite useful, but we decided to investigate further. We selected five games out of our current GPU test suite, then ran benchmarks with and without hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling enabled on a few test configurations. We used an RTX 2080 Ti as the main test GPU, and ran the benchmarks with both Core i9-9900K and Ryzen 9 3900X. Thinking perhaps a low-end GPU might benefit more, we also went to the other extreme and tested a GTX 1050 card with the 9900K.Obviously there are a ton of potential combinations, but this should be enough to at least get us started. We also tested with every possible API on each game, just for good measure. All testing was conducted at 1920x1080 with ultra settings, except for Red Dead Redemption 2 on the GTX 1050\u2014it had to use 'medium' settings to run on the 2GB card. We ran each test multiple times, discarding the first run and then selecting the best result of the remaining two runs (after confirming performance was similar, and it was).Spoiler alert: the results of GPU hardware scheduling are mixed and mostly much ado about nothing, at least in our tests. Here are the results, with charts, because we all love pretty graphs.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Borderlands 3 showed a modest increase in minimum fps on the RTX 2080 Ti using the DirectX 12 (DX12) API, while performance under DX11 was basically unchanged. The Ryzen 9 3900X showed improved performance with both APIs, of around 2%\u2014measurable, but not really noticeable. The GTX 1050 meanwhile performed worse with hardware scheduling (HWS) enabled, regardless of API. The lack of a clear pattern is going to be the only 'pattern' it seems.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The Division 2 basically flips things around from Borderlands 3. Hardware scheduling resulted in reduced performance for both the 9900K and 3900X under DX12, and made little to no difference with DX11. Meanwhile, the GTX 1050 shows a very slight improvement with hardware scheduling, but not enough to really matter\u2014it's about 3% faster, but at sub-30 fps.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Forza Horizon 4 simplifies things a bit, since it only supports the DirectX 12 API. This time, we measured very slight improvements with the 3900X and a bit larger boost with the GTX 1050, while the 9900K with 2080 Ti had basically the same performance.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Metro Exodus kicks things up a notch with DirectX Raytracing (DXR) support on RTX cards, giving us yet another comparison point. Hardware scheduling gave a negligible performance increase on the 9900K, with DX11 performing slightly better than DX12. DX11 also performed better with the 3900X, and this time hardware scheduling reduced performance just a hair under DX12. For DXR, however, the results are mixed: higher minimum fps on the 9900K with lower average fps, and lower performance overall with the 3900X. As noted earlier, there's no real rhyme or reason here. The GTX 1050 meanwhile showed no change in DX11 performance, while it got a 4% boost (but at less than 14 fps) under DX12.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Finally, we have Red Dead Redemption 2, running under the Vulkan and DX12 APIs. Performance was universally better with Vulkan, as shown in the above chart. Hardware scheduling meanwhile gave a slight boost in performance on the 9900K, and a larger 5% boost to average framerates with the 3900X. 99th percentile fps on the 3900X only improved by 2%, however, so while hardware scheduling helped, it's not quite in the expected fashion\u2014i.e. better minimum fps. The GTX 1050 showed slightly worse performance with hardware scheduling this time.Initial Thoughts on Hardware SchedulingWhat to make of all of this, then? Nvidia now supports a feature that can potentially improve its performance in some games. Except, it seems just as likely to hurt performance as well. This is a new API and driver feature, however, so perhaps it will prove more beneficial over time. Or perhaps I should have dug out a slower CPU or disabled some cores and threads. I'll leave that testing for someone else for now.At present, across five tested games using multiple APIs, on average (looking at all nine or ten tests), the change in performance is basically nothing. The 9900K with RTX 2080 Ti performance is 0.03% slower, and the GTX 1050 with the 9900K performed 0.73% slower. The 3900X with RTX 2080 Ti did benefit, but only to the tune of 0.06%. In other words, the one or two cases where performance did improve are cancelled out by performance losses in other games.If you're serious about squeezing out every last bit of performance possible, maybe for a benchmark record, you can try enabling or disabling the feature to see which performs best for the specific test(s) you're running. For most people, however, it appears to be a wash. Your time will be better spent playing games than trying to figure out when you should enable or disable hardware scheduling\u2014and rebooting your PC between changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (13)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

Not that you can't use them, but they don't correlate at all with most real-world gaming / graphics workloads.

But since its already at almost 400fps, we are looking at a little over 2%. Its good if its consistently 2% faster. Too bad some results went south instead.... AS you said, change little....\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchlachtwolf\n\n\nLook mine was not a scientifically based test, just a quick run of something that many may have on their PC, that is quite reasonably what many might use to see if it helps them on their everday normal setups. I played Mordor Shadow of War, Withcher 3, Chess Ultra and TheHunter Classic (11 year old game with still passable graphics) and I saw no difference in FPS or FPS stability. So for me it is a another questionable add-on resource eater or just released before any hardware/software can really use it.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrazor512\n\n\nCan you test a worst case scenario to see if the scheduling helps. Benchmark it on a GTX 970 where you have 2 memory pools (3.5GB and 512MB). Ignore the age of the card and focus on the how the scheduling can react to cases where there is naturally a ton of overhead in scheduling.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJarredWaltonGPU\n\n\nrazor512 said:Can you test a worst case scenario to see if the scheduling helps.

Ignore the age of the card and focus on the how the scheduling can react to cases where there is naturally a ton of overhead in scheduling.I actually already did that with GTX 1050, though not on the CPU side. Per Nvidia, you must have at least a Pascal GPU, which means GTX 1050 or above (because I do not count GT 1030 -- it's a junk card no one should buy!) GTX 970 unfortunately is Maxwell, so it will have to rely on non-HW scheduling.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncryoburner\n\n\nOr perhaps I should have dug out a slower CPU or disabled some cores and threads.That was my first thought when you mentioned testing with the 1050, but nothing about testing another processor. It could be that both of these processors are too fast, or have too many threads to show any difference. Perhaps there's more of a performance difference when the game is starved for CPU resources, such as can be seen in some titles with a four-threaded processor, like Battlefield V. After all, it sounds like this feature is moving VRAM management to be handled by the GPU, so there could possibly be gains on the CPU side of things. It could be worth testing a few games that are demanding on the CPU after swapping in something like a Ryzen 1200 or an Athlon, or maybe just disabling some cores and SMT and cutting the clock rate back to achieve similar results.\n\nAnother thought is that if the benefits are entirely on the VRAM management side of things, a 2080 Ti wouldn't likely see much benefit due to it having more VRAM than current games require, especially at 1080p. The performance benefits may appear in situations where the VRAM is getting filled, and data is getting swapped out to system memory. If the card can make better decisions about what data to keep in VRAM and what to offload, that might be where the performance benefits are. You did test a 1050 with just 4GB of VRAM, but perhaps a 1050 isn't fast enough for this to make much of a difference, especially considering its not even managing 30fps at the settings used in most of these tests. Another site I just checked only tested a couple games including in Forza Horizon 4, but showed around an 8% performance gain in both when using a 1650 SUPER paired with a 9900K, but no tangible difference to performance with a 2080 Ti, so that might be the case. Of course, that wasn't a site I would actually trust for the accuracy of benchmark results. : P\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJarredWaltonGPU\n\n\ncryoburner said:Another site I just checked only tested a couple games including in Forza Horizon 4, but showed around an 8% performance gain in both when using a 1650 SUPER paired with a 9900K, but no tangible difference to performance with a 2080 Ti, so that might be the case. Of course, that wasn't a site I would actually trust for the accuracy of benchmark results. : PYeah, that's the thing: if you only run the game benchmark ONCE and then move on, you're going to get a lot more noise. I specifically ran each test three times to verify consistency of results (because the first run is almost always higher, thanks to the GPU being cooler and boost clocks kicking in more). Given the results so far, however, I don't want to put a bunch more time into testing, which is why the article says \"I'll leave that to others.\"\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerryLaze\n\n\ncryoburner said:After all, it sounds like this feature is moving VRAM management to be handled by the GPU, so there could possibly be gains on the CPU side of things.The thing here would be that game benchmarks are already perfectly RAM managed by the developers of that benchmark themselves (at least that's how I imagine it) while the probably pretty generic hardware accelerated scheduling won't be able to beat that.\nThe question is if it does anything outside of the canned benchmark where devs can't optimize each and every scene to perfection.\n\n\n\nAlso running a 2Gb video card at ultra and expecting anything other than a huge vram bottleneck is pretty funny.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 13 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm debuts new Snapdragon G handheld gaming PC chips to compete with Intel and AMD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina to spend $55 billion on R&D in 2025 \u2014 Semiconductor, AI and quantum computing fields to benefit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBambu Lab Announces New Printer: H2D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotherboard dies after marathon 100-hour BIOS update process, vigil attended by thousands online\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD boasts its Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is up to 12.2x faster than Lunar Lake in AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreeware image editor GIMP 3.0 arrives after seven years of incubation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle's Gemini 2.0 Flash is reportedly capable of removing watermarks \u2014 Also found to generate AI celebrity photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi and ChatGPT bring AI conversations to your retro rotary phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI Afterburner update enables RTX 50 series owners to push their GDDR7 VRAM up to 36 GT/s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD manager reports 45% GPU retail market share in Japan \u2014 Eyes 70% as the next target\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

The updated drivers make NVIDIA RTX GPUs the first and only with support for DX12 Ultimate in hardware, plus the software required to take advantage of it. With this update NVIDIA also becomes the first and only GPU manufacturer to support hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling with a public driver.\u201d\n\u201cDirectX 12 Ultimate codifies GeForce RTX\u2019s many innovative technologies as the standard for multi-platform, next-generation games. It is defined as a set of DirectX 12 features that represents a new graphics standard shared between PC and console and includes: DirectX Raytracing (DXR) tier 1.1, Variable Rate Shading (VRS) tier 2, Mesh Shaders, and Sampler Feedback.\u201d\n\nThese drivers also offer support for hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling, an API-independent feature introduced by the Windows 10 May 2020 update that allows the GPU to directly manage VRAM. Microsoft says this feature reduces latency, and can provide significant improvement to both minimum and average FPS numbers.\nAll GeForce, TITAN, and Quadro RTX GPUs are gaining support, with the Game Ready Driver release notes for this new version 451.48 listing supported graphics cards going back to the GeForce 600 Series.\n \n\n\nIn addition to the Game Ready driver a new Studio driver has also been released.\n\n\u201cThe Studio Driver also brings improved performance and reliability to a number of recently updated creative apps. Over the past few weeks, apps to receive RTX-accelerated features or speedups include: Adobe Premiere Pro 14.2, Adobe Substance Alchemist, Blender 2.83, Chaos V-Ray 5 for Autodesk 3ds Max and Corel Painter 2021.\u201d\n\nGeForce Experience One-Click Optimal Settings\nFinally, NVIDIA\u2019s one-click optimal settings (OPS) in GeForce Experience, which \u201cenable you to instantly configure game options for your system\u2019s hardware, giving you smooth, optimized gameplay\u201d, has added support for a dozen additional games:\n\nAge of Empires III: Complete Collection\nCommand & Conquer Remastered Collection\nDeadside\nGears Tactics\nMafia II: Definitive Edition\nMonster Train\nONE PIECE: PIRATE WARRIORS 4\nOuter Wilds\nRoblox\nShop Titans\nStreets of Rage 4\nTotal Tank Simulator\n\nNew G-SYNC Compatible Displays\nNVIDIA has added nine monitors to their G-SYNC Compatible program as well, bringing the total up to 98.

(Image Credits: creper9000 at Reddit)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA is planning to introduce a revolutionary new idea involving a traversal coprocessor and a dual-sided PCB with its RTX 3090 GPU (and family) according to a video by Coreteks. What this essentially means (if it turns out to be true) is that the upcoming graphics cards like the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 will feature a dual-sided PCB with the GPU core on one side and a second co-processor on the other side. I do want to make it clear that I have no idea if this is true or not and it is only being posted because it has technical merit and Coreteks has proven to be reliable in the past. All that said, this post is still very much a rumor and copious amounts of salt, while not good for your health, are highly recommended.\nNVIDIA's RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 to have dual-sided PCBs with a traversal coprocessor?\nIn the video Coreteks goes over the unique new design of the RTX 3000 series and how that is something that actually hints at his conclusion. Keep in mind that Igor has already confirmed that the heatsink we saw was part of the DVT or Design Validation Test and it is just one among 2-3 designs that NVIDIA is looking into. Even if NVIDIA changes the design slightly however, it is still weak evidence of something different going on this time around.\nImage credits: Coreteks\nAccording to the source, the reason why NVIDIA has one fan at the bottom and one fan at the top is to facilitate airflow over two chips, not one. Coreteks guesses that this chip is something called a traversal coprocessor that will aid in the raytracing ability of the cards. Know the RTX cores that were embedded inside the chip in the RTX 2000 series? well, the source posits that this time around they will sit in a seperate coprocessor on the other side of the PCB.\nOne reason why I said his video has technical merit is that NVIDIA patented traversal coprocessors to aid in raytracing back in 2018 - which is just enough time for them to have implemented it in the Ampere series of GPUs. It looks like NVIDIA has been looking into combining a coprocessor with the standard GPU ASIC for a while now and doing so would allow it to take a more economical approach to GPU building then stuffing the RTX cores inside the core die.\nA copy of the traversal coprocessor diagram from a patent filed by NVIDIA.\nStill more particularly, an example non-limiting technology herein relates to a hardware-based traversal coprocessor that efficiently traverses an acceleration data structure e.g., for real time ray tracing.\nIn more detail, the example non-limiting technology provides dedicated hardware to accelerate ray tracing. In non-limiting embodiments, a hardware co-processor (herein referred to as a \u201ctraversal coprocessor\u201d or in some embodiments a \u201ctree traversal unit\u201d or \u201cTTU\u201d) accelerates certain processes supporting interactive ray tracing including ray-bounding volume intersection tests, ray-primitive intersection tests and ray \u201cinstance\u201d transforms.\nNVIDIA Patent for \"ROBUST, EFFICIENT MULTIPROCESSOR-COPROCESSOR INTERFACE\" \nLet me also explain what I meant when I said this approach is more economical. The original approach of setting aside an RTX area on the core GPU die was hard to bin and very wasteful because you had to bin the RTX parts as well and waste precious die space on lower-end customer segments that would not benefit from any negligible raytracing improvement. Moving the raytracing cores onto a new die while keeping the original GPU core pure allows NVIDIA to freely and economically bin chips with almost no waste!\nImage credits: Coreteks\nIt would also allow them to ship the coprocessors as a standalone AIC card - which is something Coreteks mentions as well. Remember the PhysX AIC cards of olde? Well, if this rumor turns out to be true, we might be getting RTX Raytracing AIC cards that can enable strong raytracing performance on a non-raytracing GPU (likely only NVIDIA ones). This is a very feasible business model and something that would greatly enhance the company's push for raytracing without adding cost to users that do not want to pay for it. I for one have my fingers crossed and sincerely hope this turns out to be true - innovation is always incredibly exciting.\n\n\n\nDo you think NVIDIA will use a double sided PCB and a traversal coprocessor?\n\n\n Yes, this makes sense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n No, this rumor is probably wrong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nM3 Max\u2019s 40-Core GPU Matches The RTX 3080\u2019s Performance, Laptop RTX 4080 Only 7 Percent Faster In New GFXBench Benchmark Comparison\n\nOmar Sohail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPossible NVIDIA Ampere-Powered SOC For Next-Gen Nintendo Switch 2 Handheld Spotted\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 SUPER Founders Edition Graphics Card Pictured Once Again\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 GPUs See Huge Price Cuts At BestBuy: 3090 Ti For $880, 3080 Ti For $720, 3080 For $420, 3070 For $300 US\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n136\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n93\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n58\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n54\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n39\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1463\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1142\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

As you may recall, they recently bumped a few of their mobile GPUs to include Super models, while also updating older variants with improved specifications.\nToday we're checking out the GeForce RTX 2080 Super Max-Q, Nvidia's fastest laptop GPU within a 90W power budget. The GPU's name is a mouthful, no doubt, and we've commented several times before how this is a broken naming scheme. We won't waste more time going about that, but we will explain where the 2080 Super Max-Q stands in the GeForce mobile range.\nThe GeForce 20 series for 2020 is heavily segmented, especially at the top end of the stack. The main models include the RTX 2070, RTX 2070 Super and RTX 2080 Super. While the RTX 2070 is continuing on and is seen in new laptops this year, the RTX 2080 has been phased out in favor of the Super variant.\n\nIn addition to the basic models, each GPU is available in multiple power configurations. The standard config is typically 115W, although high-end heftier laptops can also carry the RTX 2080 Super configured to 150W and above, according to Nvidia's spec sheet.\nLower power variants are labelled Max-Q, and are usually found as 80W or 90W configurations, depending on the OEM and cooling solution used. Occasionally, you may get access to software to toggle between the modes on a given system, though you can't toggle Max-Q on or off.\n\nWhat does remain constant within a model designation (regardless if it's Max-Q, standard or Max-P power config) is the core and memory configuration. The RTX 2080 Super for example, comes with 3072 CUDA cores, the same as the desktop variant. You'll also get 8GB of GDDR6 memory on a 256-bit bus. That's the same across all RTX 2080 Super variants.\nWhat you will see change are clock speeds. The max listed for the RTX 2080 Super mobile GPU is a base clock of 1365 MHz and a boost of 1560 MHz, while the memory is 14 Gbps maximum. The Max-Q models are clocked a lot lower to fit into their power targets as seen on the table below. Both Max-Q variants use 11 Gbps GDDR6 memory, which is the new low-voltage GDDR6 Nvidia has been touting with this refreshed line-up.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nRTX 2080\nRTX 2080 (Mobile)\nRTX 2080 Max-Q 90W\nRTX 2080 Max-Q 80W\nRTX 2080 Super\nRTX 2080 Super (Mobile)\nRTX 2080 Super Max-Q 90W\nRTX 2080 Super Max-Q 80W\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n2944\n2944\n2944\n2944\n3072\n3072\n3072\n3072\n\n\nBase Clock\n1515 MHz\n1380 MHz\n990 MHz\n735 MHz\n1650 MHz\n1365 MHz\n975 MHz\n735 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1710 MHz\n1590 MHz\n1230 MHz\n1095 MHz\n1815 MHz\n1560 MHz\n1230 MHz\n1080 MHz\n\n\nMemory Tech\n8GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus\n256-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n\n\nMemory Clock\n14 Gbps\n14 Gbps\n12 Gbps\n12 Gbps\n15.5 Gbps\n14 Gbps\n11 Gbps\n11 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n448 GB/s\n448 GB/s\n384 GB/s\n384 GB/s\n496 GB/s\n448 GB/s\n352 GB/s\n352 GB/s\n\n\nGPU\nTU104\nTU104\nTU104\nTU104\nTU104\nTU104\nTU104\nTU104\n\n\nTGP\n215W\n150W+\n90W\n80W\n250W\n150W+\n90W\n80W\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's important to remember is that that mobile RTX 2080 Super and the desktop RTX 2080 Super are not equivalent GPUs. The mobile variant is clocked lower \u2013 both the GPU and memory \u2013 and has a lower power target. An RTX 2080 Super graphics card in a desktop has a 250W power limit, while in laptops you'll be lucky to see something over 115W. In practice, the RTX 2080 Super Max-Q running at 90W is no faster than a desktop RTX 2070.\nNvidia has also been talking up two new features for their 2020 mobile line-up: Dynamic Boost and Advanced Optimus. However, we've tested six laptops so far with the newer GPUs and none of them include either feature.\n\nOur focus today will be on the RTX 2080 Max-Q in its 90W power configuration. That's what we have on hand for testing in MSI's GE66 Raider. Because this is a high-end GPU, a lot of laptop makers will be pairing it with high-tier CPUs. The GE66 Raider is the same laptop we used for testing the flagship Core i9-10980HK. A quick search for other RTX 2080 Super laptops suggests that you can get it with CPUs down to the Core i7-10750H, however 8-core CPUs are a more common pairing.\n\nThe MSI GE66 is a great test platform for the RTX 2080 Super Max-Q because it's a competently designed system with plenty of thermal headroom. It's not the slimmest or lightest, but for a mid-sized gaming laptop, it has a great chassis, 300 Hz 1080p IPS display, an interesting RGB lighting strip along the front edge... and plenty of cooling.\nUnder a Watch Dogs 2 gaming load with the CPU at 48W and the GPU at 90W, we saw CPU temperatures of around 80C and the GPU at just 65C with moderate fan noise, which is a great result. Thermal throttling is not a problem with this system, so we're able to get some excellent performance numbers.\nBenchmarks\nBefore moving forward, note that our usual laptop testing notes apply. The charts you're about to see are an average of results from laptops with the same configuration, the full list of laptops tested can be found here. We try our best to use apples-to-apples data, so all laptops are tested with similar power limits where possible, dual-channel memory configurations and with plenty of cooling.\nLet's start with Red Dead Redemption 2, one of the more graphically intensive titles in our benchmark suite. Using 1080p high settings, the 2080 Super Max-Q is the fastest GPU we've come across so far, although it should be noted we have yet to test Max-P versions of the new Super GPU variants.\n\nThis GPU is capable of very playable frame rates, delivering 17 percent more performance at 90W than the 2070 Super Max-Q, and 20 percent more performance than the RTX 2070 configured at 115W. Unfortunately we don't have test data for the 90W RTX 2080 Max-Q, however the power raised 2080 Super Max-Q is a decent 25 percent head of the older 2080 Max-Q at 80W.\n\nBorderlands 3 is another strong result for the 2080 Super Max-Q. This title is fully GPU limited on gaming laptops with Ultra settings, and like with Red Dead, we see a 17 percent lead over the 2070 Super Max-Q, as well as 17 percent over the RTX 2070. Gains over the 2080 Max-Q are more modest, however this is still enough to produce the fastest results we've seen so far.\n\nStar Wars Jedi Fallen Order is mostly GPU limited in our benchmark pass on laptops, although there are some sections that hit the CPU harder. Luckily, all of our RTX 2080 Super, RTX 2070 Super and RTX 2080 laptops we've tested so far are using similar 8-core CPUs at 45W, which leads to only minor CPU differences.\nWith that in mind, the 2080 Super Max-Q ends up 10 percent ahead of the 2070 Super Max-Q, and 14 percent ahead of the RTX 2070. The closest competitor to this GPU is the older 2080 Max-Q, however the new Super variant pulls head by modest single digit margins\n\nControl is a highly GPU demanding title, one of the most demanding in our test suite running using the High preset, the game's maximum. Like Fallen Order before, the 2080 Super Max-Q comes out around 11 percent head of the 2070 Super Max-Q when both GPUs are running at 90W.\nThe lead is similar over the RTX 2070 running at 115W, which goes to show the efficiency advantage of the larger CUDA core design. As this GPU can run more cores at lower clocks, it sits in a more efficient position on the voltage frequency curve, and so delivers better performance than the 2070 which has fewer cores and a higher power limit.\n\nIn Metro Exodus we see the RTX 2080 Super Max-Q at 90W delivering around the performance of an RTX 2070 desktop PC, which is a great comparison if you want to know how these sorts of laptops fare when put up against their desktop counterparts. In terms of laptop comparisons, the 2080 Super Max-Q is 18 percent faster than the 2070 Super Max-Q, and 24 percent ahead of the RTX 2070.\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider is another very demanding game for laptops. The performance lead the RTX 2080 Super Max-Q has over the 2070 Super Max-Q is more modest than in other titles, at just 7 percent for average frame rates, and 10 percent for one percent lows. It does command a larger lead over the 2070 though, at around 15 percent despite its lower power usage.\n\nBattlefield V is another title where the 2080 Super Max-Q holds a performance lead in the 15 percent range over the RTX 2070 Super Max-Q, at least when looking at average frame rates.\nWith this sort of GPU, some CPU restrictions are starting to be introduced, which is why many of the 8 core processors here have similar 1 percent low numbers.\n\nNot every game is going to benefit from the increased GPU power available to you. One such example is Assassin's Creed Odyssey, which hits the CPU and GPU hard on laptops.\nUsing the Very High preset, the 2080 Super Max-Q was just 3 percent faster on average than the 2070 Super Max-Q, although 8 percent faster when looking at 1% low data. You'll see similar narrow margins compared to the RTX 2070, at just single digits.\n\nFar Cry 5 also benefits from CPU power, however it mostly uses a small number of threads, and without much additional single core performance on offer between the CPUs here, the difference falls back again to the GPU. The RTX 2080 Super Max-Q is 10 percent ahead of the 2070 Super Max-Q, and up to 15 percent in front of the RTX 2070.\n\nCouple of older games to round out the main ones we're looking at today. Star Wars Battlefront II is very favorable to the RTX 2080 Super Max-Q, delivering nearly a 20 percent performance lead over the 2070 Super Max-Q. We also saw reasonable double digit gains over both the RTX 2070 and RTX 2080 Max-Q.\n\nWatch Dogs 2, like Assassin's Creed Odyssey, is a game that requires both CPU and GPU power. There's still a performance lead for the RTX 2080 Super Max-Q, but it's not as substantial as in more GPU-limited titles.\nFor many of these older open world style games, it's not worth upgrading to a flagship mobile GPU to play them.\n\nAnd finally we have Grand Theft Auto V, which is another title that delivers a ~10 percent performance lead for the 2080 Super Max-Q over both the 2070 Super Max-Q and the regular RTX 2070. Nothing particularly amazing to note here.\n\nPerformance Breakdowns\nGeForce RTX 2080 Super Max-Q vs. RTX 2070 Super Max-Q\nAcross the 19 games that form our current laptop GPU test suite, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Super Max-Q is 11 percent faster on average than the RTX 2070 Super Max-Q, and yes those names are not simply rolling off the tongue as I keep repeating \"Super\" and \"Max-Q\" over and over.\n\nWhen both GPUs are configured at 90W, the extra efficiency of the Nvidia's highest tier mobile GPU does lead to a double digit performance lead on average, although in more GPU demanding games this lead could be as high as 19 percent. On the flip side, if a game is a more mixed CPU and GPU workload, expect only mid to low single digit gains.\nGeForce RTX 2080 Super Max-Q vs. RTX 2070 Max-P\n\nIn an impressive feat for efficiency, the RTX 2080 Super Max-Q is universally faster than the RTX 2070 Max-P, despite the 2080 Super having a 90W power limit compared to the 2070's 115W.\nWith a 14 percent performance lead on average, we're not talking an amazing difference, but given this GPU can be used in slim and light systems whereas the RTX 2070 at 115W usually cannot, these efficiency gains are important.\nGeForce RTX 2080 Super Max-Q vs. RTX 2080 Max-Q\n\nFinally we have a comparison between the RTX 2080 Super Max-Q running at 90W to the RTX 2080 Max-Q running at 80W. With the added 10W of power and increased efficiency, the Super variant ends up 14 percent faster. Based on this figures we'd expect high single-digit gains when both GPUs are running at 90W, which does make the Super model faster than what came before, though still an incremental upgrade.\n\nWhat We Learned\nOverall, the GeForce RTX 2080 Super Max-Q can be summarized pretty quickly. This is Nvidia's fastest laptop GPU for power or thermally constrained laptop form factors, delivering a double-digit performance gain over the tier below it. The performance level Nvidia has been able to achieve within a 90W power budget is impressive. The efficiency of this chip is excellent, and that allows it to outperform lower class GPUs with a higher power budget.\nThe performance level Nvidia has been able to achieve within a 90W power budget is impressive\nAt the same time, this can be seen as an incremental performance upgrade over the GPU its replacing. With both GPUs using the same architecture and same process, Nvidia is pushing the limits of what's possible without a change to either of those things. If you were hoping for a more substantial gain, you'll have to wait for Nvidia's next-generation products.\n\nName designations for GeForce laptop GPUs can be confusing with so many different configurations, so choosing between laptop models can be made difficult because of this. Many laptop makers don't advertise the power limit and some, shockingly, omit Max-Q as well. This is less of a concern with this flagship GPU than it is at lower tiers, as you do get class-leading performance.\nThe RTX 2080 Super Max-Q is a great GPU for 1080p gaming and can handle all modern titles pretty well at 1080p with ultra settings, but it's nowhere near as fast as the RTX 2080 Super for desktops. It is more in the ballpark of a desktop RTX 2070, so as long as you understand desktop and mobile GPUs won't deliver the same performance, you should be fine.\n\nThe RTX 2080 Super Max-Q is usually featured on the most expensive gaming notebooks around. Devices featuring this GPU start at $2,500 with a Core i7-10750H, and that can quickly increase to $3,000+ if you want an 8-core Intel CPU. Other features and laptop build quality aside, this is around a 20% price premium over a RTX 2070 Super Max-Q laptop for 10 percent better performance, or a 50% premium on an RTX 2060 configuration for around 30 percent more performance.\nShopping Shortcuts\n\nNvidia RTX 2080 Super Max-Q Laptops on Amazon\n\nNvidia RTX 2070 Super Max-Q Laptops on Amazon\n\nNvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q Laptops on Amazon\n\nMSI GE66 Raider i9/300Hz/RTX 2080S on Amazon\n\nMSI GS66 Stealth i9/300Hz/RTX 2070S on Amazon\n\nIntel Core i7-10875H Laptops on Amazon\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 4900HS Laptops on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 13\n\n\n Got something to say?

The more straight-laced counterpart to NVIDIA\u2019s flagship SXM4 version of the A100 accelerator, the PCie version of the A100 is designed to offer A100 in a more traditional form factor for customers who need something that they can plug into standardized servers. Overall the PCIe A100 offers the same peak performance as the SXM4 A100, however with a lower 250 Watt TDP, real-world performance won\u2019t be quite as high.\nThe obligatory counterpart to NVIDIA\u2019s SXM form factor accelerators, NVIDIA\u2019s PCIe accelerators serve to flesh out the other side of NVIDIA\u2019s accelerator lineup. While NVIDIA would gladly sell everyone SXM-based accelerators \u2013 which would include the pricey NVIDIA HGX carrier board \u2013 there are still numerous customers who need to be able to use GPU accelerators in standard, PCIe-based rackmount servers. Or for smaller workloads, customers don\u2019t need the kind of 4-way and higher scalability offered by SXM-form factor accelerators. So with their PCIe cards, NVIDIA can serve the rest of the accelerator market that their SXM products can\u2019t reach.\nThe PCIe A100, in turn, is a full-fledged A100, just in a different form factor and with a more appropriate TDP. In terms of peak performance, the PCIe A100 is just as fast as its SXM4 counterpart; NVIDIA this time isn\u2019t shipping this as a cut-down configuration with lower clockspeeds or fewer functional blocks than the flagship SXM4 version. As a result the PCIe card brings everything A100 offers to the table, with the same heavy focus on tensor operations, including the new higher precision TF32 and FP64 formats, as well as even faster integer inference.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Accelerator Specification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\nA100\r\n\t\t\t(PCIe)\nA100\r\n\t\t\t(SXM4)\nV100\r\n\t\t\t(PCIe)\nP100\r\n\t\t\t(PCIe)\n\n\nFP32 CUDA Cores\n6912\n6912\n5120\n3584\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1.41GHz\n1.41GHz\n1.38GHz\n1.3GHz\n\n\nMemory Clock\n2.43Gbps HBM2\n2.43Gbps HBM2\n1.75Gbps HBM2\n1.4Gbps HBM2\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n5120-bit\n5120-bit\n4096-bit\n4096-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n1.6TB/sec\r\n\t\t\t(1555GB/sec)\n1.6TB/sec\r\n\t\t\t(1555GB/sec)\n900GB/sec\n720GB/sec\n\n\nVRAM\n40GB\n40GB\n16GB/32GB\n16GB\n\n\nSingle Precision\n19.5 TFLOPs\n19.5 TFLOPs\n14.1 TFLOPs\n9.3 TFLOPs\n\n\nDouble Precision\n9.7 TFLOPs\r\n\t\t\t(1/2 FP32 rate)\n9.7 TFLOPs\r\n\t\t\t(1/2 FP32 rate)\n7 TFLOPs\r\n\t\t\t(1/2 FP32 rate)\n4.7 TFLOPs\r\n\t\t\t(1/2 FP32 rate)\n\n\nINT8 Tensor\n624 TOPs\n624 TOPs\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nFP16 Tensor\n312 TFLOPs\n312 TFLOPs\n112 TFLOPs\nN/A\n\n\nTF32 Tensor\n156 TFLOPs\n156 TFLOPs\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nRelative Performance (SXM Version)\n90%\n100%\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nInterconnect\nNVLink 3\r\n\t\t\t12 Links (600GB/sec)\nNVLink 3\r\n\t\t\t12 Links (600GB/sec)\nNVLink 2\r\n\t\t\t4 Links (200GB/sec)\nNVLink 1\r\n\t\t\t4 Links (160GB/sec)\n\n\nGPU\nGA100\r\n\t\t\t(826mm2)\nGA100\r\n\t\t\t(826mm2)\nGV100\r\n\t\t\t(815mm2)\nGP100\r\n\t\t\t(610mm2)\n\n\nTransistor Count\n54.2B\n54.2B\n21.1B\n15.3B\n\n\nTDP\n250W\n400W\n250W\n300W\n\n\nManufacturing Process\nTSMC 7N\nTSMC 7N\nTSMC 12nm FFN\nTSMC 16nm FinFET\n\n\nInterface\nPCIe 4.0\nSXM4\nPCIe 3.0\nSXM\n\n\nArchitecture\nAmpere\nAmpere\nVolta\nPascal\n\n\n\nBut because the dual-slot add-in card form factor is designed for lower TDP products, offering less room for cooling and typically less access to power as well, the PCIe version of the A100 does have to ratchet down its TDP from 400W to 250W. That\u2019s a sizable 38% reduction in power consumption, and as a result the PCIe A100 isn\u2019t going to be able to match the sustained performance figures of its SXM4 counterpart \u2013 that\u2019s the advantage of going with a form factor with higher power and cooling budgets. All told, the PCIe version of the A100 should deliver about 90% of the performance of the SXM4 version on single-GPU workloads, which for such a big drop in TDP, is not a bad trade-off.\nAnd on this note, I should give NVIDIA credit where credit is due: unlike the PCIe version of the V100 accelerator, NVIDIA is doing a much better job of documenting these performance differences. This time around NVIDIA is explicitly noting the 90% figure in their their specification sheets and related marketing materials. So there should be a lot less confusion about how the PCIe version of the accelerator compares to the SXM version.\n\nOther than the form factor and TDP changes, the only other notable deviation for the PCIe A100 from the SXM version is how NVLink connections work. For their PCIe card NVIDIA is once again using NVLink bridges connected across the top of A100 cards, allowing for two (and only two) cards to be linked together. The upshot is that with 3 NVLink connectors, all 12 of the GA100's GPU physical links are being exposed, meaning that the card has full access to its NVLink bandwidth. So although you can only talk to one other PCIe A100 card, you can do so at a speedy 300GB/sec in each direction, 3x the rate a pair of V100 PCIe cards communicated at.\nOtherwise the PCIe A100 comes with the usual trimmings of the form factor. The card is entirely passively cooled, designed to be used with servers with powerful chassis fans. And though not pictured in NVIDIA\u2019s official shots, there are sockets for PCIe power connectors. Meanwhile, with the reduced usage of NVLink in this version of the card, A100\u2019s native PCIe 4 support will undoubtedly be of increased importance here, underscoring the advantage that an AMD Epyc + NVIDIA A100 pairing has right now since AMD is the only x86 server vendor with PCIe 4 support.\nWrapping things up, while NVIDIA isn\u2019t announcing specific pricing or availability information today, the new PCIe A100 cards should be shipping soon. The wider compatibility of the PCIe card has helped NVIDIA to line up over 50 server wins at this point, with 30 of those servers set to ship this summer.\n\n\n                Source:\n                NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n29 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nmode_13h - Monday, June 22, 2020 - link\nI hope they release a Titan A version.\n\n\n\nKjella - Monday, June 22, 2020 - link\nWell the last Titan was a gamer card w/HBM2 instead. Now the rumor is that it'll essentially just be a fully unlocked card with 24GB of consumer RAM (GDDR6x). Which I'd be totally fine with, at least then you could run some of the bigger deep learning models without cashing out $2500. When AMD can sell 8GB of RAM on the RX 570 for less than $200 then you know 24GB worth of RAM shouldn't cost that much. They just lack competition. \n\n\n\nCiccioB - Monday, June 22, 2020 - link\nAMD lose money on the 480/470, so why should you expect a healthy company like Nvidia to do the same?\n\n\n\nragenalien - Monday, June 22, 2020 - link\nSource?  Because I really doubt that.  They also sell the RX 5500 xt with 8GB and I highly doubt they would lose money on three generations of mid range cards.\n\n\n\nCiccioB - Tuesday, June 23, 2020 - link\nSource? AMD quarters results.See the gain of the GPU+CPU division. They are so low for a reason. And it is certainly not due to CPU over selling.GPU division has been in red much before AMD hid the revenue under the same CPU invoice in the reports. And now, after years of combiner red, the GPU+CPU division positive. Starting from the large acceptance of Zen architecture on the market.While GPU numbers monitored by market share are still bad if not worse. With great peaces of market not or badly covered (top, server and professional).Why should anyone believe it is now suddenly gaining money? \n\n\n\njeremyshaw - Monday, June 22, 2020 - link\nI don't know if AMD lost money on the 470/480, but I'd venture Global Foundries did on every 14/12nm die sold. They never explicitly pointed out AMD, but they always claimed it their leading edge nodes were not profitable and they really only had a single leading edge node customer.\n\n\n\nIrata - Monday, June 22, 2020 - link\nI very much doubt they do.That said, those are different cards for a very different audience.\n\n\n\nquorm - Monday, June 22, 2020 - link\nWhat you're saying about the rtx titan is incorrect. It has 24gb gddr6 ram. The new titan will probably cost just as much.\n\n\n\nWannaBeOCer - Monday, June 22, 2020 - link\nThe Titan V wasn't a gaming card it was a card aimed at scientific computing with its 7.450 TFLOPS of FP64 power. While the Titan RTX was aimed at deep learning with 24GB of DDR6 memory.\n\n\n\nmode_13h - Monday, June 22, 2020 - link\nThe cool thing about the Titan V was that it could do it all.

With the DGX A100, NVIDIA has opted to utilize AMD's EPYC line of CPUs, a change from previous models using Intel's Xeon Platinum.\nNVIDIA DGX A100 - Ampere's Electrifying Launch\nLast month, we received news that NVIDIA was gearing up to launch the long-anticipated and much-rumored Ampere GPU microarchitecture which has now taken form as the GA100. In the DGX A100's case, the A100 GPUs will use the cut-down variant of the GA100.\nRelated Story Watch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For UnveilingA100 - Specifications\n\n6,912 CUDA Cores\n108 SMs (Streaming Multiprocessors)\n422 Tensor Cores\n826mm Die Area\n\n54 Billion Transistors\n\n\nTSMC 7nm CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate)\n40 GB HBM2\nPCIe 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nDGX A100 Specifications\n\n8X NVIDIA A100\n\n320GB Total VRAM\n\n12.4 TB/s Bandwidth\n\n\n3rd Generation NVLink\n\n600 GB/s Bandwidth\n\n\n\n\n2X AMD EPYC 7742\n\n128 Cores\n256 Threads\n128 PCIe 4.0 Lanes\n\n\n1 TB DDR4-3200 System Memory\n15 TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD\n5 PFLOPS Compute\n\nAMD & NVIDIA Partnership - AMD to Supply EPYC CPUs for DGX A100\nTo many individuals, a partnership between AMD and NVIDIA may seem counterintuitive, but for both manufacturers, such a partnership is highly beneficial. AMD's EPYC lineup of CPUs boasts quite the feature set, and in that case, has attracted NVIDIA's attention. Previously, NVIDIA's DGX systems had been powered by Intel's Xeon Platinum CPUs, but NVIDIA has migrated to AMD's enterprise platform for the DGX A100.\n\u00a0\nOnly 2nd Gen AMD EPYC processors can provide up to 64 cores and 128 lanes of PCIe 4 interconnectivity in a single x86 data center processor, and we\u2019re excited to see how the power of the NVIDIA DGX A100 system enables the I/O bandwidth to be effectively doubled.\nRaghu Nambiar - Corporate Vice President. Data Center Ecosystems & Application Engineering\nThe 2nd Gen AMD EPYC processors used in DGX A100 provide high performance and support for PCIe Gen4. NVIDIA has put those features to work to create the world\u2019s most powerful AI system while maintaining compatibility with the GPU-optimized software stack used across the entire DGX family.\nCharlie Boyle, Vice President & General Manager, DGX Systems - NVIDIA\nNVIDIA's DGX A100 will be powered by two AMD EPYC 7742 CPUs for a total of 128 cores and 256 threads, along with 1 TB DDR4-3200 system memory and will offer PCIe 4.0, a feature exclusive to AMD's EPYC CPUs, with a total of 128 PCIe 4.0 lanes.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nAMD Targets NVIDIA\u2019s Grace & Intel Granite Rapids Xeon CPUs With New 5th Gen EPYC Performance Showcase, Up To 2.75x Power Efficiency\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n105\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n55\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n50\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n42\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n34\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Cinesite, Framestore, MPC and Technicolor are four VFX studios that have enabled remote workflows to help their artists stay productive while working from home.\nLearn how they\u2019ve provided their creatives with the power, performance and security needed to keep productions moving forward.\nCinesite\nFrom offices in Vancouver, Montreal, London, Munich and Berlin, award-winning digital entertainment studio Cinesite creates visual effects and feature animation for film and TV such as Black Widow, The Addams Family, Rocketman and The Witcher.\nWhen coronavirus cases started spreading in Europe, the team at Cinesite quickly looked for ways to keep employees safe while maintaining high productivity.\n\u201cAt the time, nobody from our studios was working from home,\u201d said Michele Sciolette, CTO at Cinesite. \u201cVery quickly, we needed to find a way to provide our teams at home with the same full set of functionality and graphics horsepower that they had in the studio while maintaining a high level of security.\u201d\nCinesite London offices temporarily closed as employees work remotely from home.\nWith only a few weeks to prepare and deploy a system, there was no time to explore new technologies. Cinesite needed a solution that not only provided security and would allow the team to effectively perform all their daily tasks, but was also cost-effective and minimized the amount of support required for everyone working at home.\nThe immediate decision was to provide remote access to the workstations back in the studio. This ensured no files would leave Cinesite\u2019s secure network \u2014 all production workflows would be based on accessing the artists\u2019 workstations in the office from a remote client.\nThe final deployment varies slightly for each studio, but, for the most part, they chose HP Remote Graphics Software (RGS), recently renamed to HP ZCentral Remote Boost. This provided excellent results and allowed them to quickly scale up and provide employees access to the workstation power they need. Teradici and NoMachine solutions are also used to good effect.\nCinesite additionally created a secure and scalable VPN infrastructure to support the remote access. With the pressure to get this system deployed fast, Cinesite allowed some employees to use personal computers as a remote access point if it met specific requirements.\nIn less than three weeks, Cinesite deployed the new system and enabled approximately 1,100 people working from home across its studios.\nMPC and Technicolor\nAcademy Award-winning studio MPC uses cutting-edge technology to help produce films like 1917, The Lion King, The Jungle Book, Ad Astra, and Godzilla vs Kong. With operations distributed globally, MPC and its parent company, Technicolor, wanted to ensure their deployments were consistent across all business units.\n\u201cThis was not time to go and propose large capital expenditures to solve a problem,\u201d said Sebastian Sylwan, CTO of Film and Episodic VFX at Technicolor. \u201cWe had to react very quickly to support the needs of both our artists and our customers.\u201d\nCoincidentally, Technicolor was already updating its secure VPN infrastructure, which allowed it to quickly enable a lot more users. MPC also had a robust remote workstation infrastructure on premises, using Teradici\u2019s PCoIP and Leostream.\nRemote production continues at MPC Film during temporary office closures.\nA review of available options led to a setup based on Teradici\u2019s Cloud Access Connector as a brokering service. The logistics of distributing equipment were worked out and completed just before facilities went into lockdown.\n\u201cWe already had racks of workstations in our data center using Teradici with zero clients to the artists\u2019 desks,\u201d said Martin Weaver, global systems architect at Technicolor. \u201cOur HP workstations all came with free RGS licenses, and remoting all of this infrastructure happened ridiculously fast.\u201d\nThe following weeks then saw significant efforts to tweak the settings to allow for the most challenging workflows like 4K reviews and final quality control, as well as specialized solutions for group review and others.\nMPC also worked quickly to enable other special cases, like a small virtual production team that needed to use virtual cameras to continue shooting and sync the shots with scenes that were stored in a central repository.\nTo enable these workflows remotely, a special server setup was created and the team received workstations configured with fully encrypted VPN connections segregated from the internet. In parallel, production teams were in constant contact with studios and clients to validate the proposed solutions. Once the approvals came, the deployment happened very quickly.\nIn a short amount of time, Technicolor worked collaboratively in a task force involving all business units and was able to securely remote over 3,400 employees.\nFramestore\nWith a team of 3,000 people across the globe, BAFTA- and Oscar-winning creative studio Framestore has worked on recent film and television projects including Avengers: Endgame, No Time to Die and Blade Runner 2049. Framestore also works on advertising and immersive experiences with international brands and clients such as Geico, Jaguar, HBO, Lionsgate Entertainment World, Samsung and Disneyland Resort.\nSimilar to the other studios, Framestore had very little time to set up and deploy a solution that would help their artists work from home. On the advertising side, the teams were primarily using Teradici with Leostream brokering services to remote into their NVIDIA-powered Dell Precision workstations. To get ready and set up for remote work, the employees just needed to pick up their Teradici hardware and head home.\nBut on the film side, Framestore first needed to connect with its clients and other studios to receive approval and agree on security guidelines. Then Framestore started rebuilding its VPN servers, renewing certificates, and re-establishing all of the credentials to start with a fresh base.\nProductions maintained a fast pace as artists began working from home.\nFor extra security and to help ease the transition for employees, Framestore pre-configured routers and zero clients that could easily be plugged in at home. This created a hardware-based VPN that eased artist connectivity, improved network reliability, increased encryption efficiency and provided a higher level of monitoring for the Framestore networks team.\n\u201cOur top concern was security and we tackled that first,\u201d said Steve MacPherson, CTO of VFX at Framestore. \u201cOur artists have highly sophisticated graphics workstations in the office, and we needed to ensure that we would meet their high expectations and allow them to remain efficient.\u201d\nFramestore also monitored performance across broadband connections by deploying local client routers to each user, and essentially extended the internal Framestore network edge to users\u2019 homes. This allowed the team to troubleshoot issues and perform diagnostics to determine bandwidth thresholds, and tune network performance to provide an enhanced remote working experience for the employees.\nLearn more about how NVIDIA solutions like Quadro Virtual Data Center Workstations or Quadro-powered workstations from partners like HP and Dell are helping professionals do their best work remotely.\nFor more best practices and guidance for working from home for visual effects companies, read\u00a0 this VES Technology Committee document co-authored by Sebastian Sylwan and Michele Sciolette, among others.\nFeatured image courtesy of MPC. \u00a9 2019 WARNER BROS.

Now NVIDIA has announced that its A100 PCIe GPU accelerator is available for a diverse set of use cases with system ranging from a single A100 PCIe GPU to servers utilizing two cards at the same time through the 12 NVLINK channels that deliver 600 GB/s of interconnect bandwidth.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nIn terms of specifications, the A100 PCIe GPU accelerator doesn't change much in terms of core configuration. The GA100 GPU retains the specifications we got to see on the 400W variant with 6912 CUDA cores arranged in 108 SM units, 432 Tensor Cores and 40 GB of HBM2 memory that delivers the same memory bandwidth of 1.55 TB/s (rounded off to 1.6 TB/s). The main difference can be seen in the TDP which is rated at 250W for the PCIe variant whereas the standard variant comes with a 400W TDP.\nNow we can guess that the card would feature lower clocks to compensate for the less TDP input but NVIDIA has provided the peak compute numbers and those remain unaffected for the PCIe variant. The FP64 performance is still rated at 9.7/19.5 TFLOPs, FP32 performance is rated at 19.5 /156/312 TFLOPs (Sparsity), FP16 performance is rated at 312/624 TFLOPs (Sparsity) & INT8 is rated at 624/1248 TOPs (Sparsity).\n\nAccording to NVIDIA, the A100 PCIe accelerator can deliver 90% the performance of the A100 HGX card (400W) in top server applications. This is mainly due to the less time it takes for the card to achieve the said tasks however, in complex situations which required sustained GPU capabilities, the GPU can deliver anywhere from up to 90% to down to 50% the performance of the 400W GPU in the most extreme cases. NVIDIA told that the 50% drop will be very rare and only a few tasks can push the card to such extend.\nNVIDIA HPC / AI GPUs\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Tesla Graphics CardNVIDIA B200NVIDIA H200 (SXM5)NVIDIA H100 (SMX5)NVIDIA H100 (PCIe)NVIDIA A100 (SXM4)NVIDIA A100 (PCIe4)Tesla V100S (PCIe)Tesla V100 (SXM2)Tesla P100 (SXM2)Tesla P100\n(PCI-Express)Tesla M40\n(PCI-Express)Tesla K40\n(PCI-Express)\n\n\n\n\nGPUB200H200 (Hopper)H100 (Hopper)H100 (Hopper)A100 (Ampere)A100 (Ampere)GV100 (Volta)GV100 (Volta)GP100 (Pascal)GP100 (Pascal)GM200 (Maxwell)GK110 (Kepler)\n\n\nProcess Node4nm4nm4nm4nm7nm7nm12nm12nm16nm16nm28nm28nm\n\n\nTransistors208 Billion80 Billion80 Billion80 Billion54.2 Billion54.2 Billion21.1 Billion21.1 Billion15.3 Billion15.3 Billion8 Billion7.1 Billion\n\n\nGPU Die SizeTBD814mm2814mm2814mm2826mm2826mm2815mm2815mm2610 mm2610 mm2601 mm2551 mm2\n\n\nSMs160132132114108108808056562415\n\n\nTPCs806666575454404028282415\n\n\nL2 Cache SizeTBD51200 KB51200 KB51200 KB40960 KB40960 KB6144 KB6144 KB4096 KB4096 KB3072 KB1536 KB\n\n\nFP32 CUDA Cores Per SMTBD128128128646464646464128192\n\n\nFP64 CUDA Cores / SMTBD128128128323232323232464\n\n\nFP32 CUDA CoresTBD16896168961459269126912512051203584358430722880\n\n\nFP64 CUDA CoresTBD16896168961459234563456256025601792179296960\n\n\nTensor CoresTBD528528456432432640640N/AN/AN/AN/A\n\n\nTexture UnitsTBD528528456432432320320224224192240\n\n\nBoost ClockTBD~1850 MHz~1850 MHz~1650 MHz1410 MHz1410 MHz1601 MHz1530 MHz1480 MHz1329MHz1114 MHz875 MHz\n\n\nTOPs (DNN/AI)20,000 TOPs3958 TOPs3958 TOPs3200 TOPs2496 TOPs2496 TOPs130 TOPs125 TOPsN/AN/AN/AN/A\n\n\nFP16 Compute10,000 TFLOPs1979 TFLOPs1979 TFLOPs1600 TFLOPs624 TFLOPs624 TFLOPs32.8 TFLOPs30.4 TFLOPs21.2 TFLOPs18.7 TFLOPsN/AN/A\n\n\nFP32 Compute90 TFLOPs67 TFLOPs67 TFLOPs800 TFLOPs156 TFLOPs\n(19.5 TFLOPs standard)156 TFLOPs\n(19.5 TFLOPs standard)16.4 TFLOPs15.7 TFLOPs10.6 TFLOPs10.0 TFLOPs6.8 TFLOPs5.04 TFLOPs\n\n\nFP64 Compute45 TFLOPs34 TFLOPs34 TFLOPs48 TFLOPs19.5 TFLOPs\n(9.7 TFLOPs standard)19.5 TFLOPs\n(9.7 TFLOPs standard)8.2 TFLOPs7.80 TFLOPs5.30 TFLOPs4.7 TFLOPs0.2 TFLOPs1.68 TFLOPs\n\n\nMemory Interface8192-bit HBM45120-bit HBM3e5120-bit HBM35120-bit HBM2e6144-bit HBM2e6144-bit HBM2e4096-bit HBM24096-bit HBM24096-bit HBM24096-bit HBM2384-bit GDDR5384-bit GDDR5\n\n\nMemory SizeUp To 192 GB HBM3 @ 8.0 GbpsUp To 141 GB HBM3e @ 6.5 GbpsUp To 80 GB HBM3 @ 5.2 GbpsUp To 94 GB HBM2e @ 5.1 GbpsUp To 40 GB HBM2 @ 1.6 TB/s\nUp To 80 GB HBM2 @ 1.6 TB/sUp To 40 GB HBM2 @ 1.6 TB/s\nUp To 80 GB HBM2 @ 2.0 TB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 1134 GB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 900 GB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 732 GB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 732 GB/s\n12 GB HBM2 @ 549 GB/s24 GB GDDR5 @ 288 GB/s12 GB GDDR5 @ 288 GB/s\n\n\nTDP700W700W700W350W400W250W250W300W300W250W250W235W\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's a wide scale adoption being made possible already by NVIDIA and its server partners for the said PCIe based GPU accelerator which include:\n\nASUS\u00a0will offer the ESC4000A-E10, which can be configured with four A100 PCIe GPUs in a single server.\nAtos\u00a0is offering its BullSequana X2415 system with four NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs.\nCisco\u00a0plans to support NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs in its Cisco Unified Computing System servers and in its hyperconverged infrastructure system, Cisco HyperFlex.\nDell Technologies\u00a0plans to support NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs across its PowerEdge servers and solutions that accelerate workloads from edge to core to cloud, just as it supports other NVIDIA GPU accelerators, software and technologies in a wide range of offerings.\nFujitsu\u00a0is bringing A100 GPUs to its PRIMERGY line of servers.\nGIGABYTE\u00a0will offer G481-HA0, G492-Z50 and G492-Z51 servers that support up to 10 A100 PCIe GPUs, while the G292-Z40 server supports up to eight.\nHPE\u00a0will\u00a0support\u00a0A100 PCIe GPUs in the\u00a0HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen10 Server, and for accelerated HPC and AI workloads, in the\u00a0HPE Apollo 6500 Gen10 System.\nInspur\u00a0is releasing eight NVIDIA A100-powered systems, including the NF5468M5, NF5468M6 and NF5468A5 using A100 PCIe GPUs, the NF5488M5-D, NF5488A5, NF5488M6 and NF5688M6 using eight-way NVLink, and the NF5888M6 with 16-way NVLink.\nLenovo\u00a0will support A100 PCIe GPUs on select systems, including the Lenovo ThinkSystem SR670 AI-ready server.

As we did with V-Ray last week, we\u2019re also taking this opportunity to render with NVIDIA\u2019s OptiX, and see what further performance gains might be in store. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, we took a performance look at Chaos Group\u2019s V-Ray 5, across CUDA, OptiX, and hetereogeneous rendering workloads. In that article, our inclusion of OptiX was long overdue, since it\u2019s been supported for some time. Similarly, we\u2019ve been overdue testing the same API in Redshift, and testing out the upcoming 3.0 version. As you likely suspect, this article takes care of that.\nWe couldn\u2019t find a master list of all of what Redshift 3.0 brings to the table, but we know for certain that \u201cperformance improvements\u201d is one of the bullet-points. One of the better places to look for what\u2019s upcoming is the developer\u2019s Trello board. Looking there, we can see OptiX 7.0 and Redshift RT were recently implemented, as has support for the latest software suites.\nOnce in a while, a reader will ask us when one of these CUDA-only solutions will support Radeon, and a couple of years ago, it really felt like it\u2019d never happen. But, times change, and with Apple having killed off CUDA on macOS, it\u2019s really spurred some change. Fortunately, Radeon support for Redshift is still in development, and will target both Windows and macOS when it becomes available.\n\nFor a quick tease, the above shot was provided to the Trello by Redshift developer Saul Espinosa, highlighting one of the same projects we test with running inside of Cinema 4D within macOS. Naturally, Metal is the API being used there. We\u2019d assume Vulkan will be the target on PC.\nEquipped with that Age of Vultures project seen above, as well as a simpler project of an old-time radio, we\u2019re testing performance across a range of NVIDIA GTX and RTX graphics cards, with both version 2.6 and 3.0.22. Note that while Redshift 3 is still in development, it recently lost its \u201cexperimental\u201d tag, so we feel safe doing this testing at this particular time. In addition to the version comparison, we\u2019ll also be seeing if OptiX can further improve render times.\nBut first, here\u2019s the test rig used for all of our benchmarking in this article:\n\n\n\n\nTechgage Workstation Test System\n\n\nProcessor\nIntel Core i9-10980XE (18-core; 3.0GHz)\n\n\nMotherboard\nASUS ROG STRIX X299-E GAMING\n\n\nMemory\nG.SKILL FlareX (F4-3200C14-8GFX)\n4x16GB; DDR4-3200 14-14-14\n\n\nGraphics\nNVIDIA TITAN RTX (24GB, GeForce 446.14)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti (11GB, GeForce 446.14)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER (8GB, GeForce 446.14)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER (8GB, GeForce 446.14)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER (8GB, GeForce 446.14)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 (6GB, GeForce 446.14)\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 (6GB, GeForce 446.14)\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER (6GB, GeForce 446.14)\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti (6GB, GeForce 446.14)\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 (24GB, GeForce 446.14)\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 4000 (8GB, GeForce 446.14)\nNVIDIA Quadro P2200 (5GB, GeForce 446.14)\n\n\nAudio\nOnboard\n\n\nStorage\nKingston KC1000 960GB M.2 SSD\n\n\nPower Supply\nCorsair 80 Plus Gold AX1200\n\n\nChassis\nCorsair Carbide 600C Inverted Full-Tower\n\n\nCooling\nNZXT Kraken X62 AIO Liquid Cooler\n\n\nEt cetera\nWindows 10 Pro build 19041.329 (2004)\n\n\nAll product links in this table are affiliated, and help support our work.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s get started with a look at CUDA performance between 2.6 and 3.0 versions of Redshift:\n\n\nIt never ceases to amaze us when we see performance increases like these driven entirely by software. For the end-user, a mere software upgrade gives the same impact as upgrading their GPU in some cases. Naturally, performance aside, you\u2019d still never want to go below 8GB VRAM for a workstation GPU nowadays, but it\u2019s still great to see solid performance at the bottom-end.\nEven the lowbie Quadro P2200, a card that doesn\u2019t even have a power connector, saw a mammoth improvement to performance with the simple move from Redshift 2.6 to 3.0. Again, we\u2019d never suggest choosing a GPU like this for rendering, but that level of performance improvement on a lower-end last-generation card is great to see.\nIt does become clear that one of these scenes is more intensive than the other. The biggest improvements are seen in the Radio project for some reason, whereas the improvements are a little more modest with Age of Vultures. And this is where OptiX and accelerated ray tracing can come in, and spice things up.\nIt\u2019s important to note that OptiX in Redshift is used for both AI denoising and rendering, where the Tensor cores would be used for the former, and RT (ray tracing) cores for the latter. Neither of the OptiX options are enabled by default; you will need to head into the Experimental Options section to apply it for the renderer. If you have an RTX GPU, you can effectively call it yet another free performance boost.\n\nPlease note that when we tested OptiX, performance was a bit too quick in some cases, so the below results are not comparable to the above ones. We increased the amount of sampling each scene does, so that we can try and get more useful scaling. And that said, here are those results:\n\n\nFrom the get-go, the advantage from enabling OptiX RT is clear. Even at the top-end, the GPUs managed to shave a ton of time off of their renders, and again, while the effect was less pronounced with the Age of Vultures scene, we\u2019re still seeing such major jumps that it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re getting a free GPU upgrade. It\u2019s important to note that the end renders here are the same regardless of whether you choose CUDA or OptiX, although your level of success may depend on your scene.\nThe fact that OptiX RT isn\u2019t enabled by default isn\u2019t a good enough reason to not give it a try. Some competing renderers, like Arnold, use OptiX by default, but most commonly, it is currently offered as a switch, at least perhaps until we reach a time where it\u2019s definitively stable, and can be made a default. The gains seen above from OptiX are nothing new; we saw the same sort of increases in Blender and in V-Ray.\nThe past year has been pretty great for software upgrades that tremendously help render times, and clearly, Redshift has done its part in making sure those same sorts of enhancements are making it into 3.0. If you\u2019d rather err on the side of caution and wait for a finally final release of 3.0 once it\u2019s out, you should be able to expect to see it in about two months. As always, we\u2019ll upgrade to the final release as soon as it drops, and use it going forward in our CUDA testing.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport our efforts!

Most recent news about the company has been focused on the company finally releasing their 7nm architecture, Ampere, GPUs.\n\nNvidia announced that their July software update would include cross-branch support, allowing the host video card driver to be on a different driver version than the version used by a guest virtual machine. This should make it easier for both IT teams and developers to use the company\u2019s virtual GPUs (vGPU). IT teams will be happy that they can safely update to the latest version of the drivers as soon as they come out. This also helps smooth out driver deployment, allowing IT teams to smoothly roll out updates, instead of needing to do them all at once. Developers will be able to test with different driver versions without interfering with the workflows of other people using the same physical GPU card. Nvidia also claims that the July release will support managing their vGPUs with VMware\u2019s latest version of VMware vRealize Operations.\nIn addition to their data center work, the July updates will also include improvements for streaming virtual reality and augmented reality, both used by many companies for training purposes. According to Nvidia, the upcoming release will add support for 120Hz VSync at resolutions up to 4K while streaming over 5G and Wi-Fi networks.\nAt the same time, Nvidia also announced that they have partnered with SUSE to providing vGPU support for their virtual machine platform on the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. Nvidia will integrate their vComputeServer software with SUSE\u2019s operating system to enable virtualization for AI and data science workloads.\nAvailability\nNvidia GPU virtualization software (vGPU) \u2013 July 2020\nNVIDIA GPU Virtualization\nDiscuss on Reddit\nEngage with StorageReview\nNewsletter\u00a0|\u00a0YouTube\u00a0| Podcast\u00a0iTunes/Spotify\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \nFacebookTwitterPinterestEmail \n\n\n\n \n\nMichael Rink\nI'm a content contributor at StorageReview and a senior full stack software engineer.
