The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has officially completed its acquisition of Israel\u2019s Mellanox Technologies (NASDAQ:MLNX) today, capping an arduous process that spanned over 13 months.\nOn the 16th of April, China granted a conditional approval to the merger, stipulating only generic conditions, such as a prohibition on employing \u201cunreasonable\u201d tactics \u2013 including bundling \u2013 while selling devices in China. The U.S. and the European Commission have already approved the merger, with the latter\u2019s approval having been formalized only in December 2019.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total CostFollowing a nod from China's Anti-Monopoly Bureau of the State Administration for Market Regulation, NVIDIA had announced around 2 weeks back through a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the merger deal will attain an official closure on the 27th of April. Today, as per the stated timeline, NVIDIA has officially completed this acquisition process.\nAs per the details of the original agreement, announced back in March 2019, NVIDIA would pay $125 for each share of Mellanox, equating to a total purchase price of $6.9 billion. Notably, the acquisition was to be financed entirely through cash without any equity component and constitutes the largest such deal by the U.S. chipmaker.\nThe merger will produce significant synergies for the two firms. Mellanox has pioneered the InfiniBand interconnect technology, which in conjunction with its high-speed Ethernet products, is employed in over half of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers and multiple leading hyper-scale datacenters. This deal will allow NVIDIA to optimize its data center-based computing and cloud solutions and tap the growing demand for data storage and processing that has been driven, in large part, by AI applications, cloud services, smartphones, IoT devices, and autonomous vehicles. Moreover, the merger will provide NVIDIA the requisite tools for increasing rack-to-rack communications which, in turn, will help in reducing the latency of its hyperscale systems. Furthermore, Mellanox's data center solutions will facilitate NVIDIA in offloading networking tasks from central processing units to accelerators in an AI-driven, optimized manner.\nNVIDIA\u2019s Tesla line of GPUs marked the chipmaker's first foray in the data center sphere. As a refresher, these GPUs were modeled after its Quadro professional-grade workstations. The U.S. chipmaker had developed a number of products geared towards the market for servers in collaboration with Mellanox. It was the successful execution of these joint development projects that had prompted NVIDIA to table a merger proposal, culminating in today\u2019s official closure of the deal.\nNVIDIA\u2019s stock is up 2.85 percent today, hovering around $297.88 as of 12:38 p.m. ET. Year to date, the stock is up by a healthy 23.07 percent. For comparison, the NASDAQ 100 index is down around 2.55 percent during the same timeframe.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n147\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n120\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n74\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nA Mac Studio Cluster Of Four Units, All Featuring Apple\u2019s Latest M3 Ultra, Consume Less Than Half The Power Of A Network Switch When Running At Idle\n\n\n\n41\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n29\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n920\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Being placed under their Max-Q banner, the company is unveiling new features to better manage laptop TDP allocations, and for the first time, the ability to have G-Sync in an Optimus-enabled laptop. These new technologies are separate from the new hardware SKUs being launched today \u2013 they can technically be built into any future GeForce laptop \u2013 so I wanted to touch upon separately from the hardware itself.\nNVIDIA Dynamic Boost: Dynamic TDP Between GPU & CPU, For Intel & AMD\nFirst off, we have what NVIDIA is calling their Dynamic Boost technology. This is essentially NVIDIA\u2019s counterpart to AMD\u2019s SmartShift technology, which was introduced in the recently-launched Ryzen Mobile 4000 APUs.\nLike SmartShift, NVIDIA\u2019s Dynamic Boost is designed to take advantage of the fact that in many laptop designs, the GPU and the CPU share a common thermal budget, typically because they are both cooled via the same set of heatpipes. In practice, this is usually done in order to allow OEMs to build relatively thin and light systems, where the cooling capacity of the system is more than the TDP either of the CPU or GPU alone, but less than the total TDP of those two processors together. This allows OEMs to design around different average, peak, and sustained workloads, offering plenty of headroom for peak performance while sacrificing some sustained performance in the name of lighter laptops.\nIn fact, a lot of these designs are potentially leaving some performance on the table, as far as peak performance is concerned. Because the thermal budget of a laptop is usually greater than any single processor, normal processor TDPs have them holding themselves back more than they otherwise would. So, as the thinking goes, if the two processors are sharing a common cooling system, why not raise their power limits and then them split up the thermal budget of the system in an intelligent manner?\n\nAnd this is exactly what Dynamic Boost and similar technologies set out to do. By dynamically allocating power between the CPU and the GPU, a system should be able to eke out a bit more performance by making better-informed choices about where to allocate power. This could include, for example, allowing a CPU to go to a full 135W for a short period of time because the GPU is known to be idle, or borrowing some of the thermal budget from a lightly-loaded CPU and instead spending it on the GPU. Essentially it\u2019s the next step in min-maxing the performance of laptops with discrete CPUs and GPUs by offering ever finer-grained control over how power and thermal budgets are allocated between the two processors.\nOverall this isn\u2019t a new concept, but until recently it\u2019s only been used within a single CPU/APU to balance power between those two blocks. Extending it over multiple chips is a bit more work, and while beneficial, it\u2019s really only become worth the effort as Moore\u2019s Law has been slowing down.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s solution, meanwhile, has the notable distinction of being the first generic solution that works across multiple platforms. Whereas AMD\u2019s SmartShift is designed to work with the combination of AMD APUs and GPUs \u2013 fully leveraging the AMD ecosystem and their platform control fabric \u2013 NVIDIA as a common GPU supplier for both platforms needed to develop a solution that works with both. So Dynamic Boost can be used with both Intel Core processors and AMD Ryzen processors in a relatively generic manner, allowing OEMs to apply the technology regardless of whose CPU they use.\nAs for the performance benefits, while NVIDIA isn\u2019t promising anything major, Dynamic Boost will none the less let them wring out a bit more performance out of their GPUs. Like AMD, the numbers being thrown around are generally less than 10%, reflecting the fact that most games are significantly taxing both the CPU and the GPU, but that\u2019s four to eight percent more performance that would otherwise have been left on the table. Ultimately the big win here comes from taking advantage of the relative difference in voltage-frequency curves between the processors, as the highest speed bins are always the most expensive from a power perspective.\nPast that, the hardware implementation details for the technology are pretty straightforward, but they do require vendor involvement \u2013 so this can\u2019t be added to existing (in the field) laptops. Besides the immediate requirement of having a shared thermal system, laptops need to have the sensors/telemetry in place to keep a close eye on the state of the two processors and the thermal system itself. As well, OEMs need to build their laptops with greater-than-normal capacity VRM setups so that the processors can pull the extra power needed to clock higher (particularly the GPU). And even then, there is some system-level tuning required to account for the specific performance and cooling details of a given laptop design.\nThe upshot, at least, is that all of this OEM firmware tuning is a one-time affair, and Dynamic Boost is all but transparent at a software level. So no per-game profiling is necessary, and NVIDIA\u2019s drivers can operate on a generic basis, adjusting power/thermal limits based on what it\u2019s reading from the workload at-hand. According to NVIDIA, they are making their adjustments on a per-frame basis, so Dynamic Boost will only need a short period of time to adjust to any rapid shifts in the workload, depending on just how aggressive NVIDIA\u2019s algorithms are.\nFinally, it should be noted that Dynamic Boost is an optional feature, so it\u2019s ultimately up to OEMs to decide whether they want to implement it or not. For marketing reasons, NVIDIA is bundling it under their Max-Q family of features, but just because a laptop is Max-Q doesn\u2019t mean it can do Dynamic Boost. The flip side to that, however, is that if an OEM is going for Max-Q certification anyhow, then if they have a shared thermal solution then there\u2019s everything to gain from baking in support for the technology in future laptop designs.\nAdvanced Optimus: G-Sync and Optimus Together At Last\nAlong with Dynamic Boost, NVIDIA\u2019s other new laptop technology for today is what the company is calling Advanced Optimus. Exactly what it says on the tin, Advanced Optimus is a further enhancement of NVIDIA\u2019s Optimus technology, finally allowing for G-Sync to be used with the power-saving technology.\nAs a quick refresher, Optimus is NVIDIA\u2019s graphics switching technology. Originally introduced a decade ago, Optimus allows for both an iGPU and a dGPU to be used together in a single system and in a very efficient manner. This is accomplished by primarily relying on the iGPU, and then firing up the dGPU only when needed for intense workloads. The process as a whole is more involved than relying exclusively on either GPU \u2013 frames need to get passed around from the dGPU to the iGPU when it\u2019s being used \u2013 but the power savings relative to an always-on dGPU are significant. As a result, almost every GeForce-equipped laptop shipped today uses Optimus, with the exception of a handful of high-end machines that are aiming to be portable desktops.\n\nAnd while Optimus is all well and good, the fact that it essentially slaves the dGPU to the iGPU has always come with a rather specific drawback: it means the display controller used is always the iGPU\u2019s display controller, and thus the laptop can only do whatever the iGPU\u2019s display controller is capable of. Back in 2010 this wasn\u2019t a meaningful problem, but the introduction of variable refresh rate technology changed this. Ignoring for the moment the proprietary nature of some of NVIDIA\u2019s G-Sync implementations, even today Intel only supports variable refresh on its Gen11 GPUs, which are only found on its ultra-low voltage Ice Lake processors. As a result, it\u2019s not possible to both use the iGPU of an H-class system and get variable refresh out of it at the same time.\nThe net impact has been that laptop adoption of variable refresh has been few and far between. While laptop-class variable refresh displays are available, systems implementing it have had to go old school, either using a pure dGPU setup and shutting off the iGPU entirely, or using a multiplexer (mux) to switch the display output between the iGPU and dGPU. The mux solution in turn certainly works, but it in practice it has required a (high-friction) reboot when switching modes. Or at least, it did until now.\n\nFor Advanced Optimus, NVIDIA has finally figured out how to have their cake and eat it too. In short, the company has brought back the idea of dynamic mux, allowing laptops to switch between the iGPU and the dGPU on the fly. As a result, the iGPU is no longer a limiting factor when it comes to variable refresh; if a system wants to switch to a variable refresh mode, it can just fire up the dGPU and then switch over to using that. All without a reboot.\nBy and large, Advanced Optimus does away with the most novel aspects of Optimus \u2013 passing frames from the dGPU to the iGPU \u2013 and instead becomes a much smarter muxing implementation. Which means that along with making variable refresh technology more accessible, it also gets rid of the Optimus latency penalty. Since buffers no longer need to be passed to the iGPU, that roughly 1 frame delay is eliminated.\nUnfortunately, as far as technical details go, NVIDIA is holding this one quite close to their chest for the time being. NVIDIA has tried this idea once before in 2008 with their \"gen2\" switchable graphics, but in practice it wasn't a frictionless experience like it needed to be. Once Optimus came along, even dynamic muxing was quickly cast aside in favor of Optimus for most laptops, and manual muxing for the rest.\nSo at this point it\u2019s unclear just how NVIDIA has solved the pitfalls of previous dynamic mux solutions \u2013 passing the entire Windows desktop to another GPU in real time is (still) no easy task \u2013 but the company is adamant that it is a truly seamless experience. Truthfully, I haven\u2019t fully ruled out NVIDIA doing something incredibly crazy like baking a display controller into their mux \u2013 in essence having an external controller composite inputs from the two GPUs \u2013 but this is admittedly unlikely. More likely is that the company has borrowed some tips and tricks from their eGFX technology, which has to solve a similar problem with the added wrinkle of a dGPU that can be removed at any time. None the less, it will be interesting to crack open an Advanced Optimus laptop and see what makes it tick.\nAs for the software side of matters, Advanced Optimus behaves more or less like regular Optimus. That means checking applications against a list, and then switching accordingly. Crucially, windowed or full screen mode doesn\u2019t matter, and Advanced Optimus mode works for each. So while this presumably comes with the same tradeoffs between windowed and exclusive fullscreen mode that we see in regular G-Sync operation, it none the less means that every option is on the table, just like a regular (non-Optimus) G-Sync setup.\nUltimately, NVIDIA\u2019s goal is to get variable refresh/G-Sync support in a lot more laptops than it is today, as Advanced Optimus removes both the friction and the battery life penalties that have been encountered to date. To be sure, this is still an optional feature for OEMs, as it requires them to take the care to integrate both a variable refresh display as well as the necessary mux. But never the less it opens the door to putting G-Sync on thin & light laptops and other notebooks where a vendor would never be willing to accept a traditional mux solution. I do wonder if perhaps this is going to be a short-term solution \u2013 what happens when Intel launches the variable refresh-capable Tiger Lake-H in 2021? \u2013 but for now, NVIDIA is the only game in town for doing variable refresh on a laptop without making other compromises.\n\nFinally, the first vendor out of the door will be Lenovo, whom is NVIDIA\u2019s launch partner for the technology. The two companies have worked together to add the technology to Lenovo\u2019s new Legion 5i and 7i laptops, which were also announced today and start with an RTX 2060 for $999. Unfortunately, Lenovo has not announced a release date for those laptops, so it sounds like we\u2019ll be waiting just a bit longer before the first Advanced Optimus laptop hits the market.\nGallery: NVIDIA Spring 2020 Laptop Press Deck\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n13 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nChaitanya - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nEagerly waiting to see how Optimus and G-Sync play hand in hand together. \n\n\n\nnathanddrews - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nYeah, but that Ryzen 4000-series is a BEAST!\n\n\n\nblanarahul - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nWhile it's true that Intel supports VRR only it's Gen11 IGP, AMD has much wider support in their APU lineup don't they? AMD + NVIDIA should have both Optimus and VRR without needing a seperate chop shouldn't it?\n\n\n\nMamiyaOtaru - Friday, April 3, 2020 - link\nYeah, the ROG Zephyrus G14 has a GTX 2060, an AMD APU, Optimus and freesync support for its 120hz monitor.  https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-Zephyrus-G14-Ry...\n\n\n\neastcoast_pete - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nThanks Ryan! Any information on whether the all new and improved Optimus also works with AMD Ryzen mobile CPUs, especially the 4000 series?  Until AMD gets its mobile dGPU act together, a Ryzen 4000/NVIDIA combo is probably the best option.\n\n\n\nRyan Smith - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nThere was no specific discussion of using it with AMD APUs. But then there was no specific mention of Intel, either. With NVIDIA preparing Dynamic Boost to work with processors from both AMD and Intel, it certainly makes me presume that they're going to want to support Optimus in this fashion as well. The mux aspect means that AO should be relatively abstracted from the hardware.\n\n\n\nAikouka - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nI'm rather intrigued by the Advanced Optimus feature.  I've always been more of a fan of G-Sync in laptops due to the inability to upgrade graphics, which always made the idea of syncing to falling framerates (as the laptop ages) seem like a worthwhile idea.  However, G-Sync was usually rarely found in a laptop under $1500, and it was hard to justify something when I already have a gaming desktop.  So, in turn, the cheaper Lenovo laptops also sound quite interesting.Although, like some other commenters are mentioning, I'd be curious to see if we get any AMD-equipped laptops with this technology.\n\n\n\neek2121 - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nI wonder how efficient Optimus would be if GPUs had better power management. If the GPU could be throttled down and entire blocks of cores could be shut off completely along with multiple banks of RAM, I imagine Optimus would not even be needed.\n\n\n\nlondedoganet - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nIt\u2019s spelled \u201ceke out\u201d. Sorry, it\u2019s just one of my pet peeves, along with spelling \u201cdiscrete\u201d as \u201cdiscreet\u201d (which this article did not do).\n\n\n\np3ngwin1 - Friday, April 3, 2020 - link\nIt will be interesting to see Sony's implementation of this idea with their PS5, having variable clock rates for both CPU+GPU, compared to Xbox Series-X's \"fixed clocks\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

The RTX 2060 Super, in particular, kind of made the RTX 2070 obsolete, not because the hardware itself was outdated, but because the RTX 2060 Super had the same amount of power at a cheaper price. It was, and still is, the best \u2018bang for your buck\u2019 option with ray tracing when it comes to desktop GPUs. But don\u2019t expect to see an RTX 2060 Super as part of Nvidia\u2019s latest mobile GPU lineup. Only the RTX 2080 Super and RTX 2070 Super are coming to laptops sometime this month. I can\u2019t say for certain why Nvidia is opting to release mobile versions of only those two cards, but new RTX 2060 laptop models will be available instead. Nvidia is also introducing a new and improved version of its Max-Q technology, which will be available in some new RTX 2080 Super, 2070 Super, and 2060 laptops. They\u2019re also getting Intel\u2019s Core i7 and Core i9 10th-gen mobile processors that were announced today, too. But the thing that raises my eyebrows is Nvidia\u2019s suggested entry price for new RTX 2060 laptops\u2014$1,000. Currently, laptops with a GTX 1660 Ti hover around that price right now, depending on other specs. Laptops with a RTX 2060 price well over a grand currently, so for Nvidia to say that laptops with its base ray tracing card will be available in the not too distant future for hundreds of dollars less is pretty bold.\n\n\n According to Nvidia\u2019s RTX Studio page, every RTX Studio system (desktop or laptop) comes with at least a: GeForce RTX 2060, Titan RTX, Quadro RTX 3000, or higher; Intel Core i7 or equivalent, or higher; 16 GB or more; 512 GB SSD or more; and a 1080p or 4K display (laptop or all-in-one). There\u2019s no word yet on how these new laptops will be configured, but to get that large of a price drop typically means a step down or two in processing speed, available storage, and/or amount of memory. The Acer ConceptD 7, for instance, is currently priced at $2,300 on the page\u2014far from that $1,000 price point\u2014and it comes with an Intel Core i7-9750H processor, RTX 2060, 16GB DDR4 RAM, and a 1TB SSD. I\u2019m assuming that all-new RTX 2060 laptop models won\u2019t have a 10th-gen Intel processor in them to keep costs down. But some OEMs seem to be taking the $1,000 price to heart. Lenovo says its Legion 5i (previously the Legion Y540) with a RTX 2060 GPU will be available starting at $1,000. Whether that is paired with a 10th-gen Intel mobile CPU, or any other sweet hardware components like a 1TB SSD, remains to be seen. It didn\u2019t provide specific configuration details.\n\n\n\nAcer also said is new Nitro 5 gaming notebooks will come with up to a RTX 2060, with a starting price of $750. Although, I suspect that low of a price has a GTX 1650 or GTX 1650 Ti instead. Both Nitro 5 and Predator Triton 500 laptops will include Intel 10th-gen mobile CPUs, too. Acer did not provide specific configuration details, either. Moving on to Max-Q 2.0, one of the new features, Dynamic Boost, provides \u201cautomatic, per-frame GPU and CPU power balancing,\u201d meaning, hopefully, more power is delivered to the GPU or CPU as necessary, depending on what kind of resource a games or program uses the most. (Some are GPU heavy, while others are CPU heavy.) According to Nvidia, this gives games about a 6 to 9 percent boost in performance. While a Max-Q laptop with a GTX 1080 from three years ago might get you an average of 73 fps on high, with ray tracing off, on games like Control, Wolfenstein: Youngblood, or Deliver Us The Moon, a Max-Q laptop with a RTX 2080 Super will average 167 fps with the same games on the same graphics settings, claims Nvidia.\n\n\n\nOn paper, this seems like it could help with the drop in framerate that ends up happening with current Max-Q laptops. They\u2019re slightly less powerful than their regular siblings because they\u2019re designed for efficiency over performance; higher framerates mean higher clock speed and voltages, which means more heat output and chunkier laptops. But Max-Q makes high-end laptops thinner, lighter, and quieter, which is kind of the \u2018in thing\u2019 these days. Dynamic Boost isn\u2019t something that will become available to first-gen Max-Q laptops because it\u2019s something specific to the new design. We\u2019ll hopefully get our hands on some of these new laptops soon and see if the new Max-Q design really does have better fps performance. But we\u2019ll continue to lament the lack of a mobile 2060 Super too.\n\n\n\nComputersConsumer TechGPUsNvidia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily Newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n          Get the best

That\u2019s where Nikita Jaipuria and Rohan Bhasin come in.\nJaipuria, a research scientist in computer vision and machine learning, and Bhasin, a research engineer, spoke with AI Podcast host Noah Kravitz about their roles at Ford Motor Company, as well as their GTC Digital session.\nThey explained that autonomous vehicles need to be trained on a diverse dataset that represents any possible situation, but it can be difficult to collect all of that data in the real world.\nSo Ford is using a combination of gaming engine-based simulations and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to fill the gap in real-world datasets.\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\nUsing gaming engines, Ford can create synthetic data. Using GANs on these simulations increases their photorealism. They can deploy this sim-to-real pipeline on HPC clusters and quickly generate large amounts of data.\nJaipuria and Bhasin note significant success with datasets that were originally very small or heavily biased \u2014 meaning that there weren\u2019t enough scenarios represented in the dataset.\nThis sim-to-real method reduces the time and cost it takes to collect and annotate real-world data, and could be broadly applicable to other perception features.\n\nTweetables:\n\u201cGANs make it much harder to identify which is real and which is not.\u201d \u2014 Rohan Bhasin [9:10]\n\u201cWhen you start mixing synthetic data with real data, that\u2019s when you start seeing boosts in performance, especially to unseen scenarios and datasets.\u201d \u2014 Nikita Jaipuria [13:29]\nYou Might Also Like\nNVIDIA\u2019s Neda Cvijetic Explains the Science Behind Self-Driving Cars\nWhat John Madden was to pro football, Neda Cvijetic is to autonomous vehicles.

Introduced this week in China, the vehicle has an estimated battery range of 439 miles. And its innovative level 3 automated driving features are powered by the high-performance, energy-efficient NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Xavier AI compute platform.\nThe next generation of driving is one that is software-defined, which means it can be continually updated. Rather than focusing their efforts on engine horsepower, engineering teams are fine-tuning the deep neural networks that power AI-assisted features.\nAnd even after the car leaves the dealership lot, it\u2019s constantly improving. With over-the-air software updates, vehicles can receive the latest autonomous driving and intelligent cockpit features, so they stay on the cutting edge no matter the model year.\nUsing NVIDIA\u2019s end-to-end offerings for automotive development, Xpeng is helping usher in this new era of transportation with the AI-powered P7.\nIntelligent Design\nThe sporty P7 sedan is designed for safe, convenient AI-assisted driving. It\u2019s equipped with 12 ultrasonic sensors, five high-precision millimeter-wave radars and 14 cameras for 360-degree perception. The car\u2019s forward-looking radar has a detection distance of 200 meters, penetrating rain, fog and haze.\n\nThis redundant and diverse halo of sensors informs the XPilot 3.0 level 3 autonomous driving system. With NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Xavier at its core, the system is capable of automated highway driving and valet parking.\nDRIVE AGX Xavier delivers 30 trillion operations per second of AI compute performance while consuming just 30 watts of power, making it the choice platform for level 2+ and level 3 automated driving systems. At its core is the NVIDIA Xavier system-on-a-chip, which is architected for safety, meeting all current safety standards and regulatory requirements.\nConstant Improvement\nDevelopment of the P7 began in Xpeng\u2019s data center, with NVIDIA\u2019s AI infrastructure for training and testing self-driving deep neural networks.\nWith high-performance data center GPUs and advanced AI learning tools, this scalable infrastructure allows developers to manage massive amounts of data and train autonomous driving DNNs.\nXpeng is also using NVIDIA DRIVE OS software, in addition to the DRIVE AGX Xavier in-vehicle compute, to run the XPilot 3.0 system. The open and flexible operating system enables the automaker to run its proprietary software while also delivering OTA updates for new driving features.\nThis commitment to constant, intelligent development has put Xpeng at the forefront of the future of driving with the P7 sedan.

These are mobile variants of the desktop GPUs introduced this past July, first with the RTX 2060/2070 SUPER launch; the RTX 2080 SUPER following later than month.\n\n\u201cNVIDIA today announced that its global OEM partners are bringing out more than 100 new thin, light and fast laptop models, all powered by NVIDIA GeForce GPUs, including the just-launched GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER and 2070 SUPER GPUs for laptops.\nThe record-size launch also includes a range of RTX 2060-powered laptops starting at just $999. The new platforms are all based on the NVIDIA Turing\u2122 architecture, which incorporates dedicated hardware RT Cores to process ray tracing and AI in real time, delivering increased performance and enhanced visual fidelity for today\u2019s hottest games and major content creation applications.\nMany of the models are offered in Max-Q configurations, an NVIDIA technology enhanced with new features providing the absolute fastest performance and highest efficiency in a mobile platform.\u201d\n\nRTX Laptop GPU Specs\nA glance at the specs of the updated NVIDIA GeForce RTX mobile GPU lineup reveals the same configurations as their desktop counterparts, with the expected reduction in clock speeds \u2013 though these are configurable by the OEM (note the range in Base and Boost clocks).\n \n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX Mobile GPUs\n\n\n\nRTX 2080 SUPER\nRTX 2080\nRTX 2070 SUPER\nRTX 2070\nRTX 2060\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n3072\n2944\n2560\n2304\n1920\n\n\nRTX-OPS\n38-55 T\n37-53 T\n34-40 T\n31-38 T\n26 T\n\n\nGiga Rays/s\n5-7\n5-7\n4-5\n4-5\n3.5\n\n\nBase Clock\n735-1365 MHz\n735-1380 MHz\n930-1140 MHz\n885-1215 MHz\n960 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1080-1560 MHz\n1095-1590 MHz\n1155-1380 MHz\n1125-1455 MHz\n1185-1200 MHz\n\n\nGPU Power\n80-150+ W\n80-115+ W\n80-115 W\n80-115 W\n65-90 W\n\n\nStandard Memory Config\n8GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n6GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Data Rate\nUp to 14 Gbps\nUp to 14 Gbps\nUp to 14 Gbps\nUp to 14 Gbps\nUp to 14 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Interface\n256-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n192-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\nUp to 448 GB/s\nUp to 448 GB/s\nUp to 448 GB/s\nUp to 448 GB/s\nUp to 336 GB/s\n\n\n\n \nThe RTX 2060 does not gain a \u201cSUPER\u201d variant with this update, but NVIDIA says this existing GPU is coming to the $999 gaming laptop price point, with models from Acer, ASUS, HP, Lenovo, and MSI, among others.\n\nMax-Q Technology Update\n \n\n\nIn addition to the new mobile versions of the RTX 2070/2080 SUPER GPUs, NVIDIA\u2019s laptop gaming update includes a new version of Max-Q, the initiative first announced way back at Computex 2017.\n \nNVIDIA lists these Max-Q Technology features:\n\n\nDynamic Boost \u2014 Intelligently and automatically balances power between the GPU and CPU on a per-frame basis, boosting overall in-game performance. Dynamic Boost is automatic, adaptive and always working to deliver more performance without increasing system power consumption.\nLow-Voltage GDDR6 \u2014 NVIDIA has worked with its memory partners to increase memory efficiency while delivering high performance with new lower voltage GDDR6 memory.\nAdvanced Optimus \u2014 A breakthrough display innovation that delivers long battery life and immersive, stutter-free gameplay from NVIDIA G-SYNC technology. Advanced Optimus controls which GPU is driving the display and intelligently determines the right GPU for the right workload at the right time, dynamically switching on the fly without needing a system reboot. The new lineup of Lenovo Legion laptops are the world\u2019s first to feature this groundbreaking technology.\nNext-Generation Regulator Efficiency \u2014 Next-generation voltage regulators help optimize system design so the GPU runs more efficiently while delivering higher overall performance.\nDeep Learning Super Sampling 2.0 \u2014 Powered by dedicated AI processors on RTX GPUs called Tensor Cores, DLSS 2.0 is an improved deep learning neural network that boosts frame rates while generating beautiful, sharp images for games. It boosts a game\u2019s performance headroom while maximizing ray-tracing settings with increased output resolution and extending battery life by up to 20 percent.\n\n\n \n\n\nPower balancing was heavily emphasized during NVIDIA\u2019s presentation of this new Max-Q tech, with the shared thermal load between GPU and CPU a major contributing factor for performance in notebook design.\nRather than limit each component to a static power limit, the new Max-Q Dynamic Boost can perform automatic, per-frame GPU and CPU power balancing, according to NVIDIA. What can this do for performance? NVIDIA is claiming that the new Max-Q actually doubles efficiency, increasing performance within the same power limit.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne important note: this new Max-Q tech will require new hardware. NVIDIA continues to use their GeForce Experience software to configure in-game settings to optimize power consumption, but this is also a hardware update (the lower-voltage GDDR6 and next-gen voltage regulators mentioned above) \u2013 meaning, of course, that existing laptops won\u2019t gain the new Max-Q technologies via software or firmware.\nDLSS 2.0 is another component of the 2020 mobile graphics offering that can help improve gaming performance with these new RTX GPUs, and on the laptop side this is also presented as a way to improve battery life.\n \n\n\nNVIDIA claims battery life improvements of up to 20% when playing with real-time ray tracing enabled (RTX on), with the technology\u2019s Performance Mode used in NVIDIA\u2019s example pictured above (this mode using the lowest internal resolution to help boost both performance and battery).\nRTX Studio Update\nFinally, an important aspect of this notebook graphics update that might fly under the radar for those just looking at gaming potential: content creation. Gaming laptops can be a smart way to get what amounts to a high-end mobile workstation without the pro-level price tag, and NVIDIA says their \u201cRTX Studio empowers creators with new laptops\u201d.\n \n\n\n\n\u201cNVIDIA also announced 10 new RTX Studio laptops, powered by RTX SUPER GPUs and the latest Intel 10th-generation processors. Available from Acer, Gigabyte, MSI and Razer, the laptops are the ultimate solution for creators seeking unmatched video and 3D performance.\nMore than 45 of the top creative applications \u2014 such as Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, AutoDesk Arnold, Blender and many more \u2014 all feature RTX acceleration by the RT Cores in RTX GPUs.\u201d\n\nPricing and Availability\nNVIDIA\u2019s new RTX Gaming and Studio laptops are scheduled to start shipping \u201cthe week of April 15th from multiple partners globally\u201d, the company states, \u201cwith more coming in May\u201d. Specs and pricing will, as always, vary by model/vendor/region. NVIDIA has indicated that RTX 2060-powered machines will start at $999. Launch partners include Acer, ASUS, Clevo, Dell, Gigabyte, HP, Lenovo, MSI, and Razer.\nMore information on the RTX SUPER notebook update can be found on NVIDIA\u2019s product page (link).\n \n \n \n  \n\n\n \n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVideo News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviousA Trio Of 10th Generation Intel Powered MSI Laptops \n\nNextThe Big Cloud Providers Try To Shore Up Internet Routing Security \n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\n\n\n \n\nSebastian Peak\nEditor-in-Chief at PC Perspective.

But as computing has advanced, so has NerdWallet\u2019s ambition.\nNow the company is using AI to better match casual visitors to its site \u2014 those who haven\u2019t volunteered any personal information \u2014 with financial products.\nWe\u2019re not talking ad stalking like with social media sites. This is predictive modeling, powered by NVIDIA GPUs, that ups the odds of providing valuable recommendations to those who haven\u2019t even asked for them.\nThe way Michael Tompkins, director of data science at NerdWallet, sees it, if his company wants to provide relevant information to anyone coming to its website, then it needs to make use of all of the data at its fingertips. While NerdWallet has a membership experience, it also draws more than 10 million casual visitors to its site each month.\n\u201cWe know that people in large numbers are coming, and we know they\u2019re transacting,\u201d said Tompkins. \u201cWe need to help them make better decisions.\u201d\nModeling the Unknown\nNerdWallet\u2019s machine learning models have traditionally used information provided by members to match them with financial instruments for which they\u2019re most likely to be approved.\nThe models learn which profile features \u2014 credit scores, outstanding balances, credit utilization, etc. \u2014 are getting members approved or declined. As models become more familiar with underwriting procedures, they get better and better at matching members with suitable products.\nBut doing this for non-members presented a more complicated problem: How do you infer without financial information?\nThe primary resource available to NerdWallet is user behavior, such as what pages people visit, what things they look at and what they click on. By observing these behaviors and matching them against past similar ones, NerdWallet can learn and eventually make better recommendations.\nSo the company built a model with this in mind and set about collecting \u201cevent\u201d information on every digital asset visitors access \u2014 from web pages to articles to blogs. With over 100 million unique visitors each year, NerdWallet is collecting billions of events and using that raw data to expand its model.\nThe company feeds this data into a convolutional neural network. The network\u2019s numerous layers \u2014 it can be up to 10 layers deep \u2014 are each able to extract factors by creating feature maps of data coming from the preceding layer.\n\u201cAt the last convolutional layer, we have advanced neural layers and are able to predict or infer what the user might do in their next session,\u201d said Boris Roussev, principal data scientist at NerdWallet. \u201cOr, we can decide based on user behavior what we want to recommend that would be best for this user.\u201d\nTo accomplish this, NerdWallet relies on the Keras and TensorFlow machine learning frameworks, and its data science team uses NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs for training. It builds and deploys its models on its machine learning platform that uses Amazon SageMaker.\n\nConstant Refinement\nA big part of the effort involves tuning its neural networks, which requires machine learning models to run hundreds to thousands of times. NVIDIA GPUs shorten that process from days to minutes, enabling NerdWallet to constantly optimize its supporting architecture.\nAnd, as Tompkins points out, every little refinement matters.\n\u201cOur particular problem is so tricky to solve that the precision of these models is quite low,\u201d he said. \u201cGetting precision from 25 percent to 27 percent is a huge win.\u201d\nThose little gains in precision translate to users having more trust in NerdWallet, which will continuously improve recommendations.\n\u201cThe grand idea here is that regardless of why you come to NerdWallet, we\u2019re going to provide clarity about financial decisions,\u201d said Tompkins.\nThe more the company can learn from even the most casual site visit, the more likely it can make useful recommendations quickly. Especially when that behavioral data is combined with the hard data members provide across about a dozen different financial verticals, such as mortgages and insurance.\n\u201cIf we have this holistic view of the people we do know about,\u201d Tompkins said, \u201cwe can use that to make all sorts of recommendations for the person who comes for the first time.\u201d\nLearn more by watching NerdWallet\u2019s on-demand GTC Digital session and visit NVIDIA\u2019s financial services industry web page.\n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Financial Services | GTC 2020 | GTC Digital \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And with their team now working from home, employees are using remote access to connect to that Quadro power back at the office.\nHNTB specializes in visualizations, motion graphics and immersive experiences for clients across the United States, particularly in the fields of architecture, construction and transportation.\nTo design high-fidelity visualizations for their projects, HNTB requires substantial rendering muscle, but their previous render farm was based on CPUs only. So when the team started working more with GPU-based rendering, they experienced how real-time ray tracing not only accelerated their design process, but also enabled them to stay in creative workflows while working remotely.\nBy upgrading their rack workstations to NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 and 8000 GPUs, HNTB designers can render images faster than before, allowing them to iterate quickly and spend more time on developing their designs.\n\u201cOur team has experienced almost no downtime, and we didn\u2019t need to scale back our current workload,\u201d said Austin Reed, 3D visualization team lead and supervisor at HNTB. \u201cThis allows our team to work from home during these early days of COVID-19 just like we were in the office.\u201d\nThe Need for Speed (and Mobility)\nWhen HNTB started driving more real-time simulations, they knew it was important to have hardware that can handle their complex designs, massive datasets and rendering needs.\nAs projects take anywhere from two weeks to three months, the designers wanted to work as smartly and efficiently as possible. The ability to work from any location would keep their creativity going whenever inspiration strikes.\nThe project workflow typically starts with some form of aerial imagery from NearMap. Designers then import the data into Autodesk 3ds Max to begin building existing conditions around the proposed project site.\nHowever, HNTB would previously CPU-render images locally or use their 40-node CPU render farm \u2014 and they\u2019d have to wait hours to see the results. Even after the image finished rendering, they\u2019d still need to review and iterate on the results.\n\u201cAre the shadows correct? Reflections? Why isn\u2019t the ambient occlusion working? Then we\u2019d have to make the necessary changes and go grab another cup of coffee to wait for the paint to dry,\u201d said Reed.\nImage courtesy of HNTB.\nQuadro RTX Brings Higher Power, Performance for Remote Design Workflows\nThis time-consuming rendering process ultimately became a non-issue when the Quadro RTX GPUs were installed into the Dell Precision 7920 Rack Workstations inside the server room at the HNTB office. Designers could remotely connect to their workstations from their personal desktop or laptops via Windows remote desktop and the company VPN \u2014 and bring GPU-powered performance to their remote workflows.\nThe RTX GPUs help HNTB achieve even more photorealistic renders, thanks to their real-time ray tracing capabilities.\nWith RTX, HNTB also used the extra VRAM to put large datasets directly on the GPU. Being able to remove noise and static more quickly while rendering images allows the team to be even more creative and bring high-quality immersive experiences to projects.\nAnd with creative apps like Autodesk 3ds Max, Substance Painter, Chaos V-Ray, Unreal Engine and others enabling professionals to tap into the power of RTX GPUs, HNTB can iterate much faster and resolve geometry or shader issues before sharing the final renders with clients.\n\u201cBeing able to have near one-to-one feedback while working from home allows our team to keep working on our massive projects while continuing to deliver what our clients have come to expect, even under these unusual circumstances,\u201d said Reed.\nLearn more about Quadro RTX, connecting remotely, virtualization solutions, and other tools that let you work virtually, anywhere.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | COVID-19 | NVIDIA RTX | Quadro | Remote Work | Virtualization \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He found it in bringing AI technology to enhance the safety systems on oil rigs, one of the most dangerous job sites in the world.\n\u201cWe wanted to find a capital-intensive international industry in a complex environment,\u201d said Masselink. \u201cOur assumption was that the more complex the work is, the fewer people are working on it.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s what led him to Arie Rolloos, grandson of the man who founded Rolloos Oil & Gas BV 50 years prior to Masselink\u2019s first venture. Rolloos got its start selling and maintaining forklifts and military equipment and ultimately evolved into a provider of crane safety and camera systems on oil drilling rigs.\nMasselink decided that bringing some AI in the forms of smart cameras and sensors to Rolloos\u2019 systems was an ideal project.\n\u201cIf you design or develop something really smart in which clients can be even one percent more effective, you can send a pretty decent invoice,\u201d he said.\nRolloos used NVIDIA\u2019s technology stack \u2014 from edge GPUs to optimized deep learning containers \u2014 to build the system and then deploy it on offshore rigs.\nBirth of a Life Saver\nWhen Masselink, now managing director of Rolloos, and his team began developing algorithms and the tools they would inform, they found out just how important this work was.\nA client had an accident on a rig in which a worker was killed, due to a combination of mechanical failure and human errors. The worker was standing in a dangerous place when a piece of equipment failed, and a heavy pipe that came loose hit the worker in the head.\n\u201cIt was a shock to me that people still died in the work environment,\u201d Masselink recalled of the incident, which occurred more than four years ago.\nThe Rolloos team worked with the client to develop what they call the \u201cRed Zone System,\u201d which uses AI-powered computer vision algorithms powered by NVIDIA GPUs and a network of cameras and sensors to locate rig workers in unsafe spots, and alert them before an accident occurs.\nRolloos and the client map procedures as they\u2019re supposed to unfold, and then compare real-time situations to that blueprint. This allows them to determine if it\u2019s the equipment or the people that are causing inefficiencies. What they\u2019ve found is that the Red Zone System does more than save lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a safety system, it\u2019s a tool for finding out how to work more effectively,\u201d said Masselink. \u201cMaybe with other tools or machinery, they can do a better job. They just don\u2019t know. We supply them with the tools to learn this.\u201d\nThis is a critical consideration: If a job can be done with three people instead of four, that\u2019s one person who can\u2019t be standing in an unsafe position.\nPainstaking Development Process\nIn developing the Red Zone System, Rolloos started by mounting cameras \u2014 lots of them \u2014 on the client\u2019s rig and capturing 60 days worth of various types of operations performed in all types of weather and conditions.\nThe company then employed human labelers to mark every person and object in the video data and used that information to build an algorithm that recognizes people in a complex rig environment.\nAs the labeled data was run through Rolloos\u2019 model, the focus was on improving accuracy and limiting false alarms. Today, the model pinpoints locations within 18 inches and can run a complete sequence in 250 milliseconds. Every false alarm serves as an opportunity to refine the model further.\nAnd because there\u2019s no internet connectivity on rigs, all of this is accomplished on hardware running onsite.\nRolloos, an NVIDIA Inception partner, started out using an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 GPU for video stream compression. They recently upgraded to the Jetson AGX Xavier and are seeing even better performance. By using NVIDIA\u2019s acceleration toolkits like DeepStream and TensorRT from NGC, the company can actively monitor red zones in real time.\nRolloos trained its deep learning models on NVIDIA data center GPUs and deployed them for inference on an NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPU. Masselink said they\u2019re also evaluating the Jetson for inference.\nRolloos is currently collecting metrics to illustrate the Red Zone System\u2019s impact, but perhaps the most important metric has become very clear.\n\u201cPeople have changed their behavior,\u201d said Masselink.\n\nIn Search of Red Zones\nLooking forward, Masselink sees a lot of potential to expand on Rolloos\u2019 Red Zone System in other settings and industries. First, he plans to expand to other parts of drilling rigs, such as spots where equipment is loaded and offloaded. He\u2019s also working with clients to develop more automated reporting capabilities.\nThe mining industry and wherever large containers or industrial tools are in use are other potential markets. The key, Masselink said, is to refine the technology to the point where it\u2019s easily transferable.\n\u201cWe want to make it very standardized and more plug-and-play,\u201d he said. \u201cThe architecture should be as modular as possible so you can implement other use cases.\u201d\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | DeepStream | Energy | Inception | Industrial and Manufacturing | Jetson | Metropolis | NVIDIA in Europe | TensorRT \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Ensuring the quality of each one is a top priority, but not easy.\nThe disk drive manufacturing process is incredibly complex. For example, it takes 1,400 steps just to manufacture the drive head. Even the smallest errors can lead to product flaws.\n\u201cMistakes are costly,\u201d said Raghavan Srinivasan, senior director of global marketing at Seagate, which makes more disk drives than any other manufacturer. \u201cIf there are any anomalies, we\u2019re going to end up with poor yield later on, and we wouldn\u2019t know that until the long process is completed.\u201d\nTo combat that, Seagate is using GPU-powered AI and machine learning to perform anomaly detection of recording head slider images so it can spot potential problems sooner.\u00a0\nA Solution Born from Partnership\nAt first, Seagate searched for a product that could help with image-based anomaly detection in a high-yield manufacturing environment, but there was nothing commercially available. The company started talking with NVIDIA and Hewlett Packard Enterprise about the business problem.\nThe first step the companies took was to get an idea of the amount of data in play. Bringing this idea to life for a single factory would require the ability to process 17 million images a day, and to perform inference at 20 positions per second.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a [Boeing] 747 flying inches from the ground at 100 times the speed of sound,\u201d said Srinivasan.\nOver the course of a year, the companies built a solution that could capture and analyze images of drive heads that are just molecules from the surface of the spinning disk.\nSeagate deployed this solution in a machine vision defect inspection system used in hard disk read-and-write head manufacturing in one of Seagate\u2019s factory sites and is planning to scale the solution to other sites.\nBecause the anomaly patterns in question were constantly changing, rules-based AI was not an option. A deep learning approach was needed.\nWhat\u2019s more, Seagate knew the cost of bandwidth to move so much data to and from the factory would be prohibitive, so it developed a parallel reference architecture called Seagate Edge RX. This architecture establishes each factory as a computing \u201cedge,\u201d enabling the inference process to occur on the factory floor, using lighter-weight computing resources.\nOngoing training of the deep learning model occurs offline and is performed by data scientists, who then deliver updated models.\u00a0\nPossibilities Fueled by Results\nAs this technology becomes incorporated into all of Seagate\u2019s manufacturing processes,\nSeagate expects to see up to a 20 percent reduction in cleanroom investments, a 10 percent reduction in manufacturing throughput time, and up to a 300 percent return on investment from improved efficiency and better quality.\nSrinivasan said there\u2019s every indication that the project will ultimately yield significant improvements in quality, providing plenty of juice for expanding the effort to all of Seagate\u2019s manufacturing facilities.\nIt\u2019s not lost on Seagate that none of this would\u2019ve been possible without technologies from NVIDIA and HPE. These include rugged HPE Edgeline systems with NVIDIA T4 GPUs for data acquisition and real-time AI inferencing at the factory floor, and HPE Apollo systems with NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs for AI training. The NVIDIA EGX platform runs on these systems and allows enterprises to securely deploy and manage AI workloads at the edge or in the data center.\n\u201cNVIDIA has become synonymous with AI and deep learning, and being able to provide the process behind it,\u201d said Srinivasan.\nSeagate sees a lot of potential to take this work in a variety of directions. For now, the company is focused on rolling out the smart manufacturing platform to all of its manufacturing sites. It also plans to explore how the solution can impact other manufacturing processes. Down the line, Seagate will explore predictive maintenance of process tools based on IoT sensor-based logging.\nThe good news for other manufacturers is that Seagate doesn\u2019t want to keep all of this innovation to itself. The company has published the Seagate Edge RX parallel reference architecture to give other manufacturers a jump-start in building similar image anomaly detection solutions in their own manufacturing environments.\n\u201cWe want to move the conversation forward,\u201d said Srinivasan. \u201cWe see there are a lot more opportunities to improve overall manufacturing if you put data to work.\u201d\nLearn more about Seagate\u2019s work with NVIDIA in an on-demand talk on AI on EGX: Innovations and Lessons Learned from a Production Deployment Across Global Manufacturing Sites available now with a free registration to\u00a0GTC Digital.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | RoboticsTags: Embedded Computing | GTC 2020 | GTC Digital | Industrial and Manufacturing | NVIDIA EGX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Minecraft with RTX brings fully path-traced rendering, physically-based materials, and NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 to Minecraft, delivering bleeding-edge visual fidelity and realism that can be experienced on all GeForce RTX GPUs.\nTo demonstrate the full capabilities of Minecraft with RTX\u2019s new technologies, which deliver unbelievable sights with jaw-dropping, previously-impossible-to-achieve effects, we have worked with Minecrafters to create 6 stunning Creator Worlds, downloadable for free from the in-game Minecraft Marketplace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of Minecraft with ray tracing are astounding \u2013 realistic hard and soft shadows are seen everywhere; global illumination realistically lights the world, with that light filling interiors through windows and gaps in the terrain; illuminated blocks and other light sources cast pixel-perfect lighting; reflections are seen on all reflective surfaces and blocks, with a level of fidelity far surpassing that of screen space reflections; light reflects, refracts and scatters through water, ice, stained glass, and other transparencies; and atmospheric effects occur naturally, resulting in high quality volumetric fog, and pixel-perfect god rays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow To Download and Play The Minecraft with RTX Beta\nMicrosoft and Mojang are operating the Minecraft with RTX beta via the Xbox Insider program, as they do with all other Minecraft betas, enabling them to collect and collate feedback, and automatically share updates. To join there are few steps, though it\u2019s all easy-peasy if you follow our guide below.\nFirst, ensure your system meets the minimum system requirements:\n\nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060, or better\nCPU: Intel Core i5, or equivalent, or better\nRAM: 8GB, or more\nStorage: 2GB (Game, plus all worlds and resource packs)\nOperating System: Windows 10 x64\n\nNext, download and install the latest Windows 10 updates, followed by our Minecraft with RTX Game Ready Driver, which delivers day-0 optimizations and performance improvements for the beta, and is required for the use of NVIDIA DLSS 2.0. Also, ensure you own a copy of Minecraft for Windows 10, as that is needed for participation in the beta program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we proceed further, there are a couple of things to note if you\u2019ve played Minecraft Bedrock on Windows 10 before now:\n\nAny world you open while participating in the Minecraft with RTX Beta will not be available to be opened in other Minecraft for Windows 10 betas on the Insider program, the full non-beta version of Minecraft with RTX that\u2019s launching at a later date, or the Java version of Minecraft. We therefore recommend you make copies and backups of all worlds you wish to play in the Minecraft with RTX Beta, so you can restore them at a later date in other versions of Minecraft.\nYou may need to uninstall Minecraft and/or the current Xbox Insider Minecraft Windows 10 Bedrock beta, in order to download the Minecraft with RTX beta when you opt to participate in the new beta.  \n\nPlease back up any worlds you wish to keep before signing up to the new beta, or uninstalling old versions of the game. Once your worlds migrate over to the Minecraft with RTX beta, you will not be able to go back to the previous version of your worlds.\nMinecraft saved worlds can be found in: %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Packages\\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\LocalState\\games\\com.mojang\\minecraftWorlds\u00a0and/or %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\LocalState\\games\\com.mojang\\minecraftWorlds, depending on the versions of the game you\u2019ve used in the past.\nEach folder within the minecraftWorlds directory is a game world. Please save it somewhere on your PC that is not within the Minecraft directory. You can also export worlds directly from Minecraft to your PC or laptop\u2019s desktop by hitting the \"Edit\" pencil icon. Go to Play > click the Edit icon > scroll down on the new screen, press the \"Export World\" button. \nAll good? Let\u2019s sign up to the Minecraft with RTX Beta and get you into the game:\n\nInstall the free Xbox Insider Hub app from the Windows 10 Store, but please note, Microsoft requires participants to be at least 18 years old to enroll as an Xbox Insider\nPress the big \u201cJoin\u201d button when prompted, and follow any subsequent steps to enroll in the Insider program (if you\u2019re already participating in the Xbox Insider program and Minecraft beta program, please scroll down for the steps you\u2019ll require)\nOnce enrolled, click on the box icon on the top left of the app\u2019s window, highlighted in our image below, to access \u201cInsider Content\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.

Further info will pop up - once you\u2019ve read and accepted the terms, click \u201cAccept\u201d\n7. The system will work its magic for a few moments, but once done you\u2019ll be back on the screen from step 5, and will now instead see buttons saying \u201cManage\u201d and \u201cSee In Store\u201d\n8. Click \u201cManage\u201d and a new pop up will appear, giving you the choice of which Minecraft beta to participate in. If \u201cMinecraft for Windows 10 RTX Beta\u201d isn\u2019t already selected, click it, then click \u201cDone\u201d. And if you ever wish to leave the beta and return to the publicly-available version of Minecraft for Windows 10, click \u201cUnenroll\u201d followed by \u201cDone\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. If you have automatic Windows Store updates enabled, Minecraft will automatically update to the latest available Minecraft with RTX Beta build. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be prompted to download the build when you try to load the beta\n10. Please note, this is a beta and there may be bugs. If you encounter any, please send Microsoft and Mojang detailed feedback here.\nIf you\u2019re already participating in a Minecraft for Windows 10 beta, and are a member of the Xbox Insider program, follow these instructions instead:\n\nOpen the Xbox Insider Hub app\nInside the app, click on the open box icon on the upper left to navigate to Insider Content\nOn the Insider Content screen, click on the Minecraft for Windows 10 beta program you\u2019ve already joined\nClick \u201cManage\u201d on the new screen\nSelect the Minecraft with RTX Beta and click \u201cDone\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. If you have automatic Windows Store updates enabled, Minecraft will automatically update to the latest available Minecraft with RTX Beta build. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be prompted to download the build when you try to load the beta.\nCongratulations, you now have the Minecraft with RTX Beta installed on your GeForce RTX PC or laptop!\nPlease note, this is an ongoing beta with a list of known issues - should you discover new ones, please send Microsoft and Mojang detailed feedback here.\nNow, download the 6 free custom-made, path-traced, PBR texture-enhanced Creator Worlds from the Minecraft Marketplace, by searching for \u201cRTX\u201d (all RTX-capable worlds in the Marketplace are also tagged with a special RTX badge).\nThese Creator Worlds are designed to showcase the potential of Minecraft with RTX, and to demonstrate the new possibilities and techniques you can apply to your own creations.\nOnce you\u2019ve got them installed, load Minecraft from your Windows 10 start menu, click Play, and load one of the ray-traced worlds.\nIf you wish to change your fullscreen resolution, you\u2019ll need to change your desktop resolution in Windows, and in windowed mode you\u2019ll need to resize the window as you would any other.\nFor optimum performance, we recommend playing in fullscreen mode at 1920x1080 with the ray tracing chunk distance set to 8, though on more powerful machines, and less performance-intensive worlds, your CPU and GPU may allow you to crank up the chunk distance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinecraft with RTX Creator Worlds Demonstrate The Power of Path Tracing\nTo spark your imaginations, and to demonstrate Minecraft with RTX\u2019s capabilities, we\u2019ve partnered with Minecraft creators from around the planet to bring 6 Creative, Adventure and Survival worlds to the beta, each enhanced with physically-based textures, that you can download and play for free.\nWorld: Aquatic Adventure RTX\nCreator: Dr_Bond\nType: Adventure\nDownload From: Minecraft Marketplace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLose yourself in this serene underwater world from Dr_Bond, who\u2019s been creating Minecraft worlds and sculptures since 2013.

What made ray tracing so cool was being able to properly configure materials to interact with lighting in a realistic way that helps bring out the expectations of how the material would really look. Ray tracing will allow map makers and builders to highlight points of interest in their maps, using light to draw the eye.\u201d \u2013 RazzleberryFox, CEO of Razzleberries\nWorld: Crystal Palace RTX\nCreator: GeminiTay\nType: Survival Spawn\nDownload From: Minecraft Marketplace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA fantasy castle lies abandoned \u2013 explore the Crystal Palace to discover its secrets, find treasure, and defend the village.

You now have access to the most powerful building tool, light. Using this light to create meaningful scenes and beautiful maps is so incredible. You get to think about the shadow, the rays, where your windows will be, and how the colors will interact. These are things that previously were not thought about nearly enough in the game!\nRay tracing brings Minecraft up a level. The game currently has a very iconic look to it, and without disrupting this, RTX has managed to add a level of depth and detail that I previously couldn't have even imagined. This allows us to think about the way we create in the game differently. Map designers are going to love this.\u201d \u2013 GeminiTay\nWorld: Imagination Island RTX\nCreator: BlockWorks\nType: Adventure\nDownload From: Minecraft Marketplace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockWorks was founded 7 years ago by a group of Minecraft builders who met online. They connected over their passion for designing and building in Minecraft, taking the game to its limits as they strove to build ever bigger and more beautiful projects. Now, they have a team with members from all over the world, each bringing their own unique experiences and backgrounds into their collaborative build projects, the latest of which is Imagination Island RTX, an interactive theme park filled with easter eggs and 4 distinct lands to explore, further enhanced by custom PBR textures made by the Blockworks crew.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRay tracing shone a new light on building Minecraft environments, quite literally! It really expanded the creative possibilities of the game, and changed the way we think about what a great Minecraft build is.

It\u2019s all fairly straightforward, but before you convert please ensure you backup your worlds.\nOnce you\u2019re up and running, send us screenshots and videos of your world on social media using #Minecraft and #RTXON for a chance to be featured in a Community Showcase (and to win some Minecoins). More details below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccelerate Performance With NVIDIA DLSS 2.0\nThe Minecraft with RTX Beta features one of our newest technologies, NVIDIA DLSS 2.0. This is a revolutionary real-time rendering technique that accelerates performance via AI-based super resolution \u2013 the process of rendering fewer pixels and then using AI to construct sharp, higher resolution images that run at much faster frame rates.\nPowered by dedicated AI processors called Tensor Cores, available exclusively on GeForce RTX GPUs, NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 is a new and improved, critically-acclaimed version of this technique, used to great effect in several titles, and now Minecraft, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-game, go to Settings --> Advanced Video, and switch on \u201cUpscaling\u201d to enable DLSS 2.0, if it isn\u2019t already active. When enabled, performance instantly increases by up to 1.7x at 1920x1080, and by up to 3x at 4K in the Minecraft with RTX Beta.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 1920x1080, DLSS is automatically set to \u201cQuality\u201d mode. At 2560x1440, \u201cBalanced\u201d, and at 4K, \u201cPerformance\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 2.0 enables smooth frame rates for GeForce RTX 2060 and higher GPUs. Note: Minecraft with RTX is in beta and performance will likely see further optimization between beta and official release. Performance will vary from world to world based on scene complexity\nMost importantly, DLSS achieves these performance gains while keeping image quality comparable to native resolutions. Let\u2019s look at a couple of examples.\nIn both, captured at 1920x1080, NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 delivers equivalent clarity and detail, while running substantially faster, giving gamers a smoother, more performant experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 2.0 can also improve image quality in certain cases, further improving your experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinecraft with RTX World Sweepstakes: Share Your Best Creations For A Chance To Win\nOnce you\u2019ve started playing the Minecraft with RTX Beta, you\u2019ll have the chance to win:\n\nGeForce RTX 2080 Ti graphics cards\nDigital codes worth 1600 Minecoins\nMinecraft Creeper Mega Bobbles\nMinecraft Zombie Plushes\nSteam Digital Gift Cards worth $50\n\nTo enter, download any or all of the Minecraft with RTX beta worlds and share high-quality screenshots or videos of your Minecraft with RTX beta experience with ray tracing on to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, or our GeForce forums, and use the #Minecraft and #RTXON in the copy, title or description.\nFor extra chances to win, follow the GeForce social media channels and complete the Minecraft with RTX prompts \u2013 for example, \u201cbuild a famous place from around the world using ray tracing in Minecraft with RTX, and share screenshots or videos of your creation with #RTXON and #Minecraft.\u201d\nYou can enter as many times as you like and complete any or all of our prompts for extra chances to win. For full terms and conditions, please head here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Your Own Physically Based Rendering (PBR) Textures\nTo take full advantage of Minecraft with RTX\u2019s path-traced renderer, we\u2019ve added a physically based materials pipeline that enables the creation of block textures with real-world properties. For example, blocks and textures can feature any degree of reflectivity, and will realistically mirror or reflect surrounding detail using path tracing, for pixel-perfect detail. The surface of gravel and water feels more natural and detailed. And once flat light sources from Glowstone now emits from the individual glowing specks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of the new hi-res (1024x1024) and vanilla derivative/low res (16x16) PBR textures applied to Minecraft\u2019s blocks in Minecraft with RTX\nThe Minecraft with RTX Beta Creator Worlds include creator-made PBR resource packs. These upgrade textures to follow the Physically Based Rendering pipeline and are optimized for maximum performance and detail.\nIn addition to these worlds, NVIDIA is releasing four resource packs. Two, HD Decorative Resource Pack and HD Foundational Resource Pack, are created by NVIDIA. The others, Muddle RTX and RazzleCore RTX, are created by Razzleberries. With these four packs, you will be able to enjoy both high resolution textures (1024x1024) and low resolution textures (8x8 or 16x16) with PBR capabilities.\nIf, however, you want to make your own PBR textures, or even a complete PBR resource pack, we\u2019ve written a PBR texturing how-to guide with step by step instructions. Check it out here, and watch our GTC presentation for even more info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinecraft with RTX\u2019s Path-Traced Effects, In-Depth\nAs we\u2019ve mentioned, Minecraft with RTX\u2019s worlds are almost entirely path-traced, with lighting and effects featuring unprecedented levels of detail, for the very best image quality possible. If you yearn to know more, and love to geek out about under the hood tech, here\u2019s a rundown of all the major effects.\nGlobal Illumination\nGames are traditionally illuminated by precomputed lightmaps, Image-Based Light Probes, Spherical Harmonics, and Reflective Shadow Maps, plus artist-placed lights to help force illumination where the aforementioned techniques fail. And while the results look great, the techniques used have several shortcomings, the biggest of which being that dynamic lighting fails to bounce or illuminate beyond the area that the light hit.\nFor example, imagine a dark room with bright light shining through a window. With traditional techniques, everything that is directly hit by the light is illuminated, but the illuminated areas themselves do not bounce light, and do not illuminate surrounding game elements, when in reality they would.\nWith path tracing, we can accurately model the dynamic indirect diffuse lighting reflected by one or more indirect bounces off of surfaces in the scene, and have it interact and interplay with other ray-traced effects. Imagine, for instance, sunlight beaming into a castle through multicolored stained-glass window blocks, refracting, illuminating all corners of the room, reflecting off the shiny marble floor, and brightening surrounding detail, causing new contact hardening shadows to be cast from objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderground, light beams in, illuminating the darkness, but only to a point - once the light dissipates, make sure you\u2019re carrying a torch or the Creepers will get you! (click to load an interactive RTX ON-OFF comparison)\nThe results are jaw-dropping, and give us a preview of how all games will eventually be rendered.\nReflections\nIn Minecraft with RTX, path tracing adds ray traced reflections throughout each world, allowing us to reflect every detail, every mob and NPC, and every other visual effect, for pixel-perfect reflections. And using the PBR texturing system, we can vary the level of reflectivity on different blocks, allowing for a wide range of looks, giving us perfect mirrors, smooth water-based reflections, and surfaces with rough and coarse reflectivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflectivity helps bring Dr_Bond\u2019s Aquatic Adventure to life, adding reflections to water surfaces, and bouncing light from block to block, illuminating the palace (click to load an interactive RTX ON-OFF comparison)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside, PBR textures subtly reflect light from wall to wall, further improving image quality and immersion (click to load an interactive RTX ON-OFF comparison)\nWith path-traced reflections, not only do you see more detail and information, you experience improved lighting, realism, immersion, and visual fidelity.\nShadows\nWith our unified path tracing lighting model in Minecraft with RTX, every aspect of each world realistically and naturally casts shadows, and is shaded and darkened by shadows cast upon them. Shadows soften and harden depending on the distance from the shadow caster, mobs, NPCs and new blocks block light and cast new shadows, and newly-placed light sources (torches, illuminated blocks, et cetera) cast new light that creates new dynamic shadows, and affects existing shadows and shading. Most impressive of all, every single leaf in a tree\u2019s leaf block casts its own individual shadow, adding truly wondrous shadow detail to your worlds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith ray tracing enabled, BlockWorks\u2019 Imagination Island is naturally shadowed, and each shadow has its own intensity and length, as well as realistic contact hardening and contact softening properties (click to load an interactive RTX ON-OFF comparison)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in Razzleberry\u2019s Of Temples and Totems, individual leaves in leaf blocks cast shadows as god rays pierce the forest\u2019s canopy.\nPer-Pixel Emissive Lighting\nAll torches and light-emitting blocks in Minecraft with RTX have been upgraded with per pixel emissive lighting. This enables each pixel of these items to emit uniquely colored light that affects their surroundings, best demonstrated by our special disco blocks that constantly cycle through colors on an 8x8 grid on each face of each block:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn your worlds, torches will be one of the most noticeable beneficiaries of per-pixel emissive lighting, realistically illuminating their surroundings with fire colored lighting that subtly varies as each torch burns and flickers. And of course, emitted light will result in new shadows being cast, new reflections being seen, and other path-traced effects being rendered or affected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockWorks\u2019 Imagination Island makes extensive use of emissive blocks to add mood-setting lighting to their rides and attractions (click to load an interactive RTX ON-OFF comparison)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmissive lava and fire blocks cast appropriate light throughout environments, leading to the creation of new shadows and the application of other ray-traced effects, for even better image quality (click to load interactive RTX ON-OFF comparisons)\nAtmospheric Effects\nPath tracing introduces new atmospheric effects to Minecraft, enabling players to build and experience worlds with mist and fog, illuminated by sunlight and moonlight, or the occasional torch or lantern, as seen in movies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMist and god rays add to the atmospherics of this idyllic area in GeminiTay\u2019s Crystal Palace Creator World (click to load an interactive RTX ON-OFF comparison)\nFurthermore, path tracing delivers pixel-perfect dynamic god rays that move and change in step with the sun and moon\u2019s position, and are affected by world geometry and the things you do and build.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGod rays are visible above ground and in ocean depths\nTransparency Reflection, Refraction and Scattering\nAs path tracing follows each individual light ray until it dissipates, we can apply immersive and realistic reflection, refraction and scattering to transparencies, such as stained glass, water, and ice. Using these features, you can create ice palaces illuminated exclusively by the sun and moon, and cathedrals with stained glass murals that fill the interior with colored light as the sun beams through.\nThese naturally occurring effects can noticeably affect your perception when looking through bodies of water:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to load an interactive RTX ON-OFF comparison\nAnd we\u2019ve even modelled Snell\u2019s Window, \u201ca phenomenon by which an underwater viewer sees everything above the surface through a cone of light of width of about 96 degrees. This phenomenon is caused by refraction of light entering water, and is governed by Snell's Law. The area outside Snell's window will either be completely dark or show a reflection of underwater objects by total internal reflection.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to load an interactive RTX ON-OFF comparison\nPath tracing\u2019s possibilities in Minecraft with RTX are endless, but if you want a few ideas check out the Creator Worlds mentioned earlier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinecraft with RTX Beta: Download and Play Now\nIf you\u2019ve got a GeForce RTX PC or laptop, get in-game now and experience next-generation visuals today.

This free-to-play title features dynamic and frantic battle royale gameplay with up to 150 players on the largest Call of Duty battleground ever.\nCall of Duty: Warzone puts a new spin on massive combat arenas by taking the difficulty away from looting, while giving you new missions to complete during the course of the battle that reward aggressive play and map traversal. And the fight doesn\u2019t end once you die. Even if your teammates are unable to revive you, you\u2019re placed in the Gulag where you compete one-on-one with another fallen combatant for a chance to respawn with your squad. Whether you are in Verdansk or in the Gulag - high FPS unlocks your potential and increases your chances of hitting that game winning shot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe firefights in Call of Duty: Warzone can end in the blink of an eye, so making sure you have every possible advantage is vital. Whether you\u2019re a seasoned pro or a newcomer to the battle royale genre, high FPS gameplay grants you several benefits. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy High Frames Per Second (FPS) Matters when Playing Call of Duty: Warzone\nSmoother Animations:\nIn Call of Duty: Warzone, player movement is fast. Whether you are holding the angle or peeking a corner, high FPS paired with a high refresh rate display provides improved clarity and comprehension when it really matters. Additionally, the smoother motion provided by the increased frame rate allows you more opportunities to correct your aim - making it easier to track those targets as they sprint by.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReduced Distracting Effects\nIn the heat of the moment, being reactive is critical. Sifting through distracting effects like tearing or ghosting takes precious milliseconds and can impact your ability to perceive the situation correctly. High FPS on a high Hz display significantly reduces these distracting effects by decreasing the size of the ghost trail and tear displacement. Reducing distracting effects ensures you are actually aiming at the right thing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Players Earlier:\nWhen milliseconds matter, seeing your opponent a split second earlier can give you an advantage in a fight. Higher FPS reduces the overall system latency of your computer which means your actions and the state of the game are displayed on your monitor faster. Lower system latency helps improve your reaction times and makes input feel snappier - critical for a fast paced game like Call of Duty: Warzone.\nFor more information on why high FPS matters, check out our in-depth technical article, \u201cWhy Does High FPS Matter For Esports?\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to optimize Call of Duty: Warzone\u2019s Settings\nUsing competitive settings can boost your FPS. We found the following settings combination from Prosettings.net in conjunction with image sharpening in the NVIDIA control panel to be the best combination for competitive play. Achieving higher FPS can depend on your in game situation, the version of the game, and the total PC configuration.\u00a0 Competitive settings also come with an image quality tradeoff: shadows will be less realistic and a bit blockier, less accurate reflections, and the quality of explosions will be reduced.\nIf you are less concerned about image quality and still want to maximize FPS, let\u2019s first dive into the Call of Duty: Warzone settings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways remember to set Fullscreen mode as it reduces system latency. Some of these settings are personal preference, so tweak them to find what you like! One thing to note, is that the render scale has been reduced to 90%. This will result in a small performance boost in trade for a slight loss in image quality. However, turning on image sharpening in the control panel nearly negates any image quality loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to turn on image sharpening in the NVIDIA Control Panel: \n1. Open NVCPL (right-click the desktop, select NVIDIA Control Panel) 2. Select \u201cManage 3D settings\u201d 3. Select \u201cProgram Settings\u201d\na. Select Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (if you don\u2019t see it in the list, untick \u201cShow only programs found on this computer\u201d or select \u201cAdd\u201d)\n4. Turn on Image sharpening with default settings, using our latest GeForce Game Ready Driver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Once you are done, apply your settings and restart the game.\nUsing the settings outlined above, you should see a nice boost in FPS the next time you drop in. The framerates you achieve will vary depending on the components in your machine, so be sure to tune your hardware for maximum performance by killing unnecessary services, closing perf-sapping programs, and overclocking your CPU, RAM and GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrames Win Games\nAfter digging into the benefits that we\u2019ve outlined above, we spent time studying K/D ratios in both Fortnite and PUBG to see their correlation to high-FPS gaming. If you want a deep dive into what we found, you can read our full study on playing battle royale titles at high FPS.\nAs you can see in the chart below, whether you are a weekend warrior or an aspiring professional, there is a correlation between better performance and higher FPS regardless of how much time is spent playing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen all of the available information is looked at as a whole, we can conclude that there is a strong correlation for higher FPS helping maximize your potential in battle royale games like Call of Duty: Warzone.\nFor more on High FPS gaming, check out our FramesWinGames page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The number of viewers is at an all-time high, meaning streamers are enjoying their highest view counts ever. Professional sports are transforming into virtual Players Leagues. DJs and musicians are streaming their performances to fans around the world. And unsurprisingly, streaming apps like OBS, Streamlabs and XSplit are seeing record downloads.\nIf you want to join in on the streaming fun, we\u2019ve put together this beginner\u2019s guide full of tips, tricks, and setup guides to help you get started and give your audience the best viewing experience possible.\nHere at NVIDIA, we\u2019re working on some exciting AI features for streaming that combine to create the\u00a0RTX Broadcast Engine. The features are still in development, but you can contribute by providing audio and video samples for our AI to train.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat hardware do I use?\nThe quickest and easiest way to get started is to give it a shot with what you got. Play around with the PC you have at home and have friends give you feedback on your stream quality.\nMost gamers realize pretty quickly how big of an impact streaming can have on system performance if you don\u2019t have the right hardware. You may need to lower graphics settings if your framerate drops and gameplay starts to chug.\nIf you have a GeForce GPU, you have access to the NVIDIA Encoder (NVENC) to encode with minimal system impact. By shifting the encoding to a dedicated part of GeForce GPUs, you\u2019re able to play and stream (even on a laptop!) with maximum quality and performance. And there\u2019s a range of GeForce GPUs, from the capable and budget-friendly GeForce GTX 1650 Super up to the flagship GeForce RTX 2080 Ti.\nFor more on NVENC, check out the short video below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you need to update more than just your GPU, check out RTX Studio desktops and laptops, purpose-built for creators. They\u2019re perfect for the transition from work to play and create.\nIf you want to build or buy a custom PC, here are some recommendations on optimal system specs to meet different budgets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also head to PC Part Picker for awesome build and configuration guides specifically for streaming PCs.\nOnce you get the hang of streaming, upgrading your peripherals is next.\u00a0Typically, you\u2019ll want to look for:\n\nWebcam: A nice 1080p60 webcam will meet most streaming needs. The most popular one is the Logitech C920, but you can also check out their newly released StreamCam. There are 4K webcam options as well if you plan to stream at max resolution on YouTube.\nMicrophone: There are plenty of great headsets with built-in mics available from popular brands like Logitech, Corsair or Razer (to name a few). You can also get a standalone, higher-end microphone from Blue, Audio-Technica, Rode or Shure.\nLights: It\u2019s important to properly light the subject of a scene, but also to light the scene itself. You can use Elgato\u2019s Key Lights. If you like their aesthetic, RGB strips add a nice pop of color.\nGreenscreen: if you want to remove your background for privacy, or because you have a cool idea for a background, grab a greenscreen and apply a chroma key. Elgato has great portable greenscreen options.\nChair: This is often overlooked, but it\u2019s incredibly important to have a comfortable chair. It doesn\u2019t need to be a gaming chair, but make sure it has good ergonomics, like the Ikea Markus.\n\nNow that the hardware is in place, it\u2019s time to start setting up your stream for maximum quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat software do I use?\nLive streaming software has come a long way. Applications are now easier to use, and more efficient. We\u2019ve worked with the top ecosystem partners to help accelerate their solutions for GeForce GPUs, reducing the performance impact of streaming with NVENC to almost nothing.\nIf you have a GeForce GPU, you have access to GeForce Experience \u2014 a free software that makes starting your streaming journey easy.\nThere are also many excellent broadcast applications available for use that provide more advanced functionality. The most popular app is OBS Studio. You can also opt for the Streamlabs mod of OBS, which adds popular plugins and themes to OBS.\nIf you prefer a simple, guided experience to shepherd you into the world of streaming, Twitch Studio (if streaming to Twitch) and XSplit Gamecaster are great, easy-to-use solutions.\nOne notable alternative is Discord\u2019s new Go Live feature. It allows you to stream your gameplay to a Discord channel. This is a great way to start streaming, as you can test it out with a smaller group of friends or acquaintances in a private setting, and get the hang of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat settings do I use for my stream?\nFirst you\u2019ll want to choose your encoder. If you have a GeForce GPU, NVENC will provide higher quality streams, better performance (more FPS!) and reduce your CPU overhead. It also allows you to record at higher resolutions and higher frame rates.\nTo configure OBS Studio, follow the below video guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some detailed, step-by-step guides to configuring your stream for maximum performance and quality:\n\nOBS Studio NVENC Setup Guide\nStreamLabs NVENC Setup Guide\nXSplit Broadcaster NVENC Guide\n\nIf you\u2019re curious about how NVENC\u2019s quality compares to x264, NVENC on RTX GPUs is on par with x264 Medium, while the NVENC on GTX GPUs compares to x264 Faster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat artwork/overlays do I need?\nOverlays are transparent graphics that appear \u2018over\u2019 your gameplay and camera feed. We recommend using overlays to customize your channel and make it unique, and to help you start building an audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a high level, you will want to add these:\n\nWebcam Frame: Decorates your webcam outline.\nStream Alerts and Event Overlays: Animated notifications that appear on-screen when viewers interact with your stream.\nProfile Panels: Static graphics pinned to your Twitch profile, below your stream.\nStream Screens: Screens to show when your stream is about to start, Intermissions, or is Offline.\n\nOur friends at Visuals by Impulse have put together a comprehensive beginner\u2019s guide to overlays, with info on where to get overlays and how to set them up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOK, I\u2019m ready to stream. What do I do now?\nSetting everything up is just the beginning. What\u2019s important is what comes after: choosing what your stream will be about, your stream persona, what platform you\u2019ll be streaming to, setting up your channel correctly, and learning how to promote yourself. Whew!\nFor newcomers, the best advice is to stream what you love doing \u2014 your favorite game, a craft, etc. \u2014 and engage the community to see how it feels. Getting the hang of doing something and interacting with people through chat takes a bit of time. Then you can focus on adding more personality and shape to your stream.\nThere are plenty of great resources that explain this in more detail, so we\u2019ll leave this one to the experts:\n\nEposVox\nGaming Careers\nAlpha Gaming\nMuaaz\n\nIf you have a great streaming resource or favorite channel, share it below!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips for new streamers\n\nDon\u2019t use more than 75% of your upload bandwidth (e.g. If your upload speed is 10 Mbps, you should use 7.5 Mbps max). Check the setup guides above for directions on how to test your bandwidth.\nYour bandwidth determines the resolution you can output. Don\u2019t try to push 1080p unless you can stream at 8 Mbps or higher. You know how bad a Netflix show looks when you have little bandwidth? That\u2019s what will happen to your stream if you don\u2019t have a high enough bitrate to support your target resolution. Instead, use a lower resolution (i.e. 720p) and your stream will look a LOT better. Check the setup guides!\nIf you\u2019re streaming games, make sure your version of Windows is 1903 or above (Start > Settings > Windows Specifications > Version #), and turn Game Mode on in Windows. This will help avoid lag in your stream.\nIf you\u2019re trying to stream a demanding game, know that your system now needs to do two things: game and encode. You want to ensure that it can handle both. If you\u2019re encoding on NVENC, you can just run your app in high priority mode (e.g. in OBS Studio or Streamlabs just run the app as Administrator, in XSplit Broadcaster toggle it in the settings) and that will ensure your stream remains smooth.\nTest your stream. Record yourself with the settings you\u2019re going to use and check it out. Stream by yourself for 5-10 minutes and view your own recording.\n\n\u2026 and that\u2019s it! We hope this was helpful and that it aids you on your journey to everlasting streaming stardom.

Like other advanced learning tools such as active learning, unsupervised learning takes an intelligent approach to training to lessen the burden on human annotators.\nAn autonomous vehicle must learn from a massive amount of data \u2014 measured in the petabytes, or millions of gigabytes \u2014 to safely drive without a human at the wheel. Even lower levels of autonomy, such as level 2+ and level 3 AI-assisted driving, require intensive training to operate effectively.\nEmbedded in this massive amount of data are the images of pedestrians, cars, signs and other objects in the millions of frames. For supervised learning, all these must be labeled, so that deep neural networks can learn to recognize them on their own. It\u2019s an incredibly expensive, time- and labor-intensive process, making it difficult to develop and iterate new capabilities quickly.\nHelm.ai is an NVIDIA Inception member and uses the high performance of NVIDIA data center GPUs to run its unsupervised learning techniques to train its self-driving algorithms. The startup is also relying on NVIDIA inside the vehicle, running its self-driving software on NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Xavier.\nRemoving the Training Wheels\nUnsupervised learning is a method of training neural networks without labeled data. It\u2019s an open area of AI research and comes in a variety of flavors, with some previous approaches aiming to identify new patterns in data or pre-processing a pool of data.\nHelm.ai is working to expand the scope of unsupervised learning as well as mathematical modeling to efficiently scale autonomous vehicle training.\nRather than pursue traditional approaches, the startup is looking to master unsupervised learning to remove the need for large-scale fleet data and armies of human annotators. The result is scalable AI software that can achieve autonomous driving capabilities on an improved timeline and budget.\n\u201cWe identified some key challenges that we felt weren\u2019t being addressed with the traditional approaches, in particular regarding the scalability and accuracy of AI software,\u201d said Vladislav Voroninski, founder and CEO of Helm.ai. \u201cWe built some prototypes early on that made us believe that we can actually take this all the way. Our technology leverages cutting edge applied mathematics to unlock the full potential of deep learning for deploying safe autonomous systems at scale.\u201d\nInnovating with High-Performance Compute\nTo achieve these breakthroughs in AI training, Helm.ai is relying on industry-leading computing in the data center and in the vehicle.\nNVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs in the data center make it possible to process petabytes of data without experiencing costly roadblocks, enabling advanced learning techniques like Helm.ai\u2019s.\nOnce trained, the startup\u2019s level 2+ self-driving software can then be tested in the vehicle using the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Xavier AI compute platform. DRIVE AGX Xavier delivers 30 trillion operations per second for level 2+ and level 3 automated driving.\nAt its core is the Xavier system-on-a-chip, the first-ever production auto-grade SoC, which incorporates six different types of processors for high-performance, energy-efficient AI compute.\nWith more accurate and cost-effective AI training, Helm.ai and NVIDIA are enabling the industry to safely deploy transportation technologies that will transform the way people and goods move.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: Inception | NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Developers often amass data from different sources \u2014 but central hosting of medical data is often not feasible due to patient data privacy policies.\nFederated learning addresses this challenge, enabling different institutions to collaborate on AI model development without sharing sensitive clinical data with each other. The goal is to end up with more generalizable models that perform well on any dataset, instead of an AI biased by the patient demographics or imaging equipment of one specific radiology department.\n\u201cFederated learning presents an opportunity for healthcare organizations worldwide to work together without compromising on the data security of patient records,\u201d said Jayashree Kalpathy-Cramer, of Partners HealthCare, a collaborator on the project. \u201cWith this methodology, we can collectively raise the bar for AI tools in medicine.\u201d\nResearchers from the American College of Radiology, Brazilian imaging center Diagnosticos da America, Partners HealthCare, The Ohio State University and Stanford Medicine came together for a federated learning proof of concept. In under six weeks, each institution used federated learning to improve a 2D mammography classification model, achieving better predictive power on their local dataset than the original neural network trained on their local data alone.\nBy boosting model performance, federated learning enabled improved breast density classification from mammograms, which could lead to better breast cancer risk assessment.\nRecognizing Risk\nWhen radiologists analyze mammograms, they look for tumors, but also assess breast tissue density \u2014 a measure of the fibrous and glandular tissue that appears on a woman\u2019s mammogram. Scans are categorized into one of four classifications: fatty, scattered, heterogeneously dense, and extremely dense.\nEven if doctors don\u2019t find a tumor on a standard screening mammogram, they\u2019re required to report breast density assessment to patients. That\u2019s because women with high breast density \u2014 roughly half of American women between the ages of 40 and 74 \u2014 have a four to five times greater risk of developing breast cancer.\nHigher quality tools for classifying breast density from mammograms could help doctors better assess patients\u2019 cancer risk.\nThe original mammography classification model used for this proof of concept was provided by Partners HealthCare, and was developed using the NVIDIA Clara Train SDK on NVIDIA GPUs. Each site then retrained the model using the Clara Federated Learning SDK, without any data being transferred between sites.\n\u201cDeep learning models are, by nature, constrained by the size and diversity of their training datasets,\u201d said Mike Tilkin, chief information officer at the American College of Radiology, whose team developed its models on NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs. \u201cThe Clara Federated Learning software was critical in improving the performance of the breast density classification model, without any sharing of patient data.\u201d\nForging Ahead with Federated Learning\nEach of the five participating organizations contributed a 2D mammography dataset to the project. Combined, there were nearly 100,000 scans for training.\nRather than needing to pool these scans into a single location, each institution set up a secure, in-house server for its data. One centralized server held the global deep neural network, and each participating radiology department got a copy to train on their own dataset.\nOnce completing a predetermined number of passes through their own training data, each client automatically sent partial model weights back to the federated server. The server aggregated these partial weights and sent updated weights back to each client.\nAfter several rounds of this weight exchange, each participating client site ended up with a better performing model using learnings from the aggregate dataset of all of five participating institutions \u2014 without ever seeing any data except their own.\nThis improved performance wasn\u2019t just limited to each institution\u2019s local dataset \u2014 it persisted when the model was tested on data from other participants\u2019 sites. In this way, without ever moving clinical information out of the client\u2019s data center, each institution benefited from other participants training the same model on their own datasets.\n\u201cWe saw a significant jump in our AI model\u2019s performance using federated learning,\u201d said Richard White, chair of radiology at Ohio State. \u201cThis preliminary result is a promising indicator that training on decentralized data can set a new standard for automated classification models.\u201d\nThe university\u2019s researchers used the NVIDIA DGX-1 server for training and inference of its AI models.\nFurther research using NVIDIA Clara Federated Learning includes an effort to develop generalizable models that achieve high accuracy on any dataset, as well as a project applying federated learning to segmentation models.\nTo get started with NVIDIA Clara, download the latest Clara Train SDK.\nImage by Bill Branson.

Its call to help fight the coronavirus on March 15 had amassed enough donations of spare cycles on home computers to create a crowd-sourced exascale supercomputer.\nIn just 10 days, supporters had downloaded the group\u2019s software on hundreds of thousands of home PCs to help crack the code on COVID-19.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty amazing experience,\u201d said Greg Bowman, director of Folding@home, an all-volunteer team of researchers. Bowman\u2019s also an associate professor at the Washington University School of Medicine, in St. Louis, home to one of 11 labs worldwide that keep the Folding@home network humming.\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to have the chance to try everything we can think of in parallel to maximize the chances of having an impact on the current pandemic,\u201d he said.\nFolding@home celebrated breaking the exaflop barrier on Twitter.\nSupporters sheltering at home posted a virtual party of animations in response to the tweet that announced the news. Schoolkids in video clips danced on their desks, Top Gun heroes slapped high-fives, the Cookie Monster gobbled goodies, and a small army of Star Trek, Star Wars and anime characters whooped it up. Even an animated Simon Cowell offered a thumbs up.\nAt Folding@home, the leaderboard continues to rise. More than a million computers are now on the network that started the year with just 30,000.\nBowman estimates performance has surpassed 1.5 exaflops, fueled in part by more than 356,000 NVIDIA GPUs. The group\u2019s blog site will share more news soon, he said.\nIT managers who oversee large clusters can donate unused compute cycles to Folding@Home, too. A container now posted on NGC, NVIDIA\u2019s software registry, lets enterprises and supercomputing centers deploy and run the application with Docker and Singularity on rack-scale systems.\nThe container can run on any system, whether it uses GPUs or not. Clusters accelerated by NVIDIA GPUs are expected to run Folding@Home 40% faster automatically when the container is upgraded in the near future to support NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA software.\nSneak Peek of a COVID-19 Spike\nEven before it broke the exaflop barrier, researchers were posting eye-popping work. An animation of a coronavirus protein that infects healthy cells could suggest molecular targets for an anti-COVID drug or vaccine (see the image above).\nThe effort builds on the group\u2019s earlier experiments on the Ebola virus. It\u2019s part of its broad work exploring how proteins \u2013 a basic ingredient of living things including viruses \u2013 fold into 3D shapes to perform various functions.\nThe first snapshot of a coronavirus protein couldn\u2019t be captured with a simple smartphone selfie. Such scientific visualizations demand massive compute power to simulate near-atomic-level interactions.\nFlipping on an Exaflop\nThese days, computer scientists stack computer rooms the size of a couple tennis courts with servers to gnaw on big questions of science. The Summit system at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, currently the world\u2019s largest supercomputer, packs 27,648 NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs to deliver 148.6 petaflops on the HPL benchmark. The second-ranked Sierra system at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory also uses NVIDIA GPUs to crank out 94.6 petaflops.\nThe U.S. Department of Energy, which runs both systems, aims to switch on its first exascale system sometime in 2021. Arguably, the exascale era has already begun. Summit has racked up a handful milestones, including a 3.3 exaflops score running mixed-precision AI tasks.\nThat said, Folding@home gets kudos as the first crowd-sourced effort to assemble exascale horsepower.\nIt\u2019s a heady achievement. Imagine a billion people, each holding a billion calculators. If they all hit the equal sign at the same time, they\u2019d execute in one second a quintillion calculations. That\u2019s one exaflop.\nMany Ways You Can Help\nTrying to ride the tsunami of donations, Bowman told supporters over Twitter that researchers briefly scrambled for more servers to keep all the connected PCs fed.\n\u201cI hope I can speak for most people when I say this has given me something that I can contribute and has had a positive effect on my mental state,\u201d replied one backer.\n\u201cFolding has on and off heated the top floor of my house,\u201d quipped a computer specialist in the U.K.\nThe group continues to encourage users to donate time on their PCs with software they can download here. In turn, Folding@home makes data from its experiments publicly available on open general research sites and ones devoted to areas such as biology.\nTo accelerate its efforts, Folding@home recently announced a new batch of small molecule screening simulations that will help prioritize which molecules will be synthesized and assayed by the COVID Moonshot.\nFolding@home is one of many technology efforts formed to fight coronavirus.\nThe U.S. Department of Energy created the COVID-19 High Performance Computing Consortium with support from many tech companies and universities. The group will pool 16 supercomputers to deliver a combined 330 petaflops in part with help from more than 36,000 NVIDIA GPUs.\nSeparately, developers are already coding up projects in the #BuildforCOVID19 hackathon. Highlighted projects will be announced April 10.\nFor its part, NVIDIA is offering researchers a free 90-day license to its Parabricks software to accelerate the analysis of the coronavirus\u2019 genetic code.\nNote: Since this article was published, the Folding@Home initiative has amassed a total of more than 2.4 exaflops and currently targets one million users.\n\nAs promised, here is our first glimpse of the #COVID19 spike protein (aka the demogorgon) in action, courtesy of @foldingathome .

Coupled with its dedicated CPUs, Linode\u2019s Quadro RTX 6000 offering delivers the latest GPU technology to more end users, no matter where they are in the world.\nMeeting computing needs is complex because workloads are growing larger and they\u2019re increasingly overlapping. Quadro GPUs enable Linode to upgrade its cloud offerings and foster innovation for every user.\n\u201cOur customers need a high-performance, flexible GPU to handle their scientific workflows, graphics rendering and engineering cases,\u201d said Alejandro \u201cAlex\u201d Pe\u00f1a, research and development engineer at Linode. \u201cHigh performance computing and AI are no longer strictly enterprise or academic endeavors.\u201d\nWith Linode\u2019s Quadro offering, customers can deploy GPUs that are capable of handling a wide range of workloads and ensure GPU acceleration is easily accessible for all users.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX \u2013 Support for Every Workload\nLinode honed in on NVIDIA Quadro GPUs due to their impressive memory, versatility and performance. \u201cWe have incredibly stringent performance standards,\u201d said Pe\u00f1a. \u201cThe NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 was a real standout.\u201d\nThe Quadro RTX 6000 supports Linode\u2019s customers with powerful capabilities thanks to its Tensor Cores, RT Cores and CUDA, NVIDIA\u2019s parallel computing and programming platform. Its Turing architecture efficiently handles multiple tasks simultaneously to accelerate a variety of complex workloads, including graphics, deep learning, AI, rendering, simulations and ray tracing.\n\u201cNVIDIA\u2019s introduction of RT Cores really appealed to us because we wanted to ensure Linode could support a variety of parallel processing use cases,\u201d said Pe\u00f1a. \u201cNVIDIA RTX GPUs are highly agile and customizable and support extensive processing capabilities.\u201d\nHaving selected NVIDIA RTX, Linode\u2019s next step was to launch a pilot study in its Newark, New Jersey, data center. The pilot quickly reached maximum capacity, and soon plans were made to deploy NVIDIA RTX GPUs at more of Linode\u2019s 11 global data centers.\nEveryone Can Access Versatile GPUs on Demand\n\nWith NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 GPUs, the types of workloads users can run on Linode are virtually endless.\nThey can provision cloud instances in a way that allows them to easily choose the number of GPUs, number of CPU cores and the amount of RAM needed to accomplish specific workloads.\nWith Linode\u2019s RTX instances, everyone can take advantage of a commercial-grade GPU for as little as 30 minutes thanks to transparent pricing and easy deployment. While some Linode users are running multiple GPUs all day every day for months, others are only spinning them up for a few minutes to a couple of hours.\n\u201cFrom the start, Linode\u2019s mission has been to make computing more accessible to more people,\u201d said Pe\u00f1a. \u201cNVIDIA RTX GPUs enable us to provide an easier, affordable solution for scientists, artists and engineers to access significant parallel computing power for academic research, video rendering and AI.\u201d\nLearn more about NVIDIA RTX.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: Cloud Services | NVIDIA RTX | Quadro \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Last week, China gave us the green light. In addition to the U.S., E.U., and Mexico, all jurisdictions have approved our combination. I am thrilled to announce that today, April 27, 2020, NVIDIA and Mellanox are officially one company!\u00a0\nMellanox is now NVIDIA\u2019s networking brand, our networking business unit, and Israel is one of NVIDIA\u2019s most important technology centers, with 2,500 employees. The new NVIDIA has a much larger footprint in data center computing, end-to-end and full-stack expertise in data center architecture, and tremendous scale to accelerate innovations. We are uniting two powerful forces and doubling down on data center.\nOur journey started in my hotel room at SC18 on November 18, 2018. Eyal and I had a 7 am breakfast meeting at the Dallas Ritz-Carlton. He told me there were multiple parties interested in buying Mellanox and asked if NVIDIA would like to join the bid. I told him that I loved Mellanox \u2013 the company, the technology, the products, and strategic position. We\u2019ve partnered to build many supercomputers and AI systems. \u201cMellanox is an amazing company,\u201d I said to Eyal. He went on for the next hour, telling me that \u201cMellanox is an amazing company.\u201d I agreed. He\u2019s incredibly proud of Mellanox, and rightfully so. At the end of the conversation, I told him that NVIDIA would be the final and highest bidder. The bidding was intense. NVIDIA was the highest bidder.\nNVIDIA and Mellanox are a perfect combination. The first reason is that we both care deeply about high-performance computing. Our companies are both wired for performance and technology leadership. NVIDIA accelerates 50% of the new supercomputers on the latest Top500 list. Mellanox is the networking in 6 of the top 10 supercomputers. When NVIDIA accelerates compute by 10-50x, moving data becomes the bottleneck. Amdahl\u2019s law. Mellanox and NVIDIA amplify each other\u2019s technologies.\nThe big picture reason is that the future of the data center is being reshaped and playing into our strengths. Yesterday\u2019s cloud data center architecture is called Hyper-Converged Infrastructure, where CPU-servers with integrated storage \u201cscale out\u201d into large data centers. Cloud computing was born and revolutionized the industry. AI is now driving an architecture change from Hyper-Converged Infrastructures to Accelerated-Disaggregated Infrastructure. NVIDIA and Mellanox are at the epicenter of this shift.\nAI, the most powerful technology force of our time, is a fundamentally new computing model that is reshaping data center architectures. AI is insanely computation- and data-intensive. Because CPUs designed for general-purpose computing cannot efficiently handle the workload, NVIDIA is used to accelerate AI algorithm processing, and Mellanox is used to accelerate data processing and networking. The data center is now accelerated.\nSimultaneously, the rapid adoption of data center-scale workload orchestration platforms like Kubernetes is changing software development and data center operations in a significant way. Applications and services are decomposed into smaller executable containers and deployed onto available servers across the data center. Services can dynamically compose the infrastructure with the optimal type and amount of computing elements to process each workload. Large monolithic applications no longer bog down some computers while leaving others sitting idle. Data center utilization, throughput, ease and cost of operations are all improved.\nThe data center is now a composable computer. The data center computing elements are disaggregated \u2014 i.e., CPU servers, GPU servers, and storage servers are separated and scaled independently. Mellanox\u2019s networking fabric that connects the computing elements becomes all-important to the data center.\nOur growing businesses reflect the need for fast computing and networking. When we announced the acquisition a year ago, Mellanox did $305M in revenue that quarter. Mellanox had 4 consecutive record quarters since and just announced $429M in quarterly revenue \u2013 increasing 41%. During that same period, NVIDIA\u2019s data center business grew from $680M to approaching $1B last quarter, also increased over 40%. This is just the beginning.\u00a0\nBreakthroughs in natural language understanding, conversational AI, and deep recommendation systems are pushing AI complexity to new levels. The models are complex. Data intensity is growing exponentially. And the relentless push to smarter predictions and faster response is driving computation demands.\nAI computing, networking, and data processing are more important than ever in this new world. Together we possess deep expertise and exceptional capabilities to invent this future. NVIDIA and Mellanox are a dream team combination.\nThe fastest computing and the fastest networking go hand in hand. That\u2019s why NVIDIA selected Mellanox for our DGX AI systems. Mellanox switches and networking fabric connect NVIDIA\u2019s own research AI supercomputers.

This open-source AI framework for healthcare builds on the best practices from existing tools, including NVIDIA Clara, NiftyNet, DLTK and DeepNeuro.\nMONAI is user-friendly, delivers reproducible results and is domain-optimized for the demands of healthcare data \u2014 equipped to handle the unique formats, resolutions and specialized meta-information of medical images. Our first public release provides domain-specific data transforms, neural network architectures and evaluation methods to measure the quality of medical imaging models.\n\u201cIn partnership with NVIDIA, Project MONAI is following industry standards for open-source development and building a global community across academia and industry to establish a high quality framework supporting scientific development in medical imaging AI,\u201d said Seb Ourselin, head of the School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences at King\u2019s College London.\nNVIDIA and King\u2019s College London are leading the initiative in collaboration with an advisory board hailing from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the German Cancer Research Center, Kitware, MGH & BWH Center for Clinical Data Science, Stanford University and the Technical University of Munich.\n\u201cProject MONAI has outstanding potential to accelerate the pace of medical imaging AI research,\u201d said Stephen Aylward, chair of the MONAI advisory board and a senior director at open-source software company Kitware. \u201cIt provides a high-quality, open-source foundation that is specialized for medical imaging, that welcomes everyone to build upon, and that anyone can use to communicate and compare their ideas.\u201d\nAvailable on GitHub, the open-source code is based on the Ignite and PyTorch deep learning frameworks, and brings together state-of-the-art libraries for data processing, 2D classification, 3D segmentation and more. Researchers can easily bring MONAI to their existing code, using the customizable design to integrate modular components into their AI workflows.\nAn Open, Flexible Framework for Healthcare\nModular, open-source solutions give researchers the flexibility to customize their deep learning development, without needing to replace their existing workflows with an end-to-end system.\nAn advanced researcher could, for instance, adopt MONAI code for data preprocessing and transformations, and then switch over to an existing AI pipeline for training.\n\u201cResearchers need a flexible, powerful and composable framework that allows them to do innovative medical AI research, while providing the robustness, testing and documentation necessary for safe hospital deployment,\u201d said Jorge Cardoso, chief technology officer of the London Medical Imaging & AI Centre for Value-based Healthcare. \u201cSuch a tool was missing prior to Project MONAI.\u201d\nDetailed tutorials and a user-friendly API interface allow entry-level researchers to define an end-to-end training workflow.\nA key goal of the MONAI framework is to enable reproducibility of experiments, so researchers can share results and build upon each other\u2019s work to advance the state of the art.\n\u201cReproducibility of scientific research is of paramount importance, especially when we are talking about the application of AI in medicine,\u201d said Jayashree Kalpathy-Cramer, scientific director at the MGH & BWH Center for Clinical Data Science, and associate professor of radiology at MGH/Harvard Medical School. \u201cProject MONAI is providing a framework by which AI development for medical imaging can be validated and refined by the community with data and techniques from the world over.\u201d\nFuture releases of NVIDIA Clara will also leverage the MONAI framework. We plan to bring together development efforts for NVIDIA Clara medical imaging tools and MONAI to continue delivering domain-optimized, robust software tools for researchers in healthcare imaging.\nWith contributions from an engaged community, the project will increase efficiency and collaboration among academic and industry researchers.\nJoin us at the MONAI homepage to get started, provide input and contribute code.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Healthcare and Life Sciences | NVIDIA Clara | Open Source | Science | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

On top of that, new technical goodies are on the way that could make the upcoming RTX Super-powered laptops some of the most interesting mobile gaming machines to date.The desktop versions of the RTX 2070 Super and RTX 2080 Super provide a good performance boost over their non-Super siblings, and the same should be true for the laptop versions. I'll hold off giving the silicon the thumbs up until I've tested a few systems myself, but I'm definitely excited to see what these laptops can do.If you looking to go over the technical specifications of the new GPUs, then this is the table for you. (Image credit: Nvidia)The update to the Max-Q side of things that is actually the more interesting news to me. For context, Max-Q is a system of controlling the power draw and thermals of the GPU so as to hit the sweet spot between performance and heat production. It's particularly important when it comes to thin and light laptops.There are five technologies that sit under the new Max-Q umbrella: Dynamic Boost, low voltage GDDR6, Advanced Optimus, next gen regulator efficiency, and DLSS. We've already talked about the improvements made to DLSS here, but it's going to be interesting to see what this can do in the laptop gaming space.\u00a0Dynamic Boost is great for those moments where you're GPU bound, as it'll take power from the CPU to boost GPU performance. (Image credit: Nvidia)Of these new features, Dynamic Boost will probably have the greatest impact on games. Essentially, it monitors the power draw and performance of the GPU and CPU together, and can shift power to the GPU from the CPU when needed the most. This should improve framerates, particularly in games that are GPU bound.Advanced Optimus, meanwhile, replaces the initial, rather crude, Optimus system with a dynamic display switch that can quickly shift between the CPU's integrated graphics and the laptop's discrete graphics to improve battery life and also better support the likes of G-Sync.\u00a0Nvidia is keen to get its ray tracing GPUs in more machines as well, and says the sweet spot for RTX 2060-powered laptops will be $999. Note that these aren't laptop RTX 2060 Supers, which have not been announced, just the regular type. Five RTX 2060 laptops to look out for on this front are: Acer Nitro 5, Asus ROG G512, HP Omen 15, Lenovo Y540, and the MSI GF65 Thin, with apparently many others on the way as well.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.An updated version of the HP Omen is on the way that'll make use of the new graphics architecture. (Image credit: HP, Nvidia)Laptops using the Super GPUs and/or the new take on Max-Q are due out this month, with the usual suspects all present and correct\u2014Acer, Asus, Gigabyte, Lenovo, MSI, Razer, to name but a few. There will be non-Super laptops that use the new Max-Q technology too, which makes this a major refresh.\u00a0In terms of pricing, Nvidia was keen to point out that there will be laptops available from $699. And while that doesn't get you an RTX 2080 Super, rather a GTX 1650 powered machine, there's still a concerted effort to make more affordable machines across the board, including that focus on $999 RTX 2060 systems.\u00a0It's worth noting that both Intel and AMD are going to be in this market now as well, which should hopefully make for some interesting price points. If you're in the market for a new laptop, I'd hang on for a month at least, to see how this all shakes out. Stay optimistic though, it looks like laptops are about to get a lot better.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nAlan DexterSocial Links NavigationAlan has been writing about PC tech since before 3D graphics cards existed, and still vividly recalls having to fight with MS-DOS just to get games to load. He fondly remembers the killer combo of a Matrox Millenium and 3dfx Voodoo, and seeing Lara Croft in 3D for the first time. He's very glad hardware has advanced as much as it has though, and is particularly happy when putting the latest M.2 NVMe SSDs, AMD processors, and laptops through their paces. He has a long-lasting Magic: The Gathering obsession but limits this to MTG Arena these days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest in Graphics Cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsus appears to have quietly changed the design of its Q-Release PCIe slot after claims of potential GPU pin damage \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree lucky folks in India can win the dubious honour of buying an RTX 5080 GPU at Nvidia MSRP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup allegedly trying to smuggle Nvidia Blackwell chips stare down bail set at over $1 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI will be crammed in more of the graphics pipeline as Nvidia and Microsoft are bringing AI shading to a DirectX preview next month\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia says it's sold twice as many RTX 50-series cards as RTX 40-series in the first 5 weeks.

This is our biggest launch of GeForce laptops ever -- over 100 designs from every major OEM -- and they\u2019ll be starting at an attractive price of just $699 for GeForce GTX models and $999 for GeForce RTX models. They give gamers and work-from-homers the horsepower to tackle the most demanding games while zooming through challenging creative tasks with ease, and availability starts the week of April 15th from multiple partners globally, with more coming in May.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis new lineup of laptops kicks off with the introduction of the latest GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs, bringing you performance that\u2019s up to 25% faster than original GeForce RTX 20-Series GPUs. These laptops are ideal for demanding games at high resolutions, competitive games at high FPS, broadcasting, or resource-intensive creative applications. And both the GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER and GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER GPUs are offered in Max-Q configurations for the absolute highest mobile performance and efficiency.\nFor next-gen ray tracing capabilities and performance-boosting NVIDIA DLSS 2.0, powered by dedicated GPU cores, you can choose from many new and updated models. RTX 2060 laptops will be starting at $999, such as the Acer Nitro 5, ASUS ROG Strix G15, HP Omen 15, Lenovo Legion Y540, Lenovo Legion 5i,\u00a0 MSI GF65 Thin, and many others.\u00a0 Lenovo Legion 7i and Lenovo Legion Y740 laptops with the RTX 2070 GPU will be available starting at $1199.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGone are the days of hulking desktop replacements for portable gaming. This new generation of GeForce laptops represents the perfect marriage of power and portability. Together with the latest Max-Q technologies, they feature up to 2X the efficiency of first-generation Max-Q laptops, enabling them to be incredibly thin while more powerful than ever, with the same 80 Watt GPU power budget. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage of 3 games: Control, Wolfenstein: Youngblood, and Deliver Us The Moon. 1080p, High settings, RT Off, Intel Core i7, 16GB RAM\nMax-Q laptops are highly engineered collaborations between NVIDIA and our OEM partners that let us develop and deploy groundbreaking new features that increase both performance and power optimization, such as Advanced Optimus and the new Max-Q Dynamic Boost, on supported models.\nHistorically, a laptop\u2019s CPU and GPU have a fixed, predefined power budget, regardless of the type of content being run. Our Max-Q Dynamic Boost technology automatically enables real-time GPU and CPU power balancing, allowing the system to dynamically shift up to 15W of power from the CPU to the GPU during GPU-bound workloads, like gaming. It intelligently assesses the power demand of the system on a frame by frame basis, so the power shift only happens when it\u2019s needed. The result is higher frame rates and smoother gaming overall for up to a 10% performance boost, all for free. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 2080 SUPER, Max Settings, Core i7, 16GB\nOur breakthroughs don\u2019t just give you more FPS per watt. Our new Advanced Optimus Technology enables G-SYNC support for the first time, to deliver the long battery life we expect from Optimus, and the immersive, tear-free, stutter-free gameplay from G-SYNC.\nThis new groundbreaking display innovation dynamically selects whether the GeForce GPU or the laptop\u2019s iGPU is driving the laptop display depending on what type of application you\u2019re running. Obviously, you\u2019ll want to have your GeForce GPU drive the display while you\u2019re playing games, and with Advanced Optimus Technology, your laptop will automatically switch over to the iGPU driving the display while you\u2019re browsing the web and watching videos to conserve battery life. Te brand new Lenovo Legion 7i and Legion 5i gaming laptops are the first laptops to offer this groundbreaking feature. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLenovo Legion 7i with Advanced Optimus Technology\nAnother breakthrough is the use of NVIDIA DLSS to extend battery life while gaming. Powered by dedicated AI processors on GeForce RTX GPUs called Tensor Cores, DLSS is a deep learning neural network that boosts frame rates while generating beautiful, crisp game images. When combined with NVIDIA BatteryBoost technology, DLSS allows the GPU to operate in an ultra-efficient mode that delivers the same great experience but with up to 20% longer battery life while gaming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 2.0 comparison in Deliver Us The Moon \nFor a competitive edge in multiplayer games, over 25 designs will offer 300Hz displays. These very high refresh laptops enable low latency, crisp visuals, and minimal ghosting, so you can perform at your very best. We recently published a study at SIGGRAPH Asia that showed how lower latency and higher frames result in faster and more accurate aiming in first-person shooters. Using this data, we calculated that subjects\u2019 flick shot aim improved by up to 35% at 300FPS/Hz over a 60FPS/Hz baseline. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX Studio laptops, designed and tested to power the world\u2019s creative minds, are receiving their own SUPER upgrades. The new laptops feature factory-calibrated displays, blazing-fast memory and storage, and are precision-engineered to be ultra-thin and light. Leveraging NVIDIA Studio drivers for increased stability, and with over 45 of the most popular creative and design apps getting accelerated by RTX, they provide unmatched video and 3D performance. Now, it\u2019s possible to edit up to 6K RED RAW video in real-time and render rich virtual worlds in minutes from anywhere in the real world. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance comparison of the new GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER Max-Q laptop with a MacBook Pro 16 with AMD Radeon 5500M and Core i9 laptop, as well as Intel Core i7 10750-H laptop, in Video Editing and 3D Rendering\nWe\u2019re excited to announce ten new RTX Studio laptops from Razer (Blade 15 Base and Advanced, RTX Studio Edition), MSI (Creator 15, Creator 17, WS66, and WS75), Acer (ConceptD 7 Ezel and Ezel Pro) and Gigabyte (AERO 15 OLED and AERO 17 HDR).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd for a limited time, these new RTX Studio laptops come with 3 Months of Adobe Creative Cloud (a $238.47 value). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new lineup of GeForce laptops will be hitting shelves starting the week of April 15th from multiple partners globally, with more coming in May.

Level up your livestreams, voice chats, and video calls with a suite of powerful AI effects like noise removal, virtual background, and auto frame. Learn more.\nRTX Voice is now enabled for any NVIDIA GeForce, Quadro or TITAN GPU.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable Of Contents\n\nAbout RTX Voice\nRequirements\nSupported Apps\nSetup Guide\nApp Configuration\n\nDiscord\nOBS Studio\nStreamlabs\nXSplit Broadcaster\nTwitch Studio\nWebEx\nZoom\nSlack\nTeams\nSkype\nGoogle Chrome\n \nTesting RTX Voice\nSend Us Your Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout RTX Voice\nNVIDIA RTX Voice is a new plugin that leverages NVIDIA RTX GPUs and their AI capabilities to remove distracting background noise from your broadcasts, voice chats, and remote video conferencing meetings. This allows users to \"go live\" or join a meeting without having to worry about unwanted sounds like loud keyboard typing or other ambient noise in noisy environments. RTX Voice also suppresses background noise from players in loud environments, making incoming audio easier to understand.\nRTX Voice is currently in Beta and we would love to hear your feedback.\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please report them here.\nHelp us train the AI network: https://broadcast.nvidia.com/feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\nA new version of RTX Voice is available as \u2018Noise Removal\u2019 in the NVIDIA Broadcast app!\nFor NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060, Quadro RTX 3000, TITAN RTX or higher, NVIDIA Broadcast requires NVIDIA Display Driver version 456.38 or higher.\nTo use RTX Voice, you must have an NVIDIA GTX or RTX graphics card, update to Driver 410.18 or newer, and be on Windows 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupported Apps\nRTX Voice adds a virtual Microphone and Speakers within your system. They can then be selected in most popular live streaming, gaming, and video conferencing apps including, but not limited to:\n\nOBS Studio\nStreamlabs\nXSplit Broadcaster\nXSplit Gamecaster\nTwitch Studio\nDiscord\nGoogle Chrome\nBattle.net Chat\nWebEx*\nSkype*\nZoom*\nSlack*\nTeams*\nSteam Chat**\n\n* RTX Voice speakers may exhibit issues in these apps.\n**Turn off \u2018Noise Cancellation\u2019 for better quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup Guide\nRTX Voice creates a virtual device on your system, and it is this virtual device that we want to use in your voice chat apps to denoise background noise from chat only, and not from your general Windows audio (as it would denoise unwanted audio feeds, like YouTube videos, Spotify music, or game audio).\nTo set it up:\n1. Download the App:\na. For NVIDIA RTX GPUs or higher, download NVIDIA Broadcast and visit the setup guide here.\nb. For NVIDIA GeForce GTX GPUs, download RTX Voice.\n2. Install it.\n3. Configure RTX Voice:\na. Select the microphone and speaker you want to use.\nb. Turn on the background noise removal for the mic and/or the speakers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend turning on RTX Voice for your microphone, and turn it on for your speakers only if needed. While quality remains almost the same, it is possible to see a small difference in some cases, and the solution takes system resources that you can avoid using if you don\u2019t need it. \n\n\n\n4. Configure your voice chat app according to the instructions below. Applications can sometimes apply effects, such as noise cancelling, similar to those in NVIDIA Broadcast. Applying an effect twice will often result in the effect not working correctly. We recommend disabling such effects in your app and drivers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscord\n1. Go to Settings (cog wheel), and then select Voice and Video.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.

We recommend disabling the application\u2019s settings if you are using RTX Voice, as well as any background noise removal in the software or driver that accompanies your microphone/headphones. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow To Test\nTo test the background noise removal, we recommend the following:\n1. Setup RTX Voice (instructions above). 2. Select RTX Voice (Speakers) as your speakers in the Sound Settings of Windows. 3. Open a video or recording with background noise (e.g. a YouTube video of an interview in the street). You can test the denoising by turning the background noise removal on and off on RTX Voice (Speaker path) and listening to the difference it makes to the audio. 4. When you finish testing, make sure you change back your speakers in Windows to your default! You will want to use RTX Voice as your speaker in voice apps, but not in Windows since you would filter audio that you don\u2019t want to (like music, videos, etc.).\n\n\n\nNote: RTX Voice Beta doesn\u2019t control the volume of your underlying devices. If you are testing RTX Voice (Speakers) and want to adjust the volume, go back to your previous device, adjust the volume, and go back to RTX Voice. \n\n\n\nTo test your microphone, we recommend comparing the quality of your microphone with and without denoising. To do that:\n\nMake sure that you have your microphone selected as your device in Windows. Click the Windows icon and search for Sound Settings, and select it in the microphone field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Record your voice with your microphone.\na. Open an audio recording app, for example Window\u2019s Voice Recorder. Click on the Windows icon and search for Voice Recorder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb. Click on the record icon to generate a recording. We recommend reading the same text through the different texts while you have some background noise. Example text:\n\u201cRTX Greenscreen is a plugin that delivers real-time background removal of a webcam feed so streamers can replace their backdrop with different images or video. The plugin leverages AI to separate broadcasters from their background, adding to the professional quality of the stream and empowering users to take advantage of the benefits of a physical greenscreen without the expense and hassle of installation.\u201c\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck that this test is capturing background noise. If your original audio doesn\u2019t capture background noise, RTX Voice won\u2019t be effective since it won\u2019t have any background noise to remove. \n\n\n\n3. Setup RTX Voice (instructions above). 4. Now record your voice using RTX Voice.\na. In the Windows Sound settings, select RTX Voice (Microphone) as your Microphone (see above). b. Use Voice Recorder to record your voice reading the same text as before (see above). \n5. Listen to both audio tracks with Voice Recorder or your favorite music application, and compare. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive us your Feedback!\nRTX Voice is currently in beta and the feedback you provide helps us make the software even better.\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please report them here.\nHelp us train the AI network: https://broadcast.nvidia.com/feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

While there were some good implementations, such as Control itself which previously used a CUDA-based version of DLSS, plenty of others had issues and introduced blurriness for example.\nRelated Story Watch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For UnveilingDLSS 2.0, on the other hand, has been extremely well received so far in all of the four games where it's available (Deliver Us The Moon and Wolfenstein: Youngblood, in the addition to the two mentioned above). What changed, then?\nLuckily, for those who are really curious about what goes on behind the scenes, NVIDIA's Senior Research Scientist Edwin Liu explained exactly what makes NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 such a big upgrade over the previous version in a GTC 2020 talk that was published recently on NVIDIA's website. It's an extremely interesting presentation, though fairly long (almost 48 minutes). We've summarized the salient points here for your convenience.\nThere are two possible approaches to image super-resolution rendering: single-image and multi-frame. The former is perhaps more commonly used and known, as it is usually achieved through mere interpolation filters like bicubic, bilinear, lanczos, spline, nearest neighbor et cetera. That's what happens with most video upscaling software.\n\nLately, though, deep neural networks have been used to 'hallucinate' new pixels after training. An example of this is ESRGAN, the Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks model on which several AI-enhanced texture packs for older games are based on.\nThe images reconstructed through interpolation filters are, simply put, lacking too much detail compared to the native image. DNNs do a better job in this regard, but since they are 'hallucinating' the new pixels, the result may be inconsistent with the native image.\nAs you can see in the comparison below, the left image features vastly different tree bushes compared to the native image. NVIDIA deems this unacceptable for DLSS, as the goal is to stay as close as possible to the 'ground truth' image as well as the original creative vision of the game developer.\n\nAnother major issue is that the resulting image is often temporally unstable, featuring flickering for instance. In order to solve all these issues, NVIDIA opted for a multi-frame super-resolution approach when it comes to DLSS 2.0. This allows accumulating multiple low-resolution frames to craft a high-resolution frame, which makes restoring true details much easier.\nThis is what happens with spatial-temporal upsampling techniques like the now ubiquitous Temporal Antialiasing and Checkerboard Rendering, with the latter known to be a popular choice among developers for PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One X consoles.\nSince these reconstruction techniques use samples from multiple frames, they're much less likely to encounter temporal instability issues like flickering. Additionally, while for each frame the shading rate is kept low to achieve strong performance, the effective sampling rate is drastically increased due to the multi-frame reconstruction approach.\nThat is not to say there are no issues with TAA or CR. Since there are content changes when rendering games in real-time (the scenes are continuously dynamic, after all), naively assuming previous frames will be correct could easily lead to artifacts like ghosting or lagging. Usually, these problems are handled with heuristics based history rectification of the invalid samples from previous frames. That comes with other issues of its own, though, such as the reintroduction of temporal instability, blurriness, and Moir\u00e9 patterns.\n\nOne of the most commonly used heuristics models is neighborhood clamping, which works by clamping samples from previous frames to a minimum and maximum of the neighboring current frame samples. This does strike a decent balance to avoid the shortcomings mentioned above. However, it cannot prevent a rather significant loss of detail as you can see below.\n\n\u00a0\nNVIDIA is solving this issue by exploiting the power of its supercomputer, which is trained offline on tens of thousands of extremely high-quality images.\nNeural networks are simply much more suited to a task like this than handcrafted heuristics as they can find the optimal strategy to combine samples collected over multiple frames, delivering much higher quality reconstructions in the end result.\nIt's a data driven approach and one that allows DLSS 2.0 to successfully reconstruct even complex situations like those with the Moir\u00e9 pattern. The image comparisons below are thoroughly impressive, surpassing even native images more often than not while doing a 4x upscaling from 540p to 1080p. None of this was possible with the previous DLSS model.\n\n\n\n\nOf course, NVIDIA's ultimate goal with DLSS 2.0 is to deliver great performance. And it certainly does, with very minimal overhead. The added cost is almost trivial, as it takes just 1.5 milliseconds for an RTX 2080Ti graphics card while rendering at 4K resolution.\n\nJust as exciting is that adding DLSS 2.0 will be much easier for game developers. Not only because there's an Unreal Engine 4 branch now and the generalized neural model doesn't have to be trained per game anymore, but mostly because the multi-frame approach means it will be very easy to implement DLSS 2.0 in those games and engines that already support Temporal Antialiasing (TAA), and there are lots of them.\nNeedless to say, we can't wait to see where NVIDIA takes its incredibly promising Deep Learning Super Sampling image reconstruction technique in the future. They're already working on exposing the sharpness setting, for one thing, and having more options is always great.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n107\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n53\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n35\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n33\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

We can help them join an increasingly data-driven economy,\u201d said Dengel. He serves as head of DFKI\u2019s site in Kaiserslautern in southwest Germany, a member of DFKI\u2019s management board and the scientific director of its smart data and knowledge services group.\nOne company is already testing a prototype AI sandbox and catalog DFKI built to let users try deep learning. The catalog includes 35 top neural networks for imaging with audio and video models on the way, targeting commercial use next year.\n\u201cRemoving the boundaries for companies who want to use AI is very important,\u201d said Dengel.\nAdvancing AI in Germany and Beyond\nWhile DFKI spreads AI\u2019s use, it also aims to advance the technology. The research institute is part of a group making a proposal for a German national supercomputing center focused on AI. A decision is expected later this year on the center, expected to have a budget of up to $16 million a year.\nThe effort comes amid a pan-European drive to beef up AI research. In mid-March, the European Commission granted a new AI research alliance about $54 million. It\u2019s seen as a downpayment on the region\u2019s future investments in AI.\n\nIn this environment, DFKI has no shortage of ambitions. One of its research teams is wrestling with the grand challenge of explainable AI, understanding how deep learning gets its amazing results.\nA member of the team presented a paper in June 2018 that won an award from NVIDIA\u2019s founder and CEO Jensen Huang. The paper described a way one neural network can monitor another to understand and optimize its processes.\nThe work put some light on how deep learning gets its impressive results. But there\u2019s much more to be done as the types of neural networks and datasets proliferate.\n\u201cExperts who depend on AI systems should be able to visualize or explain their processes. That\u2019s especially critical for applications on finance and healthcare,\u201d Dengel said.\nIt\u2019s one of some 250 projects across 20 departments at DFKI, one of the world\u2019s largest AI research centers.\nAmong other projects, one team is helping the German federal bank apply AI. Another conducts 600-hour tests of car engines, making predictions with AI based on the results. Yet another uses GPUs to analyze high-resolution satellite images, helping coordinate disaster relief efforts.\n17 Petaflops of GPU Compute and Growing\nDFKI computer rooms pack an estimated 17 petaflops of GPU computing power with multiple NVIDIA DGX systems. They include what was the first DGX-2 in Europe, all linked on Mellanox InfiniBand switches.\nIt\u2019s a lot of horsepower, but not enough to meet rising demands. The group spun up a climate modeling application two months ago, satellites are \u201cgrowing exponentially\u201d for imaging applications. And DFKI has a new collaboration with the European Space Agency that will spawn multiple projects.\n\u201cWe are at the limit of our systems\u2019 use. Our goal is to expand in a big way. We want to provide infrastructure that\u2019s a platform for both the German and the broader European industry,\u201d said Dengel.\n\u201cOur experience has shown that by putting apps on NVIDIA GPU clusters companies better understand what GPU acceleration can do for them,\u201d he added.\nIn the wake of the shareholder agreement, DFKI and NVIDIA are discussing plans for collaborating on software projects. It\u2019s another step in deepening ties at many levels.\nThe two groups also sometimes share talented people. A former DFKI professor is now an NVIDIA architect, and a handful of DFKI grad students are just back from a sabbatical working with NVIDIA.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | NetworkingTags: Artificial Intelligence | Machine Learning | NVIDIA DGX | NVIDIA in Europe | NVIDIA Research \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

A title search shows that the property is held by Lim Oon Kuin (more commonly known as \u201cOK Lim\u201d) \u2013 the founder of Singapore\u2019s biggest, privately held oil trader, Hin Leong Trading \u2013 and his wife, Tan Sook Eng.    The Good Class Bungalow at Second Avenue belonging to OK Lim and his wife had a caveat lodged for $27 million (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)    Source: URA Realis, downloaded on April 23, 2020 According to property agents who specialise in the GCB market, the $27 million or $1,351 psf reflected in the caveat was \u201ca fair price\u201d. After all, the last transaction at Second Avenue was for the GCB next door: sitting on a 20,000 sq ft, freehold site, the property fetched $27.5 million ($1,375 psf) in August 2018.  With Lim\u2019s oil empire now submerged in debt, the sale is not surprising. Understandably, there is interest over what other assets Lim owns. The GCB at Second Avenue isn\u2019t the only one that Lim owns. One street away is a GCB located on a corner plot at Third Avenue. The property sits on a smaller freehold site of 14,575 sq ft and is jointly owned by Lim and his son Chee Meng, according to a property title search.    The GCB at Third Avenue which Lim purchased 25 years ago for $8.95 million ($614 psf). The property is owned jointly with his son, Chee Meng (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) Lim had purchased the GCB at Third Avenue for $8.95 million ($614 psf), based on a caveat lodged in April 1995. Prices have almost doubled over the span of the last 25 years. Just across the road, a GCB sitting on a 16,276 sq ft, freehold site changed hands for $18.8 million ($1,155 psf), according to a caveat lodged in May 2019. The GCB at Third Avenue is believed to be Lim\u2019s current residence.  Another GCB at Queen Astrid Park, purchased for $46 million ($1,548 psf) in 2017, is held solely by Tan Sook Eng, Lim\u2019s wife. At Tanglin Hill, Lim also owns a GCB at Tanglin Villas jointly with daughter Huey Ching, who is also a director of Hin Leong Trading. The freehold property was purchased in November 1999, but no caveat was lodged then. The latest transaction at Tanglin Hill was for a GCB built in the 1980s, which sits on a land area of 16,448 sq ft. It was sold for $31.5 million ($1,915 psf) last October. It will be interesting to see what Lim will divest next to stave off creditors.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

The unit changed hands for $3 million ($1,380 psf)\u00a0 on March 27. It fetched $1.26 million ($579 psf) in September 1995. This means the seller earned a $1.74 million (138%) profit on the transaction, which translates to an annualised profit of 4% over close to 25 years.  Avon Park is a 179-unit development off Upper Serangoon Road that was completed in 1991. The condo is located in front of Woodleigh MRT Station on the North-East Line. It comprises three- to five-bedroom units from 1,270 sq ft to 4,520 sq ft. The latest transaction is also the most profitable deal ever recorded at Avon Park. The record was last held by a 1,711 sq ft unit, which fetched $1.94 million ($1,132 psf) in September 2012 and had been purchased for $749,418 ($438 psf) in June 2004. Thus, the seller walked away with a $1.19 million (158%) profit, or an annualised profit of 12% over eight years. The week in review also recorded the sale of a three-bedroom unit at Flame Tree Park in District 13. The 1,593 sq ft unit changed hands for $2.2 million ($1,381 psf) on March 26, after it had previously been bought for $900,045 ($565 psf) in September 2000. This translates to a $1.3 million (144%) profit, or an annualised gain of 5% over close to 20 years.    The three-bedroom unit at Flame Tree Park changed hands for $2.2 million ($1,381 psf) on March 26. (Picture: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore) Located along Sin Ming Avenue, Flame Tree Park is a 160-unit, freehold development that was completed in 1989. The development has a mix of three-bedroom units from 1,593 sq ft to 2,163 sq ft. Based on the matching of URA caveats, all of the resale transactions in the condo over the past three years have been profitable, with gains ranging from $312,888 (19%) to $1.58 million (254%).  The week also recorded notable unprofitable deals such as the sale of a 1,830 sq ft unit at Reflections at Keppel Bay. The unit changed hands for $3.13 million ($1,710 psf) on March 26 after it had been purchased for $4.23 million ($2,312 psf) in August 2007. This means the seller incurred a loss of $1.1 million (26%) on the sale, which translates to an annualised loss of 2% over close to 13 years.    The sale of a 1,830 sq ft unit at Reflections at Keppel Bay is the most unprofitable deal so far in the condo this year. (Picture: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore) Based on the matching of URA caveats so far this year, there have been nine resale transactions at the 99-year leasehold development and all of them have been unprofitable. The most recent transaction is also the most unprofitable at the development so far this year; other losses range from $54,813 (3.5%) to $1.09 million (28%).   Story continues Another notable loss during the week occurred at DUO Residences, the residential component of the mixed-use development DUO along Fraser Street in Bugis. A 1,722 sq ft unit changed hands for $3.1 million ($1,800 psf) on March 26, while the owner paid $4.1 million ($2,383 psf) for the property in January 2018. As a result, he incurred a $1 million (24%) loss on the transaction, which amounts to an annualised loss of 12% over two years.  The seller of a 1,722 sq ft unit at DUO Residences only held his unit for about two years before selling it for a $1 million loss last month. (Picture: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore)This is the first unprofitable resale transaction at DUO Residences, based on the matching of caveats. There have been four profitable deals so far at the 660-unit development, which was completed in 2017. Profits for transactions have ranged from $2,000 (0.04%) to $135,000 (11%) over the past two years.Check out the latest listings near Avon Park, Flame Tree Park, Reflections at Keppel Bay, DUO Residences,\u00a0MRT Stations\u00a0and\u00a0SchoolsFor price trends, recent transactions, other project info, check out these\u00a0projects' research page:\u00a0Avon Park, Flame Tree Park, Reflections at Keppel Bay, DUO ResidencesRead also:Seller of Regency Suites unit makes $1.62 mil profit Unit at Heritage Apartments reaps $4.8 mil profit Unit at Elizabeth Heights sold for $2.54 mil profit See Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools Residential transactions with contracts dated Mar 31 to April 7 [DONE DEALS] Three-storey conservation terraced house at Mount Sophia for sale at $3.8 mil Seller of Cityvista Residences unit incurs $1.99 mil loss  Residential transactions with contracts dated Mar 24 to Mar 31 [DONE DEALS] En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

(F(ILE PHOTO: Axel Schmidt/Pool Photo via AP)   By Faris Mokhtar (Bloomberg) -- Temasek Holdings Pte denied speculation that Chief Executive Officer Ho Ching makes S$100 million ($70 million) a year. \u201cThis claim is false,\u201d the Singapore state investor said in a rare statement addressing the pay of the top executive, who\u2019s also Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong\u2019s wife. \u201cFurthermore, Ho Ching\u2019s annual compensation is neither the highest within Temasek, nor is she amongst the top five highest-paid executives in Temasek.\u201d  Temasek manages a portfolio that\u2019s valued at S$313 billion as of March 2019. It\u2019s the biggest stakeholder in half of the country\u2019s 10 largest companies by market value, including flag-carrier Singapore Airlines Ltd. and DBS Group Holdings Ltd., Southeast Asia\u2019s biggest lender. The company issued a response following \u201cchatter based on an Asian talk show commentary,\u201d it said. It reviews compensation practices across the financial industry annually, according to the statement. \u201cThis is an added check to support talent attraction and retention, within the context of our compensation framework,\u201d Temasek said. \u201cIncentives focus on long-term performance, and ensure employees share gains and pains alongside Temasek\u2019s shareholder during the economic cycles.\u201d Temasek doesn\u2019t disclose the salaries of its executives in its annual report, but describes its compensation framework as one benchmarked against relevant markets and includes incentives and clawbacks based on performance. Among Singapore\u2019s three biggest banks, Piyush Gupta, the CEO of DBS, had the largest pay at S$11.9 million including bonus and deferred shares, according to its 2018 annual report. The heads of the other two banks each earned about S$10.6 million.  Still, the past financial year that ended in March may have been a tougher year in terms of performance for Temasek. The Singapore benchmark stock index lost almost a quarter of its value in that period, while the MSCI World Index dropped 12%. The company in February said it\u2019s implementing a company-wide wage freeze and asking senior management to take voluntary pay reductions for as long as a year amid the coronavirus outbreak. Opposition lawmakers have previously asked for details of remuneration of Temasek\u2019s top executives, only to be told by the government that it maintains an arms-length relationship and doesn\u2019t interfere in operational decisions. Ho, who uses Facebook to air her views on social media, has been vocal in defending Singapore\u2019s efforts to contain the coronavirus spread.

Crown Resorts Ltd, the country's biggest, said it secured A$1.01 billion ($634.38 million) in debt funding and that 95% of its employees have now been laid off either temporarily or permanently.  And separately, No. 2 Star Entertainment Group said it has added an A$200 million 12-month credit line, and reiterated that it has stood down about 8,500 staff. Casino operators are among the businesses worst hit by Australia's measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus, which include shuttering of casinos and severe restrictions on movement of people. New Zealand's SkyCity Entertainment Group has also temporarily laid off most of its staff in Australia. The layoffs come as Australia's economy looks destined for its first recession in three decades as large swaths of the economy have been forced to shut to fight the outbreak. Crown said on Thursday it got A$560 million in new bilateral facilities and secured a further facility of A$450 million to fund the construction of its project in Sydney. \"As a result of today's announcement, Crown is well placed to withstand an extended period of closure,\" Ken Barton, Crown's chief executive officer, said in a statement. Crown also said it will need to hire 2,000 people when the Sydney project opens.  Star said the addition of the new 12-month facility brings it cash and debt reserves up to around A$700 million. Shares of Star jumped 8% by afternoon, while Crown was up 0.4%. The wider market was down 1.5%. Crown added on Thursday that senior management pay, including that of the CEO, and director fees will be cut by 20%. However, Crown said it will pay its interim dividend on Friday, unlike Star, which had previously said it would defer its payout. Crown expects underlying operating cash costs to drop to between A$20 million to A$30 million per month as non-essential services at its casinos in Melbourne and Perth are suspended. The Australian government has pledged A$130 billion to subsidise the wages of an estimated 6 million people. But data on Thursday showed the unemployment rate tick higher in March before the widespread restrictions and shutdowns kicked in, and economists warned the worst was yet to come.

Zoom, which allows users to talk to up to 99 other people simultaneously, has emerged at the top of the heap \u2013 the average mobile user numbers in March for Zoom were nearly three times that of Microsoft Corp\u2019s Teams, according to research firm Apptopia.  Zoom Video Communications chief executive officer Eric Yuan said in a blog message on Wednesday (1 April) that Zoom\u2019s daily users has ballooned to more 200 million in March from 10 million at the end of December. However, concerns are rising over users\u2019 security and privacy. The company was sued last month by a user in California for allegedly giving users\u2019 personal data to companies including Facebook without fully informing customers. The Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Boston office on 30 March issued a warning about Zoom, telling users not to make meetings on the site public or share links widely after it received two reports of unidentified individuals invading school sessions, a phenomenon known as \u201czoombombing.\u201d Given its popularity, and as the interest and usage of the platform increases, cyber criminals will see this as an opportunity, Omri Herscovici, Vulnerability Research Team Lead at Check Point Software Technologies, a provider of cyber security solutions, said. \u201cWe see a sharp rise in the number of \u2018Zoom\u2019 domains being registered, especially in the last week. The recent, staggering increase means that hackers have taken notice of the work-from-home paradigm shift that COVID-19 has forced, and they see it as an opportunity to deceive, lure and exploit,\u201d he said. \u201cEach time you get a Zoom link or document messaged or forwarded to you, I\u2019d take an extra look to make sure it\u2019s not a trap.\u201d He offers some tips on how to enjoy the benefits of Zoom without being vulnerable to the key threats: Keep up to date In order to maintain effective security, the Zoom software must be updated frequently. The updates that tech companies offer for their products not only add new options and features, but also address \u201cbugs\u201d and security breaches, such as the ability to discover and eavesdrop on meetings. It is important to understand that, contrary to popular belief, attackers\u2019 window of opportunity does not close after the security breach has been repaired, but only after users run a software update and receive the company\u2019s product patches to address the threats. This means users who have not updated the software remain vulnerable.   Story continues Using a login passwordThe requirement to present a password before entering the conference, in addition to displaying the call number, provides sufficient security. But in order to be fully protected, attention must be paid to how participants are invited into a call.It is recommended to connect to Zoom via SSO (single sign-on) if your company has the option for you to do so.Another way to control who enters the call is the \u201cWaiting Room\u201d option, in which a call manager creates a \u201cWaiting Room\u201d through which the participants can connect, but only if the call manager confirms the participants one by one or as a group. You can do this in the \u201cAdvanced Options\u201d drop-down menu when you want to schedule a call.Manage your participants during a callEven if you have decided to use the less secure link-sharing option, you may prevent instances of participants displaying inappropriate content by restricting the use of the camera for participants. The conversation manager can decide who can use their camera and microphone by clicking \u201cManage Participants\u201d.Assume what happens in Zoom does not stay in ZoomZoom allows you to record video calls and export them as video files as soon as the call ends. This is a very useful tool when you want to update those who were not present at the meeting. The security problem that comes with using this tool is almost self-explanatory: since conversing participants can export the recorded file, the file can actually find its way into malicious hands.To reduce the possible dangers from using the recording tool, the call manager can decide which of the participants may record the call through the participant management window and click \u201cAllow Record\u201d.Do also take note that the participant can always record the conversation using external software for recording the screen. Therefore, always assume that you may be recorded and act accordingly.After the call, if you have recorded it, ensure you don\u2019t upload it to a shared platform like an information sharing cloud that is open to other parties.Related stories: Cybersecurity tips to keep safe while you work from homeWorking from home successfully takes effective communication and embracing the 'outfit mullet'How business can reshape for resilience and continuity  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

This forms part of Haier\u2019s and DBS\u2019 broader regional relief efforts to help businesses, many of which are SMEs, to stay afloat during these challenging times. Accessible by Haier\u2019s nationwide network of distributors via its digital supply chain platform, the integrated DBS financing facility enabled by the bank\u2019s APIs offers distributors online financing for their purchase orders within 24 hours. DBS partners Haier to help distributors shorten their cash conversion cycle and optimise their working capital. John Laurens, Group Head of Global Transaction Services, DBS Bank said that providing financial sustenance to SMEs that form the commercial ecosystems of large corporates is of utmost importance in this unprecedented global trade situation. The DBS-Haier digital financing solution ensures that supply chains continue to operate in the face of disruptions.   DBS partners Haier   As DBS partners Haier benefits flow both ways \u201cEnhancing working capital management and access to financing is critical for both large corporates and SMEs especially in the current business environment. Technology has proven to be a useful tool in this aspect. By using DBS\u2019 APIs to create an integrated financing facility plugged into an industry anchor\u2019s supply chain platform, the benefits flow both ways. For Haier, their sales and distribution channels are given extra support; and for its SME distributors, they enjoy an extension on payment terms, helping them with essential cash flow and working capital management needs,\u201d added Laurens.  Yang Hongxing, Head of Supply Chain Finance, Haier Group, said, \u201cDBS is the first foreign bank to cooperate with Haier\u2019s digital supply chain finance business. At the early onset of the pandemic, DBS took the initiative to accelerate the implementation of digital financing lines for our distributors, to get the funds they need with as little physical interaction as possible.   Story continues \u201cThe speed at which financing can be offered to our distributors and the ease of being onboarded, have also elevated our customer experience journey to new heights. With DBS\u2019 digital financing facility, Haier\u2019s customers can access low-cost financing with just a few clicks of the mouse. DBS and Haier\u2019s Supply Chain Finance team will continue to jointly promote global cooperation in Haier\u2019s upstream and downstream supply chain finance going forward.\u201dAs DBS partners Haierm close to 30 distributors onboarded on the fully digital financing facility targeting distributors in the first week of launch. Additional capabilities include integrated online account opening and onboarding, and facial recognition and biometric features for enhanced security.The bank has also completed its first distributor financing request in March, where the distributor received the requested financing in under 30 minutes from the point of submission. Laurens added, \u201cThe speed of financing gives businesses a fighting chance to tide through the downturn and emerge more resilient to ride the economic upturn when it returns.\u201dDBS is the only non-Chinese bank appointed by Haier for this digital financing facility. The other three participating banks are China Everbright, Bank of Shanghai and MYBank.DBS partners Haier to prove commitment in helping customers transform digitallyDBS has been steadily working with its corporate customers to digitalise their supply chain ecosystems and avail easy access to digital trade financing. Over the past year, the bank has launched several digital trade financing initiatives. in September 2019, DBS announced its first multi-tier financing facility on a logistics blockchain platform named Rong-E Lian, to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in China get faster access to trade financing. Developed in partnership with a leading Chinese logistics player, Rong-E Lian offers multi-tier financing solutions to more than 1,000 of suppliers in the company\u2019s supply chain ecosystem.In February 2020, DBS said that it is advancing Singapore\u2019s trade digitalisation agenda, by collaborating with Audi Singapore (Audi) and Audi\u2019s local distributor, Premium Automobiles (Premium). It completed the first trade financing transaction on Singapore\u2019s Networked Trade Platform (NTP). The inaugural trade relates to a SGD3.5 million letter of credit[2] transaction for a trade of Audi cars between Audi and Premium.In the traditional world of trade, car importers, such as Audi, have to physically present an array of paper-based trade documents to complete a letter of credit transaction. However, by digitalising the process through the NTP, Audi and their retail partner Premium, are now able to submit bank applications, as well as send and receive trade documents online.In turn, this enables DBS to receive and start processing the e-applications in real-time, cutting short the trade financing processing time from about a week to under one working day, yielding greater operational efficiencies for both buyer and seller. In addition, as trade documents are uploaded onto the NTP, all trade participants are able to enjoy real-time updates on the progress of their transaction, enabling them to better plan their working capital needs.In March 2020, DBS accelerated trade digitalisation efforts with more \u2018industry-firsts\u2019 to drive greater efficiencies for customers. It completed first trade financing transaction on CamelONE Trade Finance Portal; part of bank\u2019s broader efforts to provide enhanced support to corporates.The post DBS partners Haier to provide digital financing to its distributors within 24 hours appeared first on iCompareLoan Resources.

(\u201cSheng Siong\u201d, together with its subsidiaries, the \u201cGroup\u201d), one of the largest supermarket chains in Singapore, reported a 49.9% year-on-year (\u201cyoy\u201d) increase in net profit to S$29.0 million for the 3 months ended 31 March 2020 (\u201c1Q2020\u201d), mainly due to increase in gross profit arising from the growth in revenue, better gross margin, higher other income and a less than proportional increase in operating expenses relative to the increase in revenue.   sheng siong   Revenue grew by 30.7% in 1Q2020 of which 19.7 percentage points was contributed by comparable same store sales, 9.0 percentage points by new stores and 2.0 percentage points by the stores in China. The Group started off the quarter with better Chinese New Year sales compared to 1Q2019 mainly due to recovering consumers\u2019 sentiments and the low base effect in 2019. When the government raised COVID-19\u2019s DORSCON from Yellow to Orange on 7 February 2020 shortly after Chinese New Year, the first round of elevated demand was triggered. Since then demand has been elevated as more people are eating at home and probably, loading up their pantry as well.  Gross margin improved slightly from 26.1% in 1Q2019 to 27.0% in 1Q2020, with the gains coming mainly from increased sales of housebrands which command a higher gross margin and slightly lower input prices across a majority of other categories of offerings. The biggest gain came from non-fresh products as sourcing was diversified to cope with the sudden surge in demand. The ratio of fresh to non-fresh remained quite the same in 1Q2020 compared with 1Q2019. There was no major disruption in the supply chain in 1Q2020. In hindsight, the Group\u2019s move to increase stockholding since the end of 4Q2019 has prevented serious stock out situations, although certain heavily demanded items were depleted immediately after the first round of elevated demand.    First Sheng Siong Store opened by the Lim brothers with seed capital from their father, located at BLK 122 Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 (Image: Sheng Siong) Administrative expenses increased by S$11.9 million in 1Q2020 compared with 1Q2019 mainly due to; higher staff costs as working hours were increased because of the higher volume, additional headcount was hired to operate the new stores and higher provision was made for bonuses because of the better financial performance, and increase in depreciation which was partially offset by decrease in rental.   Story continues Cash generated from operating activities amounted to S$71.5 million in 1Q2020, mainly because of the higher volume of business.Cash used for capital expenditures in 1Q2020 amounted to S$7.2 million consisting mainly of the warehouse extension amounting to S$3.2 million, fitting out stores and maintenance CAPEX for the supermarket operations totalling S$2.5 million, maintenance CAPEX relating to the central distribution centre of S$1.3 million and S$0.2 million incurred by the supermarkets in China.The Group\u2019s balance sheet remained healthy with cash of S$133.7 million as at 31 March 2020.Looking forwardSubsequent to 1Q2020, the Group has secured two new HDB stores which were tendered in January 2020. These are at Block 872C Tampines Street 86 (8,490 square feet) and Block 455 Sengkang West Avenue (9,040 square feet). In addition, the Group also won a tender for a 4,610 square feet shop in the Potong Pasir Community Club, 6 Potong Pasir Ave 2. Once the \u201cCircuit Breaker\u201d is lifted, the Group will proceed to execute the leases, take vacant possession and fit out the stores. To summarize, to-date, the Group would have opened a total of 5 stores in 2020, bringing our total store count to 64 and retail area to approximately 575,160 square feet.Competition for Sheng Siong is expected to remain keen among the brick-and-mortar supermarkets and online players.Some international food companies are warning of future disruptions to the supply chain and increase in prices because of the worldwide lockdown resulting from COVID-19 outbreak.It is uncertain how long the world or Singapore\u2019s economy would take to normalise post COVID-19. When that happens, the Group expects revenue to taper off from the current elevated levels as buffer stocks kept by households are consumed. In the meanwhile, the Group will continue to hold a higher than normal level of inventory to hedge against potential disruption in the supply chain.Staff costs and other operating expenses relating to COVID-19 will increase but will be defrayed by the grants from the Government.With its strong Q1 results in the bag, Sheng Siong said that staff, excluding directors, will be rewarded with an additional month of salary for working hard during the period of elevated demand in Q1.On the future plans of the Group, Mr Lim Hock Chee, the Group\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, said,  \u201cWe have successfully secured two new HDB stores at Block 872C Tampines Street 86 and Block 455 Sengkang West Avenue as well as a store in Potong Pasir Community Club, 6 Potong Pasir Ave 2.\u201d\u201cMoving ahead, we remain committed to our strategy of opening supermarkets in areas where our potential customers reside but we have no presence. We will continue with our efforts to nurture the growth of the new stores and build on the momentum of improving comparable same store sales in Singapore and China, while focusing on improving gross margin and cost efficiency by changing the sales mix with a higher proportion of fresh produce and deriving more efficiency gains in the supply chain. \u201d The post Sheng Siong staff to get extra month of salary as it records astounding Q1 profit appeared first on iCompareLoan Resources.

(PHOTO: Roslan Rahman/AFP via Getty Images)   SINGAPORE \u2014 The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) affirmed that financial services will remain open and available to all customers and counterparties in Singapore and globally. All financial markets in Singapore remain open, and payment services are unaffected, the MAS said in a statement on Friday (3 April).  Singapore will close most of its workplaces, except for essential services and those in key economic sectors. The country will also shut schools for a month to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in televised address to the nation on Friday. Financial services is one of the essential services exempted from the suspension of activities at workplace premises under the elevated safe distancing measures announced by the Ministry of Health (MOH) today, the de facto central bank said. All financial institutions will continue to operate, with reduced staffing on their premises, in line with MOH\u2019s advisory on maximising telecommuting. The MAS has instructed financial institutions to ensure that their customer-facing locations adhere to all relevant guidance on safe distancing as mandated by the health ministry. Banking services will continue to be available through online channels, ATMs and bank branches. Insurance, broking, custody, asset management and financial advisory services will also continue to be available, the monetary authority said.  Some branches of banks and finance companies and customer service centres of insurance companies may close temporarily because of reduced customer traffic, it added. The MAS said banks will maintain adequate cash in ATMs and ask the public not to withdraw more cash than their normal needs. People are encouraged to use PayNow, FAST, Interbank GIRO, and debit or credit cards to make payments electronically. The public should minimise going to financial institutions\u2019 branches or other premises and should use online channels, such as Internet banking or customer service portals, for their transactions. Customers applying for financial relief measures such as the deferral of bank loan and insurance premium payments as announced by MAS on 31 March are urged to contact their financial service providers through phone or e-mail.

(Nasdaq:MLNX). Nvidia says that the deal will now be completed on April 27.\nNvidia signed a deal in March 2019 to acquire Israel-based Mellanox for $125 per share in cash, or just over $7 billion. The deal was meant to close by December 31 and approval was received last year from the US, EU and Mexican antitrust authorities. But as the trade war between the US and China escalated, real concerns were raised that the Chinese could sink the deal. Those worries have now been set aside.\nMellanox's share price rose 1.81% on Nasdaq last night to $124.64, giving a market cap of $6.988 billion.\nMellanox founder and CEO Eyal Waldman has said that he will continue to lead the company after its acquisition and Nvidia has said that it plans to increase its investment in Mellanox in particular and Israel in general.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - www.globes-online.com - on April 17, 2020\n\u00a9 Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd. 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u05e0\u05d5\u05e9\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05de\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1 >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEyal Waldman and Jensen Huang Photo: Kadia Levy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront\nNews\nComment\nFeatures\nMarket\n\nNewsletters\nGlobes Conferences\nRSS\nIsrael Resources\n\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea\n\nAdvertising\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nAbout\nSupport\n\n\nPowered by \nUI & Design By \nApplication delivery by \n\u00a9 Globes.

Dealers in the world's biggest gold consumer China continued to sell bullion at hefty $50 an ounce discounts versus benchmark spot prices this week. This compares with last week's $50-$70 discounts, the biggest on record according to data going back to 2014.  \"Some shops have opened, but people are in no mood to buy gold on the retail side, it's still a high-end purchase,\" Ronald Leung, chief dealer, Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong. Global spot prices are now well above $1,700 an ounce. In India, physical trading remained suspended due to the coronavirus, and jewellery showrooms will stay shut ahead of the country's biggest gold buying festival of Akshaya Tritiya on April 26. \"Usually ahead of Akshaya Tritiya, jewellers make purchases, but this year no one's buying,\" said Harshad Ajmera, proprietor of JJ Gold House, a wholesaler in the eastern Indian city of Kolkata. Many jewellers have announced plans to sell gold online on the festival and deliver it after the lockdown is lifted, \"but retail buyers are not interested in online purchases due to the higher price and uncertainty about delivery\", said a Mumbai-based dealer with a private bullion importing bank. Indian gold futures held near a record high of 47,327 rupees ($620.5).  Investment demand was steady in Hong Kong and Singapore but retail buying was poor. \"Dealers like us are taking pre-orders to be fulfilled on a later date, and clients are settling for higher premiums and for whatever inventories that are available,\" said Joshua Rotbart, managing partner, J. Rotbart & Co in Hong Kong. Premiums of $0.40-$2.00 an ounce were charged on average in Hong Kong, versus last week's $0.50-$1.00, although some dealers quoted premiums as high as $4.00. In Singapore, gold was sold at average premiums of about $1.50 to $5 an ounce for gold bars. \"No jewellery shops/businesses are open until June 1,\" said Spencer Campbell, director at Precious Metals Consultants SE Asia Consulting, adding premiums on retail gold were still high with new stock \"based on promises right now\". \"Exemptions are not being granted for this industry as they do not see refining and minting as essential businesses.\" Japan saw premiums of $0.50-$1 an ounce amid muted activity with top gold retailer Tanaka Kikinzoku shutting all its stores.

(FILE PHOTO: AP Photo/Kin Cheung)   By Shirley Zhao (Bloomberg) -- Asian tycoons are looking to snap up assets pummelled by the deadly coronavirus at bargain prices, but they are also facing hurdles as more governments seek to deter foreign takeovers of local firms. Over the past three months, top executives of companies based in mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore have told investors that they are looking for acquisitions. They include Victor Li, who took over Hong Kong\u2019s CK group from his father Li Ka-shing two years ago, and billionaire Guo Guangchang, the founder of the acquisitive Chinese conglomerate, Fosun Group.  Major stock indexes in the U.S., Europe and Asia Pacific all plunged about 20% in the first quarter in their worst rout since the 2008 financial crisis, making retail chains to hotels and property developers attractive to suitors. Cash-rich conglomerates like Li\u2019s CK group are in a position to invest when others struggle as they are built to defend against the bad times, said Jonathan Galligan, group deputy head of research at CLSA Ltd. \u201cThis is a tremendous opportunity for any company with cash,\u201d Galligan said. \u201cIf you look at what\u2019s happened in the global market, right now cash is king.\u201d The junior Li, now chairman of CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd., CK Asset Holdings Ltd. and CK Infrastructure Holdings Ltd., told analysts on March 19 that the group\u2019s cash flow and balance sheet are strong and the impact of the virus offers \u201copportunities to look at new acquisitions.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate. Biggest Test For the 55-year-old Li, the market rout has come as his biggest test since his father passed on the baton in May 2018. The now retired senior Li, 91, came to Hong Kong as a refugee but went on to transform a plastic flower business into a ports-to-telecommunications empire spanning the world. CK Hutchison, the main flagship whose stock has tumbled 24% this year, said it had HK$145 billion ($18.7 billion) of cash and liquid investments as of December. That is 3.6 times its short-term debt and 1.7 times its debt maturing over 2020 and 2021, according to S&P Global Ratings. The group spent $5.5 billion last year acquiring assets including British pub operator Greene King Plc, following about $15.2 billion of purchases the previous year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The chaos triggered by the disease is also posing another challenge for prospective buyers. Governments are preemptively trying to ward off predatory buying, with policy makers from Australia to Spain, Italy and Germany introducing or considering stricter rules to help shield strategically important domestic companies.   Story continues The regulatory barriers may make some acquisitions harder, far from the days when Chinese conglomerates such as HNA Group Co. loaded up on debt and paid top dollar for assets from U.S. technology firms to European aviation businesses.\u201cFor companies like Li\u2019s, they depend very much on acquisitions to grow, and that could be a big challenge in the long term,\u201d said Jackie Yan, an assistant professor in management and strategy at the University of Hong Kong.Li, however, is no stranger to rejections by overseas regulators. In 2018, Australia rejected CK\u2019s bid to buy APA Group, an operator of gas pipelines, for A$13 billion ($8 billion), on national security concerns.

The answer is somewhat up in the air, because Nvidia is in a solid-yet-fluid position. Market worries and announcement-filled event cancellations hover on one end, while the company's surprisingly bullish financial guidance stands out on the other.\nEither way, we've reached April without the company's usual announcement of\u00a0some new desktop hardware by March's end, and we still don't know when wholly new desktop GPUs might come (more on that later). Instead, we start this month with a different wave of products: a new slate of laptop-grade GPUs, albeit not that new.\nNvidia has announced a wave of \"Max-Q\" GPUs coming to laptops from 25 OEMs by the end of April, and most, but not all, come from the company's RTX line of GPUs. This month's wave of GPUs consists of three new laptop SKUs (RTX 2080 Super, RTX 2070 Super, GTX 1650 Ti) and slight updates to four existing SKUs (RTX 2070, RTX 2060, GTX 1660 Ti, GTX 1650). Each of these GPUs is built upon the manufacturer's Turing 12nm architecture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Nvidia provided this chart about its line of April 2020 Max-Q GPUs. This one doesn't include comparisons to last year's models.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia provided this chart about its line of April 2020 Max-Q GPUs. This one doesn't include comparisons to last year's models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      When pressed, Nvidia provided this clearer comparison between some of the 2019 RTX models and their \"Super\" upgrades in 2020.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen pressed, Nvidia provided this clearer comparison between some of the 2019 RTX models and their \"Super\" upgrades in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia provided this chart about its line of April 2020 Max-Q GPUs. This one doesn't include comparisons to last year's models.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen pressed, Nvidia provided this clearer comparison between some of the 2019 RTX models and their \"Super\" upgrades in 2020.\n\n\n\n\nBut as we learned from last year's \"Super\" line of desktop GPUs, those updates mostly consist of mild-yet-welcome jumps on nearly identical silicon, which is what we're seeing in two new Max-Q Super options. Both new Super Max-Q cards benefit the most from an apparent jump in maximum boost clocks, though it remains to be seen how those numbers bear out in the wild. Last year's cards launched with different maximum wattage counts, and that may be the same this time around as well. And they have very slight bumps in tensor core capacity, which is directed primarily at DirectX-based ray tracing and proprietary Nvidia RTX effects (like DLSS, which we get into later). Otherwise, they both continue to have 8GB of GDDR6 memory with a maximum of\u00a0448GB/s memory bandwidth, and they have each received a slight bump in \"CUDA core\" processing units (up 4.6 percent on the 2080 Super and 11.1 percent on the 2070 Super).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA press-only briefing ahead of the cards' reveal showed Nvidia coming up with ways to get further gains from these cards, which is why they tooted the horn of a few new features exclusive to this year's models. The biggest, dubbed \"Dynamic Boost,\" sees Nvidia partnering with OEMs to manage the shared thermal workload of both the CPU and GPU and to fudge up to 15W of power from one motherboard element to the other based on any application's live frame-time data. Meaning, if these sensors, as activated on the driver level, detect that either the GPU or CPU has been pushed to its maximum and that the other half could spare some power, the system will then redirect its total wattage accordingly.\n\"All of this is free\"\nNvidia representatives estimate that this system-level tweak will result in a performance boost of roughly 4 to 8 percent in any game. \"But all of this is free,\" Nvidia's marketing director, Mark Aevermann, said in a phone interview with Ars Technica. \"[The performance] was sitting there locked away because a controller wasn't smart enough to do this in the past.\" Worth noting, this feature requires total buy-in from an OEM before shipping a laptop with a new Nvidia GPU, owing to the system-level optimizations that Nvidia needs to confirm. So don't expect it to get patched into existing laptops with older GPUs. Additionally, as of press time, AMD CPUs do not work with Nvidia Dynamic Boost, and that support will arrive \"shortly thereafter,\" Aevermann said.\nAevermann mentioned additional tweaks designed to drive even smaller performance gains, including voltage optimizations for both the GPUs' GDDR6 memory and for the GPUs' general voltage regulators. These result in 1-2W of power recovery, Aevermann said, which they admitted was mild but insisted was crucial: \"We want every half-watt, quarter-watt, one-watt savings to drive the GPU core.\"\nLast on the optimization list is a feature that sounds great: \"Advanced Optimus.\" This is Nvidia's term for a new connector protocol to guarantee that a laptop's integrated-graphics solution doesn't get in the way of an Nvidia Max-Q GPU's direct connection to a laptop's display. Aevermann said that this is simply a more streamlined way for OEMs to guarantee screen technologies like variable refresh rates (G-Sync, FreeSync) and frame rates up to 144fps and beyond, even though we've seen both in Nvidia-powered laptops from the past two years. But this new toolset may also come with a licensing cost or other issues, because as of press time, only one upcoming laptop, the Lenovo Legion 7, has been confirmed to implement Advanced Optimus, with \"more coming later.\" (\"Advanced Optimus, like Dynamic Boost\u2014we offer it to OEMs, but it's up to them to implement it or not,\" Aevermann said to Ars.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      This whirring blade looked like a mess in the original implementation of DLSS.

DLSS 2.0 is indeed an impressive proposition, since its machine-trained anti-aliasing system can upscale 1080p footage to a whopping 4K pixel count with very little in the way of noticeable noise or distortion. So long as developers implement a temporal anti-aliasing system (TAA) in their game, then forward the results to Nvidia, an automatic model can be generated. If more games did so, that'd certainly be good news for anyone seeking value in their pricier RTX GPUs, laptop or otherwise.\n\n\n      $999 for RTX\n    \n  \n  Nvidia provided a list of upcoming laptops that will start at $999 with an RTX 2060 Max-Q built in. More may come later, Nvidia says.\n\nAcer Nitro 5\nASUS ROG Strix G15\nHP Omen 15\nLenovo Legion Y540\nLenovo Legion 5i\nMSI GF65 Thin\n\n\n\nOur own anecdotal testing of last week's DLSS 2.0 patch to the beautiful, ray-tracing-filled game Control revealed that the system mostly works as advertised and the images above aren't whistling Dixie: they're borne out by our own testing of the same game. But the effect is much better when a 1080p signal is processed to 4K resolution. The DLSS 2.0 up-conversion process continues to struggle with lower resolutions, particularly its attempts to scale 960p resolution to 1440p, so laptop buyers aiming for an RTX system with a 1440p monitor should be mindful. Aevermann said that its DLSS system will continue to be incrementally updated over time, so we hope lower-source resolutions receive greater emphasis going forward, especially for laptop systems that don't always ship with 4K monitors.\nWhile we were preparing this report, rumors about Nvidia's next series of Ampere-generation GPUs began picking up steam, with one report suggesting we'll have to wait until September 2020 to see any \"RTX 3000\" series cards. Anyone hoping to sink their teeth into interesting new Nvidia hardware will have to settle on this month's Max-Q line in the meantime. We hope to go hands-on with newly outfitted laptops by this month's end and will report back with our findings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Machkovech\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Machkovech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    35 Comments\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Comments\n  \n\n\nForum view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Loading comments...\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrev story\n\n\nNext story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Most Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\nEverything you say to your Echo will be sent to Amazon starting on March 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\u201cAwful\u201d: Roku tests autoplaying ads loading before the home screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\nReport: mRNA vaccines are in RFK Jr\u2019s crosshairs; funding in question\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\nTrump plan to fund Musk\u2019s Starlink over fiber called \u201cbetrayal\u201d of rural US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\nSobering revenue stats of 70K mobile apps show why devs beg for subscriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomize\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArs Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

However, it\u2019s likely that they\u2019ll be fully functional when the game is released later in the year.These features have the potential to make World of Warcraft look better and run faster on modern systems. Ray-tracing will bring more lifelike and accurate light and shadows to the venerable MMO, while VRS - currently supported on Nvidia's Turing graphics cards and Intel's Gen11 graphics architecture - will allow gamers\u2019 GPUs to identify areas in a frame that need to be rendered in full detail while reducing the detail of other parts of the frame, leading to better overall performance.Both of these features are staples of DirectX 12, which Microsoft developed with Nvidia in order to bring next-gen graphics features to Windows 10 PCs and the Xbox Series X. This hints that Blizzard could be planning a version World of Warcraft version for the next-generation console, along with Sony\u2019s PS5.Though unconfirmed, Blizzard has previously confirmed it was looking at bringing ray tracing to World of Warcraft. Game developers Michael Bybee and Patrick Magruder said in an interview on MMO-Champion that the \u201cthe engine team is working on taking advantage of RTX\".No woe for low-end systemsFor those worried that their old machine won\u2019t be able to handle the souped-up graphics, the developers added that World of Warcraft will continue to run well on all kinds of systems, saying they \"believe that the more machines that can run WoW, the better\".Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.This is an approach that Blizzard has taken with World of Warcraft for years.

In 2017, Intel acquired Jerusalem-based Mobileye for $15.3 billion, and in 2018 IFF bought out Haifa-based Frutarom for $7.1 billion.\nThis year has seen several lucrative M&A deals for Israeli companies despite the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The most recent was private equity firm Hellman & Friedman\u2019s acquisition of Israeli cybersecurity company Checkmarx at a valuation of $1.15 billion in March.\nThe NVIDIA acquisition combines its computing expertise with Mellanox\u2019s networking technology to offer customers higher performance, greater utilization of computing resources and lower operating costs.\n\u201cThis is a powerful, complementary combination of cultures, technology and ambitions,\u201d commented Eyal Waldman, founder and CEO of Mellanox. \u201cWe look forward to bringing NVIDIA products and solutions into our markets, and to bringing Mellanox products and solutions into NVIDIA\u2019s markets.\u201d\nFounded in 1999, Mellanox pioneered the InfiniBand interconnect technology, which along with its high-speed Ethernet products is now used in over half of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers and in many leading hyperscale data centers. The company employs nearly 3,000 people in Israel and in Sunnyvale, California.\nMellanox and NVIDIA have a long history of collaboration and joint innovation, reflected in their recent contributions in building the world\u2019s two fastest supercomputers, Sierra and Summit, operated by the US Department of Energy. Many of the world\u2019s top cloud service providers also use both NVIDIA GPUs and Mellanox interconnects.\nNVIDIA opened a design center in Israel in 2016, and an AI research center in 2018. The company previously pledged \u201cto continue investing in local excellence and talent in Israel, one of the world\u2019s most important technology centers.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYOU CAN GET ISRAEL21c NEWS DELIVERED STRAIGHT TO YOUR INBOX.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSubscribe today\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFighting for Israel's truth\nWe cover what makes life in Israel so special \u2014 it's people.\u00a0A non-profit organization, ISRAEL21c's team of journalists are committed to telling stories that humanize Israelis and show their positive impact on our world.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nAn unknown and never before seen Nvidia graphics card has appeared in an online database. The server GPU, brandishing the PG506 codename, appears to be a next-generation NVLink-compatible graphics module\u2014the likely successor to the Volta V100\u2014and our best lead so far as to the release of the so-called 'Ampere' architecture... unless Nvidia's just iterating on Volta again in the server space.All we've available to us in the way of specifications is the model name 'PG506', registered today, April 7, 2020, along with a brief description that reads: \"Server Graphics Module\". That code is telling of this card's purpose, however, as it continues on from the PG502 Volta accelerator announced back in May 2017 at GTC and released later that same year.The PG500 was the PCIe based version of the Tesla V100, and the first to actually look like a traditional graphics card before the Titan V got released in December.The PG504 was the latest of the same string of server GPU modules to be released: a 32GB version of the V100 that was announced back in March 2018, once again at GTC.(Image credit: Nvidia)All of the different GPU codenames were registered on the Korean National Radio Research Agency prior to availability\u2014the PG504 was registered in July and released five months later in December.\u00a0Hence why today's listing of a PG506 is so telling, it preempts a wider release of a new server GPU this year.Such a card would, should it follow the expected Ampere codename, garner the shorthand of 'A100', but don't quote us on that. For one, we're not entirely convinced ourselves that the Ampere codename is destined for Nvidia's next-gen architecture, that's just the general scuttlebutt about town. Though the Ampere codename\u2014after physicist Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re\u2014remains the bookie's favourite for the time being.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The next-generation server architecture was heavily rumoured to be making its first appearance at Nvidia's Graphics Technology Conference in San Jose this year, likely in the hands of Jen-Hsun Huang at the CEO's keynote. However, GTC was shifted online and Nvidia's major announcements postponed, leaving us in the dark a little longer.The original plan then, as widely suspected, was to release a new server card at GTC 2020. This card would likely utilise the high-bandwidth NVLink connection via a server baseboard, the likes of which we've also spotted on the RRA under the codename 'P4597' today.These codes don't necessarily confirm an architectural change with the PG506. Yet another refresh of Volta would feel a little dour after some three years in the hot seatBut is all this portent of a GeForce graphics card release? No, not really. Past launches aren't much to go on\u2014Volta and Turing were a year apart\u2014and today's announcement only confirms the server NVLink-compatible part, not a PCIe GPU we'd require for our gaming PCs.You see, Nvidia forked its GeForce and server parts back with Volta, instead choosing to lean on the Turing architecture in the RTX 20-series to carry to gaming torch once Pascal was waning in popularity and power. It's been suspected that the same thing would occur this time around, with an announcement from Nvidia\u2014now a server-first company\u2014in the data centre prior to a GeForce release.\u00a0So this doesn't necessarily detail an imminent change in the best graphics card lineup, although Nvidia is suspected to make good on rumours of a new GeForce graphics card generation to fend off AMD's RDNA 2.0 graphics card towards the end of the year.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nJacob RidleySocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, HardwareJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. for\u00a0Tirias ResearchFollow AuthorApr 14, 2020, 03:26pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.Enabling ray tracing with Nvidia's RTX technology creates a much more immersive Minecraft ... [+] environment.Nvidia\nAs I reported in my previous post (Immersive Realism Comes To Minecraft Through Ray Tracing From Nvidia), the addition of Nvidia\u2019s RTX graphics ray tracing technology transformed the cartoon-like environment of Minecraft to a true virtual environment. The announcement of Minecraft\u2019s adoption of ray tracing was announced back in August, but the first beta update of the platform will finally be available on Thursday, April 16, 2020, with additional capabilities.\n\nForbesImmersive Realism Comes To Minecraft Through Ray Tracing From NVIDIABy Jim McGregor\nYou may be wondering why this is so exciting. If you ask the four teenagers currently taking online classes and social distancing in my house, they will tell you that it is because \u201cyou can do anything in Minecraft.\u201d According to Damian McGregor, \u201cMinecraft is like digital Legos with a 3D printer \u2013 you can not only play and build anything, you can also create your own blocks.\u201d Minecraft is much more than a game; it is a virtual environment that seems to have no boundaries. People can connect from anywhere and create a virtual world that not only mimics the real world but often extends its boundaries. The organization Reporters Without Borders has created a library of content to make it available to people that would normally not have access due to censorship. And in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak, students at colleges, such as Berklee College of Music and Boston University, are taking to Minecraft to create their own virtual campuses and even planning virtual graduation ceremonies. While already impressive, these virtual worlds are about to get a huge boost.\n\nThe RTX technology includes ray tracing (the reflection, refraction, and scattering of light) plus ... [+] new block textures and illumination.NvidiaNew texture and material features in Minecraft enabled by Nvidia's RTX technology.Nvidia\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nWith the beta version supporting ray tracing, Minecrafters can now create more realistic environments. The first noticeable difference is the use of light and how it fills environments and reflects, refracts, and scatters through and off surfaces just like natural light, but it doesn\u2019t stop there. There are additional features to enhance the blocks beyond just the color and transparency (opacity), including changing or adding metallic characteristics, illumination (referred to as emissive), height (referred to as normal), and texture (referred to as roughness). The illumination or emissive feature is particularly impressive, allowing everything from water to structures to be illuminated.\n\n\nAlso added is the ability to leverage the processing power of the tensor cores on the RTX GPUs through Nvidia\u2019s DLSS2 (Deep Learning Super Sampling), which allows up to a 2x performance increase by rendering at a lower resolution (i.e. 1080p), then using AI to upscale the image to full native resolution (i.e. 4K)\u2014all while delivering the image quality of the full native resolution.\n\n\n Nvidia is also offering free maps (environments) that leverage the newest features and tools to ... [+] assists developers.Nvidia\nTo inspire creators, Nvidia is also releasing six free RTX environments, or maps as they refer to them, and tools that include textures, HD resources, a materials guide, and a Java to Bedrock conversion guide to assist Minecraft developers. You can view a brief video of the new technology on YouTube.\nTo use these new features, users will need a PC with Nvidia RTX graphics. The desktop RTX card starts around $299 and mobile PCs with discrete RTX graphics start around $999. My evaluators will be using two desktop PCs featuring AMD Threadripper CPUs and RTX 2070 Super and RTX 2060 Super GPUs.ForbesGaming Notebooks Get A Boost From AMD, Intel And NvidiaBy Kevin Krewell\nFor the estimated 480 million people already enjoying Minecraft (according to the number of accounts), the ray tracing technology enhances the experience. But, to non-Minecrafters, the new images are mesmerizing and sure to draw in new players and creators. Look for more updates on this topic as I and my four teenagers/evaluators get early access to start playing and creating with the new Minecraft.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.The author and members of the Tirias Research staff do not hold equity positions in any of the companies mentioned.

Both make the jump to the 10th generation Intel Core lineup of processors, and the Triton 500 also gets the new RTX Super GPUs.\nAcer Predator Triton 500 Updates\n\nWe got a chance to review this laptop back in 2019, and it offered quite a bit of performance in a very small and light chassis, with some unique features as well. Today Acer is refreshing the lineup with even more performance with the latest CPUs from Intel, and GPUs up to the NVIDIA RTX 2080 Super Max-Q. But Acer has also added a few new features as well, including an optional 300 Hz IPS display, up from 144 Hz last year, and Wi-Fi 6 thanks to the Killer AX1650i. And as a bonus, the new model offers a per-key RGB backlit keyboard, stepping up from the zoned keyboard backlighting last year.\nOne of the key features of the Predator Triton 500 was its portable design, and luckily Acer hasn\u2019t had to made the device any thicker or heavier. It still weighs just 4.63 lbs, and is only 0.7-inches thick which is the same dimensions as last year. But to help with cooling, Acer has tweaked the cooling with their Vortex Flow design, offering three fans, 4th generation AeroBlade 3D fans with serrated edges, and five heat pipes. Overall, Acer says they are getting 33% better thermal performance than the 2019 model.\nThe updated Triton 500 will be available in May starting at $2199.99 USD.\nAcer Nitro 5 Updates\n\nWe\u2019ve also reviewed the Acer Nitro 5 last year, although the AMD powered model, and the Nitro 5 is all the way at the other end of the spectrum compared to Acer\u2019s Triton 500, but still offers great performance in a much less expensive design. For 2020, Acer is adding some nice upgrades which should help address some of the shortcomings of the previous model.\nOn the CPU side, Acer will offer up to a Core i7-10750H, which offers six cores, twelve threads, and up to 5 GHz of frequency. This coupled with the GeForce GTX 1650, 1650 Ti, and RTX 2060, should offer some great gaming performance in this price range. There are two M.2 PCIe slots, as well as a 1 TB HDD offering, and up to 32 GB of DDR4 which is user-replaceable.\nOne key shortcoming of the 2019 model was the display, but the 2020 model is shipping with two new display panels which will hopefully address the color gamut. What it does add is high-refresh, with both 120 Hz and 144 Hz IPS panels at 1920x1080 resolution, which Acer claim are 3 ms and 300 nit capable.\n\nAcer has also tweaked the cooling, with a new dual-fan design. There are four heat vents, and overall the new cooling system offers a 25% improvement over the 2019 model, which is not insignificant.\nThe 2020 version also features the Intel AX201 WiFi 6 network card, and Killer E2600 Ethernet.\nThe best part of the Nitro 5 is its price, and for 2020 it continues to be one of the easiest ways into a gaming laptop.

It's not sleek like Razor, it's not innovative like Asus' Zephyrus lineup or aggressive as Strix, it's not futuristic as Alienware, it's not as angular or silly as Omen...But hey, RGB keyboard and seemingly an extra fan\n\n\n\nhemedans - Tuesday, April 7, 2020 - link\nthey are cheaper, you can find them easily around  $600 with decent gpu like 1050\n\n\n\nArnav_B - Tuesday, April 7, 2020 - link\nI kinda like the hardware design - not as sleek as I usually prefer but its not bad ! Alienware however is still a personal favorite !\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

The number of viewers is at an all-time high, meaning streamers are enjoying their highest view counts ever. Professional sports are transforming into virtual Players Leagues. DJs and musicians are streaming their performances to fans around the world. And unsurprisingly, streaming apps like OBS, Streamlabs and XSplit are seeing record downloads.\nIf you want to join in on the streaming fun, we\u2019ve put together this beginner\u2019s guide full of tips, tricks, and setup guides to help you get started and give your audience the best viewing experience possible.\nHere at NVIDIA, we\u2019re working on some exciting AI features for streaming that combine to create the\u00a0RTX Broadcast Engine. The features are still in development, but you can contribute by providing audio and video samples for our AI to train.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat hardware do I use?\nThe quickest and easiest way to get started is to give it a shot with what you got. Play around with the PC you have at home and have friends give you feedback on your stream quality.\nMost gamers realise pretty quickly how big of an impact streaming can have on system performance if you don\u2019t have the right hardware. You may need to lower graphics settings if your framerate drops and gameplay starts to chug.\nIf you have a GeForce GPU, you have access to the NVIDIA Encoder (NVENC) to encode with minimal system impact. By shifting the encoding to a dedicated part of GeForce GPUs, you\u2019re able to play and stream (even on a laptop!) with maximum quality and performance. And there\u2019s a range of GeForce GPUs, from the capable and budget-friendly GeForce GTX 1650 Super up to the flagship GeForce RTX 2080 Ti.\nFor more on NVENC, check out the short video below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you need to update more than just your GPU, check out RTX Studio desktops and laptops, purpose-built for creators. They\u2019re perfect for the transition from work to play and create.\nIf you want to build or buy a custom PC, here are some recommendations on optimal system specs to meet different budgets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also head to PC Part Picker for awesome build and configuration guides specifically for streaming PCs.\nOnce you get the hang of streaming, upgrading your peripherals is next.\u00a0Typically, you\u2019ll want to look for:\n\nWebcam: A nice 1080p60 webcam will meet most streaming needs. The most popular one is the Logitech C920, but you can also check out their newly released StreamCam. There are 4K webcam options as well if you plan to stream at max resolution on YouTube.\nMicrophone: There are plenty of great headsets with built-in mics available from popular brands like Logitech, Corsair or Razer (to name a few). You can also get a standalone, higher-end microphone from Blue, Audio-Technica, Rode or Shure.\nLights: It\u2019s important to properly light the subject of a scene, but also to light the scene itself. You can use Elgato\u2019s Key Lights. If you like their aesthetic, RGB strips add a nice pop of colour.\nGreenscreen: if you want to remove your background for privacy, or because you have a cool idea for a background, grab a greenscreen and apply a chroma key. Elgato has great portable greenscreen options.\nChair: This is often overlooked, but it\u2019s incredibly important to have a comfortable chair. It doesn\u2019t need to be a gaming chair, but make sure it has good ergonomics, like the Ikea Markus.\n\nNow that the hardware is in place, it\u2019s time to start setting up your stream for maximum quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat software do I use?\nLive streaming software has come a long way. Applications are now easier to use, and more efficient. We\u2019ve worked with the top ecosystem partners to help accelerate their solutions for GeForce GPUs, reducing the performance impact of streaming with NVENC to almost nothing.\nIf you have a GeForce GPU, you have access to GeForce Experience \u2014 a free software that makes starting your streaming journey easy.\nThere are also many excellent broadcast applications available for use that provide more advanced functionality. The most popular app is OBS Studio. You can also opt for the Streamlabs mod of OBS, which adds popular plugins and themes to OBS.\nIf you prefer a simple, guided experience to shepherd you into the world of streaming, Twitch Studio (if streaming to Twitch) and XSplit Gamecaster are great, easy-to-use solutions.\nOne notable alternative is Discord\u2019s new Go Live feature. It allows you to stream your gameplay to a Discord channel. This is a great way to start streaming, as you can test it out with a smaller group of friends or acquaintances in a private setting, and get the hang of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat settings do I use for my stream?\nFirst you\u2019ll want to choose your encoder. If you have a GeForce GPU, NVENC will provide higher quality streams, better performance (more FPS!) and reduce your CPU overhead. It also allows you to record at higher resolutions and higher frame rates.\nTo configure OBS Studio, follow the below video guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some detailed, step-by-step guides to configuring your stream for maximum performance and quality:\n\nOBS Studio NVENC Setup Guide\nStreamLabs NVENC Setup Guide\nXSplit Broadcaster NVENC Guide\n\nIf you\u2019re curious about how NVENC\u2019s quality compares to x264, NVENC on RTX GPUs is on par with x264 Medium, while the NVENC on GTX GPUs compares to x264 Faster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat artwork/overlays do I need?\nOverlays are transparent graphics that appear \u2018over\u2019 your gameplay and camera feed. We recommend using overlays to customise your channel and make it unique, and to help you start building an audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a high level, you will want to add these:\n\nWebcam Frame: Decorates your webcam outline.\nStream Alerts and Event Overlays: Animated notifications that appear on-screen when viewers interact with your stream.\nProfile Panels: Static graphics pinned to your Twitch profile, below your stream.\nStream Screens: Screens to show when your stream is about to start, Intermissions, or is Offline.\n\nOur friends at Visuals by Impulse have put together a comprehensive beginner\u2019s guide to overlays, with info on where to get overlays and how to set them up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOK, I\u2019m ready to stream. What do I do now?\nSetting everything up is just the beginning. What\u2019s important is what comes after: choosing what your stream will be about, your stream persona, what platform you\u2019ll be streaming to, setting up your channel correctly, and learning how to promote yourself. Whew!\nFor newcomers, the best advice is to stream what you love doing \u2014 your favorite game, a craft, etc. \u2014 and engage the community to see how it feels. Getting the hang of doing something and interacting with people through chat takes a bit of time. Then you can focus on adding more personality and shape to your stream.\nThere are plenty of great resources that explain this in more detail, so we\u2019ll leave this one to the experts:\n\nEposVox\nGaming Careers\nAlpha Gaming\nMuaaz\n\nIf you have a great streaming resource or favourite channel, share it below!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips for new streamers\n\nDon\u2019t use more than 75% of your upload bandwidth (e.g. If your upload speed is 10 Mbps, you should use 7.5 Mbps max). Check the setup guides above for directions on how to test your bandwidth.\nYour bandwidth determines the resolution you can output. Don\u2019t try to push 1080p unless you can stream at 8 Mbps or higher. You know how bad a Netflix show looks when you have little bandwidth? That\u2019s what will happen to your stream if you don\u2019t have a high enough bitrate to support your target resolution. Instead, use a lower resolution (i.e. 720p) and your stream will look a LOT better. Check the setup guides!\nIf you\u2019re streaming games, make sure your version of Windows is 1903 or above (Start > Settings > Windows Specifications > Version #), and turn Game Mode on in Windows. This will help avoid lag in your stream.\nIf you\u2019re trying to stream a demanding game, know that your system now needs to do two things: game and encode. You want to ensure that it can handle both. If you\u2019re encoding on NVENC, you can just run your app in high priority mode (e.g. in OBS Studio or Streamlabs just run the app as Administrator, in XSplit Broadcaster toggle it in the settings) and that will ensure your stream remains smooth.\nTest your stream. Record yourself with the settings you\u2019re going to use and check it out. Stream by yourself for 5-10 minutes and view your own recording.\n\n\u2026 and that\u2019s it! We hope this was helpful and that it aids you on your journey to everlasting streaming stardom.

This free-to-play title features dynamic and frantic battle royale gameplay with up to 150 players on the largest Call of Duty battleground ever.\nCall of Duty: Warzone puts a new spin on massive combat arenas by taking the difficulty away from looting, while giving you new missions to complete during the course of the battle that reward aggressive play and map traversal. And the fight doesn\u2019t end once you die. Even if your teammates are unable to revive you, you\u2019re placed in the Gulag where you compete one-on-one with another fallen combatant for a chance to respawn with your squad. Whether you are in Verdansk or in the Gulag - high FPS unlocks your potential and increases your chances of hitting that game winning shot. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe firefights in Call of Duty: Warzone can end in the blink of an eye, so making sure you have every possible advantage is vital. Whether you\u2019re a seasoned pro or a newcomer to the battle royale genre, high FPS gameplay grants you several benefits. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy High Frames Per Second (FPS) Matters when Playing Call of Duty: Warzone\nSmoother Animations:\nIn Call of Duty: Warzone, player movement is fast. Whether you are holding the angle or peeking a corner, high FPS paired with a high refresh rate display provides improved clarity and comprehension when it really matters. Additionally, the smoother motion provided by the increased frame rate allows you more opportunities to correct your aim - making it easier to track those targets as they sprint by. At 240 FPS/Hz you are given 4 times the information with 4 times the opportunities to make micro-corrections to your aim over 60 FPS/Hz!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReduced Distracting Effects\nIn the heat of the moment, being reactive is critical. Sifting through distracting effects like tearing or ghosting takes precious milliseconds and can impact your ability to perceive the situation correctly. High FPS on a high Hz display significantly reduces these distracting effects by decreasing the size of the ghost trail and tear displacement. Reducing distracting effects ensures you are actually aiming at the right thing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Players Earlier:\nWhen milliseconds matter, seeing your opponent a split second earlier can give you an advantage in a fight. Higher FPS reduces the overall system latency of your computer which means your actions and the state of the game are displayed on your monitor faster. Lower system latency helps improve your reaction times and makes input feel snappier - critical for a fast paced game like Call of Duty: Warzone.\nFor more information on why high FPS matters, check out our in-depth technical article, \u201cWhy Does High FPS Matter For Esports?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing For Battle: Competitive Play at 144+ FPS\nThe first step in preparing for this 150-person battle royale is making sure you\u2019ve got the right hardware and settings for high FPS gameplay. Call of Duty: Warzone is full of detail and features an expansive open world map that can be a challenge to render.\u00a0 To take advantage of all the benefits we showed above, you will need a powerful GPU to achieve high FPS. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivision recently published their competitive specifications for Call of Duty: Warzone, which recommend the GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER at high settings. With this powerful GPU, the vast majority of your time battling in Verdansk will be above 144 FPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to optimize Call of Duty: Warzone\u2019s Settings for 240 FPS\nUsing competitive settings can boost your FPS and allow you to make the push for 240FPS. We found the following settings combination from Prosettings.net in conjunction with image sharpening in the NVIDIA control panel to be the best combination for competitive play. Achieving 240 FPS can depend on your in game situation, the version of the game, and the total PC configuration.\u00a0 Competitive settings also come with an image quality tradeoff: shadows will be less realistic and a bit blockier, less accurate reflections, and the quality of explosions will be reduced.\nIf you are less concerned about image quality and still want to try to make the push for 240 FPS, let\u2019s first dive into the Call of Duty: Warzone settings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways remember to set Fullscreen mode as it reduces system latency. Some of these settings are personal preference, so tweak them to find what you like! One thing to note, is that the render scale has been reduced to 90%. This will result in a small performance boost in trade for a slight loss in image quality. However, turning on image sharpening in the control panel nearly negates any image quality loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to turn on image sharpening in the NVIDIA Control Panel: \n1. Open NVCPL (right-click the desktop, select NVIDIA Control Panel) 2. Select \u201cManage 3D settings\u201d 3. Select \u201cProgram Settings\u201d\na. Select Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (if you don\u2019t see it in the list, untick \u201cShow only programs found on this computer\u201d or select \u201cAdd\u201d)\n4. Turn on Image sharpening with default settings, using our latest GeForce Game Ready Driver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Once you are done, apply your settings and restart the game.\nUsing the settings outlined above, you should see a nice boost in FPS the next time you drop in. The framerates you achieve will vary depending on the components in your machine, so be sure to tune your hardware for maximum performance by killing unnecessary services, closing perf-sapping programs, and overclocking your CPU, RAM and GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrames Win Games\nAfter digging into the benefits that we\u2019ve outlined above, we spent time studying K/D ratios in both Fortnite and PUBG to see their correlation to high-FPS gaming.

The more efficient this energy transfer is, the more productive that cell can be.\nResearchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Arizona State University are simulating photosynthetic organisms to understand how they capture energy \u2014 and how they could be made even more productive.\nApplied to agriculture, this kind of optimization would mean a bigger crop yield. In healthcare, it could mean improving the delivery of antibodies and peptides in precision medicine, or even extending the lifespan of cells. And in the energy industry, it could improve the efficiency of biofuels.\n\u201cAny given plant wants to be able to live anywhere, so it will optimize its underlying machinery to survive in a range of environmental conditions,\u201d said Abhishek Singharoy, assistant professor in the School of Molecular Sciences at ASU. \u201cAs scientists and engineers, we can make a more productive variant of that plant to get more energy out of it for us.\u201d\nSingharoy and his collaborators run their molecular dynamics simulations on NVIDIA GPU-accelerated supercomputers, including the world\u2019s fastest system, Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u2019s Summit. They presented their work in one of more than 150 online talks at GTC Digital.\nThrowing Light on Photosynthesis\u2019 Efficiency\nGreen plants photosynthesize, converting sunlight into food. But in many organisms, less than 10 percent of the solar energy absorbed is turned into usable nutrients. To understand why, the researchers used a GPU-accelerated simulation of a purple bacteria\u2019s photosynthetic apparatus.\nThe atomic-scale simulation can model 136 million atoms and their movements for 500 nanoseconds, or half a microsecond, on the Summit supercomputer.\nBy moving to the Summit supercomputer from its predecessor, Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u2019s Titan system, the team saw a 6x speedup in run time. They used, on average, 922 nodes on the system to run their simulation. Each node contains six NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s useful to build the entire thing at atomic resolution to make sure you have a realistic model,\u201d said Jim Phillips, senior research programmer at the University of Illinois. \u201cTo run a dynamic model of that size fast enough, you need GPU parallelization.\u201d\nHowever, to capture the process of light turning to energy during photosynthesis, the researchers needed to run a longer simulation of a few dozen milliseconds. So rather than simulating each atom individually, they introduced approximations to simplify the cell into rigid domains \u2014 getting them to the 30-millisecond mark.\nFrom there, the team extended their predictions to determine how long the cell would take to reproduce under different light conditions. They found that the bacteria thrives best in low-light conditions \u2014 an adaptation to its muddy water habitat.\n\u201cWe knew that the bacteria is found in muddy water, but were able to figure out why it survives in that environment,\u201d Singharoy said. \u201cIts underlying structure is built such that it cannot produce more energy in conditions with more sunlight. So it would rather stay in a zone with less light.\u201d\nPurple bacteria is just the start. It\u2019s a relatively simple organism where data was available for all protein structures that needed to be simulated. As datasets are released for more complex photosynthetic organisms, such as spinach plants, the researchers aim to simulate those, informing efforts to develop more productive variants of the plant.\nThe researchers also hope to use the current simulation to train a neural network that can make predictions about cell behavior based on machine learning, instead of molecular dynamics.\nTo learn more about this research, watch the GTC Digital talk by Singharoy and Phillips.\n\n\nCategories: Research | SupercomputingTags: GTC 2020 | GTC Digital | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Science | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It appears that Huawei, the world's second largest smartphone vendor (sitting between Samsung and Apple), is reducing its N7 and N5 orders at TSMC due to a downturn in smartphone sales.\nAs a big player in smartphones facing USA blacklisting and a Google app blockade, Huawei's move might have freed up lots of production capacity at TSMC and cause problems for the contract chip maker. However, this hasn't proved to be the case with tech titans like AMD, Apple, and Nvidia queuing up to fill TSMC's order books.\n\nWith reference to TSMC's N5 process, ChainNews, via RetiredEngineer, reports that Apple quickly stepped in to take up the slack provided by Huawei's cut-backs. It adds that Apple has, additionally, asked TSMC to add nearly 10,000 wafers per month (wpm) in Q4, for it next gen iDevices.\nInterestingly, both Apple and AMD are looking to book 'N5 Enhanced' production capacity at TSMC for later in the year. This enhanced process was developed specifically for AMD, says the report.\nTSMC has yet to open its full capacity for N5 but it will have reached this milestone by mid-year. It also plans to keep up with N7 orders which are fully booked at least to the end of 2020. On the topic of N7, the report states that Huawei HiSilicon also reduced its orders with TSMC using this process. This capacity has been keenly taken up by AMD again, as well as Nvidia, says the report.\nSK hynix reinvests in its foundry division\nAnother interesting story unearthed by Retired Engineer suggests that SK hynix has reinvested in its foundry division due to anxieties over supply chains. \"SK Hynix has high hopes for its fab in Wuxi, China, which is expected to be completed by the end of June,\" reports Semi Insights. SK hynix has also signed up to participate in the MagnaChip Cheongju Plant 'Fab 4' as a limited partner for non-memory production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n178\nCheer up!

Amazon is selling the 2019\u00a0Nvidia Shield TV for just $130. That\u2019s $20 off the usual price, and the all-time low. If Amazon\u2019s sale runs out, Best Buy is selling the streamer via eBayRemove non-product link\u00a0for the same price.\nThis new Shield TV is a departure from its original 2017-era streaming box, but in a good way. While the original was an enthusiast\u2019s dream, offering the ability to perform tasks like game-streaming and running Plex servers but suffering from a complex interface\u2014a tradition continued by the $200 Shield TV Pro\u2014this 2019 model\u00a0stays laser-focused on streaming videos and music via Android TV, bolstered by some impressively geeky features. We loved it.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get super-fast performance, impressive 4K upscaling, solid HDR, object-based soundtrack support, and a remote that raises the bar for other streaming players,\u201d we said in our review.\nNvidia\u2019s excellent piece of kit handles 4K HDR via Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos audio decoding, though it doesn\u2019t support HDR10+. It also has impressive 4K upscaling for HD videos, and the remote has backlit buttons.\u00a0One end of the tube-shaped Shield TV sports power and ethernet, while the offers an HDMI port and a microSD slot.\n\u201cThe Nvidia Shield TV is still the best Android TV box, and it\u2019s not just for techies anymore,\u201d our review concluded. And today it\u2019s $20 off. Enough said.\n[Today\u2019s deal: Android Shield TV (2019) for $130 on Amazon.]\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tPCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Notice\nEuropean Privacy Settings\nMember Preferences\nEditorial independence\nLicensing & Eprints\nCalifornia: Do not Sell my Personal Info\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nAd Choice\nContact Us\nFoundry Careers\nGamePro\nSmart Answers\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPCWorld Categories \n\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe \n\n\n\n\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 IDG Communications, Inc. \n\n\n\nExplore the Foundry Network +\nTech AdvisorMacworld \n\n\n\n\nTop Of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDo Not Sell My Info\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Settings\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We've seen it recently with some of the older AMD APUs finding their way into new motherboard\u00a0designs, but here it's a case of a base GPU returning to the market. ASUS\u00a0has listed on its website a 'new' GT 710: this is a super low end graphics chip with 192 CUDA cores on the 87 mm2 GK208 Kepler die that originally launched in late 2015 / early 2016. The goal of this sort of graphics card us to supply basic video outputs to machines that do not come with any integrated graphics on the processor.\n\nWhat's different about this card, which comes with 2 GB of GDDR5 memory, is that it has four HDMI video outputs. On a modern graphics card you might expect a DisplayPort or two, but here it's all just HDMI. Despite the GK208 GPU not supporting HDMI 2.0 natively, this is the sort of card that is going to take advantage of NVIDIA opening up 4K60 with 4:2:0 subchroma sampling support on Kepler, which makes it useful for video at the most (you won't want to be running a full desktop experience with it).\nASUS states that the card can support 4K60 in this mode when one monitor is attached, or 4K30 when multiple displays are attached. Obviously with this horsepower we're not going to be doing any gaming - it's simply at the cheap end of the spectrum for office machines or library machines or similar. ASUS suggests using multiple cards at once for anyone that needs 12-16+ displays.\n\nThis card uses a PCIe 2.0 x1 connection, ensuring compatibility for a wide range of older machines, and offers a 954 MHz engine clock and a 5000 MHz memory clock. The GT710-4H-SL-2GD5 is expected to be in the ~$50 range when it comes to market.\nSource: FanlessTech, ASUS\nRelated Reading\n\nNVIDIA To Move Mobile Kepler GPUs to Legacy Status in April 2019 (& 3D Vision Too)\nNVIDIA 344.48 WHQL Drivers Available; DSR Added To Fermi & Kepler\nNVIDIA Kepler Cards Get HDMI 4K@60Hz Support (Kind Of)\n\nGallery: ASUS Launches An Old GPU: The NVIDIA GT 710 with Four HDMI Ports\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n52 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nFlunk - Monday, April 13, 2020 - link\nLooks like something you'd want to run billboards or other large high-res multi-unit displays.\n\n\n\nDanNeely - Monday, April 13, 2020 - link\nYup.  Looking on Newegg the standard GT710 config is 1xDVI, 1xVGA, 1xHDMI; with some cards dropping the VGA to save a few pennies and hit half-height size. (Many of the rest have the VGA on a ribbon cable; and could do the same by unplugging it and swapping for a smaller bracket.)For the digital signs/etc market this is intended for cheap is the name of the game; an old small design on a mature and now very cheap 28nm process is exactly what they want.  It's all about cramming in as many outputs as possible as cheaply as possible.\n\n\n\nMenhirMike - Monday, April 13, 2020 - link\nAye. Especially since these are x1 and single slot, you can fit 6 of them in an ATX board and drive 24 displays at the same time - that would be a neat video wall, or command center.\n\n\n\nSamus - Tuesday, April 14, 2020 - link\nIt's unfortunate they couldn't pick even a slightly higher-spec GPU that could drive more displays simultaneously at 4K60.\n\n\n\nCaedenV - Tuesday, April 14, 2020 - link\nthat was my first thought too, until I read that it was 4K 4:2:0.  That is literally only good for video.  Any kind of text or static slideshow would look terrible with that.And 4 4k videos running off the same 5 year old low-end card?  I wonder what kind of encoding it would need to be to play back without stuttering. \n\n\n\ndoubledeej - Tuesday, April 14, 2020 - link\n4:2:0 isn't as bad as it might seem with text -- it only becomes an issue with small, colored text on a colored background.  If either the text or background is either black or white you literally can't tell the difference between 4:2:0 and 4:4:4\n\n\n\nballsystemlord - Monday, April 13, 2020 - link\n@Ian , what's wrong with MB integrated GFX, or an APU, or a different low-end GPU offering (such as RX530/RX540)?What makes this part needed?\n\n\n\nads295 - Monday, April 13, 2020 - link\nI think it's pretty obvious that the video ports coupled with 4K outputs are the USP here.\n\n\n\nballsystemlord - Monday, April 13, 2020 - link\nThe RX530 and RX540 both support 4k.\n\n\n\nDeath666Angel - Monday, April 13, 2020 - link\nWhere do you get something like an RX 530 or 540? Neither Amazon, nor Ebay, nor the few price comparison websites I frequent list those GPUs. And Ian never said the things you mentioned to be inferior. He specifically mentions that some systems just don't have iGPUs. If you find a new RX 530 with similar specs in the wild, maybe sent him a tweet and he'll do a news piece about it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

The company eventually decided to jump on the cloud gaming bandwagon by opening up its GeForce NOW service to Android. After conducting a limited beta, NVIDIA has started to allow anyone to enjoy hassle-free cloud gaming since February. Unlike competitors such as Google Stadia and Microsoft xCloud, GeForce NOW allows end-users to stream games that they already purchased on Steam, Epic Games Store, Battle.net, and Uplay, but there is a catch! Digital game stores, as well as publishers, have the authority to revoke the games to be streamed, and it looks like GeForce NOW is going to lose access to a bunch of titles starting today (April 24). \nDespite NVIDIA's endeavor to bring in new content to the streaming service every week, it will lose games from Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, XBOX Game Studios, Codemasters, and Klei Entertainment. No official explanations have been offered for every single instance of why publishers are leaving GeForce NOW, but it could be related to the revenue generation policy and/or exclusive deals with other cloud gaming platforms. While game publishers have had to explicitly work with Google to port their games onto Stadia, GeForce NOW basically runs the games from Steam from a remote PC, thus blocking the publishers to demand extra fees for having their games be playable on other platforms, e.g. PC games are playable on Android. Some of the existing collaborations might be intended for the beta period and the expirations are basically inevitable after the service's public launch, recasting the idea as merely a theory - just one of many unknowns.\nNot all of today\u2019s news is bad, though, as Ubisoft is reportedly advancing on their cloud strategy with NVIDIA GeForce NOW. Chris Early, senior vice president of partnerships at Ubisoft, commented:\n\n\n\nUbisoft fully supports NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce NOW with complete access to our PC games from the Ubisoft Store or any supported game stores. We believe it\u2019s a leading-edge service that gives current and new PC players a high-end experience with more choice in how and where they play their favorite games. \n\n\nExpand the list below to see all the Ubisoft games that have been added to GeForce NOW library till date:\n\n\n\n            List of Ubisoft games on GeForce NOW\n    \n\n \n\n                                        Assassin's Creed II Deluxe Edition (Uplay version)\n                        \n\n                                        Assassin's Creed III Remastered (Steam)\n                        \n\n                                        Assassin\u2019s Creed Brotherhood (Steam)\n                        \n\n                                        Assassin\u2019s Creed: Revelations (Uplay)\n                        \n\n                                        Heroes of Might & Magic III - HD Edition (Steam)\n                        \n\n                                        Heroes of Might & Magic V (Uplay and Steam)\n                        \n\n                                        Heroes of Might & Magic V: Tribes of the East (Uplay and Steam)\n                        \n\n                                        Might & Magic: Heroes VI (Uplay)\n                        \n\n                                        Might & Magic Heroes VII (Uplay and Steam)\n                        \n\n                                        TrackMania\u00b2 Stadium (Uplay and Steam)\n                        \n\n                                        The Shattering (released day-and-date on Tuesday)\n                        \n\n                                        Call to Arms\n                        \n\n                                        Conan Unconquered\n                        \n\n                                        Creative Destruction\n                        \n\n                                        Darksiders: Warmastered Edition\n                        \n\n                                        Dead Age\n                        \n\n                                        Divinity: Original Sin (Classic)\n                        \n\n                                        Dungeon Defenders\n                        \n\n                                        Enclave\n                        \n\n                                        Gothic 3\n                        \n\n                                        Hitman: Absolution\n                        \n\n                                        Iron Sky: Invasion\n                        \n\n                                        King's Bounty: The Legend\n                        \n\n                                        Magicka\n                        \n\n                                        Overcooked!\n                        \n\n                                        Pro Cycling Manager 2017\n                        \n\n                                        S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl\n                        \n\n                                        Stoneshard\n                        \n\n                                        Streets of Rogue\n                        \n\n                                        Sudden Strike 4\n                        \n\n                                        Superhot\n                        \n\n                                        This Is the Police\n                        \n\n                                        Trailmakers\n                        \n\n                                        Trine 2: Complete Story\n                        \n\n                                        Tropico 4\n                        \n\n                                        Wurm Unlimited\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                                            read more\n                                    \n\n\n\n[appbox googleplay \"com.nvidia.geforcenow\"]\nSource: NVIDIA \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nGame Streaming\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support XDA.

Meet the MSI GS66 Stealth. Featuring a sandblasted finish, the all-black GS66 Stealth features a design which does its name proud. This is the ultimate sleeper from MSI. At 4.63 lbs and 0.71-inches thick, the 15.6-inch laptop is also very portable, and despite the small size, MSI has crammed in a 99.9 Wh battery, which is the largest allowed as carry-on in an airplane. The chassis still features the SteelSeries per-key RGB keyboard, which is one of the best in the gaming market, so you can still turn on a bit of bling if you are in the mood.\n\nThe GS66 Stealth offers up to a Core i9-10980HK and up to 32 GB of DDR4, expandable to 64 GB. On the GPU side MSI has tapped the brand new NVIDIA GeForce RTX Super lineup as options, with the RTX 2080 Super Max-Q at the top end, RTX 2070 Super Max-Q, RTX 2070 Max-Q, or RTX 2060 options as well. Due to the thin and light design, Max-Q is a necessity despite the new Cooler Boost Trinity+ system which MSI has designed with 0.1 mm fan blades.\nMSI has also stepped up to the new 300 Hz display territory with the GS66, although the base model offers \u201cjust\u201d 144 Hz, and mid-tier features a 240 Hz 1920x1080p IPS-Level display.\n\nRounding out the features, MSI offers NVMe storage up to 1 TB, Wi-Fi 6 thanks to the Intel AX201, Ethernet featuring the Killer E3100, USB Type-C with Thunderbolt 3, and three USB 3.2 Gen2 ports.\nThe new GS66 Stealth is available for pre-order today starting at $1599, and will be shipping on April 15th.\nGE66 Raider\n\nIf the Stealth was too laid back in the styling department to suit your tastes, don\u2019t worry. MSI has you covered. The new GE66 Raider is a larger, heavier, and flashier version of the GS66 Stealth. The cool-touch aluminum chassis features the MSI Mystic Light panoramic RGB light bar on the front, offering 16.7 million colors. The bottom of the laptop showcases dragon armor carving with hexagons, offering more grip and style, and MSI has tweaked the GE66 Raider\u2019s hinge as well to make it more durable.\n\nIf you like really flashy laptops, MSI will be offering a Star Wars themed \u201cDragonshield Edition\u201d, designed in-part with Industrial Light and Magic veteran Colie Wertz. This theming isn\u2019t just skin deep either. The design is actually laser etched into the laptop, providing contrast and texture.\nThe GE66 Raider offers much of the same internal offerings as the GS66 Stealth, with up to a Core i9-10980HK, and up to 32 GB of RAM, but thanks to the chassis being a bit thicker (0.92\u201d vs 0.71\u201d) and slightly heavier (5.25 lbs vs 4.61 lbs) MSI was able to skip the Max-Q on the RTX 2070 and RTX 2070 Super, although the top-end offering still needs the Max-Q thermals for the RTX 2080 Super Max-Q.\n\nThe 15.6-inch laptop offers either a 240 Hz 1920x1080, or a 300 Hz on the higher-tier models.\nThis laptop offers the Killer Double Shot feature with the Killer E3100 Gigabit Ethernet coupled with the Intel based Killer AX1650 wireless, and although it offers USB Type-C, unlike the Stealth, there is no Thunderbolt 3 support. This laptop also ships with the same 99.9 Wh battery, so despite the powerful internals, battery life should be reasonable.\nThe GE66 Raider will be available on April 15th starting at $1799.\nCreator 17\n\nMSI has seen a large growth segment in the creator market, and has found that many content creators have been purchasing their gaming laptops to get access to the more-powerful CPUs and beefy GPUs that gaming laptops offer. The company has started to offer models targeted at this crowd now, and their latest model is the Creator 17, which features the first Mini LED display in a laptop.\nThe 17-inch Creator 17 offers a 144 Hz 1920x1080 IPS panel offering sRGB on the base models, but the top models step up to a 3840x2160 resolution mini LED display, offering P3 color gamut, and HDR1000. The mini LED display offers 240 zones of local dimming, 1000 nits brightness, and a 100,000:1 contrast ratio thanks to the new backlighting. The laptop somewhat surprisingly offers user-choice of both the DCI-P3 as well as the P3 D65 color space. The majority of devices marketed as DCI-P3 are actually P3 D65, whereas the DCI-P3 color space is the one used in digital cinema, so offering both on a device like this is a smart move. In addition to the True Color gamut selection, the laptop will feature per-unit factory calibration which is verified by CalMAN \u2013 the same software we leverage for our laptop reviews.\n\nOn the CPU side, MSI is only offering the Core i7-10875H, which is an eight-core, sixteen-thread processor which can turbo up to 5.1 GHz. This should offer plenty of muscle for most content tasks, and for GPU-accelerated workflows, MSI will offer the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060, RTX 2070 Max-Q, RTX 2070 Super Max-Q, and RTX 2080 Super Max-Q, so you can pick your performance level depending on your GPU needs. The base model ships with 16 GB of DDR4, and MSI offers 32 GB on the higher-tier units, and all models support up to 64 GB.\nCreators need storage. MSI is shipping up to 2 TB of NVMe storage, along with micro SD, and for external storage there is a Thunderbolt 3 port. The Thunderbolt port can also be used to charge the laptop in a pinch, and provides 27-Watts of power for charging external devices.\nDespite the impressive performance inside, the Creator 17 still comes in at a starting weight of 5.29 lbs, although the mini LED model adds another 0.22 lbs to the total, and the laptop is just 0.8\u201d thick. For a 17-inch laptop, that is quite reasonable.\nThe MSI Creator 17 will be available on April 15th starting at $1799.\nSource: MSI\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n10 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\ndamianrobertjones - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nIt's nice to have a thin machine, but for a few extra millimeters we could have bigger batteries or better cooling. How they keep on getting away with this is just madness (Oh yeah, we buy them).\n\n\n\nUnashamed_unoriginal_username_x86 - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nThere's the problem though of 100Wh max battery capacity on flights, and fans using power.That said, I find it ridiculous OEMs refuse to just make airplane-forbidden batteries. Not everyone is working during a business class flight... Or even catching flights.Hell, they could market it as \"a battery so big it's illegal!\" and \"undeniably better than all its competitors!\"\n\n\n\nPeachNCream - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nI'd like to see some 11.6 inch fanless notebooks with much larger capacity batteries.  The extra thickness could also support slots for removable RAM and storage versus soldered down 4GB and 32GB or if you're buying a premium model, 64GB of eMMC.  Then I could do a little more on the road with a reasonable sized laptop instead of having to purchase something in the 13-15 inch screen size class that does not fit anywhere.  It's stuff like this that just makes me leave the PC at home and make do with a phone for any work on the road even if it is heavy lifting that is better suited to something with a keyboard and larger screen.\n\n\n\neastcoast_pete - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nIf I understand it correctly, the problem is that Lithium batteries above 100 Wh aren't allowed in the cabin, period.  And most of us aren't comfortable shipping our laptops in the checked luggage; many companies even forbid it for their employees' work laptops.\n\n\n\n0ldman79 - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nSome of us aren't a \"flight risk\" as it were.The only way you'll find me on a plane is if someone is shipping my remains home, so I'll take the 200Wh battery, thanks.It always drives me nuts, as the OP says, they make better laptop CPUs, say the introduction of the 15W CPU, then they use that capability to offer thinner and lighter laptops instead of keeping the form factor the same and giving us massive battery life.They're starting to get their act together *finally*.\n\n\n\nzmatt - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nSo are you guys going to review any of the 4000 series mobile Ryzen laptops? PC World did their review on Monday and it makes all of these Intel laptops obsolete. I understand logistics can be tricky with everyone working from home, but I've been checking every morning since Monday and nothing. Looks even worse when more than one Intel laptop review dropped today. \n\n\n\nwolrah - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nAT often doesn't have a day one review because they tend to go in depth.  Give 'em time, these laptops have only just come out and those who have put out reviews said they didn't get much time with 'em so it's all early reporting.Also, what are you talking about with \"Looks even worse when more than one Intel laptop review dropped today.\"?  AT hasn't posted any reviews of either new platform, they've basically just posted the press releases with a bit of commentary.\n\n\n\nDanNeely - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nAMD changed the embargo date for 4000 mobile laptops and forgot to tell anyone at Anandtech.  According to the twitter feed they're intending to have a review out for Monday.\n\n\n\n0ldman79 - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nI don't know how Ian didn't hear about it.I run in the same circles on twitter and even I knew it was March 30th. I think it was an ad on twitter actually.I suppose he probably has better things to do than pay attention to ads... lol\n\n\n\nGuspaz - Friday, April 3, 2020 - link\nI'm not sure 240 backlight zones really counts as \"mini LED\"... Just because a display has FALD doesn't mean you can call it \"mini LED\". It means a specific thing (chip size), so maybe they technically used LED chips that fell into the \"mini LED\" size range, but normally it's used to represent a much larger number of backlight zones than that.A 4K screen with 240 zones mean that each backlight zone is responsible for 34,560 pixels, so you're going to see some serious haloing there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

NVIDIA says that these graphics processors are \"the industry's fastest, most power-efficient available today.\" NVIDIA's claimed that these GPUs are able to render 3D graphics up to 13x faster than a CPU, and up to 10x faster than a CPU for video editing. In other words, these laptops are made for more than gaming.\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ten new laptops with NVIDIA RTX Super GPU power inside come from four different manufacturers. There's Acer, Gigabyte, MSI, and Razer in the mix. The Razer collection includes both the Razer Blade 15 Base and the Razer Blade 15 Advanced \u2013 both with RTX Studio, aluminum unibody design, and 4K OLED displays.\nAcer has two unique designs, with the Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel and the Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel Pro. Both devices have a hinge that allows the display to swivel and push the laptop to a new form. In this form, the Ezel forms a sort of easel \u2013 as the name might've indicated, making it a perfect drawing board for a compatible Wacom pen.\n\nThe Gigabyte reveals today include the Gigabyte Aero 15 OLED and the Gigabyte Aero 17 HDR. MSI revealed the MSI Creator 15, Creator 17, WS66, and WS75. These machines have features like 4K IPS displays, 100% Adobe RGB color, and DeltaE-2 action in full effect.\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of these new RTX Studio laptops have a sort of special deal at launch dealing with Adobe. They've got three months of Adobe Creative Cloud for free \u2013 just enough to get you hooked on the most massive collection of creative tools that'll make full use of the graphics power enabled by the GPUs in the laptops. Three months of Adobe Creative Cloud normally costs approximately $238.47 USD.\n\nA whole BUNCH of new NVIDIA GPU-toting laptops were revealed this week, some of which will be released as early as April 15, 2020. Another wave will be released in May. RTX 2060 GPUs power a set of laptops with price points starting at $999 USD \u2013 those include Acer Nitro 5, ASUS ROG Strix G15, HP Omen 15, MSI GF65 Thin, and the Lenovo Legion Y540 and 5i.\nStick around as we continue to expand upon the individual offerings revealed today by NVIDIA and manufacturer partners of all sorts.

Later, that startup, Mellanox Technologies, helped steer RDMA into mainstream computing, today\u2019s AI boom and the tech industry\u2019s latest multibillion-dollar merger.\nIt started in August 2001.\nD.K. Panda, a professor at Ohio State University, met Kevin Deierling, vice president of marketing for newly funded Mellanox. Panda explained how his lab\u2019s work on software for the message-passing interface (MPI) was fueling a trend to assembling clusters of low-cost systems for high performance computing.\nThe problem was the fast networks they used from small companies such as Myrinet and Quadrics were proprietary and expensive.\nIt was an easy deal for a startup on a shoestring. For the price of a few of its first InfiniBand cards, some pizza and Jolt cola, grad students got MPI running on Mellanox\u2019s chips. U.S. national labs, also eyeing InfiniBand, pitched in, too. Panda\u2019s team debuted the open source MVAPICH at the Supercomputing 2002 conference.\n\u201cPeople got performance gains over Myrinet and Quadrics, so it had a snowball effect,\u201d said Panda of the software that recently passed a milestone of half a million downloads.\nPouring RDMA on a Really Big Mac\nThe demos captured the imagination of an ambitious assistant professor of computer science from Virginia Tech. Srinidhi Varadarajan had research groups across the campus lining up to use an inexpensive 80-node cluster he had built, but that was just his warm-up.\nAn avid follower of the latest tech, Varadarajan set his sights on IBM\u2019s PowerPC 970, a new 2-GHz CPU with leading floating-point performance, backed by IBM\u2019s heritage of solid HPC compilers. Apple was just about to come out with its Power Mac G5 desktop using two of the CPUs.\nWith funding from the university and a government grant, Varadarajan placed an order with the local Apple sales office for 1,100 of the systems on a Friday. \u201cBy Sunday morning we got a call back from Steve Jobs for an in-person meeting on Monday,\u201d he said.\nFrom the start, Varadarajan wanted the Macs linked on InfiniBand. \u201cWe wanted the high bandwidth and low latency because HPC apps tend to be latency sensitive, and InfiniBand would put us on the leading edge of solving that problem,\u201d he said.\nMellanox Swarms an Infiniband Supercomputer\nMellanox gave its new and largest customer first-class support. CTO Michael Kagan helped design the system.\nAn architect on Kagan\u2019s team, Dror Goldenberg, was having lunch at his desk at Mellanox\u2019s Israel headquarters, near Haifa, when he heard about the project and realized he wanted to be there in person.\nHe took a flight to Silicon Valley that night and spent the next three weeks camped out in a secret lab at One Infinite Loop \u2014 Apple\u2019s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters \u2014 where he helped develop the company\u2019s first drivers for the Mac.\nGoldenberg with Infiniband cabling inside the Big Mac under construction.\n\u201cThat was the only place we could get access to the Mac G5 prototypes,\u201d said Dror of the famously secretive company.\nHe worked around the clock with Virginia Tech researchers at Apple and Mellanox engineers back in Israel, getting the company\u2019s network running on a whole new processor architecture.\nThe next stage brought a challenge of historic proportions. Goldenberg and others took up residence for weeks in a Virginia Tech server room, stacking computers to unheard-of heights in the days when Amazon was mainly known as a rain forest.\n\u201cIt was crashing, but only at very large scale, and we couldn\u2019t replicate the problem at small scale,\u201d he said. \u201cI was calling people back at headquarters about unusual bit errors. They said it didn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he added.\nEnergized by a new class of computer science issues, they often worked 22-hour days. They took catnaps in sleeping bags in between laying 2.3 miles of InfiniBand cable in a race to break records on the TOP500 list of the world\u2019s biggest supercomputers.\nLinking 1,100 off-the-shelf computers into one, \u201cwe stressed the systems to levels no one had seen before,\u201d he said.\n\u201cToday, I know when you run such large jobs heat goes up, fans go crazy and traffic patterns on the wire change, creating different frequencies that can cause bit flips,\u201d said Goldenberg, now a seasoned vice president of software architecture with the world\u2019s largest cloud service providers among his customers.\nRDMA Fuels 10 Teraflops and Beyond\nVaradarajan was \u201ca crazy guy, writing object code even though he was a professor,\u201d recalls Kagan.\nBenchmarks plateaued around 9.3 teraflops, just shy of the target that gave the System X its name. \u201cThe results were changing almost daily, and we had two days left on the last weekend when a Sunday night run popped out 10.3 teraflops,\u201d Varadarajan recalled.\nThe $5.2 million system was ranked No. 3 on the TOP500 in November 2003. The fastest system at the time, the Earth Simulator in Japan, had cost an estimated $350 million.\nSrinidhi Varadarajan at the controls of Virginia Tech\u2019s System X soon after it was installed.\n\u201cThat was our debut in HPC,\u201d said Kagan. \u201cNow more than half the systems on the TOP500 use our chips with RDMA, and HPC is a significant portion of our business,\u201d he added.\nRDMA Born in November 1993\nIt was a big break for the startup and the idea of RDMA, first codified in a November 1993 patent by a team of Hewlett-Packard engineers.\nLike many advances, the idea behind RDMA was simple, yet fundamental. If you give networked systems a way to access each other\u2019s main memory without interrupting the processor or operating system, you can drive down latency, drive up throughput and simplify life for everybody.\nThe approach promised a way to eliminate a rat\u2019s nest of back-and-forth traffic between systems that was slowing computers.\nRoCE: RDMA Goes Mainstream\nAfter its first success in supercomputers, baking RDMA into mature, mainstream Ethernet networks was a logical next step, but it took hard work and time. The InfiniBand Trade Association defined an initial version of RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE, pronounced \u201crocky\u201d) in 2010, and today\u2019s more complete version that supports routing in 2014.\n\nMellanox helped write the spec and rolled RoCE into ConnectX, a family of chips that also support the high data rates of InfiniBand.\n\u201cThat made them early with 25/50G and 100G Ethernet,\u201d said Bob Wheeler, a networking analyst with The Linley Group. \u201cWhen hyperscalers moved beyond 10G, Mellanox was the only game in town,\u201d he said, noting OEMs jumped on the bandwagon to serve their enterprise customers.\nIBM and Microsoft are vocal in their support for RoCE in their public clouds. And Alibaba recently \u201csent us a note that the network was great for its big annual Singles Day sale,\u201d said Kagan.\nSmart NICs: Chips Off the Old RDMA Block\nNow that RDMA is nearly everywhere, it\u2019s becoming invisible.\nToday\u2019s networks are increasingly defined by high-level software and virtualization that simplifies operations in part by hiding details of underlying hardware. Under the covers, RDMA is becoming just one of an increasing number of functions, many running on embedded processor cores on smart network-interface cards, aka smart NICs.\nIBM details the benefits of RDMA and other networking offloads used on today\u2019s smart NICs.\nToday smart NICs enable adaptive routing, handle congestion management and increasingly oversee security. They \u201care essentially putting a computer in front of the computer,\u201d continuing RDMA\u2019s work of freeing up time on server CPUs, said Kagan.\nThe next role for tomorrow\u2019s smart networks built on RDMA and RoCE is to accelerate a rising tide of AI applications.\nMellanox\u2019s SHARP protocol already consolidates data from HPC apps distributed across dozens to thousands of servers. In the future, it\u2019s expected to speed AI training by aggregating data from parameter servers such as updated weights from deep-learning models. Panda\u2019s Ohio State lab continues to support such work with RDMA libraries for AI and big-data analytics.\n\u201cToday RDMA is an order of magnitude better and richer in its feature set for networking, storage and AI \u2014 scaling out to address the exponentially growing amount of data,\u201d said Goldenberg.\nDouble Date: AI, RDMA Unite NVIDIA, Mellanox\nThe combination of AI and RDMA drew Mellanox and NVIDIA together into a $6.9 billion merger announced in March 2019. The deal closed on April 27, 2020.\nNVIDIA first implemented RDMA in GPUDirect for its Kepler architecture GPUs and CUDA 5.0 software. Last year, it expanded the capability with GPUDirect Storage.\nAs supercomputers embraced Mellanox\u2019s RDMA-powered InfiniBand networks, they also started adopting NVIDIA GPUs as accelerators. Today the combined companies power many supercomputers including Summit, named the world\u2019s most powerful system in June 2018.\nSimilarities in data-intensive, performance-hungry HPC and AI tasks led the companies to collaborate on using InfiniBand and RoCE in NVIDIA\u2019s DGX systems for training neural networks.\nNow that Mellanox is part of NVIDIA, Kagan sees his career coming full circle.\n\u201cMy first big design project as an architect was a vector processor, and it was the fastest microprocessor in the world in those days,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019m with a company designing state-of-the-art vector processors, helping fuse processor and networking technologies together and driving computing to the next level \u2014 it\u2019s very exciting.\u201d\n\u201cMellanox has been leading RDMA hardware delivery for nearly 20 years, it\u2019s been a pleasure working with Michael and Dror throughout that time, and we look forward to what is coming next,\u201d said Renato Recio an IBM Fellow in networking who helped define the Infiniband standard.\n\n\nCategories: Explainer | NetworkingTags: Artificial Intelligence | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | NVIDIA DGX | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

According to a new report, the firm is ramping up production to meet demand from Nvidia and AMD, with the former set to use TSMC's new 5nm process node. \nAccording to Digitimes' \"industry sources,\" TSMC will post strong results for the first half of 2020 thanks to upcoming short lead-time orders. The Taiwanese firm is benefitting from Nvidia's forthcoming Ampere GPU and AMD's Ryzen and Epyc CPUs.\nDigitimes doesn't go into detail about Nvidia's 5nm intentions---Ampere is known to be based on the 7nm process---so we don't know what it could be for. AMD is also planning similar orders---a recent roadmap revealed it would use 5nm for its Epyc Genoa chips---and Apple is reportedly moving to 5nm nodes.\n\nAs so many people now work and study from home, the lockdown has brought a boost in demand for laptops and desktops, many of which contain Nvidia and AMD hardware. The record spending on digital games---$10 billion in March---is also helping the tech companies' bottom lines, with people buying gaming laptops, graphics cards, and CPUs. There's also the Xbox Series One and PS5, both of which will contain AMD tech.\nThe stay-at-home requirements have seen AMD and Nvidia increase their orders with TSMC. Team red's current lineup of products use 7nm, while Nvidia is buying more 16nm, 12nm, and 7nm nodes to cover its entire family of products, which includes the Tegra X1 processors used in the Nintendo Switch.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently confirmed that the company would not be laying off any workers during the Covid-19 crisis, thanks to its strong position. To help employees cope with the economic crisis, everyone at the firm is receiving \"accelerating\" raises. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Samsung's ambitious 1.4nm plans in jeopardy as foundry challenges mount \n\n\n\n Vietnam wants to compete with Taiwan by establishing its first wafer fab \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 19 comments\n \n585 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nChip industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan is Intel's new CEO\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWestern Digital exits SSD market, shifts focus to hard drives as SanDisk takes over NAND operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia Turing silicon (Image credit: Nvidia)German laptop manufacturer Schenker revealed to news outlet ComputerBase this week that Nvidia has quietly refreshed its GeForce RTX 2070 and RTX 2060 Mobile cards.The revised GeForce RTX 2070 and RTX 2060 Mobile retain the same model names as the original versions. Therefore, the only way to differentiate the new model from the previous model is through the codename. As a matter of fact, many of the specifications from the original models are carried over in the revised models. Apparently, all Nvidia did was upgrade the memory and regulator, and that alone was enough to help squeeze some more performance out of the cards for gaming laptops.Both the GeForce RTX 2070 and RTX 2060 Mobile utilize GDDR6 memory, and they will continue to do so. According to Schenker, the memory on the revised models operate at 1.25V as opposed to 1.35V. The lower-powered memory brings two main benefits: reduced power consumption and generated heat. As a result, the GPU can use the freed-up headroom to hit higher boost clocks and provide improved performance while still staying within the TGP (total graphics power) limit.SpecsSwipe to scroll horizontallyGraphics CardCodenameTGP (W)GeForce RTX 2070 Mobile (Refresh)N18E-G1R115GeForce RTX 2070 MobileN18E-G2115GeForce RTX 2060 Mobile (Refresh)N18E-G1-B115GeForce RTX 2060 MobileN18E-G180The Schenker representative noted that the refreshed versions of the GeForce RTX 2070 and RTX 2060 Mobile outperform their originals by substantial margins within the same power consumption. He suspects that a better yield in chip production somewhat plays a part, but Nvidia hasn't confirmed that.The GeForce RTX 2070 Mobile retains the same 115W TGP rating. But since the memory is more energy efficient, the graphics card comes with a higher boost clock speed.The GeForce RTX 2060 Mobile benefits the most from Nvidia's GDDR6 treatment. The regular version comes with a 80W TBP. Nvidia is reportedly offering its partners a vBIOS updates that increases the threshold to 115W. That's a 43.8% increase and will ultimately give the GeForce RTX 2060 Mobile a very healthy performance boost.\u00a0But don't expect every GeForce RTX 2060 Mobile to have up to 115W of breathing room. As the Schenker spokesman noted, laptop makers are still free to use a different TGP limit and don't have to change the name of the graphics card. This is understandable, as cooling capacity varies from laptop to laptop. The problem is that unless the manufacturer strictly specifies it, there is no way of knowing which version is under the hood until you take the laptop home.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The Schenker rep said he believes we'll see public benchmarks for the refreshed GeForce RTX 2070 and RTX 2060 Mobile graphics cards on April 15.Today's best Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 deals86 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $1,199.99ViewLow Stock $1,332.99View $1,999.99 $1,599.99ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce\nrtx\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (7)\n\n\n\nZhiye LiuSocial Links NavigationNews Editor and Memory ReviewerZhiye Liu is a news editor and memory reviewer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

Feed it more power and you get more performance - except in the case of AMD - since AMD has ultra binned ever single little slice of silicon, and offers it's pre over clocked. Along with that extra power comes extra heat - that is why it has a setting in BIOS to allow you to keep the 80W TDP or the 135W.\n\nNvidia is is no way shape or form concerned about whatever marketing term AMD is using to describe whatever warmed over ancient design they are selling this week. It just isn't an issue. AMD has about as much chance taking over the discrete GPU for laptops as it does becoming the top tier full size GPU vendor. \"Big Massive Totally New and Shiny Look! Squirrel Navi\" is vaporware and likely to remain as such - they will undoubtedly release something with better perf - but no where near where the AMD Kiddies think it it be. \n\nThing about AMD is they get things flipped - You under promise and over deliver - not over promise and under deliver - which is the history of the Ryzen line Because by now AMD should have 80% market share and Intel begging for scraps - yet that hasn't happened. Ryzen 1 (1x00 series) had the most impact, the subsequent 2 small iterative updates - not so much. Even though AMD is hitting record revenues (for AMD) it is still really nothing and R&D requires something in excess of nothing. Jim Keller's legacy at AMD (creator of Ryzen) is already in the market - they have nothing left to draw from. The changes between 1st gen Ryzen and most current in the market Ryzen is really not much at all.

So when you use phrases such as \u201cRyzen overpromised and underdelivered\u201d along with \u201cAMD kiddies\u201d One can tell that you are a moron... and a Intel kiddie. I could go into further details ripping the rest of your so called \u201cfacts\u201d apart, but judging by your post, I will only be feeding a troll.\nIt amazes me with retarded comments such as these, that there are people out there who willingly wants to be a fanboy of any company, so they ignore the facts and start wommitting crap on forums and websites such as we see above.\nGet a brain, stop getting emotionally attached to a company like intel, try start being able to think objectively. And you will find your self not expressing words and sentenses that makes other readers IQ fall after reading your posts.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeicidium369 said:Yeah, that tends to be how things work. Feed it more power and you get more performance - except in the case of AMD - since AMD has ultra binned ever single little slice of silicon, and offers it's pre over clocked. Along with that extra power comes extra heat - that is why it has a setting in BIOS to allow you to keep the 80W TDP or the 135W.\n\nNvidia is is no way shape or form concerned about whatever marketing term AMD is using to describe whatever warmed over ancient design they are selling this week. It just isn't an issue. AMD has about as much chance taking over the discrete GPU for laptops as it does becoming the top tier full size GPU vendor. \"Big Massive Totally New and Shiny Look! Squirrel Navi\" is vaporware and likely to remain as such - they will undoubtedly release something with better perf - but no where near where the AMD Kiddies think it it be. \n\nThing about AMD is they get things flipped - You under promise and over deliver - not over promise and under deliver - which is the history of the Ryzen line Because by now AMD should have 80% market share and Intel begging for scraps - yet that hasn't happened. Ryzen 1 (1x00 series) had the most impact, the subsequent 2 small iterative updates - not so much. Even though AMD is hitting record revenues (for AMD) it is still really nothing and R&D requires something in excess of nothing. Jim Keller's legacy at AMD (creator of Ryzen) is already in the market - they have nothing left to draw from. The changes between 1st gen Ryzen and most current in the market Ryzen is really not much at all. I know all the armchair lithography and CPU fabrication experts will say but but but \"7nm\"... turns out not that big of a deal. Not making money is why they spun off Global Foundries - and why they sold Ryzen designs to the Chinese - to keep the lights on while Ryzen was prepped to take over the world... a swing and a miss.

Intel fanboi\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmitch074\n\n\nOf course Nvidia is worried - even though they do have the performance crown, stuff like the crypto currency craze and Vulkan proved that AMD had enough resources even with a tenth the R&D budget and driver dev staff to keep within striking distance. Also AMD owns the console market, as soon as they could afford 2 GPU designs instead of 1 they would kick ass - and the half-baked RDNA design proved just that.\nRDNA2 is almost here, and since AMD actually stopped overpromising with Ryzen, if they announce 50% better performance per watt we can expect \"Big Navi\" to be interesting at the very least.\nI will finally be able to replace my faithful RX480 - almost 4 years old now and still good enough.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTCA_ChinChin\n\n\nMandark said:You are just a salty uninformed poster. Intel fanboiSome people are delusional. Nobody even said this was a bad thing from Nvidia (its actually quite a savvy move), but people assume whenever you don't directly praise Nvidia or Intel that you're personally insulting them and their purchasing decisions so they must justify themselves.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrevanthkr\n\n\nDoes that mean rtx 2060 mobile which already has 80w tdp will get 115w bios update or its just the new pcs with rtx 2060 get this hike?\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 7 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia Blackwell RTX Pro with up to 96GB of VRAM \u2014 even more demand for the limited supply of GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia announces Rubin GPUs in 2026, Rubin Ultra in 2027, Feynam also added to roadmap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s new silicon photonics-based 400 Tb/s switch platforms enable clusters with millions of GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia announces Blackwell Ultra B300 \u20141.5X faster than B200 with 288GB HBM3e and 15 PFLOPS dense FP4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD RX Vega 64 runs Indiana Jones and the Great Circle at well over 30FPS in Linux with RADV driver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia earned nearly as much as its next 9 fabless rivals combined last year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsus' mini supercomputer taps Nvidia Grace Blackwell chip for 1,000 AI TOPS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHP's new Omen 16 Slim goes up to an RTX 5070 and is 16% slimmer than its predecessor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHP updates its OmniBook X line with a lattice-free keyboard, processors from AMD and Intel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Jensen Huang\u2019s Nvidia GTC 2025 keynote here \u2014 Blackwell 300 AI GPUs expected\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Intel's new Core i7-10875H is the key new CPU in their 10th-gen lineup for laptops. At the same time, Nvidia released a boosted RTX Super series GPUs, and the week prior, AMD unleashed a competitive processor that targets the same segment with Ryzen 4000.\nToday our focus will be on the RTX 2070 Super Max-Q, but proper context was very important because you should expect to see new laptop models sporting a variety of all this hardware in the coming weeks and months.\n\nIt's taken Nvidia nearly a year to bring their RTX Super GPUs from the desktop to mobile form factors, however as we explained at the time of the announcement, the change is not limited to a frequency bump but there are some neat new features reserved for these new GPUs. In case you missed it, check out our full feature breakdown here.\nThe new laptop GPUs include the RTX 2080 Super, RTX 2070 Super and the GTX 1650 Ti. The RTX 2070 Super is available in a range of TGPs, where the 80W and 90W variants get a Max-Q designation, while the maximum 115W version is referred to as Max-P.\n\nAs you can imagine, having all of these different variants and power limits under a single GPU name can be confusing, and is something we continue to be frustrated with. Just take a look at all the GPUs that are called \"RTX 2070\" these days: two desktop GPUs, two Max-P laptop variants, and at least 4 Max-Q models. Some are Super, some are not Super. Some are Max-Q, others are not. The power targets often aren't advertised, but whether you end up with an 80W or 90W Max-Q version does have performance implications. But let's move on...\nNvidia's desktop and mobile GPUs have the same CUDA core counts. So the RTX 2070 Super for laptops features the same TU104 GPU with 2560 CUDA cores as its desktop counterpart, however clock speeds are different. When looking at the Max-P variant at 115W, the mobile model has a 29% lower base clock and 22% lower rated boost clock, so naturally it'll perform below an RTX 2070 Super desktop GPU. That's not hugely surprising considering the desktop card is rated for 215W and has more room to dissipate all that heat. Comparing laptop to desktop, we also get the same memory subsystem that includes 8 GB of GDDR6 at 14 Gbps.\n\nMax-Q models are configured at a lower clock to comply with heat dissipation constraints. The 80W model comes in at 930 MHz base and 1155 MHz boost. Our test laptop also supports a 90W configuration which can boost performance. Our understanding is that laptops that default to 90W will feature 150 MHz higher base clocks. Same as with all modern Nvidia GPUs, while the rated boost clock is listed at 1155 MHz, due to GPU Boost algorithms the actual in-game clock speeds tend to be much higher, so these specifications are really only a guideline.\n\nThe laptop we've used for testing is the Gigabyte Aorus 15G. This is the same unit from our Core i7-10875H CPU analysis, and it'll allow us to test the RTX 2070 Super Max-Q performance in both the 80W and 90W configurations. Do note that because in this generation we're getting both a CPU and GPU upgrade at the same time \u2013 all RTX Super laptops will feature new 10th-gen CPUs \u2013 ideally we'd love to be checking these GPUs out when paired with the Core i7-10750H, which is much closer to the Core i7-9750H used with many gaming laptops previously, and that would remove the CPU as a variable as best as possible. But right now that's just not possible, so we're sticking to mostly heavy GPU limited benchmarks throughout this review.\n\nThe Aorus 15G also packs 16 GB of DDR4-2933 memory and a 1080p 240 Hz display. Unfortunately, two of the new features Nvidia were touting at the RTX Super laptop launch are not included in this unit: we aren't getting Dynamic Boost or Advanced Optimus, so that's something we'll have to evaluate later.\nAs with all our laptop testing, we try and lock down variables as much as possible. This means keeping the CPU at Intel's default settings unless otherwise specified, and same with the GPU. We don't use any included OEM utilities to overclock these GPUs, so this review is designed to show stock performance with a given power configuration, although some OEMs like Gigabyte in this instance allow you to choose power targets. We think many OEMs will do the same, so we're showing both 80W and 90W performance to give you the clearest idea of how this GPU will perform in a variety of configurations. You can find the full list of laptops used for putting together the benchmarks here.\nBenchmarks\nWe're kicking this one off with a fairly standard game in Far Cry 5. Here you can see quite a bunching of results with all of the RTX 2070 series GPUs we've tested, and you'll probably spot the RTX 2080 Max-Q peeking out from the middle there, too.\nLooking at average frame rates, the RTX 2070 Super Max-Q in its 80W configuration is just barely ahead of the RTX 2070 at 115W, which we guess in itself is impressive as it does beat the 90W RTX 2070 Max-Q which fell below the RTX 2070. But realistically when you look at all of these results, whether you get an RTX 2070 Max-Q through to RTX 2080 Max-Q doesn't matter too much as the difference between the best and worst results is just 6% using Ultra settings.\n\nWhat about in Battlefield V, again using Ultra settings at 1080p? The story here isn't too different, although this time both configurations of the RTX 2070 Super Max-Q aren't as fast as the 115W RTX 2070, falling 3 to 6 percent behind. The 80W configuration is also slower than the RTX 2080 Max-Q, but the margins here are similar to the RTX 2070, at just single digits.\n\n\nLet's now look at Shadow of the Tomb Raider, which is a more GPU intensive game than the previous two and allows the power of the RTX 2070 Super GPU to be unleashed. This is one of the strongest results for RTX 2070 Super Max-Q versus RTX 2070 Max-Q, both at 90W which is the comparison we have available. With this configuration, the new Super GPU is 13 percent faster and impressively, even the 80W variant is faster. This allows the 2070 Super Max-Q to come in 4% faster than the 115W RTX 2070 despite consuming just 80W of power. Impressive result in a mobile form factor.\n\nResident Evil 2 using Balanced settings also played nicely on the RTX 2070 Super Max-Q at well over 100 FPS. Here we see an 11% performance gain over the RTX 2070 Max-Q, and a 2% lead over the RTX 2070. However, frame rates don't quite keep up to the RTX 2080 Max-Q in this game, the larger GPU is better here at the same 80W power limit.\n\nMetro Exodus is a very GPU intensive title and again we see quite a large bunching of results for all the RTX 2070 class GPUs. The 80W numbers for the 2070 Super Max-Q aren't overly impressive, 2% slower than the RTX 2070, however this does flip over to a performance lead at 90W. In fact this game saw one of the largest gains for increasing the power limit at 6%, which allows it to be just under 5% faster than the RTX 2070 when all said and done. However when comparing 90W numbers to the 90W RTX 2070 Max-Q, we're not seeing much of a gain, just a 1% improvement to average frame rates.\n\nControl is a very GPU demanding title at 1080p using High settings, and here we're testing without RTX features, if you choose to enable DLSS you will see better performance. The 80W configuration of the 2070 Super Max-Q ends up nearly 10% behind the RTX 2070, but benefits from an 11% performance increase when upped to 90W, allowing to edge slightly ahead of the more power hungry last-gen configuration. This isn't a bad result from a lower power draw part.\n\nBorderlands 3 is another title where it's only at 90W can the RTX 2070 Super Max-Q match the performance of the RTX 2070, while falling about 5% behind when we compare 80W 2070 Super Max-Q to 80W 2080 Max-Q. These names are pretty confusing but that's where we are at with modern gaming laptop GPUs.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 is naturally a very popular title on PC and the performance story is very similar to some of the games we've just been looking at. The 80W configuration of the 2070 Super Max-Q is slower on average than an RTX 2070, but faster at 90W. And surprisingly this is one of the few games we tested where the 80W 2070 Super Max-Q is actually faster than the 2080 Max-Q running at the same power limit.\n\nStar Wars Jedi Fallen Order plays nicely with the RTX 2070 Super Max-Q, with both power variants clocking in 2 to 4% faster than the standard RTX 2070 for laptops. It's not quite as fast as the RTX 2080 Super Max-Q but we think performance is good in this game either way, even using the Epic preset.\n\nGrand Theft Auto V is the last title we'll take an in-depth look at, representing an older but still popular game. There's not much here that we haven't already talked about, performance margins are slim between all the GPUs we've been discussing and that's no different here really. The 80W 2070 Super Max-Q is 2% behind the RTX 2070, but 2% ahead at 90W. This is one of the rare titles where the new Super GPU is slower than the non-Super model, but we believe some of that is down to a CPU limitation, the game does benefit from faster CPUs at these sorts of frame rates.\nPerformance Breakdown: Super or Not?\nIt's time to work through some performance breakdowns. We'll start with the RTX 2070 Super Max-Q versus the RTX 2070 Max-Q, both at 90W, in GPU limited games. On average the new Super GPU was 7% faster under the same power limit, but this varied between titles. Some games weren't faster by much, others were up to 15% faster. This will depend on how the game uses resources and whether the game prefers core frequency or core count.\n\n\nInterestingly, though, the 80W variant of the RTX 2070 Super Max-Q is still faster than the 90W RTX 2070 Max-Q we tested, not in all games and not by much, but a 3% improvement on average is respectable and points to a small gain in efficiency from the larger CUDA core array with its slightly reduced clocks.\n\nSpeaking of 80W versus 90W, here is how the higher power variant stacks up. In some titles we saw as much as an 11% performance gain, but in others gains were more modest. On average we ended up with just a 3-4% performance improvement from the higher power limit, which is a little bit lower than the gains seen from higher power limits in previous generations. The 90W RTX 2080 Max-Q for example, is 7% faster than the 80W configuration on average, when we reviewed it back in early 2019.\n\nThe jump up to this new Super model has allowed the RTX 2070 class Max-Q variant to pull much closer to the regular RTX 2070 running at 115W. Running at 80W, the RTX 2070 Super Max-Q is just 2% slower on average, with some games showing it to be faster, and others slower. In our previous testing, the 80W RTX 2070 Max-Q was around 10% slower, sometimes more. We are still talking about RTX 2070 Super versus RTX 2070 here so Nvidia has needed to step up a GPU tier to achieve this performance parity at a lower power target.\n\nAt 90W, the RTX 2070 Super Max-Q is able to pull ahead of the RTX 2070 on average, but only just. The low power Max-Q model isn't always the faster GPU, but in a lot of the most GPU demanding titles it tends to perform quite well here, so I'd be hoping most people buying a laptop with this GPU inside end up getting the 90W configuration.\n\nThe RTX 2070 Super Max-Q still has its place in the line-up though. It fell only 3% behind the RTX 2080 Max-Q on average, so while we can't quite replace last generation's higher-tier product with a lower tier design, it's very close.\n\nThe RTX 2070 Super Max-Q does provide considerably more performance than the RTX 2060 when both are configured to 80W. The new Super GPU is 18 percent faster, which suggests it is by far the more efficient design.\nAfter all the comparisons above, it's clear that Nvidia has crowded the market and the gains you get from moving up one GPU bracket are very small most of the time. From the RTX 2060 to RTX 2070 Max-Q you're looking at about a 10% gain, but anything you get above that are marginal increments.\nWhat We Learned\nLet's try to keep things as simple as possible. Nvidia says that the RTX 2070 Super is replacing the RTX 2070 at roughly the same price point. So for the same money, you're getting a ~7% performance improvement. It's not groundbreaking, but we'll take it.\nThe RTX 2070 will continue to exist in the market by replacing the RTX 2060 in that price tier, so it'll be possible to choose between RTX 2070 Max-Q and RTX 2070 Super Max-Q models. Gigabyte's Aero 15, for example, is available with either GPU plus an i7-10750H. The RTX 2070 Max-Q model is $1,900, and the RTX 2070 Super Max-Q is $2,100. That's an 11% increase in price for 7% more performance, or up to 15% in a best case scenario.\n\nIf you are tossing up between Max-Q and non Max-Q laptops, the RTX 2070 Super Max-Q is providing similar performance to the 115W RTX 2070, which is neat from an efficiency sense, but not as nice when exploring value. Laptops that use the full 2070 tend to be more affordable. This revamped pricing structure doesn't solve the value disparity between Max-Q and non Max-Q GPUs: Max-Q is always worse value, but that's the premium you pay for slimmer, nicer, more portable machines.\nThen there are some edge cases where companies will replace the full RTX 2070 with an RTX 2070 Super Max-Q. That's what happened with the Gigabyte Aorus 15. In this scenario, the GPUs will perform relatively the same, but the CPU has received an upgrade from 6 to 8 cores. Unless you need improved productivity performance, this sort of \"upgrade\" isn't very enticing for gamers. If a laptop's cooler is capable of handling a 115W GPU, the more sensible option would have been upgrading to a 2070 Super Max-P, or keeping the RTX 2070 but reducing the price.\n\nWe should also note that the Aorus 15 we tested has neither Dynamic Boost or Advanced Optimus, two new features Nvidia are pushing this generation. These have the potential to improve performance further, so what we've talked about today is more of a baseline metric. We'll have to explore those features in a future review as we receive more laptops for testing.\n\nBottom line, in terms of pure performance the needle hasn't shifted too much, but hopefully we'll see new opportunities for better value laptops in the months to come. The excitement with 2020 laptops will come from the use of Ryzen 4000 APUs, Nvidia's Advanced Optimus, new 300 Hz displays, and also these nice mechanical key switches used in the Aorus.\nShopping Shortcuts\n\nNvidia RTX 2070 Super Max-Q Laptops on Amazon\n\nNvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q Laptops on Amazon\n\nGigabyte Aorus 15G XB on Amazon\n\nIntel Core i7-10875H Laptops on Amazon\n\nCore i7-9750H Laptops on Amazon\n\nCore i7-10710U Laptops on Amazon\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 4900HS Laptops on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 6\n\n\n Got something to say?

As it turns out, however, there is another benefit, and it is being realized by NVIDIA's RTX Voice application.\n\n\nNow you can ray-trace your audio! Just kidding\u2014the RTX Voice app does not actually ray-trace anything, but it does leverage the AI capabilities of Turing to suppress background noise from your broadcasts.\n\n\n\"NVIDIA RTX Voice is a new plugin that leverages NVIDIA RTX GPUs and their AI capabilities to remove distracting background noise from your broadcasts, voice chats, and remote video conferencing meetings. This allows users to 'go live' or join a meeting without having to worry about unwanted sounds like loud keyboard typing or other ambient noise in noisy environments,\" NVIDIA explains.\n\n\nIt also aims to suppress background noise from players in loud environments so that incoming audio is easier to understand. The way it does all this is by creating a virtual device on your PC. Once installed, you would select the virtual device to unleash the magic of artificial intelligence.\n\n\nThis works with several popular applications, including...\n\n\nOBS Studio\nXSplit Broadcaster\nXSplit Gamecaster\nTwitch Studio\nDiscord\nGoogle Chrome\nWebEx\nSkype\nZoom\nSlack\n\nIt might also work with apps that are not yet on NVIDIA's officially supported list. For example, at least one users says they were able to get it working just fine with Microsoft Teams.\nInstall NVIDIA's RTX Voice Plugin To Suppress Background Noise On Your Broadcasts\nBefore you begin, you need to ensure you own a GeForce RTX or Quadro RTX graphics card. You must also be running Windows 10, and have an updated GPU driver installed (version 410.18 or newer). Once you have verified you meet the requirements, download the RTX Voice app and install it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce installed, configure the RTX Voice app by selecting the microphone and speaker you want to use, and check the box next to one or both to remove background noise. NVIDIA recommends starting with just your microphone, and only enabling this for your speakers if needed. Also note that you can adjust the slider for either one to set how aggressively the app blocks out background noise.\n\n\nFrom there, it is simply a matter of configuring your voice chat app of choice. For example, if you are using Discord, you would click on the cog wheel (Settings), and select Microphone (NVIDIA RTX Voice) and/or Speaker (NVIDIA RTX Voice) as your devices. For best results, NVIDIA says to disable noise cancelling/removal effects in Discord.\n\n\nPrecise instructions vary by app. Check out NVIDIA's RTX Voice setup guide for more information.

Reports from different locations across the globe suggest that there has been a substantial surge in internet usage as more people take to gaming to beat boredom.\nIn the U.S., for instance, Verizon reports\u00a0that there has been a 75% increase in gaming activity on account of the COVID-19 pandemic. This creates an ideal situation for NVIDIA to sell more graphics cards, as PCs account\u00a0for nearly a fourth of gaming devices. Not surprisingly, NVIDIA stock has stood out while the broader chip market has undergone a big correction.\nHowever, doubts have emerged as to whether the uptick in gaming activity will lead to an actual increase in graphics card sales.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs NVIDIA's gaming business about to hit a speed bump?\nWhen NVIDIA released its fiscal fourth-quarter results in early February, the company issued robust guidance even after accounting for the effect of the novel coronavirus pandemic on its business. The graphics specialist aims to deliver 35% annual revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, even though it had to reduce its top-line guidance by $100 million due to COVID-19.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNVIDIA is expecting $3 billion in revenue at the mid-point of its guidance range in the ongoing quarter, while Wall Street was originally looking\u00a0for $2.85 billion.\nNVIDIA's gaming business was the driving force behind its impressive performance last quarter. Gaming supplies nearly half of NVIDIA's top line, and it enjoyed a 56% bump in revenue last quarter. That's not surprising, as the chipmaker dominates the gaming GPU (graphics processing unit) space with a market share of nearly 70%.\nIdeally, NVIDIA's momentum in this business should continue. Graphics cards make\u00a0gaming more engaging and immersive, as they allow people to play higher spec games. But the situation on the ground appears to be different. Citing sources at anonymous motherboard manufacturers, DigiTimes (requires subscription) reported\u00a0last month that graphics card sales could hit record lows in the first half of 2020. The publication added that supply disruptions related to factory shutdowns in China and weak demand could weigh on GPU sales.\n\n\n\n\n\nDigiTimes' sources told the publication that sales of motherboards and GPUs in China were down in the range of 30% to 50% year over year in February. A turnaround isn't expected until July. That's said to be the reason why NVIDIA declined\u00a0to reveal new products at its GPU Technology Conference last month, as the chipmaker is reportedly waiting for an uptick in demand.\nThe company had clarified in February that gauging the \"ultimate effect of the coronavirus is difficult to estimate.\" So, there's a chance that NVIDIA's graphics card sales may take a hit when it releases its quarterly results next month.\nThe good part is that another side of NVIDIA's business could come in handy in such a situation and help offset some of the weakness in the gaming business.\nDatacenter could be a savior\nNVIDIA's data center business supplied\u00a031% of its total revenue last quarter, growing an impressive 42% over the prior-year period. The company credited this terrific growth to an increase in demand for hyperscale data centers that tackle artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.\nAs it turns out, data center loads have been spiking\u00a0amid the novel coronavirus pandemic. Some countries have been forced to throttle data speeds so that the internet does not break. In such a scenario, NVIDIA's data center-specific GPUs could help boost capacity and also help researchers fight COVID-19 by accelerating research with the help of AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is difficult to predict how the company's data center sales will shape up during these uncertain times. Any weakness on this front -- along with weakness in gaming -- could send the chipmaker's shares into a downward spiral.\nBut investors should keep in mind that NVIDIA is a long-term play on tech trends such as AI, autonomous cars, and the cloud. More importantly, its balance sheet seems strong enough to ride out the novel coronavirus pandemic.\nThe company has a cash pile\u00a0of $10.9 billion and debt of just $2 billion. NVIDIA's free cash flow has also jumped remarkably over the past year.\n\nNVDA Free Cash Flow data by YCharts\n\n\n\n\n\nAs such, a drop in NVIDIA shares may be treated as a buying opportunity. NVIDIA stock is currently trading\u00a0at 58 times last year's earnings, which is significantly higher than the five-year average P/E ratio of 39. If NVIDIA falls on account of weakness in the gaming business, it could open up an opportunity for investors to get into this technology stock at a cheaper valuation.\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Keep an eye out for additional spotlights in the weeks ahead.\nMore people around the world are working from home, but sometimes having this much flexibility can make it challenging for creative professionals to adjust.\nWhether it\u2019s scheduling video calls with coworkers or finding time to complete daily tasks, it can be difficult to focus when you\u2019re not used to working remotely.\nHowever, it\u2019s possible to stay motivated and get into the creative flow of things. All it takes is a little practice.\nA few amazing artists recently participated in a Q&A, where they described how they stay motivated while working from home. Check out some of their best practices that can help you stay inspired, motivated and productive.\nPlan Your Day\nWhen working from home, it can be difficult to get in the zone or stay productive. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to create a schedule that you can stick to.\nVitaly Bulgarov \u2014 a character artist and industrial designer whose incredible portfolio includes Terminator and Transformers movies franchises and World of Warcraft and Starcraft videogame franchises \u2014 typically starts his day doing the most difficult tasks first.\n\u201cI strive to have something solid done by lunch to get a sense of rolling momentum,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll get pumped for whatever work is still ahead of me.\u201d\nVitaly Bulgarov with his Acer ConceptD 7 \u2014 an RTX Studio laptop.\nFor character artist Madina Chionidi, who\u2019s contributed to works from Sony Guerilla games, Eurocom and EA DICE Stockholm, planning is everything.\n\u201cI usually start the day with a cup of coffee and 20 minutes of mindless browsing to get the gears going,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I go through the schedule I had put together the previous evening and work through it accordingly.\u201d\nChionidi\u2019s time management skills help her stay productive throughout the day and allows her to set aside some personal time so she can enjoy her hobbies or relax after work. Don\u2019t forget to take breaks every now and then, she says.\n\u201cDefine a schedule and try to respect it as much as you can,\u201d said Lino Grandi, a 3D artist at OTOY working on OctaneRender. \u201cStaying seated for a long time is never good. Get some exercise to keep yourself in shape.\u201d\nImage courtesy of Lino Grandi.\nCreate a Workspace That Best Suits You\nWhile working remotely, it helps to have a setup that allows you to be comfortable while you do your work.\nChionidi has always been familiar with a portable setup. She carries a laptop with a portable screen that can be easily carried in a simple backpack.\n\u201cI\u2019m constantly on the road, so I need hardware that is easily portable and light,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time, it should be powerful enough to handle all the design and composition software I need to use on a daily basis.\u201d\nMadina Chionidi\u2019s mobile office includes GeForce graphics in a Dell XPS 15.\nWith NVIDIA GeForce-powered Dell XPS 15 9570, Chionidi gets the performance she requires to handle her design workflows while being able to take her work anywhere, from her own living room to the coffee shop down the street.\nGrandi similarly works in the open space of his apartment, where he has his workstation set up with two GeForce RTX 2080 Ti cards that can keep up with his creative needs. Though when the time calls for a change of scenery, he has a different place he can escape to \u2014 one surrounded by tons of action figures, comics, graphic novels and art books.\n\u201cWhen I need more privacy, I move into my alternative studio,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the studio, I have two powerful laptops, a Cintiq 13HD, and everything I need to record voice and music.\u201d\nLino Grandi creates with NVIDIA GPUs, including the Lenovo ThinkPad P73, an RTX Studio laptop.\nHaving the right workspace and setup allows you to stay productive and creative, no matter where you are.\nFun Must Be Always :-))\nThe hours and days can start to run together when you\u2019re working from home. Break up the monotony by sprinkling in enjoyable moments throughout the day.\nBut keep it within reason. There\u2019s a time for work, and a time for play.\n\u201cFellow artists, resist the temptation of binge watching Tiger King while working,\u201d said Chionidi. \u201cThis needs to be watched after the work is done so you can properly treat yourself.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also important to be creative with how you communicate. \u201cAn emoji can lighten things up a bit and keep the flow productive and fun,\u201d said Bulgarov.\nCommunication Is Key\nDuring a time when everyone is working from home, it can feel a little isolating. But artists are encouraging others to use messaging applications like Slack and Discord to keep those channels of communication open and stay connected to others.\nBulgarov points out that it\u2019s important to remember the human element. Take a few moments out of the workday to have a personal conversation.\n\u201cHaving a genuine interest in people\u2019s lives and goals will also allow you to better see their perspectives in regards to specific approaches to problem solving,\u201d explained Bulgarov. \u201cThat part is important because it can alleviate a lot of the stress that comes from not being in the same room with that person.\u201d\nImage courtesy of Madina Chionidi.\nChionidi agrees that communication is important, especially if you\u2019re staying at home with family. She recommends talking with others and communicating which hours you are \u201cat work,\u201d so this can help bring you into focus mode.\nFind Daily Inspiration From Anywhere\nLast, but not least, finding inspiration can be challenging, especially when you\u2019re not used to working in a remote environment. But that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s nothing you can do about it \u2014 certain activities can stimulate your creativity.\nGrandi finds inspiration by browsing on websites like ArtStation, a platform where artists share their work and engage with others in their community. He also stays up to date on news about technology, and it\u2019s often what he needs to get motivated every day.\nWhile artists like Grandi look through websites and articles to get the creative workflows going, Bulgarov finds inspiration from other outlets, like music.\nImage courtesy of Vitaly Bulgarov.\n\u201cIf coffee wakes me up mentally, then listening to the right kind of music for the task at hand wakes me up creatively,\u201d said Bulgarov. \u201cAlso, playing the music out of speakers is definitely one of the nice benefits of working from home.\u201d\nArtists can find inspiration from anywhere in the world, even in the comfort of their own homes.\nLearn more about laptops that help you work, play and create and other telecommuting solutions from NVIDIA.\n\n\nCategories: Laptops | Mobile | Pro GraphicsTags: GeForce | NVIDIA RTX | NVIDIA Studio | Quadro | Remote Work \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

All you have to do is head over to the RTX Broadcast Engine feedback page and submit a 15 second clip of yourself and your surroundings. And Nvidia probably won't deep fake your voice for fun and/or profit, or use it in some AI-humanoid hybrid. Probably.RTX Voice is a free application (currently in beta) that removes the background noise from your microphone or incoming audio so that you can hear your team mates and colleagues clearer\u2014and vice versa.\u00a0It's technically limited to the latest generation of RTX 20-series graphics cards\u2014Nvidia claims the application requires the Turing architecture's \"AI capabilities\"\u2014but some digging around in the backend upturned an easy solution that opens support for RTX Voice across GeForce GTX graphics cards, too.If you've already tried RTX Voice, you likely know just how good it is at removing pesky background noise. But it's not perfect\u2014it suffers the occasional blip or strange vocal artefact. That's where you come in.In order to improve the RTX Broadcast Engine behind RTX Voice and RTX Greenscreen\u2014Nvidia's background removal technology\u2014the company's asking for a 15 second recording of your voice and a sample of your room's usual background noise. Perhaps you've a particularly yappy dog: capture it, send it to Nvidia, and it won't be a problem anymore\u2026.Once that's done, you'll have to agree to Nvidia's Terms and Conditions before submitting.

According to a new report, they will arrive sometime in the third quarter, and add-in board partners are already clearing stock in preparation. \nThe claim comes from a now deleted China Times post, which stated that three new generations of Ampere cards would arrive in the second half of the third quarter, so we might see them launch sometime around September.\nIt's presumed that Nvidia will repeat what it did with the RTX 2000-series cards and reveal the RTX 3080 Ti, RTX 3080, and RTX 3070 first, with the RTX 3060 following quite a few months later.\n\nThe report also alleges that Taiwan manufacturers Asus, Gigabyte, and MSI are trying to clear their stock of current Nvidia cards. In the case of Asus, it has cut the price of the RTX 2060 to NT$10,000, or around US$330, while the RTX 2080 is down to NT$16,000, or US$538.\nIt's important to take the report with a grain of salt, especially as it's been deleted. However, the third quarter of the year is when many expect Ampere to launch, mostly because it's presumed that the Covid-19 disruption will be (hopefully) gone by that time.\nWe'll find out about Ampere and Nvidia's plans for its new architecture in two weeks from today, when the company will deliver a keynote at its annual Graphics Technology Conference (GTC) that has the byline \"get amped.\" \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Razer Blade 16 pricing leaks: $2,000 for RTX 5060 model \n\n\n\n Arm considers acquisition of data center chipmaker Ampere \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 19 comments\n \n756 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows Defender misidentifies key driver, disrupting popular PC monitoring tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

Please enable Javascript in order to access all the functionality of this web site. Here are the instructions how to enable JavaScript in your web browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTen new laptops are joining the RTX Studio lineup. They\u2019re all powered by new GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs, which deliver faster performance than the original RTX 20 series. And they all feature the latest 10th Gen Intel Core processors.\nCreative professionals are more demanding than ever. More than 40 million online and studio-based creatives depend on high-performance PCs for their craft. For years they were underserved, having to rely on hardware that didn\u2019t always address their needs.\nWhen they finally found a system, it was either a large workstation or underpowered. Neither jibes with the need to work on the go.\nRTX Studio laptops changed that, with manufacturers using NVIDIA GeForce and Quadro RTX GPUs to build a new class of high-performance systems. Ultra-thin, light designs that unleash unique levels of creativity with the power to tackle the most challenging design and visualization projects.\nThe world\u2019s top software vendors have taken notice, bringing NVIDIA RTX acceleration to more than 45 apps. And they\u2019re backed by NVIDIA\u2019s industry-leading Studio driver program, ensuring peak performance and the highest levels of stability.\n Create Anywhere with Faster, More Powerful Laptops\nThe new GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs are the industry\u2019s fastest, most power-efficient available today. They\u2019re also the only GPUs with dedicated hardware cores to accelerate ray-traced rendering and enable AI capabilities that make content creation smarter and faster.\n\nIn addition, these laptops use NVIDIA Max-Q technology to be incredibly thin and light while introducing new features that provide even faster performance and longer battery life.\nAvailable from Acer (ConceptD 7 Ezel and ConceptD 7 Ezel Pro), Gigabyte (AERO 15 OLED and AERO 17 HDR), MSI (Creator 15, Creator 17, WS66 and WS75) and Razer (Blade 15 Base RTX Studio Edition and Blade 15 Advanced RTX Studio Edition), these laptops have creator-specific features such as Wacom Pens, 4K OLED and IPS screens with 100 percent Adobe RGB or DCI-P3, and superb industrial design.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the beginning. In the weeks ahead, HP will launch new precision-engineered RTX Studio laptops.\nFor a limited time, these new RTX Studio laptops come with three months of Adobe Creative Cloud (a $238.47 value) for new and existing Adobe customers.\n  \n Apps That Zoom\nOver 45 of the world\u2019s top 3D applications \u2014 including the most essential tools for design and content creation from Adobe to Autodesk to Blackmagic Design \u2014 are being accelerated with NVIDIA RTX technology. Artists and creators can interact with complex models and scenes using real-time ray-traced lighting, get faster batch rendering to speed the production process, and get access to amazing new AI creative tools.\n\nRecent upgrades include new GPU-accelerated features to apps from Cebas, OTOY and more.\nCebas finalRender Drop 4 added dedicated support for RTX GPUs, including accelerated ray tracing and AI-enhanced denoising, to deliver considerable speed gains.\nCorelDRAW Graphics Suite 2020 now includes several new machine learning features, including acceleratedJPEG artifact removal, image upsampling, and bitmap to vector tracing. \nD5 Render, a new real-time ray-tracing renderer based on DXR, uses RTX GPUs\u2019 real-time ray tracing and rasterization technology. It delivers an unprecedented real-time rendering experience for architecture and interior design. Designers can now easily render high-quality animated videos in a few minutes, and images in seconds.\nOTOY is shipping production-ready RTX support in OctaneRender 2020, integrating the NVIDIA Optix 7.0 API across all its DCC plugins. With OptiX 7 RTX acceleration, Octane users are seeing up to 2x-3x speedups in real-world scenes compared to previous versions.\nKeep an eye out for RTX-accelerated speedups in more of the top creative apps in the weeks to come.\n Tried and Trusted\nNVIDIA Studio Drivers provide artists, creators and 3D developers the best performance and reliability when working with creative applications. They undergo extensive testing against multi-app creator workflows and multiple revisions of the top creative applications from Adobe, Autodesk, Avid, Blackmagic Design, Epic, Maxon and Unity.\nJust as work and home are coming together, so are art and technology. Diversity in the growing lineup of systems purpose-built for creators means there\u2019s an RTX Studio laptop to keep your work flowing. Wherever your office is today.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

April 2020 13:45Igor Wallossek\n\n\n\n\n\n 1 - Introduction and important preliminary remark 2 - Nvidia's Rules - The Voltage Cheat made by MSI 3 - AMD's woes - tinker cards from the Far East 4 - Production processes and Nvidia's GLP 5 - Niche manufacturers and protectionism\n\n\n\n\nThe topic is plentiful complex and hot and ideally suited to provoke even neat emotions. I would therefore like to preface this article with a preliminary remark, which iamplease keep in mind during the reading. After all, I have thought for a long time whether and how what has accumulated here in my desk and in my head in recent years can be squeezed in article form in a reasonably unemotional and comprehensible way. The fact that I am doing this today is certainly also due to the time interval that I have allowed myself and the companies concerned.\nWhat is it all about? On the one hand, we have \u201cNvidias Rules\u201d, i.e. the mysterious \u201cGreen Light\u201d Program (GLP), which every product has to go through at the board partner, and we will see by way of an example that this interpretation of a quality monitoring, often referred to as a gearing, is not so absurd. Jensen may be subject to a lot of things, but what Nvidia is now so iare has contributed to the success of the products. And we will also learn later how it is, for example, AMD is creating to split regions or push non-board partners (AIB) out of the market to protect its own partners.\nGood partner, bad partner? Anyone who approaches this with too many emotions or color preferences is deliberately ignoring the fact that all of their competitors are market- and profit-oriented companies that are committed to their investors and who are closer to the dividend than any happy Klaus-Kevin, who has turned the empty graphics card boxes into a religious shrine and believes in the Church of the Holy 3 Pixels. Religious-fanatic fanboyism is always the worst counselor, Master Jensen not Jesus and Aunt Lisa also not the mother Theresa for distressed eSportsmen.\nOlder Application Note for Pascal\nFor all the conspiracy theorists with whom I was talking about Nvidia\u2019s all-encompassing NDA at the time, and who, even then, had given themselves an absolute power of interpretation in multimedia: I have not yet been put on dry bread or whipped up by lawyer. One should be able to look at many things with a certain composure and still be able to see the limits. This is a reminder that it may also be enough to argue that it is not possible to publish the very latest assets or to publish the very latest assets. to leave the necessary distance for all parties involved.\nAfter all, if you also ask the authors of such NDAs (which don\u2019t just come from Nvidia) and not only suspect or even let third parties oracle, then most of them relax on their own. Speaking of tension: That\u2019s where I start right now on the second page, also to make the point of certain measures clear. Because out of sheer boredom, no manufacturer does that. This example on the next page is quite vivid for some of the technical curiosities that have run so far over me in recent years.\nFor example, an engineering sample of a Radeon HD 7830 from AMD is an example of things that the end user never saw or sees. This map was eagerly awaited by many at the time and never appeared on the North American or European market. Instead, AMD sent a completely overturned and inflated HD 7790 into the race, which then died faster than the flies. Funnily enough, many of these 7830 chips later reappeared in China on special cards \u2013 as HD 7850 (LE), but were never allowed to be exported. AMD has been able to prevent this quite thoroughly and emphatically.\n\nAIB or AIC \u2013 the partner choice\nFirst of all, I would like to pre-introduce a small definition, which is very important for classifying the term Board Partner. Many will have already wondered what AIC or AIB mean. Companies such as AMD or Nvidia design the GPUs, have these chips manufactured by companies such as TSMC or Globalfoundries and then by specialists such as Ase as a package on the BGA. These packages are then sold together with the appropriate storage only as bundles to the board partners.\nThis is usually called add-in card (AIC) partner by Nvidia, at AMD this is usually called add-in board (AIB) partner, who then design their own boards and cards based on the respective specifications of the chip manufacturer. For most cards, the chip manufacturers also develop a so-called reference design as orientation. But even if there are not always reference designs to see for the end customer, there is a so-called Base Design Kit for each chip internally, i.e. a very narrow specification of how the card should look technical and electric. Board layout, assembly, firmware \u2013 nothing is left to chance. But more on that later.\nBut in addition to the global partners, there are also regional suppliers and brand owners who only license and sell products labelled. I will also have an example of this later. But first we come to two small trips into the world of why both Nvidia and AMD have tightened the thumbscrews so tightly.\n\n\n\r\n        Pages:    \n 1 - Introduction and important preliminary remark 2 - Nvidia's Rules - The Voltage Cheat made by MSI 3 - AMD's woes - tinker cards from the Far East 4 - Production processes and Nvidia's GLP 5 - Niche manufacturers and protectionism\n \n\n\nKommentieren\n\nIm Forum weiterlesen und kommentieren\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDanke f\u00fcr die Spende\n\n\n\n\n\nDu fandest, der Beitrag war interessant und m\u00f6chtest uns unterst\u00fctzen?

Choosing the right card depends on many factors, so we've streamlined that process for you. Right here, you'll find strong graphics card recommendations for budget 1080p gaming PCs all the way up to 4K and high refresh rate beasts, based on our extensive testing of every graphics card on the market.\nIf you just want our direct, no-nonsense GPU upgrade recommendations, that's not a problem. \n\nRight now, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti is our top pick for the best graphics card. If you want the highest possible frame-rates in games, plus support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing and other modern techs, then the RTX 2080 Ti stands head and shoulders above any other consumer card from Nvidia or AMD.\nIf you're looking to maximise your performance per dollar, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 offers excellent 1080p and 1440p frame-rates and is the cheapest card with hardware-accelerated ray tracing. That makes it our pick for the best value graphics card.\nIn terms of our lower tier picks, we've targeted a degree of longevity and better-than-console throughput for our best budget graphics card - in this case, the old but still powerful AMD Radeon RX 570. \nWhile these are our top picks, we've also highlighted a few alternatives for each category, so look out for those after each major recommendation.\nWant to know how much of an upgrade you can expect? Take a look at the Digital Foundry GPU Power Ladder, which ranks every current graphics card, from weakest to strongest, based on our extensive testing. \nGraphics card buyer's guide\nWhile gaming desktop PCs tend to be last longer than the average games console or gaming laptop, the graphics card is one component you'll need to replace regularly if you want to keep getting good performance in the latest games. Where processors might get faster by only a few percentage points every few years, graphics cards can see gains of 25 per cent from one generation to the next - and sometimes, the increase in performance is even more substantial. For example, the Intel Core i7 2600K launched back in 2011 and still holds up pretty well in modern games, yet graphics cards of a similar vintage will struggle even at low quality settings.\nChoosing the right graphics card is important because this is the component that does most of the heavy lifting that brings your games to life. Graphics hardware capable of easily running triple-A titles starts at around the \u00a3110/$110 mark, with Nvidia's GTX 1050 and AMD's RX 560 offering (on paper at least) significantly more graphics processing horsepower than the base PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. That means that every major multi-platform title should run at least with ballpark equivalent performance. From there, it's all about paying more and scaling up, with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti sitting at the current top of the pile.\nOf course, it's also important to avoid building a bottle-necked system, so you should aim to pair your video card of choice with a suitably powerful CPU, RAM and other components. We generally recommend system builders plump for at least 8GB of system RAM, with 16GB being a worthwhile upgrade. If you're using an AMD Ryzen or a mainstream Intel CPU, using two RAM modules in dual or even quad-channel mode ensures you're not handicapping your performance. Your choice of processor is also crucial to building a balanced system. AMD's Ryzen 5 and Intel's Core i5 are the price/performance champions for 60fps gaming, but if you're looking to run the latest games at the highest possible frame-rates, particularly on a high refresh rate display, we would recommend the Intel Core i7 8700K or its ninth-generation successors.\nThankfully, we've reached the point where even the cheaper end of the discrete GPU market offers some good results if you're prepared to put just a little effort into tweaking your in-game graphical settings. Beyond that, there's seemingly a graphics card for every kind of use-case - and that's where this guide comes in. Every GPU worth considering is included in this exhaustive guide, and if you're looking for more detailed performance metrics, we can link you through to the some of the most detailed gaming benchmarks around so you can see exactly what kind of performance you should expect.\n\nBest graphics card\nNvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti: 4K gaming at 60fps or more, plus some exciting new tech.\n \n \n\n\n\nRTX 2080 Ti review\nRTX 2080 Ti benchmarks\n\nGeneration:\tTuring\nCPU Cores:\t4352\nBoost Clock:\t1545MHz\nRTX-OPS:\t76T\nMemory:\t11GB GDDR6\nMemory Clock:\t11Gbps\nBandwith:\t616GB/s\n\n\nThe RTX 2080 Ti is the culmination of decades of work from Nvidia, and it shows. The 2080 Ti comes with significant improvements to raw graphical horsepower over the GTX 1080 Ti card it nominally replaces, plus exclusive access to new technologies like real-time ray tracing (RTX) and deep learning super sampling (DLSS) that can improve the looks and performance of supported games. With real-time ray tracing coming to both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, expect the value of this technology to only increase over time.\nOutside of new technologies, the powerful RTX 2080 Ti can handle resolutions up to 4K with ease, and performs well at high refresh rates too - just remember that high refresh rates also demand a powerful processor, so don't spend all of your cash on a new RTX card without at least a Core i7 7700K or better in your build. The RTX 2080 Ti is also a brilliant choice for VR gaming, especially for high-res VR headsets such as the Valve Index.\nWith the right system to back it up, you can roughly expect your RTX 2080 Ti to deliver at least 144 frames per second at 1080p, 100 frames per second at 1440p and 60 frames per second at 4K. Obviously, more recent and intensive titles may show poorer performance, while older esports-focused games are likely to perform significantly better. \n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nFastest consumer graphics card availableMost expensive consumer graphics card available\nExcellent performance at 4K and underRTX and DLSS support still isn't a given, although expect much more in 2020\nFeatures like real-time ray tracing and DLSS are getting better over time-\n\n\n\nRadeon RX 5700 XT: Best AMD alternative for 4K or HFR\n \n \n\n\n\nRX 5700 XT review\nRX 5700 XT benchmarks\n\nGeneration:\tNavi\nCPU Cores:\t2560\nBoost Clock:\t1755MHz\nMemory:\t8GB GDDR6\nMemory Clock:\t14Gbps\nBandwith:\t448GB/s\n\n\nThe RX 5700 XT is the top Radeon card on the market, following the departure of the short-lived Radeon 7. This GPU performs well at 1080p and 1440p, while 4K gaming is also in reach if you're willing to accept a few compromises in the settings menu. One nice feature of the RX 5700 XT is that it's based on a more advanced 7nm process than AMD's previous 14nm cards or Nvidia's existing 12nm lineup, which translates into better energy efficiency and less heat generation - a big improvement over AMD's historically hot and power-hungry flagships. \nThe RX 5700 XT includes support for the latest AMD software features, including Radeon Image Sharpening (a filter that makes edges in an image more noticeable) and Radeon Anti-Lag (a feature that synchronises CPU and GPU to minimise input lag in DX9, DX11 and Vulkan titles). However, there's no support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing, which is set to become more popular in 2020 as both next-gen consoles will ship with the feature.\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nStrong gaming performance, particularly in DX12 and Vulkan titlesPerformance in DX11 games, especially at 1080p and 1440p, leaves a lot to be desired\nCooler and more power-efficient than previous Radeon cardsNo support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing or variable rate shading\nProvides access to the latest Radeon software features-\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 2070 Super: Best value Nvidia alternative for 4K or HFR\n \n \n\n\nRTX 2070 Super review\nRTX 2070 Super\n\nGeneration:\tTuning\nCPU Cores:\t2560\nBoost Clock:\t1770MHz\nRTX-OPS:\t52T\nMemory:\t8GB GDDR6\nMemory Clock:\t14Gbps\nBandwith:\t448GB/s\n\n\n\nNvidia's newly upgraded upper-mid-range card offers 1440p performance in spades, while also packing in the new features that define the Turing generation: real-time ray tracing (RT) and deep learning super sampling (DLSS). The RTX 2070 Super handles 4K resolutions better than the 2060 Super and RX 5700 XT, allowing a comfortable 60fps with a bit of settings tweakery - and that's without factoring in DLSS. Similarly, high refresh rate monitors can also be tamed by the 2070 Super, although a powerful CPU is key here as well. \n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nStrong 1080p and 1440p performance in even the toughest gamesExpensive for a GeForce xx70 card\n4K gaming is viable on most titles, with some settings tweaks-\nDLSS and real-time ray tracing can be transformative-\n\n\n\nBest value graphics card\nNvidia GeForce RTX 2060: Cheapest future-proof GPU for 1080p and 1440p\n \n \n\n\nRTX 2060 review\nRTX 2060 benchmarks\n\nGeneration:\tTuning\nCPU Cores:\t1920\nBoost Clock:\t1680MHz\nRTX-OPS:\t76T\nMemory:\t6GB GDDR6\nMemory Clock:\t14Gbps\nBandwith:\t226GB/s\n\n\n\nThe RTX 2060 is an excellent card at the price, offering solid mid-range performance plus the RTX and DLSS features that define Nvidia's 20-series cards - and at a new lower price point, thanks to the release of the RTX 2060 Super. To give you some perspective on its prowess, the RTX 2060 outperforms 2015's Titan X Maxwell - which was once the very best of the best in terms of graphics hardware.\nThe performance level on tap allows the 2060 to tackle higher resolutions (1440p versus 1080p) or higher refresh rates (like 144Hz). If you're willing to experiment with lower detail settings or you're playing less demanding esports-focused titles like CSGO or Rocket League, your PC could easily drive a popular 1440p/144Hz monitor combo flat-out. With DLSS in play, you could shoot for even more demanding resolutions and refresh rates. However, remember that high refresh rates and low resolutions shift more of the load to your processor, so ensure you've got a worthy CPU on board; we recommend a Core i7 8700K or better for optimal performance.\nFinally, against expectations the RTX 2060 can indeed power ray-traced visuals at 1080p60 in games like Battlefield 5 and Control. With DLSS available in many games to offset the extra horsepower requirements, the RTX 2060 has only gotten better with time. This card also feels like a particularly canny choice with sampler feedback streaming and variable rate shading coming to the Xbox Series X, not to mention ray tracing arriving on both next-gen consoles - all of which are supported here.\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGreat 1080p and 1440p performanceSignificantly more expensive than the last-gen GTX 1060\nCan stretch to 4K gaming, particularly with a G-Sync monitorOnly 6GB of VRAM compared to 8GB on the GTX 1070 and RX 5700\nRelatively cool and efficientAchieving 4K at 60fps requires significant settings tweakery\nInclusion of RTX and DLSS is proving a big bonus-\n\n\n\nRadeon RX 5600 XTL: Best AMD alternative for 1440p\n \n \n\n\nRX 5600 XT review\n\nGeneration:\tNavi\nCPU Cores:\t2304\nBoost Clock:\t1750MHz\nMemory:\t6GB GDDR6\nMemory Clock:\t14Gbps\nBandwith:\t336GB/s\n\n\n\nThe RX 5600 XT was fairly unremarkable when first announced, but a pre-launch BIOS upgrade for several models - including the Sapphire Pulse we tested - left the card considerably faster than expected. In our testing at 1440p, the RX 5600 XT was only six per cent slower than the RX 5700, which costs around 25 per cent more. That makes this GPU an outstanding value for 1080p or 1440p gaming, with enough horsepower to rival the RTX 2060 and embarrass the GTX 1660 Super - just make sure you select a card like the Sapphire Pulse which runs with 14Gbps memory and 1750MHz boost clocks. The only major downside to this card is its future performance, which may be limited by its lack of support for features like hardware-accelerated ray tracing, which is set to come to both the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5. \n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExcellent frame-rates at 1080p and 1440pNo ray tracing or variable rate shading support on this generation of Radeon cards\nNormally both cheaper and faster than similar-price Nvidia cardsAggressive BIOS means there's little extra performance to find through overclocking\n-Not all cards have upgraded BIOSes available, so check specs carefully\n\n\n\nGeForce GTX 1660 Super: Best Nvidia alternative for 1440p\n \n \n\n\nGTX 1660 Super review\n\nGeneration:\tTuring\nCPU Cores:\t1408\nBoost Clock:\t1785MHz\nMemory:\t6GB GDDR6\nMemory Clock:\t14Gbps\nBandwith:\t336GB/s\n\n\n\nThe GTX 1660 Super is a newer version of the GTX 1660 with faster GDDR6 memory, allowing for strong results at 1080p and the option to stretch for 1440p with some settings tweaks. That makes it a good cut-price alternative to the RTX 2060, which is only around 20 per cent faster in most games we tested. However, the GTX 1660 Super isn't our overall best value pick because it lacks support for some next-gen techs like RTX and DLSS, which could hurt its long-term viability as a top graphics card. It's also outperformed by the similarly-priced AMD RX 5600 XT, especially models that operate at blazing 1750MHz clock speeds. \n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSignificantly better performance than RX 580/GTX 1060Slightly less VRAM than the RX 580 8GB, although this doesn't matter in most games\nGood option for 1080p; can usually stretch to 1440pThe lack of RTX and DLSS could limit this card's utility in the future\nMore future-proof than its RX 580/GTX 1060 competitors with VRS and new NVENC-\n\n\n\n\nBest budget graphics card\nAMD Radeon RX 570: Older mid-range available at an entry-level price\n \n \n\n\nRX 570 review\nRX 570 benchmarks\n\nGeneration:\tPolaris\nCPU Cores:\t2048\nBoost Clock:\t1244MHz\nMemory:\t4GB GDDR5\nMemory Clock:\t7Gbps\nBandwith:\t224GB/s\n\n\n\nWith the release of new generations of graphics cards from both AMD and Nvidia in late 2019 and early 2020, older AMD cards are seeing significant price drops that bring them into new relevancy. Case in point is the RX 570, a once mid-range card that is now among the cheapest and most performant graphics cards available. This card offers good performance at 1080p, even in the latest games, although you may have to turn down a few settings in some games to guarantee a 60fps average. \nHowever, the RX 570 does have its share of drawbacks. Chief among these is higher CPU utilisation than similarly powerful cards from Nvidia, so we recommend at least a quad-core processor - preferably a recent AMD Ryzen or Intel Core model - to avoid CPU bottlenecking. The RX 570 also tends to draw more power than the GTX 1060 3GB or GTX 1050 Ti, so it may not work well in systems with limited or non-standard power supplies. \nIf you're up for overclocking, you can wring more performance out of the RX 570. How much depends as always on the silicon lottery, but some units - especially those with beefier cooling solutions - will be able to nearly match the RX 580. \n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nUnparalleled performance for its priceCan't always hit 60fps at maximum settings\nFull HD resolution at 60 frames per second is within reachRequires a quad-core processor to avoid bottlenecking\n\n\n\nRadeon RX 5500 XT: Best AMD alternative for 1080p\n \n \n\n\nRX 5500 XT review\nRX 570 benchmarks\n\nGeneration:\tNavi\nCPU Cores:\t1408\nBoost Clock:\t1725MHz\nMemory:\t4GB/8GB GDDR6\nMemory Clock:\t14Gbps\nBandwith:\t224GB/s\n\n\n\nWhile the RX 570 remains one of the best value 1080p cards, the latest games may require a slightly more powerful card, especially if you're targeting high frame rates. The RX 5500 XT is a good choice in these situations, offering better performance than Nvidia's option at this price point, the GTX 1650. Both 4GB and 8GB versions are available, with the 8GB variant better able to handle ultra texture settings in recent games, but the 4GB model offering identical performance if you don't exceed its more limited VRAM capacity. \n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExcellent performance at 1080p, even in modern games4GB of RAM variant can be limiting in some recent titles\nCan stretch to 1440p gaming with settings tweaksNot quite powerful enough for no-compromises 1440p gaming\nBetter power efficiency and thermal characteristics than RX 570-\n\n\n\nGeForce GTX 1650 Super: Best Nvidia alternative for 1080p\n \n \n\n\nGTX 1650 Super review\n\nGeneration:\tTuring\nCPU Cores:\t1280\nBoost Clock:\t1725MHz\nMemory:\t4GB GDDR6\nMemory Clock:\t12Gbps\nBandwith:\t192GB/s\n\n\n\nNvidia is a little out-gunned in the low-end space at present, but their best offering is the GTX 1650 Super. This card offers slightly less 1080p and 1440p performance than the RX 5500 XT, but normally costs a little less too. A few Turing-era features are included here, including variable rate shading and the new NVENC encoder, making the card slightly more future-proof than some of its rivals. However, Nvidia's standout RTX and DLSS features are absent, in common with all GTX cards.\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGood performance at 1080p, on par with the GTX 1060 6GB4GB of RAM makes running at ultra texture settings difficult in some games\nNvidia's driver is more efficient than AMD's, resulting in lower CPU usageAMD's low-end offerings, old and new, are generally more performant\nIncludes some Turing features, including VRS and the new NVENC encoder-\n\n\n\nAnd with that, we reach the end of our current graphics card recommendations.

This little piece of hardware was released in October of 2019 as the most compact version of the NVIDIA SHIELD device line yet produced. It's more than an alternative to products like Amazon Fire TV Stick/Cube, or Apple TV. It's a doorway to the world's best streaming content, complete with a feature that makes old content look better than it's ever looked before.\nAdvertisement\n\nI've reviewed and/or used and/or owned every NVIDIA SHIELD devices since before the SHIELD collection became about smart TV. They started with the NVIDIA SHIELD, a device that's since been re-named NVIDIA SHIELD Portable, a handheld gaming controller with a display attached, running Android \u2013 well ahead of its time, to be sure.\n\n \n\nThey made an NVIDIA SHIELD Tablet \u2013 very similar to the NVIDIA SHIELD Portable, with a larger display and no attached controller. They moved the controller to its own separate piece of hardware then \u2013 that controller can still be used with the latest versions of NVIDIA SHIELD today \u2013 then another one. There was also a stylus situation at one point \u2013 that remains radical today \u2013 there was an NVIDIA SHIELD Tablet K1, too.\nAdvertisement\n\n\n \n\nABOVE: NVIDIA SHIELD Tablet, controller (gen 1) and a bunch of accessories and such. BELOW: The NVIDIA SHIELD Android TV gen 1 and gen 2. The smaller hardware is gen 2 \u2013 this is essentially the size and shape of the newest NVIDIA SHIELD Pro (2019) too.\n\n \n\nThey released an NVIDIA SHIELD Android TV device, then another with a slightly smaller hardware footprint with less internal data storage, then they pulled out the stops with NVIDIA SHIELD 2019 \u2013 the device we're looking at today.\n\n \n\nThe NVIDIA SHIELD 2019 has AI upscaling abilities. This isn't your everyday run-of-the-mill \"soap opera effect\" nonsense. It's a system that analyzes every frame of video content you're viewing and computes the pixels necessary to enlarge the content to the size of your chosen display.\nTraditional \"upscaling\" is sort of like having a printed picture on a Fruit Roll-Up. You stretch it out, and it looks stretched out. You're still working with the same image, just pulled out in all directions. With AI upscaling, the NVIDIA SHIELD's processor applies Deep Learning Neural Network tech to the process, filling in the gaps with visual data that best fits the image.\n\n \n\nThe end result is a piece of hardware that takes all your favorite content \u2013 MOST* of your favorite content, that is \u2013 and makes it look better than you remember it ever looking before. This is ideal for the world in which we now live \u2013 apart, alone, sitting in front of the television, streaming episodes of The Office.\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NVIDIA SHIELD (2019) can be purchased for around $150 USD right now from a variety of stores online. If you're looking at places like Best Buy or Amazon right now, you might find a slightly better price, but assuming you're reading this in the future, don't worry! That $150 will be well spent.\n\n\n\nMOST of your favorite content\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a limit to which NVIDIA's AI Upscaling can work its magic. The full-powered \"AI Upscaling\" system works with content with video resolution higher than 480p, with a frame rate higher than 30Hz \u2013 and the video content color space MUST be RGB to start.\nAdvertisement\n\n\n \n\nOtherwise, as NVIDIA suggests in documentation, AI Enhanced upscaling will fallback to \"Enhanced\" if the content is too small, the framerate is too low, or video content color space is not RGB.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA SHIELD Pro for pros\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's also an NVIDIA SHIELD Pro, a device that's very similar to the 2nd-gen NVIDIA SHIELD Android TV device, with the smaller hardware size and the rectangular shape, plus the AI upscaling. That costs a bit more than the tube-shaped model and has some extra ports and such.\nAdvertisement\n\n\n \n\nThe NVIDIA SHIELD Pro is the model you'll want if you've used an NVIDIA SHIELD before, but want to upgrade. Going from an NVIDIA SHIELD Android TV gen 1 or 2 to an NVIDIA SHIELD 2019 (non-pro) can be a bit jarring if you're used to utilizing the USB ports \u2013 this new model has none.\nBut the NVIDIA SHIELD Pro has all the benefits of the NVIDIA SHIELD 2019, plus the benefits of the ports. The Pro also has more internal storage right out the gate, more RAM, and the ability to function as a PLEX Media server.\nThe NVIDIA SHIELD Pro (2019) will cost you anywhere from $50 to $75 more than the non-Pro. For some users, the additional or upgraded features could make all the difference.\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The company is launching the GeForce RTX 2070 Super and the RTX 2080 Super for laptops, both of which now support enhanced Max-Q Technologies.\r\n\n\nThis time around, NVIDIA is bundling in some new features under the Max-Q Technology umbrella to enable even thinner and lighter laptops. When all of the new features are combined, NVIDIA is touting up to a 2X improvement in efficiency over previous Max-Q implementations in gaming laptops.\u00a0Among these new additions are Dynamic Boost, which brings automatic and intelligent per-frame balancing of CPU and GPU power.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe aim is to improve overall gaming performance with less of any impact in overall power consumption but also with better load balancing between CPU and GPU workloads. It appears to be similar in practice to\u00a0AMD SmartShift\u00a0that's going to be available with Ryzen 4000 CPUs and Radeon GPUs, in that TDP can be allocated away from the CPU to boost the GPU, or vice-versa, while staying within a given power budget -- in real-time, frame by frame. NVIDIA is also using next-generation voltage regulator technologies for improved graphics performance along with low-voltage GDDR6 memory to improve power efficiency.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, new Advanced Optimus Technology is being introduced with these GPUs, which now supports G-SYNC simultaneously. This is made possible because the GPU can now output directly to the display without having to go through the IGP first. It also supports up to 4K resolutions at 120Hz, along with improved latency. Finally, there's support for\u00a0Deep Learning Super Sampling 2.0\u00a0(DLSS 2.0), which we've\u00a0covered in detail in this article.\n\n\nThere are quite a few announcements from OEMs in support of these new systems, and we\u2019ll detail them below:\n\n\nGigabyte\nGigabyte has no less than 9 new notebooks launching with Comet Lake-H (up to the Core i9-10980HK and GeForce GPUs topping out with the GeForce RTX 2080 Super. The Aorus 5 and Aorus 7 are part of Gigabyte's \"Premium Gaming\" family and include 144Hz gaming displays, up to a 10th\u00a0generation Core i7 processor, GeForce GTX/RTX Turing GPUs and an RGB backlit keyboard. The Aorus 5 starts at $1,299, while the Aorus 7 starts from $1,399.\nGigabyte Aero 17 HDR\n\n\nThe \"Extreme Pro Gaming\" entrants include the Aorus 15G ($1,699), Aorus 17G ($1,799), and the Aorus 17X (2,399). These machines can be equipped with up to 10th\u00a0gen Core i9 processors and come with such niceties as a 240Hz display option, Omron True Mechanical Keyboard, and WindForce Infinity Cooling. These systems are exclusively available with GeForce RTX 2070/2080 Super GPUs.\n\n\nFinally, there are the \"Content Creation\" laptops, which include the Aero 15 and Aero 17. These are NVIDIA RTX Studio Laptops available with 10th\u00a0gen Core i7 or Core i9 processors. They feature Xrite Pantone color calibration, all-day battery life, and of course GeForce RTX 2070/2080 Super GPUs. Prices start at $1,599 for the Aero 15 and $1,699 for the Aero 17.\n\n\nMSI\nMSI is entering the fray with three laptops using a combination of Comet Lake-H and GeForce RTX 20 Super GPUs. The 15.6-inch GS66 Stealth ($1,499)\u00a0leaked earlier this week\u00a0and is available with up to a 300Hz display, a 99.9 Whr battery, and an Infinity Cooler Boost Trinity+ cooling system.\nMSI Creator 17\n\n\nThe GE66 Raider ($1,799) shares similar specs with its GS66 Stealth counterpart, but adds MSI Mystic Light and panoramic aurora lighting displays. MSI also hasn't forgotten about that professionals out there with the Creator 17 ($1,799) that comes equipped with a 17.3-inch 4K Mini LED display that is DisplayHDR 1000 certified.\n\n\nLenovo\nLenovo is doing its part with the addition of the Legion 7i and Legion 5i laptops for enthusiasts. While both laptops ship with 10th\u00a0generation Comet Lake-S processors, only the Legion 7i is available with up to a GeForce RTX 2080 Super with Max-Q design -- the Legion 5i tops out with a GeForce RTX 2060. The Legion 5i will start at $999, while the Legion 7i will be priced from $1,199.\nLenovo Legion 7i\n\n\nIn addition, NVIDIA says that 10 new RTX Studio laptops with GeForce RTX Super GPUs are coming to market (including the aforementioned models from MSI and Gigabyte). They will be joined by ConceptD models from Acer and the Blade RTX Studio Edition from Razer. NVIDIA says that Hewlett-Packard will be joining the fray as well \"in the coming weeks\". All of these new RTX Studio laptops will ship with three months free access to Adobe Creative Cloud (which represents a $240 value).\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA says that many of the new laptops with its GeForce RTX 20 Super GPUs are available to preorder now and will ship starting April 15th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, Optimus, (nasdaq:nvda), turing, geforce rtx super\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX Spark,...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To Supercharge...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's Dream...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing Watermarks...\nBeep-Beep!

Monday, we saw the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, the first with \n  AMD's\n flagship eight-core consumer mobile chip and first AMD-based laptop with discrete \n  Nvidia\n RTX graphics. Today, \n  Intel\n announced its competing 10th-gen Core H series, which is headlined by a new octa-core/16-thread i7 processor, the i7-10875H. Intel's launch is also concurrent with Nvidia's rollout of mobile versions of its GeForce RTX 2070 Super and 2080 Super, welcome step-ups mirroring their desktop counterparts.\u00a0Nvidia also announced an updated version of its Max-Q power-saving architecture -- versions of its GPUs designed for thin-and-light high-end gaming laptops. The big news is a series of changes to its Optimus design, dubbed Advanced Optimus. That controls when a laptop switches between its basic integrated graphics and a high-power, battery-killing discrete Nvidia graphics card. The switching in Advanced Optimus is said to be more efficient. Another new feature, Dynamic boost, offers more granular balancing of power allocation (and thus speed) between the CPU and GPU.     The Acer Predator Triton 500 will also offer a 300Hz screen along with the newer Nvidia and Intel parts. AcerThis may not sound groundbreaking by itself, but even incremental performance advances can be a boon in gaming and creative work, where every extra frame or encoding minute saved can make a difference.Read more: Best laptops for 2020As ever with Intel and Nvidia launches, they're accompanied by a host of new products from key partners. This time it's the usual suspects, including\u00a0\n  Razer\n, \n  Lenovo\n, \n  Asus\n, \n  Acer\n, Gigabyte and MSI. Most of the new releases are simply updates of existing models with the replacement versions of last year's CPUs and GPUs, along with pricing and availability for eagerly awaited (at least by me!) models incorporating the new components that were announced at CES 2020 in January.\u00a0These include the MSI Creator 17, which comes with an optional 4K DisplayHDR 1000 mini LED display. It'll ship in mid-April for $3,799 (about \u00a33,060 or AU$6,230) with that screen. There's also the Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel Pro and gaming models offering the new 300Hz 1080p screens, such as the updated Razer Blade 15 (expected by the end of June). Also of note: Asus has taken the opportunity to release a version of its dual-screen ZenBook Pro Duo for gamers, the ROG Zephyrus Duo 15 (available starting around June), with a tilting design for its second screen that looks like a real improvement.Read more:\u00a0Best gaming laptop performers in 2020\u00a0\u00a0     The dual-screen Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo 15 gaming system AsusBut Nvidia says you'll also see prices starting at $699 for entry-level models with discrete GPUs, such as the GTX 1650. Systems with RTX 2060 GPUs will begin at just under $1,000. (Those will still use ninth-gen Intel CPUs.) In addition to the RTX 2060, the plain RTX 2070 will also remain a key mainstream-priced GPU. That's fine by me -- I'll never complain about better performance at an existing price threshold. Despite coronavirus-complicated supply problems, many of the manufacturers say they expect to begin shipping the new models this month. The GTX 1650 Ti and 1660 Ti remain for sale as well.For the new Max-Q, manufacturers have to update firmware and the electrical system at the very minimum to support power-saving low-voltage GDDR6 video memory and to improve voltage-regulator efficiency. The new Dynamic Boost feature shifts power allocation between the CPU and GPU as needed to eke out better overall performance without wasting battery power unnecessarily (a la AMD's SmartShift).\u00a0     Razer's Blade 15 Advanced update will offer a 300Hz screen option. RazerNvidia's Advanced Optimus improves on the original by essentially putting a switcher on the bus between the integrated GPU and the discrete GPU so the system can change between them on the fly. You previously had to be on one bus or the other, and the built-in display was usually connected to the iGPU. The switcher allows a direct path between the laptop screen and the discrete GPU, which is how it now enables G-Sync. (The new features will be coming to AMD-based systems as well.) Being able to switch on the fly allows the system to better choose whether to use the slow, low-power iGPU or the fast, high-power discrete GPU. In theory, that means less battery drain and better performance when you need it.The first laptop announced with Advanced Optimus support are the Lenovo Legion 7i and 5i (which replace the Legion Y740 and Y540) expected later this year. Every Max-Q on laptops first available from today is a new Max-Q, even for older GPUs.\u00a0 \u00a0Intel plays it safeThe new 10th-gen H lineup sounds less inspiring. They're Comet Lake-H (14nm), not Ice Lake (10nm) generation -- compare that with AMD's Ryzen 4000 series, which jumps down to 7nm -- and mostly gain some tweaks to power usage, memory speed and small bumps in clock speed over their predecessors. Specifically, those improvements boil down to support for 2,933MHz dual-channel DDR4 memory, Speed Optimizer one-click overclocking for chips that support it, integrated Wi-Fi 6 AX201 (Gig+) and some refinements to existing power-management technologies, like its Adaptix workload-based dynamic frequency adjustments.10th-gen Core H CPU lineup   Processor Cores / threadsCacheBase frequency (GHz)Max single core turbo (GHz)i5-10300H 4/88MB2.54.5i5-10400H 4/88MB2.64.6i7-10750H 6/1212MB2.65i7-10850H 6/1212MB2.75.1i7-10875H 8/1616MB2.35.1i9-10980HK 8/1616MB2.45.3    It's not clear yet how their performance will compare over the ninth-gen equivalents, since Intel only provided numbers against three-year-old laptops. CPU and GPU manufacturers like to provide performance comparisons against much older systems -- citing the replacement cycle -- rather than the previous year's. But knowing how they compare against the previous generation is an important consideration when deciding whether it's worth the price premium to buy a laptop with the latest component or if you can safely save money by opting for an older model.One potential bright spot is a new octa-core i7-10875H, though it's within the realm of possibility that it's just an updated and rebranded replacement for the i9-9980H, since there's no equivalent for that i9 in the new lineup. The six-core i7-10850H supports partial automatic overclocking (for two cores only), and the octa-core i9-10980HK is fully unlocked. It can scale performance up to the 65-watt power envelope typical of big \n  gaming\n laptops or work within the same 45-watt target of more mainstream, thin and lightweight models that the rest of the processors in the line are designed for.     The MSI GS66 Stealth will have a configuration based on the flagship i9-10980HK CPU. MSIThe devil's in the details, though. AMD's seen a performance advance in single-core workloads with its Ryzen 4000 series mobile CPUs without sacrificing its lead in multicore performance. It'll be interesting to see how the 10th-gen H models stack up in comparison. Intel continued to pursue single-core performance over multicore for this lineup, because many games still don't take advantage of multiple CPU cores. The company says it couldn't achieve the higher speeds if it moved from Comet Lake H to a newer generation.\u00a0But that strikes me as short-sighted. Creative applications are quickly moving to take advantage of as many cores as you have. And while current popular games may be optimized for at most four cores, future games are likely to be more demanding. Given that, by Intel's reckoning, people only upgrade their systems every few years, the future should weigh more than it does in Intel's high-end laptop chip strategy.\u00a0    Watch this: The best laptops from CES 2020\n        19:03  \n    The best laptops from CES 2020\n         \n        +21 More\n       See all photos      \n    Computing Guides\n   \n      Laptops\n     \n  \n          Best Laptop\n        \n          Best Chromebook\n        \n          Best Budget Laptop\n        \n          Best Cheap Gaming Laptop\n        \n          Best 2-in-1 Laptop\n        \n          Best Windows Laptop\n        \n          Best Macbook\n        \n          Best Gaming Laptop\n        \n          Best Macbook Deals\n        \n      Desktops & Monitors\n     \n  \n          Best Desktop PC\n        \n          Best Gaming PC\n        \n          Best Monitor Under 200\n        \n          Best Desktop Deals\n        \n          Best Monitors\n        \n          M2 Mac Mini Review\n        \n      Computer Accessories\n     \n  \n          Best PC Speakers\n        \n          Best Printer\n        \n          Best External Hard Drive SSD\n        \n          Best USB C Hub Docking Station\n        \n          Best Keyboard\n        \n          Best Webcams\n        \n          Best Mouse\n        \n          Best Laptop Backpack\n        \n      Photography\n     \n  \n          Best Camera to Buy\n        \n          Best Vlogging Camera\n        \n          Best Tripod\n        \n          Best Waterproof Camera\n        \n          Best Action Camera\n        \n          Best Camera Bag and Backpack\n        \n          Best Drone\n        \n      Tablets & E-Readers\n     \n  \n          Best E-Ink Tablets\n        \n          Best iPad Deals\n        \n          Best iPad\n        \n          Best E-Reader\n        \n          Best Tablet\n        \n          Best Android Tablet\n        \n      3D Printers\n     \n  \n          Best 3D Printer\n        \n          Best Budget 3D Printer\n        \n          Best 3D Printing Filament\n        \n          Best 3D Printer Deals\n                          Your guideto a better future DealsReviewsBest ProductsGift GuideCouponsVideosSoftware Downloads About CNET Press Room Newsletters Licensing Sitemap Careers Accessibility Cookie Settings Privacy Policy  Terms of Use Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information instagram youtube tiktok facebook x flipboard  US France Germany Japan Korea \n  \u00a9 2025 CNET, a Ziff Davis company.\n  All rights reserved.\n   \n\n\n"

Exactly as it says on the tin, this was a version of the company\u2019s GTX 1650 accelerator, except with newer GDDR6 instead of the GDDR5 it launched with. Now, in one of NVIDIA\u2019s more poorly kept secrets, their desktop product stack is getting a version of the card as well.\nWhile not a launch (as NVIDIA likes to frame it), the desktop GTX 1650 GDDR6 has none the less finally become an official product this past Friday, with partners unveiling their cards and NVIDIA adding the specifications to their website. Sitting alongside the existing GDDR5 version, the GDDR6 version is intended to be a parallel, generally equal SKU. As NVIDIA makes the transition from GDDR5 to GDDR6 at the bottom edge of their product lineup, the updated card gets access to faster memory, but interestingly the GPU clockspeeds are also tapered back a bit.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce Specification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\nGTX 1660\nGTX 1650 Super\nGTX 1650 (G6)\nGTX 1650 (G5)\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n1408\n1280\n896\n896\n\n\nROPs\n48\n32\n32\n32\n\n\nCore Clock\n1530MHz\n1530MHz\n1410MHz\n1485MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1785MHz\n1725MHz\n1590MHz\n1665MHz\n\n\nMemory Clock\n8Gbps GDDR5\n12Gbps GDDR6\n12Gbps GDDR6\n8Gbps GDDR5\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n192-bit\n128-bit\n128-bit\n128-bit\n\n\nVRAM\n6GB\n4GB\n4GB\n4GB\n\n\nSingle Precision Perf.\n5 TFLOPS\n4.4 TFLOPS\n2.85 TFLOPS\n3 TFLOPS\n\n\nTGP\n120W\n100W\n75W\n75W\n\n\nGPU\nTU116\r\n\t\t\t(284 mm2)\nTU116\r\n\t\t\t(284 mm2)\nTU117\r\n\t\t\t(200 mm2)\nTU117\r\n\t\t\t(200 mm2)\n\n\nTransistor Count\n6.6B\n6.6B\n4.7B\n4.7B\n\n\nArchitecture\nTuring\nTuring\nTuring\nTuring\n\n\nManufacturing Process\nTSMC 12nm \"FFN\"\nTSMC 12nm \"FFN\"\nTSMC 12nm \"FFN\"\nTSMC 12nm \"FFN\"\n\n\nLaunch Date\n03/14/2019\n11/22/2019\n04/03/2020\n04/23/2019\n\n\nLaunch Price\n$219\n$159\n~$149\n$149\n\n\n\nBy the numbers, the new GDDR6 version is largely the same as the GDDR5 version. Both are 75W cards based on NVIDIA\u2019s entry-level Turing TU117 GPU. However the GDDR6 version of the card both gains some and loses some in the process. NVIDIA swaps out the GDDR5 for newer GDDR6 \u2013 and thereby finally confirming that TU117 is GDDR6-capable \u2013 however the cards also take a slight clockspeed nerf. As a result the GDDR6 version of the card has a whopping 50% more memory bandwidth \u2013 bringing it to 192GB/sec \u2013 but 5% lower GPUs clocks and throughput.\nIn discussing the matter with NVIDIA, we were told that the GPU clockspeed change was to equalize performance and power consumption between the two parts. Which makes sense to a degree \u2013 the GTX 1650 is a particularly special part in NVIDIA\u2019s lineup since it\u2019s the fastest card they offer that can be powered entirely by a PCIe slot, which is to say it can\u2019t have a TDP over 75 Watts. So with the GDDR5 version already close to that limit, if the switch to GDDR6 memory drives up power consumption at all (be it the memory or the GPU\u2019s memory controllers), then something else has to be dialed back to compensate.\nMeanwhile, equalizing performance is something of a secondary goal in this situation, especially because of the potency of GDDR6 memory. NVIDIA doesn't intend for the GDDR6 version of the GTX 1650 to be its own product; the next card up after the GTX 1650 remains the GTX 1650 Super. But given what we\u2019ve seen on other Turing parts such as the GTX 1660 series, where a similar switch netted a further 10% in performance, I would expect the GTX 1650 to see the same kind of modest benefits from the faster memory. This in turn would more than outweigh the 5% GPU clockspeed drop. So don\u2019t be surprised if the GTX 1650 with GDDR6 turns out to be a bit faster than its pre-existing GDDR5 counterpart, though it shouldn\u2019t be by very much.\nOtherwise, the GTX 1650 GDDR6 will end up filling the same general role as the original GTX 1650. The entry-level card is the cheapest (and the slowest) of the Turing family, offering as much performance as NVIDIA can pack into a 75 Watt TDP. And while the cards should still be relatively small, I do find it interesting that NVIDIA lists the length for the (non-public) reference card at 5.7-inches, 0.6-inches longer than the GDDR5 version. GDDR6 cards require a new PCB, so this raises the curious question of whether GDDR6 designs can\u2019t be made quite as compact as GDDR5 designs.\n\nOverall, this low-key release should mark a more important turning point in the state of GDDR memory. If NVIDIA and its partners are now willing to release GDDR6 versions of low-end cards, then this is a strong indicator that GDDR6 has finally lost most of its new technology price premium, and that memory prices have fallen by enough to be competitive with 8Gbps GDDR5. GDDR6 prices were a sticking point for the profit-sensitive NVIDIA during the original Turing product stack launch, so while it has taken an extra year, the company is finally offering a top-to-bottom GDDR6-based product stack.\nNVIDIA\u2019s partners, in turn, are already rolling out their cards, with designs from Gigabyte, MSI, EVGA, and others. As with the original GTX 1650 cards, it looks like many of these will be factory overclocked, throwing out the 75W power limit in order to get some extra performance out of the TU117 GPU. Meanwhile, pricing for the GDDR6 cards appears to be identical to their GDDR5 counterparts, underscoring the transitionary nature of this release.\n\n\n                Source:\n                NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n30 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\njimjamjamie - Monday, April 6, 2020 - link\nI think it would be beneficial to include the memory bandwidth numbers in the comparison table.\n\n\n\nSlash3 - Monday, April 6, 2020 - link\nAbsolutely.\n\n\n\nRaistlinZ - Monday, April 6, 2020 - link\nThat's crazy talk.  :\u00de\n\n\n\nwizfactor - Monday, April 6, 2020 - link\nI hope Nvidia has the sense to give the GTX 1650 a fair price. $149 is horrible value when the 1650 Super, a far faster card, is only $10 more.If anyone has a PSU so cheaply made that it's dangerous to provide 6-pin power to any kind of discrete GPU, then that computer has bigger problems than needing the GPU to be powered only by the PCIe slot.\n\n\n\nPeachNCream - Monday, April 6, 2020 - link\nThere are a fair number of OEM desktops around that would not have the necessary power.  In the case of business class hardware, the quality is generally pretty high due to the need for longer warranties from the vendor to cover the full expected lifespan of the system.  In those cases one of the x030 class GPUs is a good fit.  The 1650 is pushing it a bit for sub-300 watt PSUs so an upgrade would be necessary which can be a pain in a business class system.  Not that there are a lot of desktops out there in the wild anyway with most companies issuing out laptops (something likely to become even more common now that we are in a work-from-home world).\n\n\n\nwizfactor - Monday, April 6, 2020 - link\nI am sure there is a computer out there where support for an extra 6-pin power cable doesn't exist. With that said, I don't think there are that many people who are in a position where this is their only choice for a computer and it's impossible to upgrade the power supply. If anyone is that person, then the GTX 1650 is the way to go, but only because they don't have a choice.I bet the vast majority of PC builders do have a choice. For them, the GTX 1650 makes no sense at $150. The $10 extra for the Super is a must.\n\n\n\neek2121 - Monday, April 6, 2020 - link\nI don\u2019t know of a single OEM out there that ships such a configuration. If there is one, shame on them. Does 25W really make or break things?\n\n\n\nAlistair - Monday, April 6, 2020 - link\nthere is no computer that can't run the 1650 Super, at worse, you can use an adapter to create a six pin out of your HDD power cable$120 and we'll talk, this card should have been put in the dumpster long ago\n\n\n\nDahak - Tuesday, April 7, 2020 - link\nLook at all the dell's, hp's, lenovo's especially the SFF machines which may not have a 6-pin gpu power but if the 1650 is available as a low profile card, would still work in these type of machines\n\n\n\nrrinker - Monday, April 6, 2020 - link\nPretty much. It's always a budgeting issue, but ditch the RGB fans and get plain ones, ditch the windowed case and get a plain one, ditch the fancy heat spreader RAM (with or without RGB) and get the same speed RAM in a plain package, use a slightly less expensive SSD, you'll never see the speed difference, and you'll easily have the budget to pay an extra $20 for a better quality power supply, the $10 extra for the 1650 Super, and probably enough left over to go to the next fasted CPU. Stuff that will actually improve performance in noticeable ways. Now you kids get off my lawn - yes, I am old, and I just don't get the poseur gamer (or poseur car) world. Why just look fast when you can actually be fast? I get if you already have the latest top of the line everything, the only thing you can do past that is add all sorts of RGB lights, UV reactive coolants, etc. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

OEMs and vendors across the spectrum are gearing up to roll out new and updated laptops based on the latest silicon, as they set themselves up for the next year or so of laptop sales.\nNot one to be left out, NVIDIA is also using this week\u2019s launches to roll out some new laptop graphics adapters, which partners will be pairing with those new Ryzen and Core processors. The company is also unveiling a rather important set of additions to their laptop technology portfolio, introducing new features to better manage laptop TDP allocations, and for the first time, the ability to have G-Sync in an Optimus-enabled laptop. Overall while this week is primarily focused on AMD and Intel, NVIDIA is making sure that they are giving partners (and consumers) something new for this generation of laptops.\n\nGeForce RTX 2080 Super & RTX 2070 Super\nFirst and foremost, NVIDIA is launching two new mobile graphics adapters this morning. The GeForce RTX 2080 Super and RTX 2070 Super, both of which were launched on the desktop last summer, are now coming to laptops. Like their desktop counterparts, the new adapters are based on NVIDIA\u2019s existing TU104 silicon, so there aren\u2019t any new GPUs to speak of today, but their launch gives OEMs additional options for dGPUs for their high-end gaming laptops.\nAs has been the case for NVIDIA throughout this generation, while the company doesn\u2019t have distinct, mobile-labeled SKUs, the new laptop parts do have their own set of specifications. Specifically, while the mobile parts have the same CUDA core counts and memory support as their desktop brethren, they have different clockspeed and TDP profiles, owing to the limitations of the laptop form factor. All told, the new Super parts are designed for 80W+ laptops, with the flagship RTX 2080 Super approved for 150W (or more) designs, as vendors get the option to push the adapter just about as hard as they think they can get away with in the luggable desktops we commonly see in the broader market for ultra high powered laptops.\n\nOtherwise, these are fairly typical GeForce RTX SKUs. Boost clocks will range from 1080MHz to 1560MHz, depending on what laptop vendors opt for in terms of power and performance. The RTX 2080 Super will have a fully-enabled, 3072 CUDA core TU104 GPU, while the RTX 2070 Super gets a 2560 core version of the same GPU.\nMeanwhile, memory is the only other notable change here: while both adapters come with 8GB of GDDR6 memory, unlike the desktop RTX 2080 Super, the mobile version won\u2019t come with 15.5Gbps GDDR6. Instead, it ships with 14Gbps memory like the rest of the RTX lineup. Overclocked VRAM is rather expensive in terms of power, so it\u2019s not too surprising to see NVIDIA drop it here.\nNVIDIA is also using this opportunity to roll out some smaller hardware updates to its laptop portfolio. On the memory front once more, the company has confirmed for the first time that it has been working with memory vendors on low voltage GDDR6 memory. Unfortunately the details here are slim \u2013 it\u2019s not clear whether the low voltage RAM NVIDIA is using is any different than the 1.25v GDDR6 already offered by memory suppliers \u2013 but even 1.25v would be a notable decrease over normal 1.35v memory. NVIDIA pegs VRAM memory consumption at around 20 to 25 watts for their laptop solutions, so being able to shave off even 10% of that is a couple more watts that can be shifted over to the GPU itself for more performance.\nAnd keeping with the power efficiency theme, NVIDIA tells us that they\u2019ve also been working with partners to get better VRMs in laptops. This is another area where details are quite slim, but VRMs have been an ongoing focus area for the company. Voltage regulation is a game of efficiency \u2013 any power you lose is waste heat that eats into a laptop\u2019s thermal budget \u2013 so the goal is always to maximize efficiency. Coupled with NVIDIA\u2019s new Dynamic Boost technology, the need for more efficient VRMs (particularly high wattage solutions) is at an all-time high.\nGeForce GTX 1650 Ti and GTX 1650 (GDDR6) As Well\nAlongside their new high-end hardware, NVIDIA is also launching a pair of new low-end SKUs for the mobile space. These are the GeForce GTX 1650 Ti, and a GDDR6 version of the GTX 1650.\nThe GTX 1650 Ti is a particularly interesting matter, as it has no desktop counterpart. Up until now, NVIDIA has been launching desktop parts first, and then having laptop parts launch in-concert with the desktop parts, or at a later time entirely. But for the GTX 1650 Ti, we have a purely mobile part, at least for the time being.\nThe hardware itself shouldn\u2019t be too much of a surprise. Here NVIDIA is reusing its TU117 GPU, which is the same GPU that powered the original mobile GTX 1650. The big change here is that the Ti SKU gets much better definition: whereas the regular GTX 1650 has \u201cup to\u201d 1024 CUDA cores and comes with a couple of different memory types, the GTX 1650 Ti is guaranteed to have 1024 CUDA cores as well as GDDR6 memory. Coupled with a slightly higher maximum TDP of 55W, and it should deliver better performance. Though it\u2019s still going to leave a noticeable gap between this fully-enabled TU117 part and the next part up in the stack, the TU116-based mobile GTX 1660 Ti.\nJoining the GTX 1650 Ti will be another GTX 1650 SKU, the GTX 1650 with GDDR6. As alluded to in the name, this is a mobile GTX 1650 with GDDR6 memory instead of GDDR5. NVIDIA isn\u2019t outlining any performance figures for the new part, so performance expectations will have to be left up to the reader\u2019s imagination, but at otherwise equivalent specifications, this would be a 50% bump in memory bandwidth, from 8Gbps GDDR5 to 12Gbps GDD6.\nHowever it\u2019s going to be up to laptop vendors to decide what GTX 1650 configuration they\u2019re using, as well as how to disclose it. The GDDR6 version isn\u2019t getting its own canonical SKU name, so a laptop with it could have anything from an 896 core model with GDDR5 to a 1024 core model with GDDR6. Ultimately the minimum configuration hasn\u2019t changed, but laptop OEMs now have another option for a slightly more powerful configuration. Or one could go with the GTX 1650 Ti and skip the uncertainty entirely.\nRebalancing the GeForce Laptop Product Stack\nWith the addition of the new RTX 2080 Super, RTX 2070 Super, GTX 1650 Ti, and GTX 1650 (GDDR6) adapters to its portfolio, NVIDIA is using this week\u2019s launch to rebalance the entire laptop product stack. As a result, some products are being discontinued, and others are being pushed down in price to fill spots previously covered by other parts.\n\nFirst and foremost, like the desktop realm, the regular RTX 2080 is now gone from laptops as well. With the RTX 2080 Super taking up the flagship spot \u2013 and not being massively different from the original RTX 2080 \u2013 NVIDIA has excised the original entirely. The RTX 2070 Super is instead NVIDIA\u2019s second-tier adapter for laptops.\nThe RTX 2070, on the other hand, is still staying around. Instead, it\u2019s getting pushed down the product stack to the third-tier position. NVIDIA now expects RTX 2070 to start showing up in laptops as cheap as $1199.\nThe RTX 2060 is also along for the ride. And this one is a particularly notable shift, as the RTX 2060 will now be NVIDIA\u2019s anchor SKU for $999 laptops. This spot was previously held by the GTX 1660 Ti, and while NVIDIA does not explicitly discuss laptop part pricing, reading between the lines it\u2019s clear that the company has cut laptop adapter prices to make this new product stack happen. So, as NVIDIA likes to promote, RTX laptops now start at $999.\n\nIn fact of all the new mobile SKUs being launched today, the now lower-priced RTX 2060 is definitely getting the greatest focus from NVIDIA. The company\u2019s OEM partners are announcing 5 new/updated laptops with the part, and the promise of more to come. As in the desktop space, NVIDIA is eager to dislodge its own legacy parts and entice gamers to upgrade to a laptop with a newer GeForce SKU, and while NVIDIA is certainly delivering the goods there, their case isn\u2019t being helped by the relatively stagnant Intel. Thankfully AMD\u2019s new Zen 2-based APUs have just launched, and while the market isn\u2019t going to shift overnight, it gives the Green Team some new performance opportunities with the Black Team (or is that ex-Green Team?).\n\nFinally, the new and updated GeForce GTX 1650 SKUs will be flushing out the low-end of the NVIDIA laptop product stack. The Pascal-based GTX 1050, the last GeForce GTX-branded holdover from the previous generation, is now on its way out. In its place, the GTX 1650 is being shifted down to take over. GTX 1650 laptops, in turn, will be hitting the market for as little as $699. In between that and the RTX 2060 will be the GTX 1660 Ti, as well as the new GTX 1650 Ti. And below $699 we\u2019ll see the usual mismash of last-generation laptops, as well as NVIDIA\u2019s entry-level, non-GTX laptop parts, the GeForce MX3xx series.\nWrapping things up, as with this week\u2019s laptop CPU launches, laptops featuring the new and updated GeForce SKUs are set to hit the market shortly. While the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has thrown a spanner into exact release dates, AMD Ryzen Mobile 4000 laptops are already shipping. Meanwhile, Intel Comet Lake-S laptops should be shipping soon. Accordingly, we\u2019re already seeing ASUS Ryzen laptops shipping with GeForce dGPUs, while Comet Lake-H laptops with the new parts should hit the market in a couple of weeks.\n\n\n                Source:\n                NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n16 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nAlistair - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nIt isn't good news for hardware enthusiasts that nVidia is launching RTX for the 3rd time now, even if for mobile. 2018, 2019, and 2020. I really want 7nm nVidia, no more of this.\n\n\n\nyeeeeman - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nI also am waiting for nvidia to get some 7nm parts out, but as the rumours say, they will use 10nm for Ampere which is sad.\n\n\n\nclose - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nWhy skip steps when competition isn't pushing them too hard and they can milk this for another year? What Intel did for years isn't exclusive to Intel.\n\n\n\ns.yu - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nIDK, Intel looks like they really failed, they'd prevent AMD from outselling them 5 to 1 if they could. Nvidia's more of a case of not trying hard enough.\n\n\n\nyeeeeman - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nBut yeah, would be nice to get RTX 2060 performance in 30-40W TDP.\n\n\n\nUnashamed_unoriginal_username_x86 - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nGPU cadence is considerably slower but less iterative than CPU cadence, with little clock upgrades and bin changes while they're prepping their next generation.And I think they're sticking with old nodes for less R&D and better yield+pricing. (or at least margins)I remember there was a great article on Wikichip which went through AMD's 7nm development, where they had to design around increasing resistance on the 2nd + 3rd metal layers and confusing cell arrangement\n\n\n\nRyan Smith - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nIt might be best to think of this not as an NVIDIA product launch, but NVIDIA's complementary offerings to Intel and AMD's new CPUs. The CPU and GPU dev cycles aren't synced, so new CPUs mean that laptop vendors have to use current GPUs. And in which case, they like something with a higher model number (which is why we get the semi-annual rebadge ritual on the desktop).\n\n\n\nAlistair - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nBut usually a new year comes with lower prices. RX 580 lower cost than RX 480 for example. Or the GTX 1080 dropping in price. The 2080 Super is the same speed as last year, still high priced. This definitely shouldn't encourage anyone to buy a new laptop.\n\n\n\nYojimbo - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\nThat's not true. There are only two refreshes. Mobile RTX was released 1 year ago, this is the first refresh of the mobile lineup. The desktop RTX launched in 2018 and was refreshed once in 2019. Later this year NVIDIA will launch a 7 nm desktop chip and laptops will get the architecture in 2021. It takes longer for a laptop SKU to go from product validation to retail so NVIDIA would have to release laptop versions of the GPU in quarter 2 in order for the laptops to appear on the shelves by the holiday shopping season. But to keep laptop chips close to the performance of desktop chips it makes more sense to launch them after desktop parts, so as things stand now, since back to school and Christmas are the focal points for both markets, it's more natural for the laptop parts to be a year behind.\n\n\n\nAlistair - Thursday, April 2, 2020 - link\n\"even if for mobile\", that's why I said that. Looking at the MSI marketing materials, they are claiming 2080 Super is 1 percent faster than 2080. This shows the thermal issues are the main problem. This isn't even faster than last year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

See our ethics statement.Photo by Stefan Etienne / The VergeJon Porter is a reporter with five years of experience covering consumer tech releases, EU tech policy, online platforms, and mechanical keyboards.If you\u2019re finding that background noise is disrupting voice or video calls made from your computer, then a new piece of software from Nvidia might help (provided you have the necessary hardware to run it). Released in April 2020, RTX Voice uses the hardware found in Nvidia\u2019s RTX (and more recently, GTX) GPUs to process your incoming and outgoing audio and eliminate almost all background noise.Below, you\u2019ll find a quick demonstration I recorded to show how it works. This was recorded from a Blue Snowball microphone using the built-in call recording functionality in Zoom. When I don\u2019t have the software enabled, you can hear the loud clacking of my mechanical keyboard in the background of the call. But when I turn on RTX Voice, the sound completely disappears. As well as processing your microphone\u2019s input so that the people you\u2019re speaking to can\u2019t hear any background noise around you, you can also set the software to eliminate background noise coming in from other people. So you can save yourself from your colleagues\u2019 loud keyboard as well as protecting them from your own. It\u2019s a win-win.How to use RTX Voice to reduce background noiseRTX Voice is pretty simple to use, but the big caveat is that you need the right hardware. In order to run it, you\u2019ll need an Nvidia GeForce or Quadro RTX or GTX graphics card since the software uses this hardware to process your audio. That means you\u2019re out of luck if you\u2019ve got a Mac, or a Windows machine without a dedicated GPU.As well as hardware requirements, the other thing to note about RTX Voice is that since the processing is being done by your graphics card, it might take system resources away from any games or other graphically intensive applications you\u2019re running. I ran some quick and dirty benchmarks to try to gauge the performance impact and found that running RTX Voice on my Discord microphone input reduced UniEngine\u2019s Heaven Benchmark by just over 3fps or around 6 percent, rising to over 8fps or 14 percent if I used the software to process incoming audio as well. That more or less tracks with YouTuber EposVox\u2019s report of a 4 to 10 percent reduction when using it on his microphone, rising to 20 percent with both mic and speakers.I think that makes RTX Voice a much better option for calls where you\u2019re unlikely to be running something graphically intensive at the same time, like a work conference call, rather than while you\u2019re running a game simultaneously. If you\u2019re looking for something more gaming-specific, Discord recently launched its own noise suppression feature, which might be a better alternative.RTX Voice can be set it up in just a couple of minutes.First, update the driver software of your graphics card if it\u2019s not already running on version 410.18 or aboveDownload RTX Voice from Nvidia\u2019s website and install itOnce the software is installed, you can configure it to improve your incoming audio, outgoing audio, or both. Nvidia recommends only turning it on for your input device (read: microphone) to minimize the impact the audio processing will have on the performance of your system. You can also select how much noise suppression you want. I left it at 100 percent, but you might want to play around to find what works best for you.You can set RTX Voice to work on your microphone input and / or your speaker\u2019s output. Screenshot by Jon Porter / The VergeOnce installed, \u201cNvidia RTX Voice\u201d will appear as an audio input and / or output device for your PC. That means you can go into your voice chat app of choice and select it as though you\u2019d plugged an extra microphone or set of speakers into your PC. Check out Nvidia\u2019s site for specific instructions on how to configure the software for individual applications; here\u2019s what the setting looks like in Zoom.Once enabled, most chat apps will let you manually select RTX Voice as though it\u2019s an input or output device. Screenshot by Jon Porter / The VergeNvidia\u2019s software isn\u2019t unique. In addition to Discord\u2019s feature, Microsoft also plans to add a similar piece of functionality to Teams later this year. The advantage of RTX Voice, however, is that it works across a much broader range of apps. Nvidia\u2019s site lists 12 apps that it\u2019s validated. However, I tested out audio recording app Audacity, which Nvidia doesn\u2019t list as being supported, and found that RTX Voice worked just fine, so there are likely to be other unlisted apps that also work.Not everyone will have the hardware to take advantage of this latest feature, and for others, the performance hit won\u2019t be worth it. However if, like me, your gaming PC is mainly being used as a work computer these days, then using RTX Voice is a no-brainer.Correction: This article originally stated that RTX Voice won\u2019t work on a Windows machine with a dedicated GPU when it should have read that it won\u2019t work on a Windows machine without a dedicated GPU. We regret the error.Update 10:31AM, April 6th: Nvidia has extended RTX Voice support for earlier GTX, Quadro, and Titan-branded graphics card, so we\u2019ve updated this post with relevant info.Vox Media has affiliate partnerships.

This sale saves you $20 off its full cost and matches the best price we've seen for this 4K streaming device since its release. Shipping is free. You can also snag this deal at Best Buy and its eBay store.Our review gave the new 2019 NVIDIA Shield TV 4.5 stars out of 5 and a badge calling it The Best. Russell Holly said, \"This simpler, more polished experience is fantastic on nearly every level, and doesn't deviate terribly from the things we already enjoyed about this system. And for its price, the new console checks a lot of boxes. If you want a dead simple streaming box that occasionally includes some fun gaming to it as well, this is without a doubt the box for you.\"The NVIDIA Shield TV uses an advanced Tegra X1+ processor for 25% faster performance than the previous NVIDIA Shield TV generations. It's the fastest Android TV streaming media player. Plus it comes with support for Dolby Vision HDR content and Dolby Atmos, which lets you enhance your surround sound for an excellent audio experience. The processor also has AI upscaling so all of your content is in 4K and looks great.The new design makes the NVIDIA Shield TV super compact. It will fit behind your entertainment center with all the other stuff you don't really need to see. Plus, despite the much smaller size it still has a Gigabit Ethernet port for stable, speedy streaming, and a microSD card slot so you can add even more storage if you want. There's a built-in power supply and dual band Wi-Fi as well.Even though NVIDIA no longer bundles its own gaming controller with the new NVIDIA Shield TV, you're still able to use the tubular streaming device for gaming \u2014 you just need to connect your own Bluetooth controller.Our review gave the new 2019 NVIDIA Shield TV 4.5 stars out of 5 and a badge calling it The Best.

This free-to-play title features dynamic and frantic battle royale gameplay with up to 150 players on the largest Call of Duty battleground ever.\nCall of Duty: Warzone puts a new spin on massive combat arenas by taking the difficulty away from looting, while giving you new missions to complete during the course of the battle that reward aggressive play and map traversal. And the fight doesn\u2019t end once you die. Even if your teammates are unable to revive you, you\u2019re placed in the Gulag where you compete one-on-one with another fallen combatant for a chance to respawn with your squad. Whether you are in Verdansk or in the Gulag - high FPS unlocks your potential and increases your chances of hitting that game winning shot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe firefights in Call of Duty: Warzone can end in the blink of an eye, so making sure you have every possible advantage is vital. Whether you\u2019re a seasoned pro or a newcomer to the battle royale genre, high FPS gameplay grants you several benefits. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy High Frames Per Second (FPS) Matters when Playing Call of Duty: Warzone\nSmoother Animations:\nIn Call of Duty: Warzone, player movement is fast. Whether you are holding the angle or peeking a corner, high FPS paired with a high refresh rate display provides improved clarity and comprehension when it really matters. Additionally, the smoother motion provided by the increased frame rate allows you more opportunities to correct your aim - making it easier to track those targets as they sprint by.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReduced Distracting Effects\nIn the heat of the moment, being reactive is critical. Sifting through distracting effects like tearing or ghosting takes precious milliseconds and can impact your ability to perceive the situation correctly. High FPS on a high Hz display significantly reduces these distracting effects by decreasing the size of the ghost trail and tear displacement. Reducing distracting effects ensures you are actually aiming at the right thing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Players Earlier:\nWhen milliseconds matter, seeing your opponent a split second earlier can give you an advantage in a fight. Higher FPS reduces the overall system latency of your computer which means your actions and the state of the game are displayed on your monitor faster. Lower system latency helps improve your reaction times and makes input feel snappier - critical for a fast paced game like Call of Duty: Warzone.\nFor more information on why high FPS matters, check out our in-depth technical article, \u201cWhy Does High FPS Matter For Esports?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Optimise Call of Duty: Warzone\u2019s Settings\nUsing competitive settings can boost your FPS. We found the following settings combination from Prosettings.net in conjunction with image sharpening in the NVIDIA control panel to be the best combination for competitive play. Achieving higher FPS can depend on your in game situation, the version of the game, and the total PC configuration.\u00a0 Competitive settings also come with an image quality tradeoff: shadows will be less realistic and a bit blockier, less accurate reflections, and the quality of explosions will be reduced.\nIf you are less concerned about image quality and still want to\u00a0maximise FPS, let\u2019s first dive into the Call of Duty: Warzone settings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways remember to set Fullscreen mode as it reduces system latency. Some of these settings are personal preference, so tweak them to find what you like! One thing to note, is that the render scale has been reduced to 90%. This will result in a small performance boost in trade for a slight loss in image quality. However, turning on image sharpening in the control panel nearly negates any image quality loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to turn on image sharpening in the NVIDIA Control Panel: \n1. Open NVCPL (right-click the desktop, select NVIDIA Control Panel) 2. Select \u201cManage 3D settings\u201d 3. Select \u201cProgram Settings\u201d\na. Select Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (if you don\u2019t see it in the list, untick \u201cShow only programs found on this computer\u201d or select \u201cAdd\u201d)\n4. Turn on Image sharpening with default settings, using our latest GeForce Game Ready Driver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Once you are done, apply your settings and restart the game.\nUsing the settings outlined above, you should see a nice boost in FPS the next time you drop in. The framerates you achieve will vary depending on the components in your machine, so be sure to tune your hardware for maximum performance by killing unnecessary services, closing perf-sapping programs, and overclocking your CPU, RAM and GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrames Win Games\nAfter digging into the benefits that we\u2019ve outlined above, we spent time studying K/D ratios in both Fortnite and PUBG to see their correlation to high-FPS gaming. If you want a deep dive into what we found, you can read our full study on playing battle royale titles at high FPS.\nAs you can see in the chart below, whether you are a weekend warrior or an aspiring professional, there is a correlation between better performance and higher FPS regardless of how much time is spent playing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen all of the available information is looked at as a whole, we can conclude that there is a strong correlation for higher FPS helping\u00a0maximise your potential in battle royale games like Call of Duty: Warzone.\nFor more on High FPS gaming, check out our FramesWinGames page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\n#SHOTWITHGEFORCE\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United Kingdom\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Previously, he reported on the technology and gaming industries for more than a decade.Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now cloud gaming service is losing access to more titles later this month, the company announced on Monday. Starting April 24th, GeForce Now will no longer be able to play titles from Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Game Studios, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, Codemasters, and Klei Entertainment.Without Xbox Game Studios, GeForce Now can\u2019t access popular titles like Halo: The Master Chief Collection or games in the Gears of War or Forza franchises. Warner Bros.\u2019 game division is another popular publisher, owning the rights to series like the Batman: Arkham games developed by Rocksteady and Mortal Kombat titles from NetherRealm. Codemasters is well known for developing racing titles with the Formula 1 brand and rally racing games under the Dirt series. And Klei is well known for making indie hits like Don\u2019t Starve and Mark of the Ninja.\u201cFor those leaving, we\u2019ll give gamers as much notice as possible.\u201dThe news is another blow for GeForce Now, which differs from Google Stadia by letting subscribers stream games from their existing Steam libraries on a remote PC. Nvidia\u2019s model has been controversial because it does not involve publishers selling separate licenses of games for access in the cloud. Yet due to agreements Nvidia has with those game publishers and likely out of caution for licensing disputes, Nvidia does not support games on GeForce Now without the express permission of the publisher that owns the intellectual property.This was a non-issue when GeForce Now was free in beta form, but since its public trial launch in early February, Nvidia started charging $4.99 a month. Publishers, including Activision Blizzard and Bethesda Softworks, then began pulling their libraries. 2K Games also removed its titles early last month.\u201cAs we prepare for commercial service in June, we\u2019ll be adding and removing games through the end of May,\u201d Phil Eisler, Nvidia\u2019s vice president of GeForce Now, writes in the blog post. \u201cBehind the scenes, we\u2019re working with digital game stores so publishers can tag their games for streaming on GeForce Now, right when they publish a game. This will help us bring more games to the library, quicker, as well as provide a more stable catalog. We\u2019re transitioning as many games to GeForce Now as possible over this time. For those leaving, we\u2019ll give gamers as much notice as possible.\u201dNvidia says these publisher removals are few and far between. Thirty of the top 40 games on Steam are supported, the company says. GeForce Now is also gaining access to the complete Assassin\u2019s Creed and Far Cry series.\u201cUbisoft fully supports Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now with complete access to our PC games from the Ubisoft Store or any supported game stores,\u201d Chris Early, senior vice president partnerships at Ubisoft, said in a statement. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s a leading-edge service that gives current and new PC players a high-end experience with more choice in how and where they play their favorite games.\u201dNvidia hasn\u2019t released stats on the number of users it has. But today\u2019s blog post says \u201cthe number of registered gamers [for GeForce Now] grows by the millions.\u201dSee More: EntertainmentGamingNewsPC GamingTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019Lego announces Pok\u00e9mon sets are coming next yearInstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

In addition to equipping the latest gaming laptops, the new one-two power punch will find its way into 10 new RTX Studio notebooks from manufacturers like Acer, Gigabyte, MSI, and Razer.Featured \n          The next big TV panel leap was just unveiled by Sony - and it makes OLED look outdated\n        \n          That weird CAPTCHA could be a malware trap - here's how to protect yourself\n        \n          The best smart rings you can buy: Expert tested\n        \n          I've tried nearly every browser out there and these are my top 6 (none are Chrome)\n        Many of these new models are refreshes of existing RTX Studio systems, such as the Acer ConceptD 7, Gigabyte Aero,\u00a0MSI Creator and the Razer Blade 15 Studio Edition. In the case of the new ConceptD 7 Ezel and Ezel Pro, as you may recall from our CES coverage, they get a hinged design that allows artists to draw in a familiar fashion with a Wacom digital pen. Nvidia also announced that HP will be launching a pair of new RTX Studio laptops in the coming weeks to add to the 10 from fellow PC makers.Laptops with the RTX Studio badge have more than just the freshest hardware, as Nvidia also provides special Studio drivers for video editing, ray tracing, AI and other content-creation apps to ensure the best performance and stability. Given the power requirements behind these types of software, it's no surprise that the laptops use Nvidia's Max-Q technology, which is designed to help keep high-octane portables thinner, lighter, quieter and more energy efficient.As an added bonus, the new RTX Studio laptops will include three free months of an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription that include over 30 different apps (including Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and more). That can help offset the cost of one of these new systems, none of which comes cheap given the cutting-edge technology that's inside: The starting price for the Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel is $2,699, for instance, and the Pro version starts at $3,099.

Next up, we have an NVIDIA Quadro RTX 5000, which matches up to RTX 2080 series but with double the memory at 16GB GDDR6 ECC. With the added memory, the Quadro RTX 5000 can now run many deep learning applications that the RTX 2080 cannot. Aside from the hardware specs, as part of NVIDIA\u2019s Quadro line the Quadro RTX 5000 is certified to run a number of professional applications making it a versatile part. In our review, we are going to see what this GPU has to offer.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 5000 Overview\nThe Quadro RTX 5000 GPU has a length of 10.5\u201d long, width of 1.38\u201d and a height of 4.4\u201d. It is a dual-slot graphics card using a blower type cooler. The blower-style cooler allows for better cooling in servers as well as densely packed workstations.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 5000 Front\nThe Quadro RTX 5000 does not use a backplate, as we see in many consumer-type GPU\u2019s. This is one area that we would like to see changed. Aside from helping cool the GPU, a backplate also helps protect the card from potential warping and damage when servicing the system it is in.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 5000 Back\nAt the end of the Quadro RTX 5000, we find the video outputs, which are 4x DisplayPorts, and 1x VirtualLink port for VR head-mounted displays. If you are looking for a HDMI output, then you need to look elsewhere. If you are installing these in a server, you should be aware that these, unlike Tesla cards, will have video outputs registered in the systems.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 5000 IO Ports\nPower connections located at the top end of the Quadro RTX 5000, 1x 8-pin, and 1x 6-Pin connections outfit the GPU for power connections at the back of the card. That helps avoid the \u201chumping\u201d trend we have seen in some 4U systems.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 5000 Power Connections\nOverall, this is a fairly standard GPU form factor that we have seen for many generations.

The company has just announced that Top OEMs launch 100+ laptop designs with GeForce GPUs.\n\n\n\nIn addition to this lovely round number, OEMs did a record launch includeing new SUPER GPUs and Max-Q Technologies and Geforce RTX Laptops starting at $999.\nThere is still a significant market that wants a dedicated GPU and Nvidia is enabling these designs in every market segment. Serious gamers on the notebook side now have a chance to use the just-launched GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER and 2070 SUPER GPUs for laptops. Nvidia also improved its Max-Q design and worked with multiple OEMs to enable additional performance for the Max-Q designs.\nThe 100+ OEM machines also include a range of RTX 2060-powered laptops starting at just $999. The new platforms are all based on theNvidia Turing architecture, which incorporates dedicated hardware RT cores to process ray tracing and AI in real-time. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u201cA little more than 18 months ago, NVIDIA reinvented graphics with real time ray tracing, which represents a seismic shift in how games look, play and feel\u201d, said Jeff Fisher, senior vice president of gaming at Nvidia. \u201cHaving this technology available in a laptop for just $999 is amazing. And thanks to Max-Q, consumers will have a selection of remarkably thin and light laptops to choose across all price points.\u201d\n\nGeforce RTX 2080 SUPER / 2070 SUPER specs\nGeforce RTX 2080 SUPER comes with 3072 Cuda cores, 38-55T RTX-OPS, 5 to 7 Giga Rays / s, \u00a01080 - 1560 MHz boost clock, 735 - 1365 MHz base clock and graphics subsystem power varying from 80 to 150W. Geforce RTX 2080 has 2944 Cuda cores, 37-53T RTX-OPS, 5 to 7 Giga Rays / s, \u00a01095 - 1590 MHz boost clock, 735 - 1380 MHz base clock and graphics subsystem power varying from 80 to 150W+. Both cards are using 8GB GDDR6 with up to 14 Gbps memory speed. Geforce RTX 2070 SUPER comes with 2560 Cuda cores, 34-40T RTX-OPS, 4 to 5 Giga Rays / s, \u00a01155 - 1380 MHz boost clock, 930 - 1140 MHz base clock and graphics subsystem power varying from 80 to 115W. The Previous Geforce RTX 2070 has 2304 Cuda cores, 31-38T RTX-OPS, 4 to 5 Giga Rays / s, \u00a01125 - 1455 MHz boost clock, 885 - 1215 MHz base clock and graphics subsystem power varying from 80 to 115W.   Geforce RTX 2060 has a SUPER edition and still has 1920 Cuda cores, 26T RTX-OPS, 3.5 Giga Rays / s, \u00a01185 \u2013 1200 MHz boost clock, 960 \u2013 1xx0 MHz base clock and graphics subsystem power varying from 65 to 90W. The memory interface is set to 192 bit, and the GPU uses 6GB GDDR6.\nNew Max-Q Technology gets up to 10 percent more\nThere is a new addition to Nvidia Max-Q formula, and the latest techniques and innovative cooling designs enable a performance increase of between four and ten percent.\nThe new design enables even thinner, lighter, and more efficient laptops, and the whole catch is in the shared thermal design between the CPU and GPU. In traditional non-Max-Q design, a high-end gaming laptop has a 115W thermal budget for CPU and GPU. The CPU takes 35W while the rest, 80W, goes for the GPU. Nvidia did some testing with RTX 2080 SUPER Laptop featuring 90W GPU power limit, 35W CPU Power limit in Witcher3, Max Settings, Core i7, 16GB. In a given scenario, the CPU was using 15 W less, and these 15W were used by GPU as the power budget shifted to the GPU. The result is close to 10 percent higher performance in the game.Nvidia shared the data of the GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER-powered Acer Triton 500 notebook, and in seven games or benchmarks, this notebook showed a significant performance increase. The test games included Strange Brigade, Metro Exodus, Witcher 3, Battlefield 5, Shadows of The Tomb Raider, and Firestrike and TimeSpy benchmarks. Nvidia did a three-year laptop comparison and Gigabyte Aorusx5 powered with GeForce GTX 1080, a 2017 MAX-Q laptop scores 73 FPS in the three-game average mix, while 2020 MAX-Q Gigabyte Aero 15\nThe GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER scored 167 FPS. The average of three games included Control, Wolfenstein: Youngblood, Deliver us the Moon at 1080p, High settings, RT Off, Core i7, 16GB.\nNew advancements to Max-Q are now doubling that efficiency over previous designs, and introducing features that enable faster performance and longer battery life:\n\nDynamic Boost \u2014 Intelligently and automatically balances power between the GPU and CPU on a per-frame basis, boosting overall in-game performance. Dynamic Boost is automatic, adaptive and always working to deliver more performance without increasing system power consumption.\nLow Voltage GDDR6 \u2014 NVIDIA has worked with its memory partners to increase memory efficiency while delivering high performance with new lower voltage GDDR6 memory.\nAdvanced Optimus \u2014 A breakthrough display innovation that delivers long battery life and immersive, stutter-free gameplay from NVIDIA G-SYNC\u00ae technology. Advanced Optimus\u00ae controls which GPU is driving the display and intelligently determines the right GPU for the right workload at the right time, dynamically switching on the fly without needing a system reboot.\nNext-Generation Regulator Efficiency \u2014 Next-generation voltage regulators help optimize system design so the GPU runs more efficiently while delivering higher overall performance.\nDeep Learning Super Sampling 2.0 \u2014 Powered by dedicated AI processors on RTX GPUs called Tensor Cores, DLSS 2.0 is an improved deep learning neural network that boosts frame rates while generating beautiful, sharp images for games. It boosts a game\u2019s performance headroom while maximizing ray-tracing settings with increased output resolution and extending battery life by up to 20 percent.\n\nRTX Studio Empowers Creators with New Laptops\nNvidia also announced ten new RTX Studio laptops, powered by RTX SUPER GPUs and the latest Intel 10th-generation processors. Machines are available from Acer, Gigabyte, MSI, and Razer as the ultimate solution for creators seeking unmatched video and 3D performance. More than 45 of the top creative applications such as Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, AutoDesk Arnold, Blender, and many more \u2014 all feature RTX acceleration by the RT cores in RTX GPUs.\nPricing and Availability\nThe availability of new RTX Gaming and Studio laptops starts the week of April 15th from multiple partners globally, with more coming in May. Specific SKUs, configurations, and pricing will vary based on region and partner availability but will include designs from Acer, ASUS, Clevo, Dell, Gigabyte, HP, Lenovo, MSI, Razer and more.\nRTX 2060-powered laptops starting at $999 include the Acer Nitro 5, ASUS ROG G512, HP Omen 15, Lenovo Y540, and the MSI GF65 Thin, with more to be announced later. \n\n\n\nLast modified on 02 April 2020\t\t\t\n\n\nRate this item\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n(0 votes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTagged under\n\nNvidia\nmaxq\nnotebooks\ngaming\ngeforce rtx 2080 super notebook\nintel 10th generation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in this category:\n\n\t\t\t\u00ab Smartphone sales plumet to their worst levels in a decade\t\t\n\n\t\t\tIntel launches 5.3GHz 10th Gen Intel Core H \u00bb\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tback to top\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about:\nIntel releases XeSS 2 SDK \nMSI snubs AMD\u2019s RDNA 4 lineup \nBolt Graphics brings RISC-V to the GPU market \n\n\n"

And that\u2019s just the sort of people who can benefit from putting it to work now.\nRamey spoke with AI Podcast host Noah Kravitz about how NVIDIA developed into an AI company thanks to the invention of the parallel computing platform CUDA, as well as the broader state of deep learning today.\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\nRamey provided an overview of the activities available to developers at GTC Digital, including seven full-day workshops and 15 short courses by the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, which has trained over 200,000 people worldwide.\nHe was the very first guest on the NVIDIA AI Podcast. He joined our first episode \u2014 the most streamed to date \u2014 three years ago to talk about the history of the AI boom and the fundamentals of deep learning.\nRamey explains how deep learning is used to improve self-driving cars. Rather than spending decades collecting real-world driving data, deep learning allows for simulations that can be run in parallel, accelerating training time.\n\nLearn more about the developer community that Ramey supports.\nTweetables:\n\u201cDeep neural networks, they\u2019re much larger, they\u2019re deeper \u2014 meaning they have lots more layers \u2014 and require a lot more data to train. Being able to do that work in a practical amount of time requires something like a GPU parallel accelerator.\u201d \u2014 Will Ramey [9:31]\n\u201c[Deep learning] has made this technology available to many, many more people with much less domain-specific subject matter expertise.\u201d \u2014 Will Ramey [15:29]\nYou Might Also Like\nNVIDIA Chief Scientist Bill Dally on Where AI Goes Next\nThis podcast is full of words from the wise.

In particular a Gigabyte model, the GV-N1656WF2OC-4GD, was detailed. Rather than the 4GB of 8Gbps GDDR5 memory of its older siblings, the new card sports 4GB of 12Gbps GDDR6. This faster memory is expected to make the GTX 1650 moderately faster, depending upon the task at hand. Incidentally, PCGamer heard got a quote from Nvidia regarding the move, and the brief response was that \"The industry is running out of GDDR5, so we've transitioned the product to GDDR6.\" So, this wasn't a strategic competitive decision about the performance of the GeForce GTX range.\nLate on Friday Nvidia made the GeForce GTX 1650 GDDR6 official by updating its website to detail this SKU. If you head on over to this link you will see the new GTX 1650 model described as the GeForce GTX 1650 (G6) - next to the GeForce GTX 1650 (G5). Thanks to the regular HEXUS tipster for the alert about this. Over the weekend various Nvidia AIC partners have gone ahead and make their new GeForce GTX 1650 (G6) cards official. However many aren't that obviously different to the existing GTX 1650 stock, looking at at the packaging and naming.\nAsus appears to have two new GTX 1650 variants with GDDR6; the overclocked TUF Gaming GTX1650-O4DG6, and standard clocked TUF Gaming GTX1650-4DG6. Asus hasn't penned any news release about the new cards and in my quick comparison with the existing Asus TUF stock - nothing has changed in design terms but under the shroud you have the faster memory and a slightly slower clocked GPU (as we saw with last week's Gigabyte leak).\n\nAs you can see above, the Asus packaging mentions GDDR6 twice on the front of the carton sleeve.\nEVGA has gone into some more detail about how it has 'levelled up' by equipping its GTX 1650 cards with GDDR6. The firm says that its EVGA GeForce GTX 1650 GDDR6 gives you \"that extra edge to up your game to the next level,\" and has a marketing graphics performance chart with which to enchant you, see below.\n\nKey specs of the new EVGA card are that its 996 CUDA core GPU runs at a boost clock of 1710MHz, and its GDDR6 RAM runs at 12,000Gbps, delivering 192GBps bandwidth. EVGA is selling this card for US$160. It still sells GDDR5 models for above and below this price, depending upon OC model, cooler, etc.\n\nGigabyte has a couple of new GTX 1650 D6 series cards. If you follow this link you can compare the compact single fan GTX 1650 D6 OC 4G with the beefier dual fan GTX 1650 D6 WindForce OC 4G. Meanwhile, Aorus Japan is teasing a completely new range of cards called the Eagle Series with GDDR6 added.\n\nMSI has published a full press release about its GDDR6 upgrades to its GeForce GTX 1650 series. Like Gigabyte, MSI has decided to make it pretty clear that these are new faster memory products by adding the 'D6' suffix to the upgraded range.\n\nMSI appears to have enthusiastically embraced the change and has eight new SKUs to present; the Twin Frozr thermal design GeForce GTX 1650 D6 Gaming, the smaller dual fan D6 Ventus XS, the compact D6 Aero ITX, and twin fan low profile D6T LP. Each of those four models is also being sold in an OC variant. MSI says that are all available immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 1 Comment\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

The MX series of GPUs target entry-level notebook designs, featuring a mix of low power and good graphics performance but they've yet to see architecture parity with the higher-end GeForce Desktop and Mobility parts.\nNVIDIA To Bring Turing Powered GeForce MX Entry-Level GPUs To Tackle Intel's Xe DG1 And AMD's 7nm Vega Integrated GPUs\nNVIDIA has refreshed its Turing based GeForce RTX and GeForce GTX lineup on both desktop and notebook fronts. With the likes of the RTX 2080 SUPER (Max-Q / Max-P), they currently dominate the high-end and even the mainstream segment with little to no effort by AMD's RTG to compete against them with its own Navi based lineup which has yet to be seen in action in this space. But, there's one market where NVIDIA's GPU efforts are getting crushed by the day and that's the iGPU side of things.\nRelated Story AMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI BenchmarksIntel's Ice Lake with Gen 11 and AMD's enhanced Vega GPUs have allowed notebook GPU makers to stop relying on NVIDIA's discrete GPUs as these modern integrated solutions offer great graphics performance and don't require excess power or cooling requirements in a notebook. While NVIDIA has been trying to release and refresh its GeForce MX lineup to get the attention of laptop vendors, it's efforts have mostly been to release parts based on the previous generation Pascal architecture.\n\nNVIDIA's most recent GeForce MX300 series chips are based on the Pascal GP107 and Pascal GP108 architecture and while the specifications have seen a good boost along with a performance with up to a 70% boost over AMD's Ryzen 'Picasso' based CPUs Intel's Ice Lake CPUs, both Intel and AMD are not sitting ducks and will be updating its notebook iGPU lineup in the coming months. AMD already did so with the release of its Ryzen 4000 lineup which offers up to 95% performance of the GeForce MX350 with much lower power requirements since it shares its TDP with the 25W Renoir Ryzen 7 4800U APU. The Ryzen 7 4800U isn't even the best chip in AMD's lineup with the Ryzen 9 4900U & the Ryzen 9 4900H taking it up a notch in total graphics horsepower versus NVIDIA's GeForce MX GPUs.\nIntel, on the other hand, is also preparing its Tiger Lake-U processors which will deliver 2x the GPU performance uplift over Skylake's Gen 12 GPUs. The new Xe DG1 GPUs are expected to deliver very good performance numbers in a integrated design and are expected to launch in the second half of 2020.\nSo how will NVIDIA tackle these two opponents with pose a large threat to their entry-level efforts? The answer is with Turing. NVIDIA's next MX GPU has leaked out by ROGame, a TU117 GPU based part that has a base clock of 540 MHz and up to 2 GB of GDDR6 memory clocked at 10 Gbps. The chip has a TDP of under 25W so similar to the current GeForce MX350, but it would definitely offer much better performance.\n\nAs per NotebookCheck who managed to uncover some details on the next-gen GeForce MX GPUs, it is stated that they are being developed primarily to take on Intel's Xe DG1 GPUs. The reason is simply that Intel-based entry-level notebooks are a huge market seller and till now, consumers who required extra graphics performance would get an entry-level Intel laptop with NVIDIA's entry-level MX GPUs. They are a perfect balance for budget users who want a GPU ideal for their needs in an entry-level product. But with Tiger Lake Xe GPUs, that would change as Intel will be offering some thing better than NVIDIA's current MX GPUs, integrated on its own chip.\nNVIDIA GeForce MX Series GPU Family Specifications:\n\n\n\nGPU NameGPU ArchitectureCUDA CoresGPU ClockMemory SpeedMemory BusTDP\n\n\n\n\nGeForce MX570Ampere GA1072048TBA - 1155 MHz12 Gbps GDDR664-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX550Turing TU1171024TBA - 1320 MHz12 Gbps GDDR664-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 450Turing TU117896540 - 1575 MHz10 Gbps GDDR664-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 430Turing TU117896TBA - TBA MHz10 Gbps GDDR6\n7 Gbps GDDR564-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 350Pascal GP1076401354-1468 MHz7 Gbps GDDR564-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 350Pascal GP107640746-937 MHz7 Gbps GDDR564-bit15W\n\n\nGeForce MX 330Pascal GP1083841531-1594 MHz6/7 Gbps GDDR564-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 310Pascal GP1082561341-1379 MHz6/7 Gbps GDDR564-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 250Pascal GP1083841518-1582 MHz6/7 Gbps GDDR564-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 250Pascal GP108384937-1038 MHz6 Gbps GDDR564-bit10.5W\n\n\nGeForce MX 230Pascal GP1082561518-1531 MHz6/7 Gbps GDDR564-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 150Pascal GP1083841468-1531 MHz6 Gbps GDDR564-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 150Pascal GP108384937-1038 MHz5 Gbps GDDR564-bit10W\n\n\nGeForce MX 130Maxwell GM1083841122-1242 MHz6 Gbps GDDR564-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 110Maxwell GM108256963-993 MHz1.8 Gbps DDR364-bit10W\n\n\n\n\nThe MX400 series as I would like to call it will have two variants as NotebookCheck reports, both are based on the TU117 GPU, one being based on the TU117-655-KA/B/A1 SKU and the other being based on the TU117-650-A1 SKU. Both variants will be fabricated on the 12nm process node and will feature PCIe Gen 4 interface, making them the first Gen 4 enabled mobility GPUs at launch. The faster variant will feature GDDR6 64-bit memory while the second variant will feature a mix of GDDR6 and GDDR6 configurations. These GPUs are mentioned to feature a TDP of 25W and will go into mass production by May-June 2020 so expect a launch in the second half of 2020.\n\nBased on the numbers, we can expect anywhere between 80-90% performance of the GeForce GTX 1650 which would be amazing for an entry-level 25W laptop chip. It will definitely be an interesting comparison between the new GeForce MX Turing based GPUs and the integrated parts from AMD and Intel in the second half of 2020 as all three vendors try to offer extra graphics performance in entry-level notebook designs.\n\n\n\nWhich entry-level notebook GPUs do you think will have the best performance per dollar and performance efficiency in 2020?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce MX400 Turing GPUs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Intel Tiger Lake With Xe DG1 GPU\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n AMD Ryzen 4000 With 7nm Vega GPU\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D & 9900X3D 3D V-Cache CPUs Now Available \u2013 The Best Gaming & Content Creation Package Ever!\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetail Website Exposes AMD Radeon RX 9050 GPU; An Entry-Level RDNA 4 GPU?\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n94\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n52\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n47\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n44\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n40\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Today, aerial imagery from satellites and drones powers a range of efforts to monitor and protect our planet \u2014 accelerated by AI and NVIDIA GPUs.\nOn the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, see how companies in the NVIDIA Inception program are using aerial imagery and AI to track global deforestation, monitor thawing permafrost in the Arctic and prevent natural gas leaks.\nInception is a virtual accelerator that equips startups in AI and data science with fundamental tools to support product development, prototyping and deployment.\nTracking Tree Loss: Orbital Insight\nMillions of acres of forests are lost each year due to agriculture and illegal logging. Orbital Insight is working with the World Resources Institute to identify areas around the world where virgin rainforest is being replaced with new roads, buildings and palm oil plantations.\nImage courtesy Orbital Insight\nUsing over 600,000 five-meter resolution satellite images, the startup\u2019s deep learning algorithm maps deforestation as part of Global Forest Watch\u2019s initiative for real-time forest monitoring. AI can give researchers a head start, allowing them to spot signs of impending deforestation by extrapolating trends into the future \u2014 rather than relying on monthly alerts that come too late to prevent tree loss.\nThe tool can also help companies assess the risk of deforestation in their supply chains. Commodities like palm oil have driven widespread deforestation in Southeast Asia, leading several producers to pledge to achieve zero net deforestation in their supply chains this year.\nBased in Palo Alto, Calif., Orbital Insight uses convolutional neural networks to analyze satellite imagery and radar data for supply chain monitoring, real estate, mapping and infrastructure. Its geospatial AI algorithms are accelerated by NVIDIA GPUs through Amazon Web Services.\nUsing GPUs in the cloud allows the team to upscale and downscale their usage as needed, and enables a 100x inference speedup on huge satellite images, said Manuel Gonzalez-Rivero, senior computer vision scientist at the company.\nAI on the Arctic: 3vGeomatics\nOne of the biggest burgeoning climate threats today is thawing permafrost. Mainly found in polar regions like the Canadian Arctic, permafrost is composed of ice, rock and sediment located under a layer of soil. Rich in organic material, the world\u2019s permafrost is estimated to contain 1,500 billion tons of carbon \u2014 twice as much as in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nImage by National Park Service Climate Change Response. Licensed from Wikimedia Commons under CC BY 2.0.\nAs much as 70 percent of permafrost could melt by 2100, releasing massive amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Climate change-induced permafrost thaw also causes landslides and erosion that threaten communities and critical infrastructure.\nThrough a project for the Canadian Space Agency, Inception startup 3vGeomatics is using a remote sensing radar satellite-based technology called InSAR to monitor thawing permafrost across the Canadian Arctic.\nConducting analyses via an on-premises server with dozens of NVIDIA data center GPUs enables thousand-fold increases in processing speed of the radar satellite images, each of which contains billions of pixels and covers thousands of square kilometers.\n\u201cBefore, it would take months to analyze satellite images and deliver results, only to tell our client that they had a landslide 5 weeks ago,\u201d said Parwant Ghuman, chief technology officer of 3vGeomatics. \u201cLeveraging GPUs enables us to deliver actionable intelligence about the risks they have today.\u201d\nPreventing Oil, Gas Leaks: Azavea\nThe U.S. oil and gas industry leaks an estimated 13 million metric tons of methane into the atmosphere each year \u2014 much of which is preventable. One of the leading sources is excavation damage caused by third parties, unaware that they\u2019re digging over a natural gas pipeline.\nAzavea, a Philadelphia-based startup that builds geospatial analytics tools for civic and social impact, is collaborating with aerial services company American Aerospace to detect construction over known pipelines \u2014 using NVIDIA GPUs for training as well as inference at the edge.\nImage courtesy of American Aerospace\nNeural networks deployed on planes or drones can detect visible construction vehicles and trucks on the ground, warning oil and gas companies of potential excavations that could damage pipelines.\n\u201cCurrently, a pilot will just fly at low altitudes over known pipelines and look out the window to see if there\u2019s any indication of construction vehicles,\u201d said Rob Emanuele, vice president of research at Azavea. \u201cOur work allows pilots to fly much safer by flying higher off the ground, relying on AI to detect where construction vehicles are present.\u201d\nDeveloped with Raster Vision, Azavea\u2019s open-source deep learning framework for aerial imagery, the AI algorithms are being tested using an NVIDIA RTX laptop in a small plane for real-time inference. Future deployments would instead use embedded GPUs on unmanned aircraft and drones.\nLearn more about how GPU technology is driving applications with social impact, including environmental projects.\nMain image credit: NASA\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Inception | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And in March, RTX 2060 adoption moved up to 2.71% according to Steam\u2019s figures, representing a healthy increase of 0.53% on the previous month.The second-biggest gainer was the RTX 2070 which moved up 0.33% to reach a 2.01% share of the GPU market, and that was followed by the newer RTX 2070 Super, the pepped-up version of the graphics card which increased adoption by 0.28% to reach 1.21%.While those adoption figures might sound relatively small, we have to bear in mind that the GPU market is quite fragmented across a large number of different models, and in fact the RTX 2060 hitting 2.71% means it\u2019s now the fifth most popular graphics card overall among the Steam gamers surveyed. It\u2019s also more popular than any of the cheaper GTX Turing models (without ray tracing hardware acceleration) which are led by the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti in seventh place on 2.48%.The most popular cards remain Nvidia\u2019s previous-generation 10-series offerings, holding the top four spots, and being led by the GeForce GTX 1060 which is still used by 12.67% of Steam gamers (it was down a fraction \u2013 dropping 0.01% \u2013 in March). Nvidia\u2019s GTX 1050 Ti is in second place on 8.81% (down a quarter of a percentage point), followed by the GTX 1050 on 5.42%, and then the GTX 1070 on 4.23%. The RTX 2060 is next in line.No great surpriseIs this RTX success to be expected, though? Nvidia is clearly all-in on ray tracing, with next-gen RTX 3000 cards expected to make big advancements on this front, and they are expected to launch later in 2020, with price adjustments of existing RTX cards to doubtless follow.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Hopefully more affordable and better ray tracing should help push adoption even further, and of course there\u2019s the small matter of the next-gen games consoles \u2013 the PS5 and Xbox Series X \u2013 also supporting ray-traced graphics. And of course AMD\u2019s getting on board with its next Big Navi graphics cards powered by RDNA 2 also coming with hardware accelerated ray tracing.So in short, the industry is clearly headed this way, so Nvidia\u2019s current RTX cards gaining momentum really shouldn\u2019t be much of a surprise. Particularly as the RTX 2060 has already become more affordable\u2026As to AMD\u2019s current performance in the Steam survey for March, the best placed Radeon graphics card doesn\u2019t make the cut for the top 10. AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 580 is in eleventh place with a 1.95% share, and you have to drop to nineteenth place to find the next AMD card, the RX 570 on 1.13%.Valve\u2019s gaming platform certainly paints a picture of Nvidia domination, although again that\u2019s no surprise, as this has been echoed by figures we\u2019ve been seeing from other sources including analyst firms for a good long time.
