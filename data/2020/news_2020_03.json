The currency\u2019s nominal effective exchange rate is approaching the bottom of the Monetary Authority of Singapore\u2019s policy band, according to one model. This raises the prospect that the central bank may follow in the footsteps of some of its peers in delivering an out-of-cycle easing.  The city-state\u2019s trade-reliant economy is teetering on the brink of a recession as the coronavirus epidemic weakens global trade and saps consumer spending. Monetary policy could be the next tool after the government pledged more than $4 billion of aid to shore up growth. \u201cAn announcement before the next scheduled policy meeting around mid-April should not surprise,\u201d Philip Wee, a foreign-exchange strategist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd., wrote in a note Thursday. \u201cThis would be in line with the inter-meeting easing measures\u201d undertaken by other central banks in March, he wrote. The NEER was 1.6% below the mid-point of the policy band on Friday after dropping to 2% below on Wednesday, based on a model by Standard Chartered Plc. The central bank doesn\u2019t disclose details on the policy band. On March 13, the central bank said the NEER had eased in an \u201corderly manner\u201d within the policy band in line with weakening economic conditions. In February, it noted there was room within its exchange-rate band to accommodate some weakness in the currency to counter the coronavirus outbreak, and would make a policy decision in April as scheduled. Singapore said Thursday it planned to draw on a US$60 billion swap facility it entered into with the Federal Reserve. There\u2019s a growing likelihood that the MAS could undertake an unusual combination of two easing measures, according to DBS and Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. \u201cWe now expect the MAS to not only shift to a neutral policy stance at their April meeting, but also push the Singapore dollar lower by re-centering the policy band to the prevailing level,\u201d Khoon Goh and Irene Cheung, strategists at ANZ, wrote in a note Wednesday. MAS easing is expected \u201ceither at their scheduled meeting in April or earlier,\u201d they wrote. \u00a9 2020 Bloomberg L.P.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

Popular titles from 2K, which will be missing from Nvidia's games streaming service for the foreseeable future, include the following franchises; BioShock, Borderlands, and Civilisation.\n\nLast month we saw some other big name publishers pull their wares from Nvidia's GeForce Now streaming service after it came out of beta and paid subscriptions opened up (though a free version remained usable). GeForce Now launched to the wider public with this paid option in the first week of Feb. Companies like Capcom, EA, Konami, Remedy, Rockstar, and Square Enix all withheld their properties from as the service launched. However it was only later decision changes that raised awareness of what was happening. Within a week of GeForce Now launching proper Activision Blizzard removed access to its games. Not long later Bethesda decided to do the same. Bucking the trend, the good eggs at CD Projekt Red announced that Cyberpunk 2077 would be available on GeForce Now as soon as it became available (and this game will also be an Xbox Smart Delivery title - meaning if you buy it on Xbox One you will get the upgraded Xbox Series X version for free when it is released).\n\nOver the weekend Nvidia updated customers that \"Per publisher request, please be advised 2K Games titles will be removed from GeForce Now today.\" The official poster added, with optimism, as is now customary, \"We are working with 2K Games to re-enable their games in the future\".\nThe news of the latest big publisher to abandon GeForce Now inspired Tim Sweeney to comment on the situation, judging from the timing and subject matter of his Tweets. On Saturday the Epic Games founder and CEO offered his full support to GeForce Now, with the promise of improved integration on the way.\n\nSweeney said that GeForce Now had many virtues for users, \"It's the most developer-friendly and publisher-friendly of the major streaming services, with zero tax on game revenue,\" he said. He added that \"everyone should be supporting this kind of service,\" and if this was the case the game industry would be in a healthier state.\nRounding off his 'Tweet storm', Sweeney took the opportunity to snipe at the likes of the iOS and Google Play for taking substantial slices of developer revenue. Last but not least the Epic CEO shared his particular ire for Google which is said to be \"lobbying against Apple for blocking Stadia from iOS, while Google blocks GeForce Now, xCloud, and Fortnite from Google Play\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\n\n                    And Nvidia's GeForce Now service becomes Xbox friendly (via updated Microsoft Edge). \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n11\nSir Trevor McDonald OBE becomes the GamesMaster\n\n                    He will take on the iconic role during the three 60-minute episodes aired later this year. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n10\nAMD Radeon RX 6900 XT Halo Infinite graphics card revealed\n\n                    This SKU won't be going on sale but will be used for competition prizes and so on. \n                \n\n\n\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nGod of War scheduled for PC release on 14th January\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator GOTY announced \u2013 a free update\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 18 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD is currently the only vendor with both x86 processors and discrete graphics cards under one roof, at least until Intel's Xe graphics roll out, giving Team Red some flexibility with its interconnect technology. This tech has been particularly useful in the world of high-performance computing (HPC), as evidenced by an AMD presentation at the Rice Oil and Gas HPC conference yesterday.\u00a0AMD initially announced at its Next Horizon event in 2018 that it would extend its Infinity Fabric between the data center MI60 Radeon Instinct GPUs to enable a 100 Gbps link between GPUs, much like Nvidia's NVLink. But with its Frontier supercomputer announcement in May, AMD divulged that it would expand the approach to enable memory coherency between CPUs and GPUs.(Image credit: Twitter)The annual Rice Oil and Gas HPC event hasn't concluded yet, but according to a tweet from Intersect 360 Research analyst Addison Snell yesterday, AMD announced that future Epyc+Radeon generations will include shared memory/cache coherency between the GPU and CPU over the Infinity Fabric, similar to what AMD enabled in its Raven Ridge Ryzen products.\u00a0We also got a glimpse of some slides presented at Rice Oil and Gas, courtesy of a tweet \u00a0from Extreme Computing Research Center senior research scientist Hatem Ltaief.\u00a0Image 1 of 5(Image credit: Twitter @HatemLtaief @addisonsnell)(Image credit: Twitter @HatemLtaief @addisonsnell)(Image credit: Twitter @HatemLtaief @addisonsnell)(Image credit: Twitter @HatemLtaief @addisonsnell)(Image credit: Twitter @HatemLtaief @addisonsnell)AMD's charts highlight the divide between power efficiency of various compute solutions, like semi-custom SoCs and FPGAs, GPGPUs, and general purpose x86 compute cores, and highlights the FLOPS performance relative to both power consumed and the amount of silicon area required to deliver that performance. As we can see, general purpose CPUs lag behind, but optimizations for vectorized code that use dedicated SIMD pathways can boost performance in both metrics. However, GPUs still hold a commanding lead in terms of both power efficiency and area consumed.\u00a0Leveraging cache coherency, like the company does with its Ryzen APUs , enables the best of both worlds and, according to the slides, unifies the data and provides a \"simple on-ramp to CPU+GPU for all codes.\"\u00a0AMD also provided some examples of the code required to use a GPU without unified memory, while accommodating a unified memory architecture actually alleviates much of the coding burden.\u00a0Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.AMD famously embraced the Heterogeneous Systems Architecture (HSA - deep dive here) to tie together Carrizo's fixed-function blocks, touting that feature among its marketing materials. Much like the approach of extending an Infinity Fabric link between the CPU and GPU, HSA provides a pool of cache-coherent shared virtual memory that eliminates data transfers between components to reduce latency and boost performance.\u00a0For instance, when a CPU completes a data processing task, the data may still require processing in the GPU. This requires the CPU to pass the data from its memory space to the GPU memory, after which the GPU then processes the data and returns it to the CPU. This complex process adds latency and incurs a performance penalty, but shared memory allows the GPU to access the same memory the CPU was utilizing, thus reducing and simplifying the software stack.Data transfers often consume more power than the actual computation itself, so eliminating those transfers boosts both performance and efficiency, and extending those benefits to the system level by sharing memory between discrete GPUs and CPUs gives AMD a tangible advantage over its competitors in the HPC space.\u00a0While AMD still appears to be a member of the HSA foundation, it no longer actively promotes HSA in communications with the press. In either case, it's clear the core tenets of the open architecture live on in AMD's new proprietary implementation, which likely leans heavily on its open ROCm software ecosystem that is now enjoying the fruits of DOE sponsorship.\u00a0AMD has blazed a path in this regard and secured big wins for exascale-class systems, including the recent El Capitan supercomputer that will hit two exaflops and wields the new Infinity Fabric 3.0, but Intel is also working on its Ponte Vecchio architecture that will power the Aurora supercomputer at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Argonne National Laboratory. Intel's approach leans heavily on its OneAPI programming model and also aims to tie together shared pools of memory between the CPU and GPU (lovingly named Rambo Cache). It will be interesting to learn more about the differences between the two approaches as more information trickles out.\u00a0Meanwhile, Nvidia might suffer in the supercomputer realm because it doesn't produce both CPUs and GPUs and, therefore, cannot enable similar functionality. Is this type of architecture, and the underlying unified programming models, required to hit exascale-class performance within acceptable power envelopes? That's an open question, but while Nvidia is part of the CXL consortium which should offer coherency features, both AMD and Intel have won exceedingly important contracts for the U.S. DOE's exascale-class supercomputers (the broader server ecosystem often adopts the winning HPC techniques), but Nvidia hasn't made any announcements about such wins, despite its dominating position for GPU-accelerated compute in the HPC and data center space.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more CPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nx86\nRadeon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (18)\n\n\n\nPaul AlcornSocial Links NavigationManaging Editor: News and Emerging TechPaul Alcorn is the Managing Editor: News and Emerging Tech for Tom's Hardware US.

If you have that you might as well have unified HBM memory on the APU as well.\nImagine a package like the 3970 or 3990 with half of those CPU chiplets being GPU chiplets. Then throw a few chiplets with GPU-CPU-unified HBM4 memory in there. That could be an amazing machine.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndigitalgriffin\n\n\nI looked at HSA years ago, and looking at AMD's scalable architecture, new memory types and made a very good guess where it was going. AMD was a big proponent of heterogeneous architectures working together. I read the leaves said this about 3 years back.\n\nAbout two years ago I said, \"You're going to see an APU with a chiplette for CPU, a chiplette forGPU, an IO Die, and HBM package that is part of unified memory dedicated to graphics calls.\"\n\nMy only miss was I predicted Zen 2 (Ryzen 3000) would come out of the gate this way. I was correct with chiplettes, but missed the GPU chiplette on package. But I'm betting we'll see something like this soon.\n\nWhile HSA is being less emphasized, one of the problems I had resolving (when I drew up block diagrams) was indeed cache coherency between chiplettes. I knew infinity fabric was the answer. But I didn't have the exact answer in terms of algorithms to keep from overloading it. That one took me a while to figure out. \n\nIt's a similar problem dealing with GPU to GPU chiplettes. Everyone thought I was nuts. They likended it to SLI/Crossfire. But it isn't SLI/Crossfire with a unified memory architecture. It's just a matter of resolving tiles and sharing the data differences between them. Even NVIDIA posted a paper about how it wasn't practical. But they are all looking a lot closer at it now.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheEldest\n\n\nGomez Addams said:From the article : \"...but Nvidia hasn't made any announcements about such wins, despite its dominating position for GPU-accelerated compute in the HPC and data center space. \"\n\nOh?

Having 112 v100's is nothing by comparison.\n\nAMD is also moving into data centers with both CPU's and GPU's and since nVidia doesn't make a CPU they can't compete in that market. Epyc is a better choice than anything Intel is offering. The price difference is huge and epyc has better performance. So much so that VMware is changing how they charge based on core count...oddly one of the tiers ends with the exact core count of Xeon...weird\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 18 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Flower\u2019s beastly 2800W power supply lands at $899 \u2014 enough juice to power a couple of RTX 5090 GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei's Microsoft Windows license for PCs expires this month, company launching PCs with Harmony OS: Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 50-series GPU scalping extends to system integrators \u2014 over $3,000 for a RTX 5090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel\u2019s new CEO gets a $1 million salary plus $68 million in bonuses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSNES consoles appear to run faster with age \u2014 APU frequency increased by up to 182 Hz after 35 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech giants call Trump tariffs 'big headache' \u2014 Foxconn CEO teases increased production in US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe week in chip news: Intel gets a new CEO, China chip smuggling, AMD dominates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi Pico powers $75 PicoCalc portable programming handheld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel's new CEO warns employees about 'tough decisions', but Wall Street cheers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI skips RDNA 4 and will not manufacture AMD Radeon 9000-series GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Ernst-August Winkelmann, whose farm in Beelitz southwest of Berlin produces about 6,000 tons of asparagus each season, says he is short of 500 pickers and risks having no choice but to leave the finger-thick white spears to rot in the soil.  Most of his seasonal workers come from Romania and Poland. The interior ministry on Wednesday said it was imposing an indefinite entry ban on fruit and vegetable pickers in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. \"The decision is wrong on many levels,\" said Winkelmann. \"We rely on those people for a living. We also have very high hygiene standards, we house our workers in separate facilities and they live on the farm. So the risk is low.\" Agriculture Minister Julia Kloeckner acknowledged on Thursday that Germany won't be able to replace the almost 300,000 seasonal agricultural workers, most of whom come from eastern European countries. \"The staffing situation is very tight along the full length of the food supply chain,\" she told a news conference. \"Supplies of labour from neighbouring countries have shrunk, sometimes very sharply, with slaughterhouses, meatpackers and dairies particularly seriously affected.\" Highlighting the importance of asparagus in German culture, the mass-selling Bild newspaper raised the possibility of drafting soldiers to help with picking the vegetable, which is typically served drenched in butter or with Hollandaise sauce, schnitzel and potatoes. Germans are famed for their love of white asparagus rather than the more common green variety. At Winkelmann's farm, 95% of the harvest if of the white variety. \"We've been getting calls from people saying they want to volunteer and come help us,\" said Winkelmann. \"It is heartening but we need to train these people and time is pressing we need to start picking now.\" (Reporting by Joseph Nasr; Editing by Nick Macfie)   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average's surge of over 20% from its coronavirus-induced recent low this week, by one definition used on Wall Street, suggests a new bull market. The surge came on hopes a $2 trillion stimulus measure would flood the country with cash in a bid to counter the economic impact of the intensifying pandemic.  But that definition should be treated with a large piece of caution. The very definition of bull market is debatable, and given the market's volatility on news about the pandemic, some said that calling the move upwards a \"bull market\" was tantamount to missing the forest for the trees. \"Labeling it a bull market when it fits a definition of being up 20% kind of removes any perspective from where we have been over the past month, and more importantly, where we might be going over the next few months,\" said Willie Delwiche, an investment strategist at Robert W. Baird. Other definitions say the index should crest the previous high and that a bull market can only be identified a long time after the event. For example, a mini-bull market has occurred previously during a bear market - providing a false hope of relief. The S&P 500 logged a gain of 24% over a period of 30 trading days starting on Nov. 20, 2008, even as the bear market continued during the height of the financial crisis, and the index did not bottom till March 9, 2009, marking the start of the bull market.  Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, said that while there is consensus about the definition of a bear market - a 20% decline from a peak - the definition of a bull market is less widely agreed upon. \"Bull markets occur between bear markets,\" Yardeni said. Part of the confusion about whether the Dow is indeed out of the bear market is because while one group is widely recognized for determining U.S. economic cycles - the National Bureau of Economic Research - no such body is uniformly accepted for defining bull and bear markets. Analysts warn against putting too much stock in strict definitions of market cycles. Factors like the velocity of the market\u2019s rise or fall, how much average stocks have changed, and the reasons behind the moves also contribute to whether investors view a major move as a turning point in sentiment or a short-term interruption to an existing bull or bear market. Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices in New York, said he still sees the Dow in a bear market. The Dow would need to hit 29,551.42, the high of Feb. 12, to be technically in a bull market, he said.   Story continues \"If we keep going up, eventually we could have a bull, but until it hits the record, it's a bull run in a bear market,\" Silverblatt said.(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Noel Randewich; Additional reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch; editing by Megan Davies and Leslie Adler)  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

It employs new temporal feedback techniques for sharper image details and improved stability from frame to frame.\nGreat Scaling Across All RTX GPUs and Resolutions \u2014 a new AI model more efficiently uses Tensor Cores to execute 2x faster than the original, improving frame rates and removing restrictions on supported GPUs, settings and resolutions.\nOne Network for All Games \u2014The original DLSS required training the AI network for each new game. DLSS 2.0 trains using non-game-specific content, delivering a generalized network that works across games. This means faster game integrations, and ultimately more DLSS games.\nCustomizable Options \u2014 DLSS 2.0 offers users three image quality modes (Quality, Balanced and Performance) that control render resolution, with Performance mode now enabling up to a 4x super resolution. (i.e. 1080p \u2192 4K). This means more user choice, and even bigger performance boosts.\n\nIn addition to Control and MechWarrior 5, DLSS 2.0 has delivered big performance boosts to Deliver Us The Moon and Wolfenstein: Youngblood.\nDLSS 2.0 is now also available to Unreal Engine 4 developers through the DLSS Developer Program that will accelerate deployment in one of the world\u2019s most popular game engines.\nRTX Momentum Builds Across the Ecosystem\nDLSS is one of several major graphics innovations, including ray tracing and variable rate shading, introduced in 2018 with the launch of our NVIDIA RTX GPUs.\nSince then, about 15 million NVIDIA RTX GPUs have been sold. More than 30 major games have been released or announced with ray tracing or NVIDIA DLSS powered by NVIDIA RTX. And ray tracing has been adopted by all major APIs and game engines.\nThat momentum continues with Microsoft\u2019s announcement last week of DirectX 12 Ultimate, as well as NVIDIA RTX Global Illumination SDK, new tool support for the Vulkan graphics API, and new Photoshop texture tool plugins.\nDirectX 12 Ultimate\nLast week, Microsoft unveiled DirectX 12 Ultimate, the latest version of the widely used DirectX graphics standard.\nDirectX 12 Ultimate codifies NVIDIA RTX\u2019s innovative technologies, including ray tracing, variable rate shading, mesh shading, and texture space shading, as the standard for multi-platform, next-gen games.\nGame developers can take full advantage of all these technologies knowing they\u2019ll be compatible with PCs equipped with NVIDIA RTX GPUs and Microsoft\u2019s upcoming Xbox Series X console.\nRTX Global Illumination SDK\u00a0\nThe NVIDIA RTX Global Illumination SDK, released Monday, gives developers a scalable solution to implement beautiful, ray-traced indirect lighting in games while still achieving performance targets.\nThe RTX GI SDK is supported on any DirectX raytracing-enabled GPU. It\u2019s an ideal starting point to bring the benefits of ray tracing to more games.\nVulkan Game Developers Get New Tools\nNVIDIA also Monday added support for the Vulkan graphics API to two of its most popular game development tools.\nNsight Aftermath, which provides precise information on where GPU crashes occur and why, is now available for the first time for Vulkan.\nNVIDIA will also provide Vulkan developers with GPU Trace, a low-level profiler in Nsight Graphics that provides hardware unit metrics and precise timing information\nNVIDIA Texture Tools Exporter\nThe NVIDIA Texture Tools Exporter allows users to create highly compressed texture files that stay small on disk and in memory.\nIt allows game and app developers to use higher quality textures in their applications, and provides users a smaller, faster, download size.\nIt\u2019s available as a standalone tool or as an Adobe Photoshop plug-in for game developers and texture artists.\nMore Advancements for Gamers\nAdd it all up: DLSS 2.0, support for RTX technologies with DirectX 12 Ultimate, the introduction of the NVIDIA RTX Global Illumination SDK, support for the Vulkan graphics API in more NVIDIA developer tools, as well as more texture tools. The result is more advancements in the hands of more gamers, developers, and creators than ever before.\n\n\n\nCategories: GamingTags: Artificial Intelligence | GeForce | GPU | Turing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

That's why mid-range graphics cards like the AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT and Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 exist, and why previous generation GPUs like the GTX 1060 and GTX 960 still occupy high positions on the Steam Hardware survey. The latest 'mid-range' cards may cost more than previous generations, but $250-$300 will often get you a sizeable bump in performance compared to $200 cards.AMD's RX 5600 XT launched in January 2020, offering a middle ground between AMD's higher performance RX 5700 cards and the budget RX 5500 XT. You can see where it sits in terms of performance in our GPU benchmarks hierarchy, but there's more to the story than raw performance. It was originally intended to compete against Nvidia's GTX 1660 Ti, but then Nvidia dropped the price on its 2060 Founders Edition and worked with EVGA to release a $300 EVGA RTX 2060 KO, which in turn caused AMD to release new BIOS guidelines to its partners. The result is a pretty big discrepancy in performance between the base model RX 5600 XT and the higher performance models. The good news is that good RX 5600 XT cards like the Sapphire RX 5600 XT Pulse and Gigabyte RX 5600 XT Gaming OC cost $300 or less. The bad news is you might need to flash the VBIOS after purchase (it's not too difficult, though).The GTX 2060 by comparison is old news. It launched in January 2019 and acts as the caboose for Nvidia's RTX line. If you want ray tracing acceleration in hardware, you can't go any lower\u2014and while Nvidia does offer DirectX Raytracing (DXR) enabled drivers for it's GTX 10- and 16-series cards, DXR performance is typically far lower than even the RTX 2060. But the price cut to $300 is new, and that makes for a far more interesting battle between the RX 5600 XT and the RTX 2060.Read our initial AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT ReviewBe careful, because Not Every AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT Can Handle 14 Gbps GDDR6Related: Gigabyte RX 5600 XT Gaming OC 6G ReviewThere are a lot of options for right around the $300 mark. Besides the RX 5600 XT and RTX 2060, AMD's RX 5700 can often be found on sale for close to $300\u2014less, if you're willing to deal with mail-in rebates. Some of the Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti models also cost close to $300, but let's be honest: They're not remotely worth the price of admission (the GTX 1660 Super is a better choice with nearly the same performance for about $50 less).You can also go quite a bit lower with something like an RX 5500 XT or GTX 1660, or step up to the RX 5700 XT or RTX 2060 Super. We've already covered those decisions, so let's break down how the RTX 2060 and RX 5600 XT compare. We'll be looking at the reference spec for both cards, though we generally wouldn't recommend the base model in the case of the 5600 XT\u2014there's no reason to save $10 and not get a faster model with significantly higher core and memory clocks. We'll include details for factory overclocked cards as well, and we'll discuss features, drivers and software, performance, efficiency, and overall value.\u00a0(Image credit: Nvidia)1. Feature TechnologyAMD's Radeon RX 5600 XT is the middle ground product of AMD's RX 5000 series. However, it still uses the same Navi 10 GPU core as the RX 5700 XT, just with four of the Compute Units (CUs) disabled, giving it 2304 GPU cores. It also has 6GB of GDDR6 memory clocked at either 12 Gbps or 14 Gbps (depending on the model) and a 192-bit memory bus. The GPU is nominally called the Navi 10 XLE, but the important bit is that it has the same number of CUs as the RX 5700, with generally similar clock speeds. The main differentiator is the loss of memory and the memory clock\u201414 Gbps means 25% less bandwidth than an RX 5700, while 12 Gbps means 36% less bandwidth. It's a big difference and the 14 Gbps card variants are clearly faster.Nvidia's GeForce RTX 2060 is the bottom of the RTX line, using the company's TU106-200-KA-A1 GPU. That has 30 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), with 1920 CUDA cores and a conservative boost clock of 1680 MHz. It also includes 30 RT cores for ray tracing calculations and 240 Tensor cores for things like DLSS\u2014or doing deep learning computations for AI research.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.SpecificationsSwipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 RX 5600 XTSapphire RX 5600 XT PulseRTX 2060EVGA RTX 2060 KO UltraGTX 1660 TiArchitectureNavi 10Navi 10TU106TU104TU116Process (nm)77121212Transistors (Billion)10.310.310.813.66.6Die size (mm square)251251445545284SMMs / CUs3636303024GPU Cores23042304192019201536Tensor CoresN/AN/A240240N/ART CoresN/AN/A3030N/ATurbo Clock (MHz)13751615168017751770VRAM Speed (Gbps)1214141412VRAM (GB)66666VRAM Bus Width192192192192192ROPs6464646448TMUs14414412012096GFLOPS (Boost)63367442645167395437Bandwidth (GBps)288336336336288TDP (watts)150160160160120Suggested Price$279 $289 $349 (now $299)$319 $279 Launch DateJan 2020Jan 2020Jan 2019Jan 2020Feb 2019Here's where things get interesting. AMD effectively has two different RX 5600 XT models in the wild\u2014those that stick closer to the reference clocks, or at least limit the VRAM to 12 Gbps, and those that are boosted to substantially higher performance levels. Looking at the Nvidia RTX 2060 makes it easy to see why this was done. Traditionally, Nvidia gets more real-world utility out of its theoretical performance\u2014so a 9 TFLOPS Nvidia GPU can match or beat a 10 TFLOPS AMD GPU. But the 5600 XT initially went after the GTX 1660 Ti, which is a much slower chip; against the RTX 2060, it wouldn't look as good.Note that the EVGA RTX 2060 KO uses the TU104 GPU (TU104-150-KC-A1 to be precise) instead of the usual TU106. TU104 is much larger, with up to 3072 CUDA cores, and it's normally found in the RTX 2070 Super, RTX 2080, and RTX 2080 Super. Apparently there are enough TU104 chips that can't meet the requirements for RTX 2070 Super that Nvidia has created a special lower-tier version for cards like the EVGA RTX 2060 KO. Note that this isn't that unusual\u2014Nvidia has GTX 1060 models that use GP104 instead of the usual GP106 as well. For the end user, it shouldn't matter\u2014core counts and clock speeds are the important things\u2014but it does mean EVGA has a different PCB for these cards, as the TU104 is physically larger and has more solder points. There are also instances where TU104 does perform better, like Blender and some other workstation apps.Navi 10's 251mm square vs. the TU106's 445 mm square means Nvidia's GPU is 77% larger, which generally makes a chip more expensive to manufacture. However, TSMC is the foundry for both AMD and Nvidia, and its 7nm tech costs more than the older 12nm tech. We don't have exact details on how much each chip costs to manufacture, or TSMC's yields for the chips, but ultimately the retail prices are similar for cards using the GPUs.In terms of theoretical performance, the match between 'reference' RX 5600 XT and RTX 2060 is likely to favor Nvidia by a bit, whereas higher clocked cards like the Sapphire Pulse should pull ahead, but then factory overclocked 2060 cards bring things back to near-parity.Both AMD and Nvidia support adaptive refresh rate technology: AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync. However, Nvidia has an advantage in that it also supports select 'compatible' adaptive sync displays (aka, FreeSync), whereas AMD only works with FreeSync/Adaptive Sync monitors. If you own a G-Sync display, Nvidia is really your only viable GPU choice; good FreeSync displays will work with AMD and Nvidia GPUs. Nvidia also has HDMI 2.1 VRR (variable refresh rate) support on its RTX series cards, which is important for some of the latest 4K 120Hz TVs.Looking at other features, most areas are a tie. Both have 6GB of GDDR6, though Nvidia will always give you 14 Gbps memory, where some 5600 XT cards are 12 Gbps. TDP is basically the same as well, and 10W won't matter in the real-world of desktop graphics cards. AMD uses TSMC's latest 7nm finFET manufacturing process and Nvidia uses the older 12nm finFET, which explains the difference in chip sizes.The biggest difference in feature support as usual comes down to ray tracing hardware. DXR and Vulkan-RT are currently used in eight games, and another eight major games with ray tracing support should launch in 2020. And while the RTX 2060 is the lowest card on the RTX ladder, it can still run all of those games with RTX enabled\u2014provided you're willing to use DLSS or not shoot for maxed out settings.Winner: Nvidia RTX 2060. AMD has a much smaller chip, but it's still first-generation Navi and that means no hardware ray tracing. You may not feel that ray tracing is a critical feature right now, and it's not, but everything else being equal we'd rather have that option to try it out. Nvidia also gives you the choice between G-Sync and FreeSync / G-Sync Compatible displays\u2014and considering Nvidia did the dirty work of fully validating every G-Sync Compatible display, we also know which FreeSync displays are likely to work best, even with AMD GPUs.\u00a0AMD Radeon Settings (Image credit: AMD)2. Drivers and SoftwareThis is a somewhat controversial topic, especially considering that some people have encountered issues with AMD drivers blackscreening on RX 5000 series GPUs. We said AMD 'won' the driver battle last time in the 2060 Super vs. 5700 XT face off, but we've been looking into the situation.AMD's blackscreen problems are real and documented. However, the latest drivers also appear to clear up that issue\u2014it's one of the items listed as 'fixed'. We haven't been able to replicate a blackscreen so far, but then we weren't experiencing issues in the first place. Our advice for AMD users is to run with the 'standard' profile if you get a blackscreen and see if that helps. Extra features like Enhanced Sync may be partly to blame. Otherwise, the difference between AMD and Nvidia drivers is more in terms of presentationAMD's Radeon Adrenalin 2020 drivers overhauled the presentation of information and consolidated everything under one large umbrella. There are also new features like integer scaling and Game Boost, joining existing features including Radeon Anti-Lag, Radeon Image Sharpening, Radeon Chill, Enhanced Sync, and the ability to record or stream your gaming sessions. All of the new additions appear to have generated a lot of new bugs, but AMD has put out multiple drivers in 2020 that have each resolved a sizable number of issues. AMD gives you everything you need in one package, including the ability to tweak and overclock your graphics card.Nvidia's 442.59 drivers are the company's fourth driver update of 2020, though other than being Game Ready for several recent games, there don't appear to be any major changes since the initial 440 driver release. Nvidia and AMD drivers are mostly at parity with each other, with a few minor exceptions. First, Nvidia doesn't provide any tools for overclocking (though many free utilities like MSI Afterburner exist). Second, Nvidia splits up features between the Nvidia Control Panel and GeForce Experience.We prefer AMD's unified approach, and one of my personal complaints is Nvidia's requirement to log in, with a captcha, to use GeForce Experience. It's not the end of the world, and there haven't been any major issues with Nvidia drivers of late (that I've noticed, at least\u2014nothing as widespread as AMD's blackscreen problem). Still, Nvidia's driver quality and Q&A is arguably better.Winner: Tie. We said AMD was ahead last time, based mostly on the login requirement of GeForce Experience. I still hate having to log in every time I do a driver clean and install new drivers, but \u00a0most people aren't going to do that as often as a GPU reviewer. Pet peeves aside, it's difficult to point to anything that would make one side definitively better or worse, at least now that the AMD blackscreen issues appear to be resolved.\u00a0Ray tracing vs DX12 UW (Image credit: Shutterstock)3. Gaming PerformanceGraphics cards are for playing games, outside of a few exceptions. We've tested 12 games across multiple resolutions and settings to see how the RX 5600 XT and RTX 2060 compare. Ray tracing isn't enabled, and we have a mix of both AMD and Nvidia promotional titles. Note also that for these tests, we're using the Sapphire RX 5600 XT Pulse against the EVGA RTX 2060 KO Ultra\u2014it wouldn't be 'fair' to compare the Pulse against the reference clocked 2060 Founders Edition, so we've used two factory overclocked parts.

The above results are for the higher performance Sapphire RX 5600 XT Pulse against the EVGA RTX 2060 KO Ultra, but a reference clocked 5600 XT and RTX 2060 would tell a similar story. Again, AMD's initial target was supposed to be the GTX 1660 Ti, where the RX 5600 XT would have likely swept the performance results. The 2060 is 12~22% faster than the 1660 Ti, however, closing the gap.Looking at the individual games, there are a few that favor the RX 5600 XT and a few that favor the RTX 2060. The Division 2, Forza Horizon 4 and Metro Exodus are in the AMD camp (despite Metro being an Nvidia title); Assassin's Creed Odyssey, The Outer Worlds, and Total War: Warhammer 2 favor the RTX 2060 (despite Outer Worlds and Warhammer 2 being AMD titles). But in the more critical overall metric, it's effectively a tie\u2014with the RTX 2060 holding a nominal 0-2% lead and slightly better minimum fps.Winner: Tie It's entirely possible to skew benchmarks in favor of AMD or Nvidia by selecting a different mix of games, but in our tests this is as close to a dead heat as we're likely to see. Of course, we're also testing without any of the RTX ray tracing or DLSS 'enhancements' and you could argue that's not fair, but it wouldn't be a like-for-like comparison in that case. Plus Nvidia already got credit for those in the features category win.\u00a04. Power Consumption and Heat Output\u00a0Depending on the specific card you purchase, the power requirements may be slightly higher, but yet again we end up with a close match. Theoretically, a card could use a single 6-pin PCI Express Graphics (PEG) power connector and the x16 PCIe slot to get 150W of power, but looking at the cards available at Newegg, every RX 5600 XT and RTX 2060 card comes with at least an 8-pin PEG connector\u2014and a few even have 8-pin plus 6-pin connectors. Short of some massive manual overclocks, though, it's difficult to imagine the need for anything more than a single 8-pin connector.AMD's AMD's RX 5600 XT reference spec has a 150W Typical Board Power (TBP) rating, and Nvidia's RTX 2060 is rated at 160W. Most of the custom overclocked AMD cards also have a 160W spec (if it's listed), and in real-world testing the two GPUs are closely matched. Some use cases (eg, multi-monitor) favor Nvidia, while games are within a few watts. Sustained workloads, like Furmark also seem to favor Nvidia slightly, but we're more focused on the gaming tests. (Note: our power testing in the earlier reviews used GPU-Z monitoring, which doesn't measure board power on AMD, so we're looking at other data.)As you'd expect given the similar power requirements, both GPUs recommend a similar level of power supply: AMD officially recommends 550W while Nvidia recommends 500W, but any good (ie, 80 Plus Gold or better) 450W or higher rated PSU should be more than capable of powering either card. In testing with a Core i9-9900K PC, power use is far lower than those PSU recommendations. We measured around 275W at the outlet with the RTX 2060 and 270W with the RX 5600 XT.For most PCs, the 5~15W difference in power use isn't going to matter a lot\u2014if your PSU can handle the RTX 2060, it can handle the 5600 XT, and vice versa. And since power use is virtually the same, temperatures and fan speeds are more a factor of the cooler on your specific card. Larger coolers with triple fans will generally run cooler and quieter, dual or single fans with a smaller cooler will be louder and/or hotter. You can get graphics cards from the various vendors using either chip to fit your specific wants.Winner: Tie It's not very exciting to end up with a tie in nearly every category, but the RTX 2060 and RX 5600 XT are as evenly matched as we're likely to see. It's a bit of a concern that AMD's slightly lower power consumption with similar performance is largely thanks to its 7nm lithography, and Nvidia's future Ampere GPUs could jump ahead, but that's a story for another day.5. Value PropositionWhich GPU is the better value? That can be a bit of a subjective answer. There are many factors at play, like the features, price, factory overclocks, cooler, and more. Right now, the RX 5600 XT has a starting street price of $270, while the cheapest RTX 2060 cards start at $300 ($290 after mail-in rebate). The problem is that the cheapest RX 5600 XT cards have 12 Gbps GDDR6, which drops performance about 5-8%, so you're better off paying $10-$30 more to get a card with 14 Gbps memory.At that point, card prices are the same, but you get ray tracing with Nvidia \u2026 which is still a tough sell, considering the graphics upgrade in most games that support the features isn't that big. At publication time, AMD also had a promotion running where you get Monster Hunter World: Iceborne and the Resident Evil 3 remaster, plus three months of Xbox Game Pass.Winner: Tie Yes, we're calling this another tie, and it comes down to personal preference. Do you want to try ray tracing, or you think that's the future of games? Nvidia's RTX 2060 gets the value edge in that case. Do you want one or both of the games that come with the RX 5600 XT? That's potentially a $40-$100 value add (though the current offer is ending soon and will likely be replaced with some newer games). Sales can obviously tip the scales as well.\u00a0Swipe to scroll horizontallyRoundNvidia GeForce RTX 2060AMD Radeon RX 5600 XTFeatured Technology\u2717Row 0 - Cell 2 Drivers and Software\u2717\u2717Gaming Performance\u2717\u2717Power Consumption\u2717\u2717Value Proposition\u2717\u2717Total54 Nvidia RTX 2060 FE (Image credit: Nvidia)Bottom LineThis is as close of a matchup as you're likely to find in the graphics card market. The RX 5600 XT and RTX 2060 go toe to toe, trading glancing blows but with very few solid hits. Fans will loudly proclaim the superiority of their chosen GPU vendor, and a slight change in perspective\u2014or price\u2014can make all the difference.Our ultimate winner ends up being Nvidia's RTX 2060, but there are caveats. First is that it's a very subjective call, as so many areas are clearly a tie. Performance, power, thermals and pricing are all nearly identical. That leaves features and drivers, where there's no universal metric for weighing the contestants. Ray tracing is clearly something extra, though, and for the same price, why not get the RTX 2060?The difficulty in recommending the RTX 2060 over the RX 5600 XT is that at around $300, the 5600 XT is outclassed by the RX 5700. We can't say for certain how long the deals will last, but right now Newegg has the MSI RX 5700 Evoke OC on sale for $333, with a $30 promo code and a $30 mail-in rebate. That brings the price down to $273, or $303 if you don't do the rebate, so it's either cheaper or the same price as the RTX 2060, and it's faster. In other words, the RX 5700 is arguably the winner if you want to include it in this conversation (and you should).Pricing can change, but Nvidia has already dropped the RTX 2060 from $350 to $300 and it's a much larger chip to manufacture. AMD likely has more wiggle room to drop the RX 5600 XT down into the $250 range, at which point it becomes a clearly better value and likely gets the overall pick. Of course, with AMD's future Navi 2x and RDNA 2 slated to launch by the end of 2020, and Nvidia's Ampere GPUs also coming down the pipe, the battle for the $300 market is far from over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce\nrtx\nRadeon\nRadeon RX \nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (20)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

Across 12 tested games, it's slower (by ~5-8%) in Red Dead Redemption 2, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and Strange Brigade. It's faster (again, by 5~8%) in Division 2, Hitman 2, Outer Worlds, Warhammer 2, Metro Exodus, and Forza Horizon 4. That's using the Sapphire Pulse, of course, so subtract 5% for a reference 12Gbps card. For the RTX 2060, the story is basically the same.\n\nNow, add in the fact that Vega 64 is a 295W card (and often consumes more than that) and it's not really that great an idea. Vega 56 is still worth a thought, but again, power hungry, older architecture, not sure I'd really want it. There's a reason they're selling for so cheap -- but not $200 cheap unless you go eBay. https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?N=100007709 601302833 4814&Order=PRICE\nAnd there is no way I would recommend a used Vega card. Cryptomining was a major factor in Vega selling well for most of its shelf life. Used cards that are more than two years old are a major risk.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbaylesje\n\n\nI'd still like to kick the guys in the nuts who decided when this price became \"mid-range\".

We're not happy with a mere 60Hz anymore.\n\nThe R9 285 was released in September 2014. Definitely a mid-range card FOR ITS TIME. I purchased a new one in January 2015, at $235. That's about $260 today by inflation calculator estimates (I went change 2014 to 2019, as I couldn't enter 2020 as a \"final year\" since it's not the end of 2020 yet).\n\n$290 doesn't seem THAT outrageous.\n\nEDIT: Like the Sapphire Pulse, my R9 285 was also an overclocked card, the Gigabyte Windforce OC R9 285.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJarredWaltonGPU\n\n\nbaylesje said:I'd still like to kick the guys in the nuts who decided when this price became \"mid-range\".

Alas, I guess this is the de-evolution of human-kind as we take everything for granted in exchange for complacency.I think part of the problem is that 'budget' GPUs have become largely pointless. If you can only afford a $100 GPU for gaming purposes, and considering most modern games cost $50+, you should probably not be buying games or hardware to play games. I'd suggest either save your money for at least a $200 GPU, or just use the integrated GPU inside any recent Intel CPU, or get a Ryzen APU. Of course, gaming has moved from being primarily for teens and maybe 20-somethings into a hobby for a lot of adults, and adults tend to have more money for their hobbies.\n\nSo if $100 dedicated GPUs are out, the next step up becomes $150, and that's the new 'budget' price. And elsewhere I recommend moving up to the $230 1660 Super as a better choice than an RX 5500 XT 4GB or GTX 1650 Super. That has a cascading effect of pushing 'mid-range' or 'mainstream' up to around $300.\n\nIt's also important to put things in a different perspective. A $300 PC graphics card with any decent PC is more powerful than any current gen console, by far. And the PS5 and XB1X are going to probably cost $500 or more is my guess -- I could be wrong, but at a minimum it looks like you get a $150 CPU + $300 GPU + $100 SSD + $100+ in other bits. Even at $500, it would be sold at a substantial loss, and $600 seems more likely at launch. Guess we'll find out come fall, though.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmac_angel\n\n\nYou guys are really struggling for news and article subjects with everything going on I take it.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJarredWaltonGPU\n\n\nmac_angel said:You guys are really struggling for news and article subjects with everything going on I take it.Not necessarily.

Across 12 tested games, it's slower (by ~5-8%) in Red Dead Redemption 2, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and Strange Brigade. It's faster (again, by 5~8%) in Division 2, Hitman 2, Outer Worlds, Warhammer 2, Metro Exodus, and Forza Horizon 4. That's using the Sapphire Pulse, of course, so subtract 5% for a reference 12Gbps card. For the RTX 2060, the story is basically the same.\n\nNow, add in the fact that Vega 64 is a 295W card (and often consumes more than that) and it's not really that great an idea. Vega 56 is still worth a thought, but again, power hungry, older architecture, not sure I'd really want it. There's a reason they're selling for so cheap -- but not $200 cheap unless you go eBay. https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?N=100007709 601302833 4814&Order=PRICE\nAnd there is no way I would recommend a used Vega card. Cryptomining was a major factor in Vega selling well for most of its shelf life. Used cards that are more than two years old are a major risk.Or you can undervolt the 64 or 56 for power savings or a performance boost and it\u2019s still $50 more more in savings. Plus you\u2019re gonna have to have your PC running full bore a lot for the extra wattage time make a difference.

The vast amounts of information reveal what to expect from the upcoming GPU architecture and also mentions the technical specifications of the various GPU SKUs that we would get in NVIDIA's next-gen Ampere GPU family.\nNVIDIA Next-Gen GeForce 'Ampere' GPU Rumors - 10nm Process, Q4 2020 Launch, Ray-Tracing Across Entire Lineup, RTX 2080 Ti's Successor Up To 40% Faster\nNVIDIA's Ampere GPU family has seen various rumors and so far, NVIDIA has been very tight-lipped about their upcoming family. We can't say for sure if Ampere would be the codename for its next-gen GPUs but the various SKUs that have slipped passed EEC seem to indicate that it might be the case after all.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Ampere GA102F GPU Support Added To AIDA64, Is This The Chip Powering The GeForce RTX 3090 Ti?Coming to the details, first are foremost, these leaks are not to be compared with the ones we had earlier which were only specific to the HPC parts. Those may feature a different GPU architecture & an entirely different fabrication process unlike the GeForce parts being mentioned here. With that cleared away, the two leakers from Twitter have reported that NVIDIA's next GPU architecture will be based on the Samsung 10nm process node and not go with TSMC as reported earlier. The new 10nm process node from Samsung will be utilized for the fabrication of NVIDIA's next-gen GeForce GPUs. The process is said to be closer to the 8LPP technology that Samsung has to offer but it isn't EUV-based.\n\"NO EUV. GA102 has taped out. It was based on SAMSUNG 10nm. (You can call it 8nm?) And the new tegra will use the same process node.\" - Kopite7kimi\n\nPreviously, Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA, stated that TSMC will be handling the majority of its 7nm orders while Samsung would only get a small number of GPU orders. It makes sense that NVIDIA is just referring to 7nm parts and not 10nm parts like mentioned in this rumor. If TSMC were to get the larger order of 7nm GPUs, then that might be a different GPU altogether and it could be possible that the HPC oriented GA100 GPU is based on TSMC's 7nm process while the GeForce GPUs are to be fabricated at Samsungs (10nm / 8LPP) fab. The same process is also being used to produce the Orion SOC which utilizes NVIDIA's next-gen GPU architecture, reportedly Ampere.\nThe Rumored NVIDIA GeForce Ampere GPU Lineup - GA102, GA013, GA104, GA016 & GA107 For Gamers\nNow with the process rumors out of the way, let's talk about the speculation that's been going on over the GeForce GPUs. According to KittyCorgi on Twitter, the GeForce lineup would be powered by a total of 5 Ampere GPUs and their respective SKUs featuring various core configurations. The topmost SKU in the lineup would be the GA102 which would be the successor to the TU102 GPU. The rest of the GPUs and their predecessors are mentioned below:\n\nNVIDIA GA102 - TU102 - GP102\nNVIDIA GA103 - No Predecessor\nNVIDIA GA104 - TU104 - GP104\nNVIDIA GA106 - TU106 - GP106\nNVIDIA GA107 - TU117 - GP107\n\nNVIDIA's rumored GeForce Ampere GPU specifications leak out. (Image Credits: KittyCorgi)\nBefore we get into the details of these specific GPUs, it is mentioned that all GPUs will be made on the Samsung 10nm (8LPP) process node. SLI through a next-generation NVLINK interconnect will be available but only on the top-tier GA102 based graphics cards. Currently, this limitation only falls below the TU104 based GPUs but it looks like NVIDIA would impose further limitations with next-gen Ampere parts. NVIDIA would also enable RTX (real-time ray-tracing) across all GPUs, even the lower-end GA107 parts which means that there are some significant architectural enhancements made to the RT design on Ampere GPUs, allowing for more real-time raytracing performance on the new cards.\nhttps://twitter.com/CorgiKitty/status/1237748855426310144\nOnce again, it is mentioned that FP32 units on Ampere would be doubled but they don't translate into a 2x rasterization performance increase or twice the increase in the number of CUDA cores. The Ampere GPU wouldn't only\u00a0improve the rasterization and shading performance\u00a0but also deliver huge uplifts over Turing in ray tracing performance.\nSince Turing was the 1st generation implementation of ray tracing on NVIDIA graphics cards, Ampere will further optimize it and is expected to offer more ray-tracing hardware onboard in the form of RT and Tensor cores. The Ampere GPUs are also mentioned to leverage performance from PCIe Gen 4.0 which is a given since this is a next-generation GPU architecture tuned for next-generation gaming platforms and the higher bandwidth from the Gen 4.0 protocol, plus NVLINK would be an essential feature. So let's talk about the GPU configurations now.\nNVIDIA GA102 For Next-Gen Titan & GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Graphics Card- The Flagship Ampere GeForce GPU\nThe flagship GeForce GPU is rumored to be the GA102 and will be the successor to the Turing based TU102 GPU we got to see on the Titan RTX and RTX 2080 Ti graphics cards. The GPU will feature 84 SMs which equals 5376 CUDA cores. This is 16% more CUDA cores than the full-fat TU102 GPU featured on the Titan RTX. The GPU would be able to support up to 12 GB of VRAM across a 384-bit bus interface.\n\nWe can't say for sure if NVIDIA would be using the full configuration on the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti or whatever they call the RTX 2080 Ti's successor but if they follow the current plan which was used for Turing, then we would see a full fat 5376 core config on the next-generation Titan while the RTX 3080 Ti could use a more conservative core count of 5120 CUDA cores which may not be a huge difference which would be made up by higher clock speeds of AIB cards. The GA102 GPU is said to be up to 40% faster than the RTX 2080 Ti and once again, this is the full configuration that is being compared. It will be the same if not bigger leap as the GTX 1080 Ti was versus its non-Ti GTX 1080 brother.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Graphics Card - Up To 10 GB GDDR6, 320-bit Bus, GA103 GPU\nAs mentioned above, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 will be the successor to the GeForce RTX 2080. It will feature a total of 60 SMs with 64 CUDA cores each making 3840 CUDA cores. This would be a big leap over the RTX 2080's CUDA core count which was set at 3072 and we aren't even factoring in the clock speeds which NVIDIA will be able to churn up with the advanced process node.\nThe card is also said to feature a 320-bit bus interface which means that it could support either 10 or 20 GB of GDDR6 memory. If NVIDIA really wants to blow the audience away with Ampere, then 20 GB would be a perfect choice. However, we have to take into consideration the high costs that are associated with GDDR6 memory and the looming rumors of a memory shortage due to higher demand from the console market.\n\nSo let's be conservative and say 10 GB of GDDR6, which would still be 2 GB more than the current GeForce RTX 2080. If we are looking at 16 Gbps modules on the upcoming RTX 3080, it would give us 640 GB/s bandwidth which would be insane over the 496 GB/s of the RTX 2080 SUPER which features 15.5 Gbps memory alongside a 256-bit bus interface. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 is said to be 10% faster than the RTX 2080 Ti which is a better performance bump than both the RTX 2080 and the GTX 1080 which only matched and were slightly faster (under 5%) than the outgoing Ti parts.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Graphics Card - Up To 8 GB GDDR6, 256-bit Bus, GA104 GPU\nThe third card is the GeForce RTX 3070 and as stated above, it will feature the GA104 GPU. The successor to the TU106 based GeForce RTX 2070 is suggested to feature the same CUDA core count as the RTX 2080, at 3072, all rounded up in its 48 streaming multiprocessor units. The card is expected to feature a 256-bit bus interface which once again would allow for 8 GB or up to 16 GB GDDR6 memory, but you have to take into consideration what I just said above about the GDDR6 supply and cost factor.\n\nThis GPU is said to deliver 95% performance of the RTX 2080 Ti which could be pushed further ahead with custom models and higher factory overclocks. This would mean that NVIDIA would deliver a card that offers the performance of an $1200 US card for under $500 US which would be pretty impressive.\nLastly, we have the GA106 and GA107 GPUs which would target the mainstream and budget segments. The GA106 GPU would feature 30 SMs or 1920 CUDA cores with up to 6 GB memory across a 192-bit bus interface while the GA107 GPU would feature 20 MS or 1280 CUDA cores with up to 4 GB of memory across a 128-bit bus interface.\nNVIDIA Ampere GPU 'GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, RTX 3080, RTX 3070' Rumored Specs Comparison:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti\n\n\n\n\nGPU ArchitectureTuring TU106Turing TU104Ampere GA104Ampere GA103Turing TU102Ampere GA102\n\n\nProcess12nm FinFET NVIDIA (TSMC)12nm FinFET NVIDIA (TSMC)Samsung 10nm (8LPP)?Samsung 10nm (8LPP)?12nm FinFET NVIDIA (TSMC)Samsung 10nm (8LPP)?\n\n\nSMs364848607284\n\n\nCUDA Cores2304 CCs3072 CCs3072 CCs3840 CCs4608 CCs5376 CCs\n\n\nMemory8 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68/16 GB GDDR610/20 GB GDDR611 GB GDDR612 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus256-bit256-bit256-bit320-bit320-bit384-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed14 Gbps14 Gbps16 Gbps?16 Gbps?14 Gbps16 Gbps?\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth448 GB/s448 GB/s512 GB/s640 GB/s640 GB/s768 GB/s\n\n\nLaunch201820182020202020182020\n\n\n\nWhat's interesting is that these two cards leave so much room open for a GeForce RTX 3080 Ti to just blow away the enthusiast market segment again. If the reports of NVIDIA's overall Ampere architecture gaining 50% higher performance than Turing while offering twice the efficiency are correct, than given those specs, an RTX 3070 would be able to deliver the performance or even outperform the RTX 2080 Ti at a much lower price point.\nAccording to the Taipei Times, NVIDIA's Ampere GPU is going to deliver seriously impressive figures in both performance and efficiency.\u00a0The overall performance gain is expected to be 50% higher than existing Turing GPUs while offering twice the power efficiency.\u00a0It is clearly mentioned that Ampere would halve the power consumption compared to existing Turing GPUs. This means that a GPU with a lower TDP figure than the RTX 2060 (125-150W) would be able to outperform the 2080 Ti which is seriously impressive. One can only expect the kind of performance which a high-end GPU based on the Ampere architecture would offer as we can definitely expect true 4K 60 FPS ray-traced gaming from the updated architecture.\n\nThese are truly exciting details but we have to remember that all of these are just rumors at this point. NVIDIA had to recently push its annual GTC conference from a live webcast to just news releases in light of the coronavirus outbreak. That might change the timeline for major GPU and key announcements that were to be made so we have to wait for official confirmation before we can consider these specifications 100% accurate.\n\n\n\nWhich NVIDIA Ampere based graphics card are you interested for the most?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Ampere GA103 GPU Makes Desktop Debut In GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Graphics Cards\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Ampere GA103 GPU May Debut As The GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Mobile On The Fastest Gaming Laptops Ever Made!\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom GALAX & Gainward GeForce RTX 3060 Cards With NVIDIA Ampere GA104 GPUs Listed\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Graphics Cards With Ampere GA104 GPUs Spotted\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n74\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n73\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve Rumored To Launch SteamOS For Desktop PCs Soon; Is Time For A Bloatware-Free OS Near?\n\n\n\n25\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n22\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n14\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1285\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\n\n\n783\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The long-term trend \u2013 UptrendBy connecting the lowest lows (closing price) on a price chart we can easily see that NVIDIA is in a long-term uptrend. As this trend spans from 2016 through 2020 (months to years) it is a long-term trend.2. The medium-term trend \u2013 SidewaysConnecting the highest highs for NVIDIA from 2019 to 2020 (weeks to months) we can see that NVIDIA is in a sideways consolidation pattern. Here you can see that trend-line (2.) is also called the resistance line. The price bounced twice off the resistance line but did not break through, meaning resistance. Also, in terms of the chart pattern, it is a \u201cdouble top\u201d.3. The Short-term Trend \u2013 DowntrendLooking at the days to weeks timeframe and connecting the highest highs of the closing prices we can clearly see that NVIDIA is in a downtrend.4. Long-term lateral support lineHere we can draw a horizontal line connecting previous highs and lows to see there a possible future target price may be.Using Trend-lines to Establish Possible Price DirectionNow that we have drawn the trend-lines we can see that if price breaks through or bounces off a trendline what the next market move will be. Predictions are colored in Red.5. Price Breaks Through Long-term Trend LineIf the stock price breaks down through the long-term price trend (1.) then we expect it to move down to trend-line (4.) at $1206. Price Breaks Up through Short-term Down TrendIf price breaks up through trend line (3.) Then we expect resistance at the Medium-term trend line (2.) At this point, it will either move back down to continue up.7. Price Breaks through Medium-term Trend 2.Finally, if the price moves up through medium trend (2.), this is a new all-time high and a bull run.SummaryI hope this guide shows you how to draw trend lines properly to give professional reliable results and market entry timings.ThanksBarry \u2013 LiberatedStockTrader.comliberatedstocktraderFollowBarry D.

That's understandable. Things are up in the air at the moment. The market is crashing like it's 2008, getting double-whammied by the novel coronavirus pandemic and the oil price war set off by Saudi Arabia and Russia on March 6. Whether it's the first money you're hoping to put to work, or it's a recent deposit in an ongoing effort to save for the future, now is one of those rare periods in time where it seems there's nowhere good to invest.\nMy personal investing journey (as well as my formative years as a working adult) began in 2007, which wasn't ideal timing considering the global financial crisis got started that year. But what that period taught me was that even less-than-ideal timing can be wildly rewarding if you can ignore the short-term doomsday-ism and stay invested in quality companies for the long haul (since stocks are, after all, passive business ownership).\nWith that in mind, here's my mini stock portfolio for the next decade for those looking to put $1,000 to work right now, and plan to buy more with subsequent savings: Facebook (META -4.20%), NVIDIA (NVDA -3.63%), Texas Roadhouse (TXRH -2.15%), Square (XYZ 1.72%), and STORE Capital (STOR).\n\nEven the catastrophic financial crisis will be rendered a blip with the passing of time. Data by YCharts.\nFacebook: The king of social media and more\nThe coronavirus and oil market-fueled sell-off are only the latest blows to Facebook stock. Over the last couple of years, the company has been dealing with privacy and political backlash over its handling of user personal information and its stance on running political ads (specifically, for not eliminating them entirely if they're found to be false). A record $5 billion fine paid to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) hasn't helped. Double-digit revenue growth that has consistently run north of 20% has been offset by much faster operating expense growth as Facebook updates its privacy and safety mechanisms. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe result is a stock that has failed to sustain positive traction since late 2017. So why buy Facebook now? \u00a0\nFor one, even as the undisputed leader of the social media industry, revenue generated by Facebook and its subsidiaries Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger continues to trudge higher. Management said to expect sales growth to again exceed 20% in 2020. And after heavy spending the last two years, operating expenses are also forecast to moderate this year, paving the way for even higher earnings-per-share growth. As of this writing, the stock trades at value pricing -- just 15.5 times one-year forward earnings. \u00a0\nLooking even further out, Facebook has a lot of irons in the fire. Those include its Oculus virtual reality business, new e-commerce tools to help connect sellers and buyers, and payment capabilities to help small businesses and individuals move money. Love it or hate it, there's a lot going for Facebook, and this is one of my favorite stocks to add to whenever I am looking to invest money for the long term.\u00a0\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNVIDIA: A chip designer for the future of computing\nSpeaking of companies that have massive long-term potential, graphics processing unit (GPU) leader NVIDIA also tops my list as a favorite long-term buy. The GPU designer is best known for its work powering high-end video game graphics, but the chips are so much more than that these days. Getting put to use as a computing accelerator, NVIDIA's wares can be found in advanced driver assist systems in cars and fueling autonomous vehicle innovation, healthcare imaging, robotics, and artificial intelligence in the cloud and in devices at the edge of networks. Put simply, this company has a world of possibility ahead of it.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA stock is a similar story to Facebook. After about a year of sales slump (the chip industry is a cyclical one, even for a high-growth company like NVIDIA), shares are trading for the same price as they were in 2018. The pace of innovation is on a tear, though, and NVIDIA's revenues are back in all-out expansion. Fiscal 2020 (12 months ended Jan. 26, 2020) sales ended down 7%, but fourth-quarter revenue notched a massive 41% rally from the comparable period a year ago. Even with supply chain constraints due to coronavirus, management said it was expecting another 35% year-over-year increase in the first quarter of the new year. \u00a0\nIt's all about the long haul for this technologist, though, and shares look like an especially attractive buy for those looking a decade down the road. NVIDIA stock is currently going for 27.7 times forward earnings -- a premium to be sure, but reasonable given the potential for this computing innovator. \u00a0\nOther odds and ends for a well-rounded investment\nAny portfolio should be diversified, so for the rest of my current buys, I'm opting for a strong consumer discretionary brand, a financial company for the 21st century, and some diversified real estate.\nTexas Roadhouse is one of my favorite restaurant stocks around -- even though earnings have been hit in the last year due to minimum wage increases. That's because, even though the industry is highly competitive and average comparable store sales (a blend of foot traffic and average guest ticket size) have been trending negative for a few years now, Roadhouse has been a consistent winner. It has been able to slowly grow its store count, and guest traffic continues to tick higher.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for the bottom line, it started to rebound during the fourth quarter of 2019 with a 45% increase. Pressure will no doubt continue in 2020 as labor cost continues to rise, but the bulk of the pain appears to be in the rear view mirror now. Plus, management continues to report positive guest traffic trends even as the restaurant industry heads the opposite direction. I also like the company's chances of bucking the coronavirus fears, as most of its stores are located in suburban areas. Going for just 15.9 times forward earnings per share, Roadhouse is a timely buy. \nHere's another timely buy: Square, which continues to put up 40%-plus sales growth but is trading near multi-year lows after the recent market sell-off. There are really two businesses at work here: Square, the network of point-of-sale and software tools to help small businesses accept digital payments and manage operations, and Cash App, the peer-to-peer money sharing and investment application for consumers.\nBoth are fast-growing finance businesses built for the 21st century, and at only 6.5 times trailing 12-month sales, Square stock looks like a serious bargain. That's especially so considering management's call for an increase of 26% in revenue in 2020. Investment into new features like business loans at Square Capital and Cash App features like investing in fractional shares of stock means this is a growth-now, profit-later business. However, the potential is there (gross profit margin was 40% last year and is still trending up as new users sign up to the platform) for some serious return down the road. \nMy final buy switches gears to the real estate front. In a world that seems to be favoring digital over physical, STORE Capital has been able to grow its portfolio of real estate with quality tenants. Favoring single-occupant long-term leases (average remaining non-cancellable term was 14 years at the end of 2019), the company is well-diversified with restaurants, retailers, health clubs, auto repair shops, and early childhood development centers. Properties are also more than 99% occupied, speaking to the efficiency of this real estate manager.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted funds from operations (or FFO, real estate's equivalent to earnings per share) rose 8% last year, and based on the company's expectation for at least another 3% increase in 2020, the stock is going for just 14.1 times adjusted FFO. It has a solid pipeline for further property acquisition, development, and lease signing, and should be a solid income yield play in the years to come. Speaking of which, post market drubbing, STORE pays a yearly dividend that yields 4.2%. \nFor those with $1,000 to invest right now, here's how I'm allocating to these stocks: One share each of Facebook and NVIDIA, four shares of Texas Roadhouse, three shares of Square, and six shares of STORE Capital. As of this writing, that leaves about $25 left in cash to be invested later or used as a personal reward (like lunch or ice cream!) for investing for the long-term even though it feels totally wrong to do so. Power through the tidal wave of bad news, and stay focused on the future potential of these businesses.\n\n\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The terms of the deal are not being disclosed.\nTitan IC has developed what is essentially an in-chip search engine that scans the data flowing through a company\u2019s network and finds items of interest. The technology, dubbed RXP, can be used to spot malicious traffic sent by hackers trying to stage a cyberattack. RXP is also capable of speeding up analytics workloads by helping applications find important pieces of\u00a0 information in data they process, like large transactions in a stream of e-commerce purchases.\nMellanox uses Titan IC\u2019s technology to power some of the features in its BlueField line of network adapters. Buying the firm will enable Mellanox to take ownership of a key component of its product portfolio and, in the longer term, align Titan IC\u2019s development roadmap more closely with its own.\u00a0\n\u201cThere are simply some things that we couldn\u2019t do as two separate companies that together we will be able to accomplish,\u201c Dror Golderberg, Mellanox\u2019s vice president of software architecture, wrote in a blog post. \u201cFirst and foremost, some development will be enabled simply as a matter of scale, focus, and opportunities for innovation.\u201d\n\u201cBoundaries between different IP interfaces can prevent the optimization of hardware accelerators across sub-systems, and as part of a single company these boundaries will be eliminated,\u201d Golderberg added.\nThe executive said Mellanox will work to apply\u00a0Titan IC\u2019s\u00a0chips\u00a0to use cases such as data center storage optimization, virtualization and artificial intelligence. AI is a major focus for Nvidia, which made a $6.9 billion bid to acquire Mellanox last year that\u2019s currently undergoing regulatory review.\nOn its website, Titan IC lists machine learning and deep learning among the workloads that can benefit its RXP technology. The firm claims that RXP allows models to filter unnecessary information out of the data they analyze to speed up processing.\nMellanox\u2019s purchase of Titan IC is the latest in a series of acquisitions involving major data center suppliers and niche network chip providers. In December, Cisco Systems Inc. picked up an Australian firm called Exablaze Pty. Ltd., which developed packet processing cards for the algorithmic stock trading sector. Previously, Arista Networks Inc. bought field programmable gate array maker Metamako Inc. for an undisclosed sum.\u00a0\nPhoto: Titan IC\n\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content. \u00a0\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\n\n\n\u201cTheCUBE\u00a0is an important partner to the industry.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GV100 (Image credit: Nvidia)According to a new DigiTimes report, Nvidia will be among one of the three major clients that will leverage TSMC's CoWoS packaging this year, with the other two being Xilinx and HiSilicon.CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate) is a 2.5D packaging technology that integrates multiple chiplets onto a single interposer. The list of primary benefits includes a much smaller footprint, increase in bandwidth and reduction in power consumption.\u00a0Speaking of CoWoS, TSMC in conjunction with Broadcom recently developed a gargantuan interposer that measures 1,700 mm\u00b2. In summary, the concept consists of binding multiple interconnected interposers together on a solo wafer. The new design is featured in an upcoming Broadcom HPC (high-performance computing) processor that's based on TSMC's EUV 5nm (N5) node. The improved CoWoS platform can house multiple system-on-chip (SoC) dies and up to six stacks of HBM high-bandwidth memory), totaling up to a whopping 96GB of memory. TSMC is touting a memory bandwidth up to 2.7 TBps, which is 2.7 times faster than the company's prior CoWoS platform that originated in 2016.CoWoS Platform (Image credit: TSMC)Coming back to Nvidia, the chipmaker is no stranger to CoWoS packaging. The technology is present on a number of high-end Titan, Quadro and Tesla graphics cards, dating back to the Pascal era. The GP100 (Pascal) and GV100 (Volta) silicons come out of TSMC's furnace and use CoWoS packaging. The first is based on the foundry's 16nm FinFET manufacturing process, while the latter profits from the 12nm node.AMD's Vega 20 7nm silicon is also packaged with CoWoS. DigiTimes didn't include AMD on its top three list, which means Nvidia, Xilinx and HiSilicon will ultimately gobble up TSMC's CoWoS production capacity. The foundry will reportedly pump out between 6,000 to 8,000 wafers per month so there should be enough product to go around.In any event, we don't expect Nvidia's consumer graphics cards to feature CoWoS technology due to the high costs that it would post to the consumer. The chipmaker will probably turn to CoWoS for its Quadro and Tesla offerings like in the past. Ampere is the codename for Nvidia's next-generation GPU architecture, but there hasn't been an indication that it will utilize a MCM (multi-chip module) design, though. Hopper, on the other hand, might rely on MCM.We've already seen a trio of mysterious Nvidia graphics cards sporting ginormous amounts of CUDA cores and memory. Although we're unsure of their nature, the unidentified graphics cards should make use of one of Nvidia's upcoming GPU architectures.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (1)\n\n\n\nZhiye LiuSocial Links NavigationNews Editor and Memory ReviewerZhiye Liu is a news editor and memory reviewer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

Today, NVIDIA announced on the GeForce Now forums that 2K Games has requested its titles be removed from the service.\"Per publisher request, please be advised 2K Games titles will be removed from GeForce NOW today,\" the statement reads. \"We are working with 2K Games to re-enable their games in the future.\"This follows a long list of other removals, as Activision Blizzard has pulled all of its games, The Long Dark has been removed and Bethesda Softworks has pulled every game except for Wolfenstein: Youngblood. By contrast, CD Projekt Red has confirmed that Cyberpunk 2077 will support the service on day one.GeForce Now: Everything you need to know\n\n\n\nGeForce Now\n\n\nFree at NVIDIA\nNVIDIA's cloud game streaming service is one of the best available today, delivering lag-free gaming at 1080p/60fps. The fact that you can access NVIDIA's servers for free makes it an easy sell, and the $4.99 plan makes it an immediately enticing option for seasoned gamers.\n\n\nGet the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nPC Gaming\nGaming\n\n\nSamuel TolbertSocial Links NavigationFreelance WriterSamuel Tolbert is a freelance writer covering gaming news, previews, reviews, interviews and different aspects of the gaming industry, specifically focusing on Xbox and PC gaming on Windows Central.

The whole point of DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) is that GPUs can process fewer pixels and then use AI to construct sharp, higher resolution images. This means faster, more efficient performance - and Nvidia believes it has made great strides towards this vision with DLSS 2.0.\n\nKey changes with DLSS 2.0 include; superior image quality, scaling across all RTX GPUs and resolutions, one AI network for all games, and a choice of three images quality modes. Tackling the first of these, Nvidia asserts that \"DLSS 2.0 offers image quality comparable to native resolution while rendering only one quarter to one half of the pixels.\" The graphics chip maker adds that \"new temporal feedback techniques,\" are employed by DLSS 2.0 and this produces sharper imagery with greater stability from frame to frame.\n\nAnother important change is that DLSS 2.0 is now more widely useable. All GeForce RTX GPUs and all resolutions can use the new tech. Furthermore, Nvidia claims its new AI network uses your Tensor cores \"to execute 2X faster than the original\". Nvidia DLSS 2.0 is now trained using non-game-specific content. This means faster game integrations and more DLSS games will emerge.\n\nControl graphics samples; DLSS 2.0 compared, click to zoom\nA control panel allows the end user to switch between 'Quality, Balanced, or Performance' modes of DLSS 2.0. These control the game's internal rendering resolution and in Performance mode, for example, the scaling factor is 4X which would render a game at 1080p and AI scale it to 2160p for your 4K UHD monitor.\n\nHappily this isn't just a paper launch and DLSS 2.0 is enabled by the latest Nvidia GeForce driver and a selection of games can already use the technology. Deliver Us The Moon, Wolfenstein: Youngblood, and MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries are all DLSS 2.0 enabled now and Control will receive a patch on Thursday to enable DLSS 2.0.\nIf you head on over to the Nvidia blog it talks about specific game performance with DLSS 2.0 on (with graphics comparing Quality, Balanced, and Performance modes), provides images samples, and some videos too. I've embedded a selection of these here too, above, for your convenience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 17 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

From cosmic worlds to extraterrestrial creatures, participants were asked to design renderings that captured what life could look like in our nearest galactic neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy.\u00a0\nArtists shared unique visions by 3D modeling and rendering still images that portrayed the future of intergalactic living. A group of esteemed judges selected the top submissions from four categories.\nThe first-place winners for each category are:\nUnknown Creatures: Matija Mladicek\n\nMladicek shared this rendered image of ostiophants, giant creatures roaming the vast deserts of a distant planet. This species is known for its long legs and elongated mandibles, which are used to forage for food from miles away.\n\nPlanet Perseus: Alben Tan\nTan designed this floating city surrounded by hovercrafts and inhabitants living high above the ground. The building designs are based on Mayan architecture, with tall, tree-like bases and bridges that connect one district to another.\n\nAirship Arrival: Alan Guyant\nGuyant shows his rendition of the finest skyliner in the galaxy, the USS Albatross. In this alternate future of Earth, this airship is the first to be powered by newly discovered antigravity technology. \n\nPlanet Perseus Intelligent Life: Adrian Baluta\n\nBaluta shared this design of Unknown-Gen75, a colorful, robotic character with an internal furnace that acts as its navigation technology.\n\nNVIDIA teamed with PNY Technologies, CGSociety, Substance by Adobe, Quadspinner, 80 Level and CGMA to provide winners with an astronomical lineup of prizes, including an NVIDIA Quadro 4000 GPU, Substance software and more.\nCheck out the other winners, including some of NVIDIA\u2019s favorites, on the CGSociety website.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: Quadro | Ray Tracing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

To help beat the disease, the Netherlands Cancer Institute, rated one of the top 10 comprehensive cancer centers in the world, is using virtualization to have its IT infrastructure work the late shift, as well.\nThe NKI, which consists of both research facilities and cancer clinics, has dual goals: to accelerate research, while also improving the efficiency and productivity of its physicians.\nWhether analyzing images to diagnose breast cancer or running DNA computations with large datasets, the institute relies on innovative, flexible technology to drive new discoveries in cancer research.\nTo keep up with the increasing needs of doctors and researchers, NKI upgraded to a state-of-the-art, software-defined infrastructure using NVIDIA virtual GPU technology powered by NVIDIA T4 GPUs and Hewlett Packard Enterprise DL380 Gen10 servers.\nDuring the day, this virtual desktop infrastructure provides healthcare professionals with fast, flexible and secure access to patient data. At night, researchers use the same VDI platform to run computationally intensive GPU workloads.\nWith this high-performance yet flexible IT infrastructure, healthcare professionals can spend more time focusing on patients, while researchers can advance breakthroughs in cancer treatment.\nVirtual Desktops Enhances Security and Mobility\nBefore NKI moved to a virtualized platform, doctors would handle patient data the old-fashioned way: working on physical desktops that stored local apps and information. The doctors would need to go to computer labs, manually log into the system, and open applications up to 20 times a day, a tedious and time-consuming process.\nMaintenance and security were challenging. A few times PCs had been stolen, so NKI wanted better security to protect sensitive patient information and research data.\nWith VDI, physicians can move around the hospital more freely. With workstations available in each room, they can log into a virtual desktop session in one part of the hospital, then easily move to another area and get right back into their session with a swipe of their badge.\nThis ability to quickly switch allows NKI\u2019s healthcare professionals to work much faster and more efficiently, providing clinicians with greater flexibility to move from one patient to another.\nThe VDI platform also stores all data in a safe, central environment rather than individual devices. Doctors and nurses who can securely access apps and information on mobile phones, tablets, at home or on the road.\n\nvGPUs Bring More Power, Speed to Research\u00a0\nNKI\u2019s new infrastructure is made up of 78 HPE servers, each with three NVIDIA T4 GPUs, to provide doctors and researchers with massive GPU power for computations like DNA or image analysis.\nIts clinics are busiest during the day. But most users log off in the evening, freeing up a majority of the GPU resources for cancer research. With virtualization, researchers can repurpose the T4 GPUs that aren\u2019t in use for running complex compute workloads at night.\n\u201cBefore, it would take a week for researchers to get their photos analyzed at an imaging facility,\u201d said Roel Sijstermans, IT manager at NKI. \u201cWith the new virtual GPU infrastructure, we can send the pictures in the evening and the images will be finished by the morning.\u201d\nWith data being processed overnight, researchers can analyze breast cancer tumors or increase image quality at a faster rate than before, giving doctors more time to plan their care for patients.\nRegister now for GTC Digital to learn more about the Netherlands Cancer Institute and how virtualization is changing the future of healthcare.\nLearn more about how NVIDIA solutions help you work virtually or remotely.\n\n\nCategories: Graphics Virtualization | Pro GraphicsTags: Healthcare and Life Sciences | Social Impact | Virtualization \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Within thirty days, major indexes have dropped by 25%+, despite government assurances of economic stimulus through packages.\nIn a fireside chat today, NVIDIA Corporation's management shed light on the company's current operating environment, the impact from coronavirus on its first quarter\u00a0of FY2020, China's recovery and other pressing concerns.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total CostNVIDIA Provides Update On COVID-19: Reports In Recovery China, Growth In Laptop Demand, PC Gaming Supply Chain Improvement While Reiterating $50 Billion Datacenter TAM\nStarting from NVIDIA's operating environment, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress reported today that demand for laptops is picking up, particularly in China. As the number of infections from COVID-19 now peaks in Europe, the East Asian country is recovering economically. This recovery, for NVIDIA, is joined by the U.S. and Europe in driving up demand for products covering all ends of its stack.\nNVIDIA's supply-side for these products is also improving, but with a caveat that should hinder its ability to capture the aforementioned demand surge. The company today reports that supply chains will have recovered in the range of 70% to 80% at the end of this quarter, and the bulk of this recovery will be focused on the personal computing segment of its revenue.\nSo naturally, once NVIDIA and retailers run out of inventory for mobility products, and the mobility (laptop) supply chain does not recover along the lines of the personal computing supply chain, the company will face headwinds in catering to the demand surge from COVID-19.\n\nIncreased user reliance on the internet for their work and entertainment needs, coupled with an uptick in workload-heavy inferencing task demand is helping NVIDIA in this quarter. As per Ms. Kress, NVIDIA is witnessing a benefit from COVID-19 disruptions in:\n\nLaptops.\nMobile and virtual GPUs.\nDesktops\nWorkstations\nInternet, cloud and hyperscale platforms.\n\nNVIDIA also confirmed an uptick in demand for accelerated methods driven by healthcare and through the use of vectors, natural language processing and conversational artificial intelligence in models.\nThe company also maintains its current estimate of a $50 billion total addressable market for Datacenter. This estimate is for the end of the year 2023, with NVIDIA's estimates of the market size for the end of this year stand in at $30 billion according to statements made on its investor day 2018.\nNVIDIA Corporation maintained a total addressable market (TAM) estimate of $50 billion for Datacenter products at today's fireside chat. An earlier breakdown of the market provided at last year's analyst day segregates this into $10 billion for HPC, $20 billion for hyperscale and $$20 billion for cloud computing and related industries.\nNVIDIA expects laptop inventories to not exhibit significant problems due to build up for Chinese New Year\nNVIDIA's CFO sounded relaxed when questioned about the company's balance sheet and its importance in running operations during current conditions. The executive believes that demand in Datacenter and Gaming products will help her company navigate through these few months, as NVIDIA's top priority, for the time being, is to ensure that all supply needs will be met, which is crucial if the company is to capitalize on the shift in purchases resulting from the coronavirus impact.\nFurther commenting on NVIDIA's current situation on the ground, Senior Vice President of NVIDIA's personal computing business Jeff Fisher stated today that his company is finding it easier to handle supply constraints for desktops as opposed to for mobility products (notebooks).\nAccording to him, even though laptop demand has been strong, the company does not expect inventories to exhibit significant problems; due to higher levels as NVIDIA headed into the Chinese New Year.\nMr. Fisher also highlighted today that trends witnessed in gaming and other high-performance product needs have increased demand for workstation\u00a0laptops in particular. At the same time, NVIDIA is also replenishing inventory for desktop products, but based on statements made by the company's management today, it continues to monitor inventory levels stringently.\n\nConsoles will stimulate installed-base for hardware-accelerated ray tracing believes company\nNVIDIA's network of iCafe partners in China shut down their facilities due to restrictions and according to the latest data, roughly one-fifth of traffic to these locations has returned following China's coronavirus recovery. The personal computing executive also stated today that his company's Etail product delivery platforms helped counter the drop in retail sales in China following government lockdowns, and the channels are now exhibiting similar trends in North America and Europe.\nNVIDIA's VP also provided important statistics for cloud-based game streaming. According to his figures, a staggering\u00a080%\u00a0of GeForce Now customers utilize low power platforms for using the service. Mr. Fisher also believes that gaming sessions for GeForce Now customers have grown in length this month.\nThe company's data also suggests that a big chunk of its user base is unable to meet 144 frames-per-second framerates, and the need to boost this and reduce latency for heavier titles due soon will require this chunk of users to migrate to the higher-end of NVIDIA's stack. 15% of NVIDIA's installed base has migrated to Turing, state today's disclosures, and the company believes that its Turing microarchitecture's ramp has outpaced Pascal.\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) also believes that the installed base for hardware-accelerated raytracing will grow following the launch of next-generation gaming consoles by Sony Interactive and Microsoft Corporation.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n87\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n59\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\n\n\n16\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\n\n\n16\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve Rumored To Launch SteamOS For Desktop PCs Soon; Is Time For A Bloatware-Free OS Near?\n\n\n\n14\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1528\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1285\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\n\n\n783\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Ahead of the online event, Nvidia teased an announcement on Twitter, then spurred further interest when the tweet was deleted.The tweet came from @NvidiaANZ, the company's official Twitter handle for news and announcements in Australia and New Zealand. The folks at eTeknix managed to take a screen grab before it was removed, which consisted of a date (March 19, 2020) an eyeball emoji, and an interesting black and white animation.While it's no longer available to view, the animation appeared to depict an eyeball tracking two points of light crossing over the iris. There's been some speculation that this could somehow be related to Nvidia's next-generation Ampere GPU, though TechPowerUp brings up the possibility of it actually pointing to a technique called foveated rendering.It could technically be both, though the latter is more plausible. Foveated rendering is something Nvidia demonstrated at SIGGRAPH 2016. It's basically an eye-tracking technique to make rendering scenes in virtual reality less demanding on hardware.\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\nWatch On \n\"Each new increase in the resolution of head-mounted displays (HMDs) means an increase in the number of pixels that the GPU must render. \u00a0To maintain a fluid VR experience, we must continue to find new ways to optimize VR rendering performance. \u00a0The emergence of HMDs with integrated eye tracking offers a new way of improving both perceived visual quality and performance, since the human eye perceives visual quality differently across the field of vision,\" Nvidia explained in a blog post from 2019.Nvidia points out that the human eye only notices \"maximum details\" in the fovea, a very narrow region of the eye. Peripheral vision is less detailed and typically blurred.\"VRS [variable rate shading] foveated rendering takes advantage of this quirk of human perception to render with higher-quality at the gaze location while rendering at reduced quality in the peripheral region,\" Nvidia says.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Nvidia's deleted tweet may have been teasing a commercial launch of foveated rendering, whether in relation to Ampere or not.

In fact, thanks to this, we learned that NVIDIA is working on an adjustable sharpness setting for DLSS as mentioned on this GitHub page (access requires linking of GitHub and Epic Games accounts).\nWhy doesn't r.NGX.DLSS.Sharpness doesn't seem to have any effect?\n\nWe are currently hard at work calibrating the user-adjustable sharpness setting to combine well with the internal sharpness value produced by DLSS's deep neural networks, in order to consistently deliver a high-quality output while still giving the user a significant level of flexibility over the amount of sharpening they want applied. It is currently available as a debug feature in non-production DLSS builds, but is disabled by default.\n\n\nWe can see that in the image below, too, taken from the development tool.\n\nIn fact, NVIDIA's Edward Liu (Senior Research Scientist at NVIDIA Applied Deep Learning Research) confirmed on Twitter that the setting could have been made available in Control already if only there was a menu option for it. Following a user's request, Liu also relayed the feedback to the team, which makes us hopeful to see that option added in the game with a patch.\nAfter all, more options are always welcome to PC gamers.\n\nI relayed your feedback to the relevant team.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: TechRadar)\n\n\n\n\nIf new rumors are to be believed, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti could launch by the end of 2020, and will be up to 40% faster than its predecessor, the RTX 2080 Ti.The new rumors come courtesy of KittyCorgi on Twitter. Now, bear in mind that this is a relatively new Twitter account with very few followers, so take this all with a pinch of salt, but the account is posting what looks like detailed information on Nvidia\u2019s upcoming Ampere series of graphics cards.Nvidia\u2019s next-gen GeForce graphics cards could launch at GTC and be on sale in AprilThese are the best Nvidia GPUs of 2020A massive Nvidia graphics card just leaked: is this the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080?According to the tweets, which you can see below, the Ampere series of GPUs will feature five different graphics cards, and all will offer ray tracing capabilities for advanced, life-like, lighting effects in games, so even the more affordable models of Nvidia\u2019s next generation graphics cards will be able to handle ray tracing.They will all apparently use Samsung\u2019s 10nm process as well.1 Surprisingly, the next gen chip will be based on Samsung 10nm node\n2 Not very solid about what GA102 really got, may struggle to be 40% above 2080ti, but bound to be under that number if compared against full bore TU102\n3 SLi will be available to GA102 ONLY\n4 RTX for everyone pic.twitter.com/b5YAKmOmgfMarch 11, 2020What GPUs is Nvidia cooking up?According to the leak, there will be an Nvidia GA102 GPU, which will be the flagship Ampere followup to the TU102 GPU which is found in the RTX Titan and RTX 2080 Ti graphics cards, so the assumption is that this would power the next-generation Titan and GeForce RTX 3080 Ti (or whatever it will be called).The leak suggests this will come with 5376 CUDA cores, an increase of 16% on the TU102 in the RTX Titan, and would support up to 12GB of memory with a 384-bit bus interface.There\u2019s speculation that an Ampere Titan card, which would be the best-of-the-best consumer graphics card, as Titan cards usually are, would use the full amount of CUDA cores, while an RTX 3080 Ti would use fewer.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The leaker also suggests that the GA102 GPU will be up to 40% faster than the RTX 2080 Ti.Next up is the GA103 GPU, which would apparently power the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080, with 3840 CUDA cores, a big increase over the RTX 2080\u2019s 3072 CUDA cores, and 320-bit bus interface, which could mean it comes with 10GB or 20GB of GDDR6 memory.\u00a0Even if it goes for the lesser 10GB amount, that would still be 2GB more than the RTX 2080, and could lead to a performance boost of about 10% compared with the RTX 2080.The leak also talks about the GA104, which could go into an RTX 3070, and what\u2019s interesting about this is that if the RTX 3070 does exist, it could offer 95% the performance of the RTX 2080 Ti. The RTX 3070 would likely be a much cheaper card as well \u2013 as Wccftech point out, this could lead to a $500 graphics card in the future offering the performance of a current $1,200 card. If true, that could be very exciting.There are also apparently going to be GA106 and GA107 GPUs, which will be aimed at mainstream and budget markets, and as we mentioned above, they will still offer ray tracing capabilities.Again, we should stress that these are all unconfirmed rumors, but they certainly are exciting. Although Nvidia has cancelled its GTC 2020 keynote, which was where many of us expected to hear more about its next gen GPU plans, including perhaps an unveiling of Ampere, we should still get news from Nvidia on March 24, which will hopefully include more information about the new graphics cards it will release this year.These are the best graphics cards you can currently buy\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nMatt HansonSocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, Core TechMatt is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Core Tech, looking after computing and mobile technology.

Here\u2019s whyThe cloud gaming service is controversial among developers. Here\u2019s whyby  Nick StattMar 2, 2020, 6:12 PM UTCLinkFacebookThreadsImage: NvidiaNick Statt is a Senior Producer on Decoder. Previously, he reported on the technology and gaming industries for more than a decade.Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now took yet another hit this weekend with a new publisher pulling its software from the cloud gaming service. That\u2019s because GeForce Now, unlike competing services like Google Stadia, lets anyone who purchases a digital game on Valve\u2019s Steam marketplace reinstall it on a virtual machine and play it using its cloud platform.That doesn\u2019t sit well with some game publishers and developers, including Raphael van Lierop, the game director and writer of indie hit The Long Dark from his company Hinterland Studio. Lierop pulled his game over the weekend, displeased that it was included in the paid version of GeForce Now without his explicit permission.We\u2019ve seen this before; Activision Blizzard and Bethesda have pulled their games from GeForce Now, presumably for similar reasons. I say presumably because neither of those giant publishers has explicitly stated why they did so, and just what about GeForce Now they find dissatisfying. In Activision Blizzard\u2019s case, there was a licensing dispute we are aware of, and there\u2019s the matter of Nvidia not re-acquiring permission to use its titles once it began charging $5 a month for the public trial of GeForce Now early last month.Game publishers are pulling titles from GeForce Now left and rightThe publishers have given vague statements, leading many to surmise that it may be due to the lack of a revenue split or the fact that big game publishers would rather charge customers a second time for a separate license to play a game on a cloud gaming service, regardless of how it\u2019s structured. Stadia, for instance, charges customers for games even if you own them on Steam already, and a lot of big publishers have signed up under those terms. But again, these are assumptions. The developers haven\u2019t spoken at length about the disputes, and Nvidia has politely obliged when it comes to removing games because its service appears to depend on the goodwill of participating developers.But van Lierop, on the other hand, is the first self-publishing indie developer to jump publicly into the GeForce Now controversy, and he stated plainly what his issues are. \u201cSorry to those who are disappointed you can no longer play #thelongdark on GeForce Now. Nvidia didn\u2019t ask for our permission to put the game on the platform so we asked them to remove it,\u201d he wrote on Twitter over the weekend. \u201cPlease take your complaints to them, not us. Devs should control where their games exist.\u201dLater on, van Lierop wrote, \u201cToday\u2019s world is getting complex for devs, with lots of platform changes and shifts to streaming, so devs have to be able to plan a strategy for how their games will appear and where, as a means of running a business. All the platforms acknowledge this.\u201d He said Hinterland would reconsider putting The Long Dark on GeForce Now in the future, but right now, he doesn\u2019t like the current situation.This argument confused many onlookers, especially those who currently use or are considering using GeForce Now. Why would a game developer get to dictate the hardware its games are played on, and why would Nvidia need permission to make games a customer has already purchased on Steam available on a virtual machine? These are not trivial questions. In fact, the answers are critical to understanding the ongoing controversy with GeForce Now and how important it will be to the future of the cloud gaming sector. The thread Lierop inadvertently kicked off by stating his plain thoughts on the matter is actually quite insightful, and I recommend everyone read it to get an even better understanding of what\u2019s going on here.\u201cDevs have to be able to plan a strategy for how their games will appear and where, as a means of running a business.\u201dEffectively, there are two sides to the controversy \u2014 one in favor of the game maker and one in favor of the customer \u2014 and both have merits. For game developers and publishers, a digital game is not the same as a physical good you can do what you want with, including resell it. A digital game is a license to use a virtual good in a way stipulated by licensing agreements, both from the maker of the game and from the marketplace that sells it, in this case Steam. (This, of course, is ignoring the fact that physical games also have these license agreements so you can\u2019t, say, burn one to a Blu-ray and sell it on eBay. You can, however, sell a physical game back to GameStop and that is legal.)A license to play a game does not mean another company can redistribute it, even if you personally bought the license. That\u2019s what happening with GeForce Now, and it\u2019s important to understand that. Nvidia isn\u2019t just renting you a virtual machine. It\u2019s renting you a virtual machine and then redistributing a video game sold by Steam under agreements that do not include Nvidia, at least not yet. It is not just a hardware rental service, and pretending it is one is disingenuous.Nvidia is effectively injecting itself into the sale and distribution of a piece of software. We\u2019ve seen this time and again with companies that have hoped to similarly disrupt distribution, from failed over-the-air broadcast TV streamer Aereo to theater subscription plan MoviePass. It rarely works, because the companies either face steep fees out of fear of getting sued, their business plan is unsustainable, or because they go ahead without permission and get litigated into the ground. Strong-arming a new distribution model into reality is expensive and adversarial, and only a few companies, like Apple with iTunes, can successfully say they pulled it off.GeForce Now complicates choices for developers like mobile ports and exclusivitySo even if it doesn\u2019t seem Nvidia is doing something similar here, legally it is. This is precisely why Steam runs its PC Caf\u00e9 Program, a bulk licensing service so gaming cafes can acquire the rights to host software that its customers may have already paid for. This is also why many developers choose to use their own PC launchers; doing so affords them freedom to control how the game is distributed even more tightly. That\u2019s important for things like piracy, copyright infringement, and cheating, but also for protecting the intellectual property from being redistributed in ways the company doesn\u2019t like.One good example of a downside of GeForce Now is mobile ports. What developer would put resources toward developing a competent mobile port of their game, with hopes to resell it to a new audience to recoup investment on the port and make some profit, if GeForce Now is available on mobile (it\u2019s already on Android) and completely obviates the need to pay for the mobile version? A service like GeForce Now complicates that for developers, and as van Lierop points out, \u201cthe most customer-friendly thing you can do as a dev, is run a sustainable business so that you can support your game and your customers into the future.\u201d He goes on to say, \u201cControlling your own content is key to that.\u201dAnother big issue is that GeForce Now complicates exclusivity agreements. How can you ensure an exclusivity agreement on, say, console or through Epic Game Store if the game can be easily reproduced through GeForce Now on any screen? Cloud gaming with absolutely no restrictions would start dictating an important aspect of developers\u2019 financial future.Nvidia doesn\u2019t dispute its role here. It published a blog post last month tackling the issues head on, writing, \u201cAs we approach a paid service, some publishers may choose to remove games before the trial period ends. Ultimately, they maintain control over their content and decide whether the game you purchase includes streaming on GeForce Now.\u201d Nvidia said it expects these game removals to be \u201cfew and far between,\u201d but it acknowledges the developers\u2019 right to choose whether to participate.Now, here\u2019s the counter argument, from the consumer perspective. Why would any company take issue with GeForce Now? What developer wouldn\u2019t want to support this? It seems like a no-brainer, right. If the customer has already purchased the game, let them play it wherever they want. And if they don\u2019t like it, well, Nvidia shouldn\u2019t need their permission anyway. As one commenter on Twitter put it, \u201cI would ask why should a studio be allowed to dictate where I am allowed to install and play a game I have purchased.\u201d That\u2019s a sound argument.This argument is also not as complicated as the other side. It is undoubtedly much more consumer-friendly to let someone play a game they\u2019ve already purchased on whatever screen they choose. In an ideal world, Nvidia wouldn\u2019t need permission and developers wouldn\u2019t take issue with it in the first place. Cloud gaming would just be a new way to enjoy the games we already paid for.But this ideal world also stipulates that things like piracy don\u2019t exist, or that companies never take advantage of one another or try to drive their competitors out of big business. It is also a world that ignores how complicated and potentially fraught gaming distribution is about to get, when cloud gaming and subscription services combine (hello xCloud) into what very well may be the future of how all video games are played, regardless of the hardware they run on.Game developers are afraid of losing control of their destinyIn this world, if developers don\u2019t keep tight control over their intellectual property and how it is distributed, they will lose the ability to control their destiny. That\u2019s scary for creators whose financial well-being is determined by how many copies they sell. It\u2019s unfair to assume that opening the floodgates for third-party companies to do whatever they want with your software would magically work out well for all parties involved. It is well within van Lierop\u2019s right not to be a guinea pig in that experiment.That\u2019s not to say that this is the cloud gaming future we want. It\u2019s not. Having to buy games twice would be a real shame. Having to rely on subscription services to be as well-funded and robust as Xbox Game Pass, which is financed by one of the world\u2019s most successful software companies, to ensure developers can get paid in the future isn\u2019t a great situation, either. A world where a developer goes out of business because they can only sell a limited number of copies on Steam \u2014 due to cloud gaming making it available everywhere else for free \u2014 is not what anyone should want.Cloud gaming promises to make any piece of gaming software available at all times on any screen, and that remains a very exciting prospect. But it has a lot of economic complexity, and the only way that gets ironed out is through negotiation and by both consumers and platform providers understanding what\u2019s at stake. Right now, Nvidia\u2019s \u201cask for forgiveness, but not permission\u201d strategy is irking game developers, and for good reason. Until this is no longer an experiment, permission should be required.See More: TechEntertainmentGamingNvidiaPC GamingReportMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

And a gaming-related announcement, no less. This morning NVIDIA is finally taking the wraps off of their DLSS 2.0 technology, which the company is shipping as a major update to their earlier AI-upscaling tech.\nResponding to both competitive pressure and the realization of their own technology limitations, the latest iteration of NVIDIA\u2019s upscaling technology is a rather significant overhaul of the technique. While NVIDIA is still doing AI upscaling at a basic level, DLSS 2.0 is no longer a pure upscaler; NVIDIA is now essentially combining it with temporal anti-aliasing. The results, NVIDIA is promising, is both better image quality than DLSS 1.0, as well as faster integration within individual games by doing away with per-game training.\nAs a quick refresher, Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) was originally released around the launch of the Turing (GeForce RTX 20 series) generation in the fall of 2018. DLSS was NVIDIA\u2019s first major effort to use their rapidly growing experience in AI programming and AI hardware to apply the technology to image quality in video games. With all of their GeForce RTX cards shipping with tensor cores, what better way to put them to use than to use them to improve image quality in games in a semi-abstracted manner? It was perhaps a bit of a case of a hammer in search of a nail, but the fundamental idea was reasonable, especially as 4K monitors get cheaper and GeForce 2080 Tis do not.\n\nUnfortunately, DLSS 1.0 never quite lived up to its promise. NVIDIA took a very image-centric approach to the process, relying on an extensive training program that involved creating a different neural network for each game at each resolution, training the networks on what a game should look like by feeding them ultra-high resolution, 64x anti-aliased images. In theory, the resulting networks should have been able to recognize how a more detailed world should work, and produce cleaner, sharper images accordingly.\nSometimes this worked well. More often the results were mixed. NVIDIA primarily pitched the technology as a way to reduce the rendering costs of higher resolutions \u2013 that is, rendering a game at a lower resolution and then upscaling \u2013 with a goal of matching a game\u2019s native resolution with temporal anti-aliasing. The end results would sometimes meet or beat this goal, and at other times an image would still be soft and lacking detail, revealing its lower-resolution origins. And all the while it took a lot of work to add DLSS to a game: every game and every resolution supported required training yet another neural network. Meanwhile, a simple upscale + sharpening filter could deliver a not-insignificant increase in perceived image quality with only a fraction of the work and GPU usage.\nEnter DLSS 2.0\nWhile DLSS 1.0 was pure, in retrospect it was perhaps a bit na\u00efve. As NVIDIA plainly states now, DLSS 1.0 was hard to work with because it hinged on the idea that video games are deterministic \u2013 that everything would behave in a pre-defined and predictable manner. In reality games aren\u2019t deterministic, and even if AI characters do the same thing every time, second-order effects like particles and the like can be off doing their own thing. As a result it was difficult to train DLSS 1.0 networks, which needed this determinism to improve, let alone applying them to games.\n\nSo for their second stab at AI upscaling, NVIDIA is taking a different tack. Instead of relying on individual, per-game neural networks, NVIDIA has built a single generic neural network that they are optimizing the hell out of. And to make up for the lack of information that comes from per-game networks, the company is making up for it by integrating real-time motion vector information from the game itself, a fundamental aspect of temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) and similar techniques. The net result is that DLSS 2.0 behaves a lot more like a temporal upscaling solution, which makes it dumber in some ways, but also smarter in others.\n\nThe single biggest change here is of course the new generic neural network. Looking to remove the expensive per-game training and the many (many) problems that non-deterministic games presented in training, NVIDIA has moved to a single generic network for all games. This newer neural network is based on a fully synthetic training set rather than individual games, which in turn is fully deterministic, allowing NVIDIA to extensively train the new network in exactly fashion they need for it to iterate and improve over generations. According to NVIDIA, this new network is also faster to execute on the GPU as well, reducing the overhead from using DLSS to begin with.\nBesides eliminating per-game training times and hassling developers on determinism, the other upshot for NVIDIA is that the generic network gives them more resolution scaling options. NVIDIA can now upscale frames by up to 4x in resolution \u2013 from 1080p input to 4K \u2013 both allowing DLSS 2.0 to be used with a wider range of input/output resolutions, and allowing it to be more strongly used, for lack of a better term. DLSS 1.0, by contrast, generally targeted a 2x upscale.\nThis new flexibility also means that NVIDIA is now offering multiple DLSS quality modes, trading off the internal rendering resolution (and thus image quality) for more performance. Those modes are performance, balanced, and quality.\nOtherwise, the actual network training process hasn\u2019t entirely changed. NVIDIA is still training against 16K images, with the goal of teaching the neural network as much about quality as possible. And this is still being executed as neural networks via the tensor cores as well, though I\u2019m curious to see if DLSS 2.0 pins quite as much work to the tensor cores as 1.0 did before it.\nThe catch to DLSS 2.0, however, is that this still requires game developer integration, and in a much different fashion. Because DLSS 2.0 relies on motion vectors to re-project the prior frame and best compute what the output image should look like, developers now need to provide those vectors to DLSS. As many developers are already doing some form of temporal AA in their games, this information is often available within the engine, and merely needs to be exposed to DLSS. None the less, it means that DLSS 2.0 still needs to be integrated on a per-game basis, even if the per-game training is gone. It is not a pure, end-of-chain post-processing solution like FXAA or combining image sharpening with upscaling.\nPast that, it should be noted that NVIDIA is still defining DLSS resolutions the same way they were before; which is to say, they are talking about the output resolution rather than the input resolution. So 1080p Quality mode, for example, would generally mean the internal rendering resolution is one-half the output resolution, or 1280x720 being upscaled to 1920x1080. And Performance mode, I\u2019m told, would be a 4x upscale.\n\nMeanwhile, it goes without saying that the subject of image upscaling and enhancements has been a hot topic since the introduction of DLSS, as well as AMD\u2019s more recent efforts to counter it with Radeon Image Sharpening. So NVIDIA is hitting the ground running, as it were, on promoting DLSS 2.0.\nIn fact \u201cpromotion\u201d is perhaps the key word for today. While NVIDIA is only finally announcing DLSS 2.0 today and outlining how it works, the company has already been shipping it to game developers for a bit. Both Deliver Us the Moon and Wolfenstein: Youngblood are already shipping with DLSS 2.0. And now that NVIDIA is happy with the state of the now field-tested technology, they are moving on to rolling it out to gamers and game-developers as a whole, including integrating it into Unreal Engine 4.\nAlong with the aforementioned games, both Control and MechWarrior 5 are getting DLSS 2.0 updates. Control in particular will be an interesting case, as it\u2019s the only game in this set that also had a DLSS 1.x implementation, meaning that it can be used as a control to judge the image quality differences. Even NVIDIA is going that far to demonstrate some of the quality improvements.\n\nAs for performance, NVIDIA is generally promising similar performance figures as DLSS 1.0. This means the comparable Quality mode may be a bit slower than DLSS 1.0 in games like Control, but overall that Quality mode and its one-half rendering resolution should deliver significant speed gains over native resolution games. All the while the resulting image quality should be better than what DLSS 1.0 could deliver. NVIDIA is even touting DLSS 2.0 as offering better image quality than native resolution games, though setting aside for the moment the subjective nature of image quality, it may not be quite an apples-to-apples comparison depending on what post-processing effects developers are using (e.g. replacing a very blurry TAA filter with DLSS 2.0).\n\nAt any rate, DLSS 2.0 is now officially available today. Updates for Control and MechWarrior 5 will be shipping this week, and if NVIDIA gets its way, more games will soon follow.\nGallery: NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 Press Deck\n\n\n                Source:\n                NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n30 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nArbie - Monday, March 23, 2020 - link\nIs this for Turing only?

Will probably not be backported for the handful of nutters gaming on GV100 either. \n\n\n\nDragonstongue - Monday, March 23, 2020 - link\n\"technically\" does not require Tensor cores as AMD is \"able\" to do raytracing as well, obviously they not have Tensor at all, unless they got the \"go ahead\" from Ngreedia to use when it comes time for PS5 Xbox S Next etc.. which I highly doubt.That being said,  NV has never been in the habit of \"back\" support old product with newest features, would cut into their sales of the more $$$$ product lining pockets (they are in a business, I get it, but still) Pascal \"overall\" good-great performance given power use, Turing for the most part took quite the hit power use wise (though faster a chunk) from these specialized Tensor cores.odd they could not figure out how to make the \"shaders\" be able to do this stuff without requiring specialized \"units\" to do this, might have kept power use more manageable..something along those lines anyways??\n\n\n\nUnashamed_unoriginal_username_x86 - Monday, March 23, 2020 - link\nThis hurts to read.

It\u2019s a good thing because the industry is accelerating as quickly as a Tesla.\nThe autonomous driving future is among the more recent challenges for Nvidia, which started in the gaming industry. But the technology company is at the forefront of delivering solutions to automakers for self-driving cars, infotainment, digital instrument clusters, rear-seat entertainment and advanced driver assistance systems.\nDany Shapiro discusses Nvidia and the 2020 GTC Technology Conference in this episode of The Weekly Driver Podcast.\nNot much of the ever-changing automotive technology world won\u2019t be examined in Nvidia\u2019s GTC GTU Technology Conference. It\u2019s just that this year, it will be a virtual conference.\nConference organizers, citing the uncertainty of the coronavirus, have changed the conference into a digital presentation rather than a live event. The event was scheduled March 22-26 at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center.\nDetails are pending, but conference spokesperson Dave Jasmin said the keynote speech, as well as other presentation details, will be posted on the website www.nvidia.com. Refunds will be applicable.\nThe digital conference will address the same issue. What and where is the future of autonomous driving? How safe is it? How intense is the competition in the Silicon Valley marketplace and China, the industry\u2019s international hub?\n\u201cIncredible advancements are going on in the transportation industry, but it\u2019s not just cars,\u201d said Shapiro of the pending gathering of industry experts who\u2019ll discuss all things related to the future of autonomous vehicles.\n\u201cIt\u2019s trucks, construction vehicles, agriculture, mining and transportation of goods, delivery, etc. It\u2019s the future of these vehicles that could have no pedals.\u201d\nSince 2014, Nvidia has diversified its business focusing on four markets: gaming, professional visualization, data centers and auto. Nvidia is also now focused on artificial intelligence.\nIn addition to manufacturing, Nvidia provides parallel processing capabilities to researchers and scientists that allow them to efficiently run high-performance applications. They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world.\nA more than 25-year veteran of the computer graphics and semiconductor industries, Shapiro has degrees in electrical engineering, computer science and business administration from Princeton and UC Berkeley.\nHe\u2019s keen on the solutions that will enable faster and better design of automobiles, as well as in-vehicle solutions for infotainment, navigation and driver assistance.\n\u201cWe are working with a number of companies who are developing what\u2019s being called Robotaxis,\u201d said Shapiro. \u201cThink of it as your Uber or Lyft but there\u2019s nobody behind the wheel. You will summon it with an app and it will show up.\n\u201cYou will be able to get inside and it will take you where you need to go. These vehicles are going to safer than any human driver vehicle. They are no point to get distracted or drowsy. There\u2019s no driving under the influence.\u201d\nWhile manufacturers \u2014 Toyota to Volvo to Mercedes-Benz \u2014 have been involved in the future of autonomous driving for years, Shapiro echos what other industry analysts believe. Introducing the concept to the driving public is a more difficult task than first anticipated.\n\u201cThe industry and the reports in the media really underestimated the complexity of what we are trying to solve,\u201d said Shapiro. \u201cIt is a massive computing problem. It\u2019s a massive artificial intelligence challenge. I think the original estimates were a little aggressive.

It employs new temporal feedback techniques for sharper image details and improved stability from frame to frame.\nGreat Scaling Across All GeForce RTX GPUs and Resolutions \u2013 A new AI network more efficiently uses Tensor Cores to execute 2X faster than the original. This improves frame rates and eliminates previous limitations on which GPUs, settings, and resolutions could be enabled.\nOne Network For All Games \u2013 The original DLSS required training the AI network for each new game. DLSS 2.0 trains using non-game-specific content, delivering a generalized network that works across games. This means faster game integrations, and ultimately more DLSS games.\nCustomizable Options \u2013 DLSS 2.0 offers users 3 image quality modes \u2013 Quality, Balanced, Performance \u2013 that control the game\u2019s internal rendering resolution, with Performance mode enabling up to 4X super resolution (i.e. 1080p \u2192 4K). This means more user choice, and even bigger performance boosts.\n\n\n\n\n \nDLSS 2.0 In Pictures: Enhanced Image Quality Arrives\nRather than further reporting on NVIDIA\u2019s explanation of DLSS 2.0 and its technical changes from the initial version, let\u2019s have a look at the images presented in the presentation about this new version.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe side-by-side DLSS / DLSS 2.0 comparisons in particular paint a compelling picture of the image quality improvements:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd perhaps the most impressive A/B comparison \u2013 objects in motion (a video is also available here):\n \n\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these slides show DLSS 2.0 using the new \u201cQuality Mode\u201d. That choice makes perfect sense, but performance will be naturally be higher with the lower quality settings \u2013 which use a lower internal resolution. In a nutshell, the best performance uses a 4x upscale, and the best quality uses only a 2x upscale.\n \nWhat A Difference A Year Makes\nNVIDIA\u2019s DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) technology hasn\u2019t had the best reputation up to this point, with still image analysis (professional and amateur) that pinpointed image quality concerns, and less technical complaints from the gaming community about \u201cblurriness\u201d.\u201dDLSS saves performance, but sacrifices visuals\u201d proclaimed Digital Foundry in their February 2019 analysis of Metro Exodus, and NVIDIA responded with an FAQ addressing some of the concerns which (besides further explaining how DLSS works) essentially re-stated what NVIDIA had been saying all along: DLSS is an emerging technology, and would improve over time.\nThe fact that DLSS was originally presented as a sort of AI-assisted form of AA (anti-aliasing) that existed as an alternative to TAA probably caused additional confusion, as DLSS was really a method to upscale lower-resolution content to reduce the performance impact of real-time ray tracing. It did accomplish this, certainly, but the upscaling question was still being pondered when 3DMark\u2019s updated technical guide (PDF) brought at least one implementation to light:\n \n\n\nFrom a look at NVIDIA\u2019s early developer news it was indicated from the beginning that this was a technique involving an end result that begins with a lower internal resolution: \u201cDLSS provides a new way of achieving higher display resolutions without the cost of rendering every pixel in the traditional sense\u201d.\nRegardless of how we got here, it seems that NVIDIA has addressed concerns from the first version of DLSS, and remains committed to improving the technology.\n \nDLSS 2.0 Enabled Games (So Far)\nA new version doesn\u2019t do much good if there aren\u2019t any games taking advantage of it, and of course NVIDIA has already enabled DLSS 2.0 in a couple of titles, with Wolfenstein: Youngblood and Deliver Us The Moon ready to go. More titles will follow soon, as DLC for Control and Mechwarrior 5 are coming this week, according to NVIDIA.\n \n\n\nDeep dives into the performance quality of these (and future) games will determine how version 2.0 stacks up from a visual and performance standpoint, but it seems the seeds have been sown for an improved experience \u2013 and reputation \u2013 from DLSS in 2020.\nMuch more in the way of technical information and visual comparisons available from NVIDIA here.\n \n \n \n  \n\n\n \n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVideo News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviousYes, There Is Something Phishy On Your Corporate Network \n\nNextAmazon Streaming Movies In A Theatre Near You \n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\n\n\n \n\nSebastian Peak\nEditor-in-Chief at PC Perspective.

Even independent developer Hinterland Studio demanded that Nvidia pull The Long Dark from GeForce Now after the company \"didn't ask for our permission to put the game on the platform.\"\nIn the case of Activision Blizzard, Nvidia later clarified that this was down to a \"misunderstanding\" -- the Call of Duty publisher participated in a beta trial of GeForce Now and Nvidia believed that meant the partnership would continue after the service launched. It's possible there have been more misunderstandings with the other companies.\nNvidia has now gained significant new support in the form of Epic Games. CEO Tim Sweeney announced via Twitter that not only has his company made Fortnite compatible with GeForce Now, it will also enable games sold via the Epic Games Store -- including exclusives -- to work on the streaming service.\nAgain, the latter point comes down to publisher permission, but Sweeney encouraged games makers to get behind GeForce Now.\n\"It's the most developer-friendly and publisher-friendly of the major streaming services, with zero tax on game revenue,\" he wrote. \"Game companies who want to move the game industry towards a healthier state for everyone should be supporting this kind of service.\"\nHe went on to add that cloud streaming services will be \"key players in ending the iOS and Google Play payment monopolies and their 30% taxes\" -- a subject Sweeney has spoken out about before.\nThere appears to be some confusion around how GeForce Now works, particularly with games companies taking issues with their titles being added to the platform without permission. \nUnlike Google Stadia, titles are not purchased exclusively for the streaming service, nor are they bundled into the subscription like Xbox Game Pass. Instead, players still purchase the titles via Steam (or now Epic Games Store), with revenues going to developers and publishers as usual. If players then subscribe to GeForce Now, they have the ability to play titles they have already purchased via streaming rather than running natively on hardware.\nAs with all the previous withdrawals, the Nvidia forum post about 2K Games' removal has been followed by complaints by users who purchased these titles specifically to play via streaming as they do not own hardware powerful enough to handle the games.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            Sumo Group sells publishing business Secret Mode for undisclosed sum\n          \n\n\n\n            India's first dedicated PC and console game publishing house closes pre-seed founding round\n          \n\n\n\n            Aptoide fully launches to iOS consumers across EU\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nJames Batchelor: James is Editor-in-Chief at GamesIndustry.biz, and has been a B2B journalist since 2006.

The battlefields of the future are dominated by MechWarriors, elite pilots of giant stompy BattleMechs. Via a story-based campaign, randomly generated instant action missions, and co-op, you\u2019ll strap into these BattleMechs and blast opposing forces to smithereens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 2.0: A Big Leap in AI Rendering\nNVIDIA DLSS is an AI-powered super resolution technology that dramatically boosts frame rates and generates beautiful, sharp images for your games. Powered by dedicated AI processors on GeForce RTX GPUs called Tensor Cores, DLSS 2.0 brings significant improvements to the technique, giving GeForce RTX gamers performance headroom to maximize graphics settings and increase output resolutions. To learn more, check out our dedicated NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 article.\nIn MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries, DLSS 2.0 improves performance from 30% up to 75% using the \u201cQuality\u201d mode, all while maintaining -and in some cases even improving- image quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNVIDIA DLSS 2.0 basically gives our players a free performance boost, without sacrificing image quality\u201d said Russ Bullock, President at Piranha Games. \u201cIt was also super easy to implement with NVIDIA\u2019s new SDK, so it was a no brainer for us to add it to MechWarrior 5.\u201d\nIn terms of fidelity, DLSS 2.0\u2019s Quality Mode in MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries maintains comparable image quality to native resolution, while improving upon it in certain cases. Let\u2019s check out a few examples:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the comparison above, captured at 1440p using Quality mode, DLSS adds sharp detail to the intricate parts of the \u2018mech, showing the wear and tear. In addition, DLSS also stabilizes the cyclone fencing on top of the building, for better fidelity during gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, captured at 1080p with Quality Mode, DLSS maintains sharp, clear image quality while boosting frame rates. Note the fine line details on the barn and the increased fidelity of the fields of grain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, in this example captured at 1080p using Quality mode, DLSS restores the guard railing at the top of the wall, and sharpens smaller details both on the wall and the areas on either side of the gate.\nFor news on upcoming integrations of DLSS 2.0, including a new patch that brings the latest version of DLSS to Control, stay tuned to GeForce.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapture Custom Screenshots With NVIDIA Ansel\nIn the single-player campaign and Instant Action, NVIDIA Ansel enables players to capture unique screenshots from custom angles, with filters and other tweaks applied. Press Alt+F2, snap, and upload to ShotWithGeForce and other sites with just a few clicks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Ansel\u2019s many features and functions, you can create wildly different looks for your screenshots, unlocking your creativity and inner photographer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you build something beautiful, be sure to tag @NVIDIAGeForce on social media, and we may feature you on our feeds.\nFor the latest updates and announcements regarding ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 2.0, and other exciting visual technologies stay tuned to GeForce.com.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

From early demonstrations of path tracing in Minecraft via Sonic Ether's RT shader mod to the release of Quake 2 RTX, we've seen a series of old-school titles reborn with modern techniques, in a way that seems perfectly suited to demonstrating the unique capabilities of RT technology. Today, we get a fresh look at the most highly-anticipated ray tracing showcase: Minecraft with RTX. \nIt's important to note that this is the official Microsoft release of Minecraft with ray tracing, a near total overhaul of the game, rather than the shader mod that preceded it. We first went  went hands-on with the title at Gamescom 2019, and since then we also got an exclusive look at the Minecraft DXR tech demo on Xbox Series X. While the game doesn't yet have a release date, some Minecraft creators have already gotten access to development builds - and today we're seeing the fruits of their labours for the first time.\nFirst, here are screenshots of three worlds created by Minecraft mainstays, with Nvidia's descriptions. You can click the image to see the full-size, full-fat screenshot in all its glory.\n \n \n\n\"Of Temples and Totems RTX\" by Razzleberries. An adventure world focusing players on exploring and completing challenges in mysterious temples. Each temple showcases per-pixel emissivity and real-time shadows, and leverages global illumination to create an immersive experience for players.\n\n \n \n\n\"Imagination Island RTX\" by BlockWorks. A fully explorable theme park, filled with Easter eggs, that hosts four distinct lands, each dedicated to an element of real-time ray tracing.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Remedy)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has staunched the flow of game streaming blood pouring from its GeForce Now library and is actually starting to add games back into its streaming catalogue, starting with Control and featuring ray tracing support for Founders members.Remedy's Control was one of the big misses when Nvidia announced that it would be bringing its RTX servers online for the GeForce Now game streaming service. For my money it's the most impressive implementation of the Microsoft DXR-powered ray tracing pretties outside of the upcoming Minecraft update, and seemed like the obvious title to have in the GFN library if Nvidia wanted to show off its wares.Couple that with the fact that it's one of the big Epic Games Store exclusives it seemed doubly weird to not have Control on Nvidia's streaming service after Tim Sweeney claimed Epic was \"wholeheartedly supporting\" it.That miss has been remedied now and Control has been added into the GeForce Now catalogue, giving you access so long as you have the game available on your Epic Games Store account. And if you're a Founders member, and managed to get in before they sold out in Europe, then you get access to all the ray tracing beauty of The Oldest House and its super shiny floors.Nvidia's even working to bring the expansion, The Foundation, to the service too. But honestly, we're not sure they should bother...(Image credit: Nvidia)You will need to make sure you select the DirectX 12 version from the initial Epic launcher menu, but Nvidia has now automatically enabled the ray tracing settings for Founders members. Initially it seemed as though you had to go in and tweak the settings manually, but that has now been amended.It's not the only new game being added this week as GeForce Now is also getting Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, Dungeons 3, Headsnatchers, IL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad, Jagged Alliance 2 \u2013 Wildfire, and The Guild 3 slipped into the library too.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Nvidia has pledged to align most of its releases to Thursdays, so keep an eye out each week to see what goodies GeForce Now is adding in the future.After all the games pulled by the likes of Activision Blizzard, Bethesda, and 2K, it's good to finally see games going back on to the service.

The startup specialises in object storage and should help Nvidia expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\nSwiftStack provides cloud-based software that allows enterprises to manage their cloud storage. The on-premise infrastructure needs to be simplified to also ensure the performance and capacity of the public cloud.\nLast year, the company launched the SwiftStack Data Platform for AI and high-performance computing. Nvidia has been working with SwiftStack for more than a year to address certain data challenges to enable companies to deploy AI on a large scale. This collaboration seems to be the basis for the acquisition.\nIntentions \nThe intention is to integrate the technology into Nvidia\u2019s AI stack, as the company\u2019s ambition is to make the AI software more widely applicable. Users no longer just need to have a GPU or software library, but expect a complete stack from the GPU to the applications.\nNvidia emphasises not to become a storage vendor, collaborations with storage partners remain extremely important. \u201cThe acquisition is intended to integrate different storage technologies and promote the work around AI,\u201d says head of enterprise computing Manuvir Das.\nThe acquisition is subject to regulatory approval, which may take until June 10. Incidentally, the acquisition is expected to be completed sooner.\nThe news follows previous expansions within the Nvidia portfolio through acquisitions. Last year was dominated by the Mellanox acquisition, a supplier of network equipment.\n\n\n\nTags:\nacquisition / enterprise storage / Nvidia / SwiftStack \n\n\n\n\n\n\"*\" indicates required fields\n\nStay tuned, subscribe!\nE-mailadres*\n\nNieuwsbrieven*\n\nMorning Bytes\n\n\nWeekly Advisor\nPhoneThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nRelated                                \n\n\n\nGoogle moves legacy G Suite users to shared Workspace storage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolarWinds buys incident response startup Squadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetApp expands into block storage through ASA A20, A30 and A50\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataCore stronger in file storage via Arcastream acquisition\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor picks    \n\n\n\nGoogle comes to agreement with Wiz: company acquired for 32 billion dollars\n\n$9 billion more than 2024 bid\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to build a chip that\u2019s as efficient as the human brain\n\nIs neuromorphic computing the future?\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenAI introduces Responses API for building AI agents\n\n\nOpenAI has launched a new set of APIs and tools, making it easier for...\n\n\n\n\n\nA storm has formed around CoreWeave\n\nOpenAI steps in, Microsoft pulls back\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsight: Backup & Recovery\n\n\n\n\nCohesity buys Veritas unit for nearly 3 billion dollars\n\n\nCohesity has reached an agreement to acquire Veritas' data protection...\n\n\n\n\n\nCommvault Cloud shifts to cyber resilience\n\n\nCommvault is well known for backup solutions, but increasingly wants ...\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIs Microsoft stealing backup vendors\u2019 lunch with Microsoft 365 Backup?\n\n\nMicrosoft unveiled a new feature at its Inspire event a few weeks ago...\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHow do you protect data on a Synology NAS?\n\n\nA NAS server is a perfect environment for storing data.

A powerful reference design, RTX Server allows engineers to use high performance computing for simulating physics and iterating designs \u2014 all with GPU-accelerated rendering and computer-aided engineering simulation computing times.\nAcuSolve Enhances CAE Workflows\nAcuSolve is a general-purpose CFD software that helps engineers simulate the fluid flow with turbulence and heat transfer of a design. With NVIDIA GPUs, AcuSolve users can perform simulations up to 4x faster than on CPU only configuration.\nBlog images courtesy of Altair.\nThea Render Brings Design to Life\n\nThea Render, a powerful 3D rendering and animation tool, enables engineers to visualize realistic previews of their work. The CUDA-based renderer can now deliver ray tracing with NVIDIA OptiX AI-accelerated denoiser.\nIn addition, Altair Inspire Studio design software with Thea Render and visualization app ParaView both leverage GPU-accelerated AI to reduce the time it takes to render high-quality, noiseless images.\nAltair applications use CUDA, the parallel computing and programming platform featured on NVIDIA GPUs, to gain significant increases in speed and throughput. This lets engineers freely and quickly explore designs and make decisions based on more accurate results.\nRTX Server Accelerates Computations Overnight\n\nRunning design validation workloads on RTX Server similarly enhances GPU-based CFD solvers, which are software \u201cengines\u201d that use advanced computational algorithms to predict physical performance.\nWith RTX Server powering Altair ultraFluidX and nanoFluidX, users can design new models faster and more efficiently during the day on NVIDIA Quadro virtual workstations. The same RTX Server can then be used to complete large-scale CFD simulations overnight instead of taking days to compute the data.\nWhen engineers arrive the next morning, the simulations are ready for them to analyze. This allows teams to understand the performance, behavior and mechanics of their models earlier in the design process \u2014 all while using a more energy-efficient computing system that\u2019s accessible on premises or in the cloud.\nLearn more about Altair and NVIDIA RTX Server for engineering.\n\n\nCategories: Graphics Virtualization | Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | NVIDIA RTX | Simulation and Design | Visual Computing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The report notes that Nvidia\u2019s incoming GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3070 graphics cards will both arrive based on the new Ampere GPU architecture \u201cpacking some gigantic new performance improvements, and equally as impressive power efficiency.\u201dThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, which will reportedly be up to 40% faster than its predecessor, is also expected to launch by the end of 2020, \u00a0complete with 5376 CUDA Cores, a 384-bit memory bus and 12GB of VRAM.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.While Covid-19 has affected Nvidia\u2019s launch plans for 2020, it hasn\u2019t impacted the company financially.

While the technology was promising, there were some drawbacks. First of all, image quality was typically lower than rendering at the target resolution, even when the game was in motion. Also, DLSS required per-game training on the graphics giant's neural network, and as a result adoption wasn't quite as high as NVIDIA would have liked. All that changed this week when the GeForce maker unleashed a new revision of its AI-powered anti-aliasing method, dubbed DLSS 2.0.\n\r\nThis time around, implementing NVIDIA's DLSS is much easier since it doesn't require time and resource intensive training on a per-game basis. Instead, the same AI routines are applied across all games, delivering a generalized work load which NVIDIA promises to be both faster and better looking than the original. If you haven't seen Paul's write-up with all of the details, definitely check that out. Here we're going to actually put DLSS 2.0 to the test and check it out in MechWarrior 5 and Control.\n\n\nGiant Supersampled Mechs With DLSS 2.0\r\nRather than compare DLSS 2.0 against its previous implementation, we set a much higher bar: native resolution images. Below we have a couple of comparisons of how MechWarrior 5 looks at our test display's native 2560x1440 resolution and what different levels of DLSS 2.0 do with the image. Each picture has been scaled to twice its size using nearest-neighbor scaling, and preserved without compression artifacts in PNG format.\u00a0\n\n\nFXAA only - DLSS 2.0 is turned off. Tons of jaggies in repeated patterns here\n\n\nDLSS 2.0 in Performance mode smooths it out a bit, but there's still shimmering in motion\n\n\nIn Balanced mode, we're getting closer to a smooth image. The repeating patterns look like themselves again.\n\n\nNot sure how else to say it: DLSS 2.0 in Quality mode looks much better than with only FXAA.\n\r\nWe're really just floored (ha!) by the results on the floor of this hangar, but there might be more to this story. First of all, the whole game has some noise to it without DLSS. The mechs, the floor, and even the buildings have some serious dithering patterns to them, and really, those ventilation holes should look better than they do. This very off-center viewing angle is the sort of thing that anisotropic filtering should fix on its own, so we're not entirely convinced that the game is rendering this scene like it should. As a result, this may be a somewhat unfair comparison, but this is how the game looks so let's compare anyway.\u00a0\n\r\nAt a relatively high 1440p resolution, there's a ton of shimmering when the image is in motion, and the little ventilation holes on the other side of the mech platform just flat-out look wrong because of the extreme angle we see them. Even in the Performance mode, which uses just a 1280x720 image as its base, those little holes look like holes once again. By the time we crank up the DLSS setting to Quality, the whole image just looks better. There's no other way to say it than DLSS 2.0 improved image quality over FXAA.\u00a0\n\r\nOne side effect of DLSS is that it doesn't seem to play nicely with MSAA (forced through the drivers) or TXAA enabled in the game. Performance actually tanked pretty hard with either of those anti-aliasing methods on top of DLSS 2.0, with the Quality mode only performing around half as fast as no DLSS. Once we switched back to the FXAA shader-computed method,\u00a0\n\r\nFor performance, we tested out a GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER and a GeForce RTX 2060 at our display's native 1440p resolution. To get nice, steady frame rates we could easily reproduce, we used the tutorial mission's weapon test area and recorded frame rates while firing the Centurion's lasers, auto cannon, and long-range missiles. This gives us a look at some explosion effects and destructible buildings.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nPretty unmistakable how the performance trends for our two test cards. We cranked the details all the way to the max in MechWarrior 5 because anything less and our GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER was more or less CPU-bound. Finally with max settings, it's the graphics card taking a pounding, so we can see the effects of DLSS on both cards. At default settings, we're talking about 100 fps or more, so definitely turn up the detail if you can.\n\r\nJust note that for the GeForce RTX 2060 you can eke out quite a bit more performance if you need to by lowering DLSS quality. Although, once DLSS is enabled it's already pretty smooth at a resolution the RTX 2060 wasn't really designed for. Averaging over 60 fps on the DLSS 2.0 Balanced mode is extremely smooth, and the game looks fantastic. \n\r\nMeanwhile, the GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER doesn't really need DLSS as it's awfully close to 60 fps anyway. If you have a display with a higher refresh rate, turning on the Quality mode and taking a modest resolution hit is still pretty worthwhile. By the time you get to the Performance mode, the frame rate is very high all the time.\u00a0\n\nDLSS 2.0 And AI Anti-Aliasing In The Oldest House\r\nThe DLSS 2.0 update for Remedy's supernatural thriller (and personal favorite game of 2019) Control dropped just a couple days after MechWarrior 5, so we can take that for a spin as well. This game certainly had some quirks in its DLSS implementation at launch. For example, Jessie's hairs were broken and floating above her head, and anything with grid lines at all (for instance, an inbox basket on an office desk) wobbled and moved in motion. We're happy to report that all of that is absolutely fixed here. Because we could get before and after shots of Control, we've got a bunch of screenshots to look at.\u00a0\n\r\nWe're zoomed way in here, looking at a 200% crop resized with nearest-neighbor sampling (integer scaling if you're fancy), so it's nice and sharp and brings out every pixel. This gives us a look at all of the detail in a small section of the scene, but it's representative of what we see throughout the game. In short, we think DLSS 2.0 looks amazing considering the performance boost. Let's take a look at why.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFirst of all, this is what that scene should look like at 2560x1440.\n\n\n\nDLSS 1.0 on High looks like someone buttered the screen but somehow kept all the aliasing artifacts.\n\n\n\nDLSS 2.0 on Quality matches the resolution of 1.0's High. The difference is night and day.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDLSS 2.0 on Performance even looks better than than the old version on High. This is quite remarkable.\n\r\nThe really telling comparison here is between DLSS 2.0 Quality and DLSS 1.0 High. They both use the same render target of 1706x960 but the difference is huge. Jessie's finer details pop right out using the newer method. All of those details are a blurred mess with the original implementation. We're pretty hard pressed to tell from screenshots the difference between Native and DLSS 2.0 High. There's no Balanced screenshot here, but it looks a bit better than performance but a tiny bit less convincing than Quality.\u00a0\n\r\nBecause DLSS 2.0 applies itself to objects in motion as the scene moves, there's a little bit of temporal distortion (no, this is not Star Trek). That means that things which move and animate, like Jessie, give off a very faint halo. Try as we might, we couldn't capture it in screenshots in a way that was obvious because the halo is only apparent in motion. Stil, for the performance uptick we're calling it a win. This is nowhere near as distracting or experience-breaking as the wild warbling mesh patterns in the first iteration, and we think it's a pretty good trade-off for the additional performance it gains.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nJust like before, all forms of DLSS represent big performance boosts on both cards. For the GeForce RTX 2060 it's the difference between silky smooth and not really all that playable at 1440p. DLSS 2.0's Quality mode renders at a sub-full HD resolution so performance is faster than native 1080p. You'd normally think that it wouldn't look as good at a lower resolution, but we disagree\u2014the game looks better with DLSS 2.0's Quality setting at 1440p than than native 1080p HD too.\u00a0\n\r\nThe real competition is between the two higher-quality DLSS implementations. DLSS 1.0 actually ran a tad slower than the updated version on both the GeForce RTX 2060 and the RTX 2080 SUPER while also delivering worse overall image quality. The difference in performance is not that great, right around 5%, so while it's consistent this could just be within the margin of error. On the other hand, the difference in quality is absolutely apparent. There's no doubt the updated version looks better while not hurting performance at all.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 2.0 - Higher Quality Game Rendering That Doesn't Kill Performance\r\nOverall we're pretty stoked about NVIDIA's revised DLSS algorithm. For one, it's much easier for developers to implement because the AI routine is content-agnostic. Its availability in Unreal Engine 4 and relatively simple API means it's a simple way to take advantage of a neat hardware feature that can boost performance without negatively affecting image quality.\u00a0We've looked at DLSS 2.0 in just a couple of games, but already we think that it's a tech worth watching. \n\r\nWhen it comes to the games we tested today, we think both Control and MechWarrior 5 have a lot to gain. For GeForce RTX 2060 owners, it's a no brainer. Turn on DLSS 2.0 on any game that supports it, especially if that game also has real-time ray tracing effects, because the performance improvement is absolutely worthwhile. If you've got a faster RTX card, there's still very little harm in enabling this new antialiasing and enjoying a performance boost if you need it.\u00a0\n\nNVIDIA deserves a lot of credit for what it's doing with DLSS 2.0. Not only does it overall improve image quality and performance, it does so at no cost to GeForce RTX owners. It's not very often that mid-generation software updates bring along this kind of improvement. We hope to see adoption pick-up soon.\u00a0\r\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, GeForce, (nasdaq:nvda), dlss, dlss-20\n\n\n\nRelated content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEK Fluid Gaming 270 Conquest Review: Immaculate PC Gaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Review: BFGPU Benchmarks Unleashed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamsung SSD 980 Pro Review: Blazing Fast PCIe 4.0 Storage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalit GeForce RTX 3080 GamingPro OC Review: Big, Custom Ampere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Review: Ampere Is A Gaming Monster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT STUFF IN PC COMPONENTS\n\nEK Fluid Gaming 270 Conquest Review:...\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Review: BFGPU...\nSamsung SSD 980 Pro Review: Blazing Fast...\nPalit GeForce RTX 3080 GamingPro OC...\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Review: Ampere...\nTONOR Q9 USB Microphone Kit Review:...\nNVIDIA Reviewer Toolkit: Preparing For...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKEEP INFORMED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSITE\n\nHome\n\n\nReviews\n\n\nNews\n\n\nBlogs\n\nFull Site\n\nSitemap\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nPC Components\n\n\nSystems\n\n\nMobile\n\n\nIT Infrastructure\n\n\nLeisure\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nCOMPANY\n\nAbout\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\nNews Tips\n\n\nContact\n\n\nPrivacy And Terms\n\n\nHotTech\n\n\n\nMORE\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nShop\n\n\n\nSTAY CONNECTED\n\nTwitter\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n            As an Amazon and Howl Technologies Associate, HotHardware earns a commission from qualifying purchases made on this site.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Marco Chiappetta is a technologist who covers semiconductors and AI.Follow AuthorMar 29, 2020, 07:22pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SuperMarco Chiappetta, HotHardware\nThis past week, NVIDIA announced an update to its Deep Learning Super Sampling technology, aptly dubbed DLSS 2.0. If you recall, DLSS originally a launched alongside the company\u2019s Turning-based GeForce RTX series graphics cards in the fall of 2018, and this latest iteration improves the technology in a number of meaningful ways, that benefit not only gamers, but game developers as well.\n\n\nDLSS essentially takes lower-resolution imagery, and intelligently upscales it to looks like native, higher-resolution output. DLSS 1.0 required game developers to provide game assets to NVIDIA, who would then feed the data to a DGX-1 neural network to evaluate the game\u2019s visuals, frame by frame, comparing them to a \u201cground truth\u201d golden sample of image quality. The ground truth reference was a full resolution image with 64x super-sampling (64xSS) applied, to provide extreme detail and ultra-high-quality anti-aliasing. The neural network is then tasked with producing an image output, measuring the difference between it and the 64xSS ground truth image quality target, and adjusting its weights accordingly in an effort to perfect the image on the next iteration; and the process continues until the model is built for that particular game.\nNVIDIA's DLSS 2.0 Offers Big Performance Improvements Over The Original.NVIDIA\n\nIn practice, DLSS 1.0\u2019s effect on game visuals and performance was a mixed bag, that varied from title to title. Performance was universally improved to varying degrees since the game was being internally rendered at a lower resolution, but image quality wasn\u2019t always optimal and sometimes resulted in unwanted artifacts.\n\nDLSS 2.0 improves upon the original release in just about every way. Game developers are still required to implement the technology into their games (it\u2019s not a tick-box feature than can be enabled universally via drivers), but they no longer have to provide game-specific assets to NVIDIA. DLSS 2.0 is trained using generalized game content on a neural network that works across virtually all games. NVIDIA has also improved DLSS 2.0\u2019s performance by leveraging the Tensor cores available in its GeForce RTX-series GPUs and image quality is drastically improved as well.\n\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nUsers have three quality options to choose from with DLSS 2.0: Quality, Balanced, and Performance. And the feature can now be enabled at any resolution. The lower-resolution internal rendering target will vary, but generally speaking, DLSS 2.0 should off significant performance and image quality gains versus DLSS 1.0.\nDLSS 2.0's Image Quality Is Comparable To The Native Resolution Rendering.NVIDIA\n\n\nAlthough the feature is brand new, a couple of games already support DLSS 2.0. In this evaluation at HotHardware, which tested DLSS 2.0 with MechWarrior 5 and Control, both a mainstream GeForce RTX 2060 and high-end GeForce RTX 2080 Super showed massive performance gains at all DLSS 2.0 quality levels. In-game image quality was clearly improved as well.\nBen Funk states, \u201cNVIDIA deserves a lot of credit for what it's doing with DLSS 2.0. Not only does it overall improve image quality and performance, it does so at no cost to GeForce RTX owners. It's not very often that mid-generation software updates bring along this kind of improvement.\u201d\nTo date, only a few games that support DLSS 2.0 have been announced and existing titles that already support DLSS 1.0 will need to be patched to support the new technology. Considering the barriers NVIDIA has removed to more easily implement DLSS 2.0 though, and the performance and image quality benefits, additional game developers are likely to hop on board.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.Nvidia said today that game publisher 2K Games is pulling its library from the company\u2019s GeForce Now cloud gaming service at 2K\u2019s request.\u201cPer publisher request, please be advised 2K Games titles will be removed from GeForce Now today. We are working with 2K Games to re-enable their games in the future,\u201d said Nvidia community manager Cory Banks in a post on Nvidia\u2019s forums. When asked for comment, Nvidia pointed The Verge to this February 20th blog post.2K publishes the BioShock trilogy, Borderlands series, Civilization games, and the NBA 2K series, among others2K publishes the BioShock trilogy, Borderlands series, Civilization games, and NBA 2K series, among others. So the publisher\u2019s withdrawal is a big loss for GeForce Now, which just left beta on February 4th. Nvidia is now offering a premium version of the cloud gaming service as a \u201cpublic trial\u201d for $4.99 a month, yet the switch to charging customers for the service has instigated a wave of game removals. 2K pulling its games from the service follows the departures of Activision Blizzard\u2019s and Bethesda\u2019s games last month, meaning that many popular titles aren\u2019t available to play on the newly-public service.2K, Activision Blizzard and Bethesda allowed their games on GeForce Now while it was in beta, but that has changed since the service left beta and Nvidia started charging people money for the service (though there is still a very limited free tier of GeForce Now). In a statement to The Verge, 2K Games said it \u201crequested its games be removed from GeForce Now, as a commercial agreement is currently not in place with Nvidia.\u201d In the case of Activision Blizzard, Nvidia reportedly never got permission to keep Activision Blizzard\u2019s titles on GeForce Now after it left beta. Presumably, Bethesda pulled its games from GeForce Now from GeForce Now for similar reasons, likely due to some form of licensing dispute.The promise of cloud gaming services seems great: stream all your games in high fidelity over the internet without having to worry about whether or not your computer, console, or phone have the hardware to run it. But like the hard-to-track content shuffling we see on streaming services, the early days of cloud gaming have shown that similar types of licensing issues may dictate what games you can actually stream. My colleague Nick Statt wrote a great article breaking down the situation that I recommend you go read to better understand the intricacies at play with a service like GeForce Now.RelatedNvidia\u2019s GeForce Now is becoming an important test for the future of cloud gamingBethesda follows Activision in pulling games from Nvidia\u2019s GeForce NowYou can blame Nvidia, not just Activision Blizzard, for their GeForce Now falling-outNvidia\u2019s GeForce Now is losing all Activision Blizzard games, a bad sign for cloud gamingNvidia\u2019s GeForce Now finally leaves beta, challenges Google Stadia at $5 a monthUpdate, March 9th, 2:25PM ET: Added statement from 2K Games.See More: EntertainmentGamingNewsPC GamingTechMost PopularMost PopularAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsLeaked Apple meeting shows how dire the Siri situation really isThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Citing the latest developments in the now coronavirus pandemic, NVIDIA has altered its GTC plans once again. The company is now postponing its GTC announcements entirely. A new date will be scheduled \"once the situation stabilizes.\"\nGiven the much lower-key nature of NVIDIA's previously planned news releases, I was not expecting the company to bring out its biggest announcements to begin with. But now the matter is settled entirely, as there will not be any NVIDIA announcements at all.\nMeanwhile, Digital GTC will still be occurring as scheduled, with NVIDIA offering online workshop content as well as streaming presentations supplied by participating speakers.\n\nNVIDIA Axes GTC Digital Keynote In Favor Of News Releases; Fate Of Major Announcements Unknown\nOriginal Article (03/09/2020): Last week, in light of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, NVIDIA opted to scale down their plans for their annual trade show, the 2020 GPU Technology Conference. At the time the company announced that they would take the show entirely digital, including offering webinars, pre-recorded talks, and of course, CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s annual keynote. However a week later, and those digital offerings are now getting a whole lot slimmer, as NVIDIA is announcing that they have canceled the keynote altogether.\nCiting the current coronavirus situation and the potential for it to impact their ability to produce a keynote presentation, the company is \u201cdeferring plans to deliver a webcast keynote\u201d. But rather than give up on making any announcements altogether, in place of that NVIDIA now intends to issue a series of news announcements on March 24th that had previously been scheduled to be shared in the keynote. So while NVIDIA has scaled things back even further, there will still be some news coming out of the company later this month.\nThe big, outstanding question of course is how many \u201cmajor\u201d announcements NVIDIA will still go ahead with. GTC keynotes in recent years have been an onion of sorts, with core NVIDIA technology announcements surrounded by news about partnerships, projects customers have been working on, NVIDIA\u2019s own research projects, etc. So there is a great deal of (intentional?) ambiguity in today\u2019s announcement from NVIDIA, as it\u2019s not clear if NVIDIA is still going to make some long-expected core technology announcements, or if they\u2019ll withhold them for another time.\nComplicating all of this one degree further is that the company\u2019s annual investor day takes place during GTC. That presentation, which typically encapsulates the keynote\u2019s major announcements with a great deal of discussion on NVIDIA\u2019s financials, has been scaled back as well, but not entirely. NVIDIA will still be doing an investor call on the morning of the 24th, which is set to follow the release of their news announcements. As a result, there are several competing factors here in determining what news NVIDIA still needs to or will want to present.\nThe good news, at least, is that the rest of GTC Digital will still be taking place. That kicks off on March 25th, with NVIDIA set to release more details on how the company will be collecting and sharing that material.\nAt any rate, AnandTech will be covering all of the news from GTC, regardless of what form it comes in. So be sure to check back in on the 24th to see what NVIDIA is (or isn\u2019t?) announcing this month.\n\n\n                Source:\n                NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n26 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nnandnandnand - Monday, March 9, 2020 - link\nSoon, no paid vacations to tech conferences.

It looks like PCGamesN has got hold of an internal slide that shows up to 50% better performance of each SUPER variant compared to its older non-SUPER sibling.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 20 SUPER Mobility GPUs Headed To SUPER Laptops - Up To 50% Faster Performance With RTX 2080 SUPER & RTX 2070 SUPER\nThe Turing Refresh or GeForce RTX SUPER Mobility GPU lineup is expected to launch soon with several variants popping up in leaked benchmarks time after time. We have got to see several rumored specifications for various GPUs but as we get closer to launch, we are expected to get even more information, whether through official or unofficial channels.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total CostThe slide in question that PCGamesN got a hold on seems to be from an internal press deck which shows two SUPER variants listed with their respective performance. The GPUs include the GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER and the GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER. The performance is measured with DLSS On and DLSS Off. Surprisingly, the slide doesn't mention the other SUPER cards which we know are also coming to laptops next quarter such as the RTX 2060 SUPER, the GTX 1650 SUPER series and also doesn't mention the RTX 2080 mobility which is the current flagship of the lineup.\nThe performance of NVIDIA's upcoming GeForce RTX SUPER Laptop GPUs including the RTX 2080 SUPER & RTX 2070 SUPER notebook has been leaked by PCGamesN.\nEarlier, it was revealed by the folks over at\u00a0NotebookCheck that NVIDIA was working on SUPER variants for the mobility Turing lineup too. A leaked slide from an internal presentation revealed that there would be at least five variants which would include:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER Mobile (N18E-G3R)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER Mobile (N18E-G2R)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER Mobile (N18E-G1R)\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 SUPER Mobile (N18P-G62)\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX SUPER Mobility GPU Lineup Specs:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti NotebookNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 RefreshNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 RefreshNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPERNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER\n\n\n\n\nCodenameN18P-G62N18E-G1-BN18E-G1RN18E-G2RN18E-G3R\n\n\nArchitectureTuring TU116Turing TU106Turing TU104Turing TU104Turing TU104\n\n\nProcess Node12nm FinFET NVIDIA12nm FinFET NVIDIA12nm FinFET NVIDIA12nm FinFET NVIDIA12nm FinFET NVIDIA\n\n\nSMs1630364048\n\n\nCUDA Cores10241920230425603072\n\n\nStandard Max Boost Clock1485 MHz1285 MHz1485 MHz1380 MHz1560 MHz\n\n\nMax-Q Max Boost Clock1200 MHzTBCTBC1155 MHz1080 MHz\n\n\nVRAM4 GB GDDR66 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus128-bit192-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit\n\n\nMemory Clock12 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Bandwdith192 GB/s336 GB/s448 GB/s448 GB/s448 GB/s\n\n\nTGP (Total Graphics Power)35W (Standard)\n55W (Max-Q)115W (Standard)115W (Standard)115W (Standard)\n80 (Max-Q)150W+ (Standard)\n80 (Max-Q)\n\n\n\nRegardless, since the GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER has got a specification boost, it's more than likely to either match or comes close to the RTX 2080 (Non-SUPER) in which case, we are looking at a 50% increase in performance over the standard RTX 2070 when going to an RTX 2070 SUPER mobility GPU and turning DLSS On. The same is true for the GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER, which is another 50% performance uplift over the RTX 2070 SUPER / RTX 2080 mobility GPUs. That's definitely a huge jump in performance but as pointed out in the specifications, the RTX 2080 SUPER mobility is a part with a TGP of 150W+ and that's going to be only used in the most high-end laptop configurations which have ever been created.\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER Notebook GPU has been spotted by _Rogame.\nAlso while the RTX 2060 SUPER is not mentioned, _Rogame managed to find that particular SKU in Geekbench 4 database. The chip houses 34 SMs like the RTX 2060 SUPER, featuring 2176 cores, 8 GB of GDDR6 memory and a core clock of around 1.49 GHz. The specific notebook it was featured in was an HP OMEN model. The chip yielded a score of 23,131 which is super close to the RTX 2070 which scores around 24,500 points and faster than the RTX 2070 Max-Q which scores around 22K points.\nAnd not surprisingly, the leaked slide also mentions Intel's 10th Generation Comet Lake-H CPU as a part of the test configuration which makes sense since these new GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs will be featured in laptops featuring Intel's latest processors.\n\nNVIDIA's CEO already showcased how their current GeForce RTX mobility lineup is faster than even the next-generation console lineup which puts the refreshed SUPER series in a league of its own. It would be the ultimate combo for users who want powerful performance on-the-go and it looks like this is the niche where Intel and NVIDIA would continue to dominate for a while until AIBs start using RTX 2080 SUPER GPUs in AMD's Ryzen 4000 'Renoir' based notebooks.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n86\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n75\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n22\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve Rumored To Launch SteamOS For Desktop PCs Soon; Is Time For A Bloatware-Free OS Near?\n\n\n\n21\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\n\n\n17\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1285\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\n\n\n783\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The new form of the technology that was showcased in Deliver Us the Moon and Wolfenstein Youngblood back at that huge tech show is now available for developers to shove into any new game.\u00a0Here are the best graphics cardsCheck out the best processorsThere's a whole world of PC components out thereThis new implementation, as we've already explored, looks way better than it did in the past, to the point where no one should avoid using this version of DLSS 2.0, even if you have the hardware to render your games at full resolution with all details maxed.\u00a0You won't even really need to wait to see this technology in games, either. We already mentioned that DLSS 2.0 is available in Wolfenstein Youngblood and Deliver us the Moon, but it's also being added to Control via its The Foundation DLC and Mechwarrior 5. And, you can bet that we'll be testing this new implementation out to see how it performs in these new titles.\u00a0DLSS 2.0 is easier for developers to access, and with a single network for all the machine learning, we should see a ton of new games featuring the technology \u2013 and we can't wait to see all the new DLSS-packed PC games.\u00a0How does it work?DLSS, or Deep Learning Super Sampling, utilizes the power of Nvidia's Tensor cores to intelligently upscale games to a higher resolution using AI and machine learning. This means that your graphics card will be able to output at, say, 4K while only feeling the pressure of rendering at 1440p. This means that 4K gaming is way more affordable than it was before, as you won't need something like an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti.\u00a0Before DLSS 2.0, however, there weren't many games that could leverage this awesome feature. You see, Nvidia's supercomputers had to undergo specific training for each game that implemented DLSS, which meant that it was labor- and data-intensive to get each game ready.\u00a0Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Now that's not the case anymore. Nvidia has been able to condense everything down into one DLSS network, which means Nvidia doesn't need to do per-game training anymore. Instead, there's a generalized algorithm that will allow any developer to implement the tech into their games.\u00a0We should be clear that, while this new implementation of DLSS means that it will be available in more games, it doesn't mean that it will be available in all games. Developers need to actively include the feature in their games, and if they choose not to for whatever reason, there's no way to activate it on the user's end. Unlike other graphics features Nvidia has implemented over the years, you can't force it through GeForce Settings in Windows.\u00a0Still, we assume that the fact that it is more easily implemented will mean that it will appear in more games in the future. With the PS5 and Xbox Series X specs looking like they'll really push for 4K gaming in the mainstream, mid-range GPUs like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 are going to need all the help they can get to keep up.\u00a0DLSS exists along with ray tracing\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nBill ThomasSocial Links NavigationBill Thomas (Twitter) is TechRadar's computing editor.

This allows users to gain immediate visual feedback to see how a vehicle\u2019s aesthetics will interact with different environments in real time.\nBy transforming massive amounts of digital design and engineering data into photorealistic renders in VRED, professionals can make better-informed decisions throughout the design and development process, allowing them to bring products to market faster.\nDesign with Real-Time Rendering, Deliver Real-Time Results\nAutodesk VRED enables users to create digital prototypes so they can gain insight into how vehicles will look and perform. To be effective in guiding design decisions, the digital prototypes need to look and behave as close as possible to the real thing.\n\u201cReal-time ray tracing has a huge impact on design visualization, which is why Autodesk is making our industry-leading VRED 3D visualization software even more powerful by embracing NVIDIA Quadro RTX GPUs in the latest release,\u201d said Thomas Heermann, associate vice president of Automotive + Conceptual Design at Autodesk.\nWith RTX accelerating VRED, professionals can create product presentations, design reviews and virtual prototypes with photorealistic details in real time. VRED users can also achieve physically accurate scalable rendering on GPU, and they can connect several NVIDIA RTX Servers to speed up real-time and offline rendering performance.\nDesigning the Fastest Trains with the Fastest Tools\n\nAlstom, a leading company in the transportation industry, designs and builds locomotives, including France\u2019s TGV, one of the world\u2019s fastest trains. While many automotive designers are adopting VR for their design workflows, Alstom pushes the graphics envelope further to bring massive train models to life for real-time design reviews.\n\u201cWith NVIDIA Quadro RTX and VRED GPU ray tracing, we are able to achieve a significant performance increase over CPU ray tracing, accelerating our renderings from minutes to milliseconds,\u201d said Fabien Normand, virtual reality expert at Alstom. \u201cWith RTX Server scalability and Autodesk VRED, we can now spend less time optimizing our models for ray-tracing performance and more time designing. The results look amazing on our 32-million-pixel stereoscopic power wall.\u201d\nAI Denoiser Delivers Noise-Free Images in Real Time\nIn addition to real-time ray tracing and rendering, VRED uses RTX to deliver AI denoising.\nBy combining NVIDIA\u2019s AI-accelerated denoiser with VRED\u2019s scalable ray tracing, designers can remove the last bit of grain in their renders and create noise-free, interactive images in real time.\nThis workflow provides users with immediate visual feedback so they can see and interact with their latest designs, allowing them to explore with different variables like light, materials, viewing angle and shadows.\nDesigners can now see how a vehicle\u2019s aesthetics will interact in different environments, which is critical to ensure automotive prototypes meet certain requirements before the design is finalized.\n\u201cProfessional VRED users demand the performance Quadro RTX provides for both photorealism and real-time interactivity for design reviews and exploration on desktop, large-scale review environments and in VR,\u201d said Heermann. \u201cCoupled with NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 and RTX 8000 GPUs, our latest release of VRED delivers performance improvements that make a difference to our customers.\u201d\nRegister for GTC Digital to learn more about the latest release of Autodesk VRED 2021.\nFeatured image courtesy of Peter Spriggs.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | NVIDIA RTX | Ray Tracing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Other investors include Storm Ventures and UMC Capital.\n\nSwiftStack, which was founded in 2011, placed an early bet on OpenStack, the massive open-source project that aimed to give enterprises an AWS-like management experience in their own data centers. The company was one of the largest contributors to OpenStack\u2019s Swift object storage platform and offered a number of services around this, though it seems like in recent years it has downplayed the OpenStack relationship as that platform\u2019s popularity has fizzled in many verticals.\nSwiftStack lists the likes of PayPal, Rogers, data center provider DC Blox, Snapfish and Verizon (TechCrunch\u2019s parent company) on its customer page. Nvidia, too, is a customer.\n\nSwiftStack notes that it team will continue to maintain an existing set of open source tools like Swift, ProxyFS, 1space and Controller.\n\u201cSwiftStack\u2019s technology is already a key part of NVIDIA\u2019s GPU-powered AI infrastructure, and this acquisition will strengthen what we do for you,\u201d says Arnold.\nSwiftStack Raises $16M For Its Enterprise Object Storage Service\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI), Co-founder, Enterprise, GPGPU, mayfield fund, nvidia, object storage, openstack, openview venture partners, PayPal, Startups, storm ventures, supercomputer, SwiftStack, Verizon \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tFrederic Lardinois\t\n\n\n\nEditor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore he joined TechCrunch in 2012, he founded SiliconFilter and wrote for ReadWriteWeb (now ReadWrite).

Bernas used NVIDIA\u2019s Getting Started With Jetson Nano Deep Learning Institute course to begin his project.\nAI on Reading\nBernas\u2019s winning entry, Reading Eye for the Blind with NVIDIA Jetson Nano, is a text-to-voice AI app and a device prototype to aid the visually impaired.\nThe number of people worldwide visually impaired \u2014 those with moderate to severe vision loss \u2014 is estimated to be 285 million, with 39 million of them blind, according to the World Health Organization.\nHis device, which can be seen in the video below, allows people to place books or handwritten text to be scanned by a camera and converted to voice.\n\n\u201cPart of the inspiration was for creating a solution for my grandmother and other people with vision loss,\u201d said Bernas. \u201cShe\u2019s very proud of me.\u201d\nDIY Jetson Education\nBernas enjoys do-it-yourself building. His living room stores some of the more than 20 radio-controlled planes and drones he has designed and built. He also competes in his school\u2019s Science Olympiad team in electrical engineering, circuits, aeronautical and physics.\nBetween high school courses, online programs and forums, Bernas has learned to use HTML, CSS, Python, C, C++, Java and JavaScript. For him, developing models using the NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit was a logical next step in his education for DIY building.\nHe plans to develop his text-to-voice prototype to include Hindi, Mandarin, Russian and Spanish. Meanwhile, he has his sights on AI for robotics and autonomy as a career path.\n\u201cNow that machine learning is so big, I\u2019m planning to major in something engineering-related with programming and machine learning,\u201d he said of his college plans.\n\u00a0\nNVIDIA Jetson Nano makes adding AI easier and more accessible to makers, self-taught developers and embedded tech enthusiasts.

Catch up on all our automotive posts, here.\nLidar can give autonomous vehicles laser focus.\nBy bouncing laser signals off the surrounding environment, these sensors can enable a self-driving car to construct a detailed and accurate 3D picture of what\u2019s around it.\nHowever, traditional methods for processing lidar data pose significant challenges. These include limitations in the ability to detect and classify different types of objects, scenes and weather conditions, as well as limitations in performance and robustness.\nIn this DRIVE Labs episode, we introduce our multi-view LidarNet deep neural network, which uses multiple perspectives, or views, of the scene around the car to overcome the traditional limitations of lidar-based processing.\n\nAI-Powered Solutions\nAI in the form of DNN-based approaches has become the go-to solution to address traditional lidar perception challenges.\nOne AI method uses lidar DNNs that perform top\u2010down or \u201cbird\u2019s eye view\u201d (BEV) object detection on lidar point cloud data. A virtual camera positioned at some height above the scene, similar to a bird flying overhead, reprojects 3D coordinates of each data point into that virtual camera view via orthogonal projection.\nBEV lidar DNNs use 2D convolutions in their layers to detect dynamic objects such as cars, trucks, buses, pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users. 2D convolutions work fast, so they are well-suited for use in real-time autonomous driving applications.\nHowever, this approach can get tricky when objects look alike top-down. For example, in BEV, pedestrians or bikes may appear similar to objects like poles, tree trunks or bushes, resulting in perception errors.\nAnother AI method uses 3D lidar point cloud data as input to a DNN that uses 3D convolutions in its layers to detect objects. This improves accuracy since a DNN can detect objects using their 3D shapes. However, 3D convolutional DNN processing of lidar point clouds is difficult to run in real-time for autonomous driving applications.\nEnter Multi-View LidarNet\nTo overcome the limitations of both of these AI-based approaches, we developed our multi\u2010view LidarNet DNN, which acts in two stages. The first stage extracts semantic information about the scene using lidar scan data in perspective view (Figure 1). This \u201cunwraps\u201d a 360-degree surround lidar range scan so it looks as though the entire panorama is in front of the self-driving car.\nThis first-stage semantic segmentation approach performs very well for predicting object classes. This is because the DNN can better observe object shapes in perspective view (for example, the shape of a walking human).\nThe first stage segments the scene both into dynamic objects of different classes, such as cars, trucks, busses, pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists, as well as static road scene components, such as the road surface, sidewalks, buildings, trees, and traffic signs.\nFigure 1. Multi-view LidarNet perspective view.\n\u00a0\nFigure 2. Multi-view LidarNet top-down bird\u2019s eye view (BEV).\nThe semantic segmentation output of LidarNet\u2019s first stage is then projected into BEV and combined with height data at each location, which is obtained from the lidar point cloud. The resulting output is applied as input to the second stage (Figure 2).\nThe second stage DNN is trained on BEV-labeled data to predict top-down 2D bounding boxes around objects identified by the first stage. This stage also uses semantic and height information to extract object instances. This is easier in BEV since objects are not occluding each other in this view.\nThe result of chaining these two DNN stages together is a lidar DNN that consumes only lidar data. It uses end-to-end deep learning to output a rich semantic segmentation of the scene, complete with 2D bounding boxes for objects. By using such methods, it can detect vulnerable road users, such as motorcyclists, bicyclists, and pedestrians, with high accuracy and completeness. Additionally, the DNN is very efficient \u2014 inference runs at 7ms per lidar scan on the NVIDIA DRIVE\u2122AGX platform.\nIn addition to multi-view LidarNet, our lidar processing software stack includes a lidar object tracker. The tracker is a computer vision-based post-processing system that uses the BEV 2D bounding box information and lidar point geometry to compute 3D bounding boxes for each object instance. The tracker also helps stabilize per-frame DNN misdetections and, along with a low-level lidar processor, computes geometric fences that represent hard physical boundaries that a car should avoid.\nThis combination of AI-based and traditional computer vision-based methods increases the robustness of our lidar perception software stack. Moreover, the rich perception information provided by lidar perception can be combined with camera and radar detections to design even more robust Level 4 to Level 5 autonomous systems.\n\n\nCategories: DRIVE Labs | DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Now he and his 10-member team are teaching it to robots.\nWhen the AI specialists at Mobile Industrial Robots, based in Odense, Denmark, are done, the first graduating class of autonomous machines will be on their way to factories and warehouses, powered by NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX GPUs.\n\u201cThe ultimate goal is to make the robots behave in ways humans understand, so it\u2019s easier for humans to work alongside them. And Xavier NX is at the bleeding edge of what we are doing,\u201d said Sorensen, who will provide an online talk about MiR\u2019s work at GTC Digital.\nMiR\u2019s low-slung robots carry pallets weighing as much as 2,200 pounds. They sport lidar and proximity sensors, as well as multiple cameras the team is now linking to Jetson Xavier GPUs.\nInferencing Their Way Forward\nThe new digital brains will act as pilots. They\u2019ll fuse sensor data to let the bots navigate around people, forklifts and other objects, dynamically re-mapping safety zones and changing speeds as needed.\nThe smart bots use NVIDIA\u2019s DeepStream and TensorRT software to run AI inference jobs on Xavier NX, based on models trained on NVIDIA GPUs in the AWS cloud.\nMiR chose Xavier for its combination of high performance at low power and price, as well as its wealth of software.\n\u201cLowering the cost and power consumption for AI processing was really important for us,\u201d said Sorensen. \u201cWe make small, battery-powered robots and our price is a major selling point for us.\u201d He noted that MiR has deployed more than 3,000 robots to date to users such as Ford, Honeywell and Toyota.\nThe new autonomous models are working prototypes. The team is training their object-detection models in preparation for first pilot tests.\nJetson Nano Powers Remote Vision\nIt\u2019s MiR\u2019s first big AI product, but not its first ever. Since November, the company has shipped smart, standalone cameras powered by Jetson Nano GPUs.\nThe Nano-based cameras process video at 15 frames per second to detect objects. They\u2019re networked with each other and other robots to enhance the robots\u2019 vision and help them navigate.\nBoth the Nano cameras and Xavier-powered robots process all camera data locally, only sending navigation decisions over the network. \u201cThat\u2019s a major benefit for such a small, but powerful module because many of our customers are very privacy minded,\u201d Sorensen said.\nMiR developed a tool its customers use to train the camera by simply showing it pictures of objects such as robots and forklifts. The ease of customizing the cameras is a big measure of the product\u2019s success, he added.\nAI Training with Simulations\nThe company hopes its smart robots will be equally easy to train for non-technical staff at customer sites.\nBut here the challenge is greater. Public roads have standard traffic signs, but every factory and warehouse is unique with different floor layouts, signs and types of pallets.\nMiR\u2019s AI team aims to create a simulation tool that places robots in a virtual work area that users can customize. Such a simulation could let users who are not AI specialists train their smart robots like they train their smart cameras today.\nThe company is currently investigating NVIDIA\u2019s Isaac platform, which supports training through simulations.\nMiR is outfitting its family of industrial robots for AI.\nThe journey into the era of autonomous machines is just starting for MiR. It\u2019s parent company, Teradyne, announced in February it is investing $36 million to create a hub for developing collaborative robots, aka co-bots, in Odense as part of a partnership with MiR\u2019s sister company, Universal Robotics.\nMarket watchers at ABI Research predict the co-bot market could expand to $12 billion by 2030. In 2018, Danish companies including MiR and Universal captured $995 million of that emerging market, according to Damvad, a Danish analyst firm.\nWith such potential and strong ingredients from companies like NVIDIA, \u201cit\u2019s a great time in the robotics industry,\u201d Sorensen said.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | RoboticsTags: Computer Vision | DeepStream | Jetson | Metropolis | NVIDIA in Europe | TensorRT | Xavier \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

These technologies represent the biggest leap in graphics since the invention of programmable shaders in 2002, bringing cinema-quality reflections, shadows, and lighting to games.\nNow, Microsoft has announced DirectX 12 Ultimate, their new graphics API, which codifies GeForce RTX\u2019s innovative technologies as the standard for multi-platform, next-gen games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectX 12 Ultimate gives developers a large, multi-platform install base of hardware to target and ready-made tools and examples to work from -- all backed by time-saving middleware. This makes game development faster and easier, and enables more developers to add these innovative technologies to their games. Many developers have already crafted next-gen experiences featuring these technologies--there are over 30 DirectX Ray Tracing games shipping or announced--and now with the launch of DirectX 12 Ultimate, adoption of them is set to increase rapidly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith GeForce RTX, the first and only PC platform with support for these game-changing features, gamers will be ready for the most advanced and graphically intensive games launching today and in the coming years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nDirectX 12 Ultimate unlocks the latest in graphics hardware technology with support for ray tracing, mesh shaders, and variable rate shading. It\u2019s the new gold standard for the next generation of games. \n- Marcus Wassmer, Director of Engineering, Graphics, Epic Games\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectX 12 Ultimate Technologies\nRay Tracing\nAt the heart of DirectX 12 Ultimate is ray tracing, which realistically simulates the path of light in a scene, enabling lighting, shadow, and reflection effects only previously possible in blockbuster movies. DirectX 12 Ultimate brings with it a new update to DirectX Raytracing (DXR), version 1.1, which makes ray tracing even more efficient for developers to implement.\nWith hardware and software pioneered by NVIDIA, we\u2019ve helped bring ray tracing to Battlefield V, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Control, Metro Exodus, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and others. And we\u2019re working to bring ray tracing to massively anticipated blockbusters such as Cyberpunk 2077, Minecraft with RTX, Watch Dogs: Legion, and Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, to name a few.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the inclusion of ray tracing in DirectX 12 Ultimate, all major game engines, and next-gen consoles, the adoption of ray tracing is set to take off in the coming year. And it\u2019ll look and run best on GeForce RTX GPUs due to dedicated ray tracing hardware called RT Cores, and our performance-boosting DLSS technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Rate Shading\nVariable Rate Shading (VRS) improves performance by allowing developers to render different parts of a scene at different quality levels. In the Vulkan-powered Wolfenstein: Youngblood, our NVIDIA Adaptive Shading implementation of VRS boosted performance by up to 15%, without a perceptible loss of image quality. By bringing Variable Rate Shading to DirectX 12 Ultimate, many more developers can easily add this win-win tech to their games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectX 12 Ultimate is going to accelerate the adoption of cutting edge graphics features in games because development platforms are not fragmented. With DirectX 12 Ultimate I know that I can adopt new graphics features immediately and that they will work in PC and Xbox games. We are already experimenting with DirectX 12 Ultimate for Rogue Company, which will launch in 2020.\n- Chris Larson - COO, Hi-Rez Studios and GM/EP of Rogue Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the hood, developer-made algorithms identify pixels that the player can\u2019t easily see and pixels that infrequently change or update, and use VRS to reduce the rate at which they are rendered (shaded). For example, black pixels in a shadow look no different when the shading rate is reduced. So by reducing the shading rate of numerous pixels per frame, GPU workload is decreased, increasing performance.\nIn the visualization image below, you can see how VRS can apply different shading rates in a scene. The colored overlay on the right side shows a possible application to a frame - the car, sky, and foliage have been shaded at full rate (i.e., blue region) to preserve fine details. The area next to the car has been shaded once per four pixels (green), and the road to the far left and right periphery has been shaded once per eight pixels (yellow).\nThese areas are motion blurred to add to the sense of speed, and are therefore difficult for a player to perceive during gameplay. So by using VRS, their shading rate can be decreased without affecting image quality to any appreciable degree, giving the game an instant performance boost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about this exciting, performance-enhancing technology, check out our Variable Rate Shading and NVIDIA Adaptive Shading explainer article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMesh Shading\nIf you\u2019ve played an open-world game and experimented with the graphics settings, you\u2019ll know that cranking up the level of geometric detail can greatly decrease performance, usually by flooding the CPU with draw calls, which limits CPU performance, in turn bottlenecking the GPU. Mesh Shading enables developers to fix this, and further boost fidelity and performance, with new rendering techniques that can create worlds filled with detail stretching out into the distance as far as the eye can see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectX 12 Ultimate is going to accelerate the adoption of cutting edge graphics features in games because development platforms are less fragmented. With DirectX 12 Ultimate we are able to adopt new graphics features on multiple platforms faster than before.\n- Mika Vehkala, Director of Technology, Remedy Entertainment \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo demonstrate, we built the Asteroids tech demo, in which Mesh Shaders render and dynamically adjust the detail of up to 350,000 individual asteroids with a level of sub-pixel geometric detail and performance that is otherwise impossible to achieve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Asteroids in action, here\nWith DirectX 12 Ultimate, Mesh Shaders will be faster and easier for developers to implement. So look out for worlds with lifelike forests filled with vegetation, mega cities with high levels of detail across the entire screen, and of course, space scenes with massive space stations and stunning asteroid fields.\nFor a deep dive on Mesh Shading\u2019s inner workings, check out Turing architecture graphics and technology article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSampler Feedback\nSampler Feedback shares the same philosophy as Variable Rate Shading: work smarter to reduce GPU load and improve performance. It is enabled by a hardware capability in our GeForce RTX architecture called Texture Space Shading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a developer, a single API for PC and Xbox is a boon for my business. If my programmers know DirectX 12 Ultimate they can code for either PC or console.\n- Koen Deetman, CEO & Game Director, KeokeN Interactive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirtually all of today\u2019s games render new frames \u201cfrom scratch\u201d, meaning that they generally don\u2019t use calculations made prior to that frame (except for temporal anti-aliasing, NVIDIA DLSS, and the occasional post processing technique). But in most games - as in the real world - relatively little changes from frame to frame. If you look outside your window, you might see trees blowing in the wind, pedestrians passing by, or birds flying in the distance. But the majority of the scene is unchanged. The main thing that changes is your point of view.\nSome objects will indeed change appearance as you change your point of view - notably those which are glossy or shiny. But most objects will actually change very little as you move your head, and as such, it\u2019s a waste of precious GPU cycles to keep recalculating the same exact colors that make up those objects every frame. Picture, for example, a wooden telephone pole - regardless of your head and eye position, it looks essentially the same.\nBy using Sampler Feedback, we can more efficiently shade those objects at a lower rate (say, every third frame, or perhaps even lower than that) and reuse the object\u2019s colors (or \u201ctexels\u201d as they\u2019re referred to) as calculated in previous frames. This notion of work reuse can be used for ray tracing, especially in the case of global illumination, which is a common example of a slow-changing and very expensive shading computation.\nFor more info on the tech behind the tech, head here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX Is Game Ready For DirectX 12 Ultimate\nWe\u2019re excited to see the technologies pioneered by NVIDIA engineers and the GeForce RTX architecture come to the standardized DirectX 12 Ultimate API, enabling developers everywhere to easily add these game enhancing technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy investing in next-gen graphics features using DirectX 12 Ultimate, we know our work will benefit gamers on PC and future consoles, and the game will look the way we dreamed.\n- Anton Yudintsev, CEO, Gaijin Entertainment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile DirectX Ray Tracing and Variable Rate Shading are supported in Windows 10 today, Microsoft\u2019s Windows 10 \u201820H1\u2019 update will add DirectX support for Mesh Shading and Sampler Feedback, as well as update DXR to version 1.1. NVIDIA will be ready on the day of Windows 10 20H1 release with full driver support for all the new and updated DirectX 12 Ultimate capabilities.\nAlready, you\u2019ve seen the power of ray tracing in blockbuster games, and the benefits of Variable Rate Shading in Wolfenstein. And now, you can look forward to higher levels of detail thanks to Mesh Shading, and even-faster performance thanks to Sampler Feedback.\nThese features are fully -and currently only- supported by GeForce RTX graphics cards and laptops, so if you own one you\u2019re game ready for all upcoming titles powered by the DirectX 12 Ultimate API.\nFor news about those games, be sure to bookmark GeForce.com, where you\u2019ll find in-depth looks at the latest game tech, GPUs, and NVIDIA game and GPU enhancements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Since its initial release, PUBG has topped Steam\u2019s concurrent player charts and has become one of the most played competitive games on the market.\nIn such a highly competitive title, it\u2019s important to take advantage of every edge you can get - finding the right weapon and tier 3 armor early on can give you a great in-game advantage, but you can also leverage your PC\u2019s hardware to get 144+ FPS and unlock your aiming potential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving a high-refresh monitor and a GPU capable of pushing 144+ FPS grants a number of benefits to any player. The first of these is lower system latency. System latency is the time that passes between a mouse movement or a keypress and when the screen updates with this new information. As you can imagine, having lower latency means you can see and react to targets sooner.\nAnother benefit of high FPS gaming is smoother animations. When you increase the number of frames being displayed per second, there are smaller gaps between each movement on the screen. When you move up from 60 to 144 or 240 FPS, enemy movements will appear more fluid, allowing you to more easily stay on target. For more info, check out our deep-dive into exactly how high FPS improves your gameplay, along with WackyJacky\u2019s video, below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n144 FPS For Competitive Play\nAs you might imagine, PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds is a resource-intensive game that can be very demanding on even the best hardware available. This is due to a number of factors, such as the sheer size of the map and the number of trees, buildings, and other objects that are realistically rendered throughout. You also have to take into account the fact that there are as many as 99 other players in the zone, all of whom you\u2019re trying to spot, regardless of how far away they might be. In order to enjoy the benefits of high FPS, you will need a powerful GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of these considerations, PUBG Corp. recommends players use a GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER for a great competitive experience with a solid, consistent 144 FPS at all times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimizing PUBG\u2019s Settings For 240 FPS\nFor those competitive gamers who wish to get maximum FPS, we have carefully researched the effect that each graphics setting has on both gameplay and performance to find the optimal configuration for competitive play. PUBG tournaments, like the PGS, as well as professional esports players, use GeForce RTX 2080 and 2080 Tis to reach max frame rates.\nAt home, if you have a top tier GeForce RTX GPU, such as the GeForce RTX 2070 or better, and a top tier CPU like the i9-9900K, you can make the push to 240 FPS by using our tuned esports settings.\nAchieving 240 FPS can depend on your in game situation, the map you\u2019re on, and any game changes in recent updates. Furthermore, using max FPS settings does come with a few trade offs: effects like explosions will have reduced image quality, shadows and edges will be a bit blockier, and overall terrain quality will be reduced. If you still want to push for 240 FPS gameplay, follow the steps below:\n1.\u00a0 Set your resolution to 1920x1080 and make sure your display is running at the maximum refresh rate. 2.\u00a0 Next, set your Render Scale to 90, and use the in-game graphics settings below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. After exiting the game, you\u2019ll want to add some sharpening in the NVIDIA Control panel. This will help cancel out some of the visual quality loss from where we changed the Render Scale. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a.

Turn on Image sharpening with default settings, with this driver (or a newer GeForce Game Ready Driver) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne. Apply and close the NVIDIA Control Panel\nIf you use the settings outlined above, you should notice a significant increase in your FPS the next time you go after that coveted chicken dinner. The framerates you achieve will vary depending on the components in your machine, so be sure to tune your hardware for maximum performance by killing unnecessary services, closing perf-sapping programs, and overclocking your CPU, RAM and GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh FPS Results\nAfter digging into the benefits that we\u2019ve outlined above, we spent time studying K/D ratios in both Fortnite and PUBG to see their correlation to high-FPS gaming. If you want a deep dive into what we found, you can read our full study on playing battle royale titles at high FPS.\nOver the past six months, we have spent time pouring over this data and found some other interesting trends related to the amount of time a player spends in a game. As you can see in the chart below, whether you are a weekend warrior or an aspiring professional, there is a correlation between better performance and higher FPS regardless of how much time is spent playing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen all of the available information is looked at as a whole, we can conclude that there is a strong correlation for higher FPS helping maximize your potential in battle royale games like PUBG.\nFor more on High FPS gaming, check out our FramesWinGames page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

On March 26th, developer Remedy is releasing a Control update that adds NVIDIA DLSS 2.0, a new and improved deep learning neural network that further enhances the quality of DLSS. In addition, the update includes new story-based downloadable content, and a bunch of other tweaks and changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 2.0: Big Performance Boosts, Even Better Image Quality\nNVIDIA DLSS is an AI-powered technology that dramatically improves performance, as well as image quality. The latest 2.0 version of DLSS brings significant improvements to the technique, giving GeForce RTX gamers even better image quality. To learn more, check out our dedicated NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 article.\nDLSS 2.0\u2019s Quality Mode in Control delivers sizable improvements throughout the game\u2019s ray-traced offices and otherworldly spaces. Mika Vehkala, Director of Technology at Remedy Entertainment, developer of Control, said, \u201creal-time ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS made Control look amazing at launch, and upgrading to DLSS 2.0 made the game\u2019s image quality better than ever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Control, DLSS 2.0 allows gamers to choose DLSS behaviour based on their preference for max performance, max quality, or a balance between both. This is done by enabling DLSS in-game, selecting a display resolution, and then a DLSS Rendering Resolution, equivalent to the Quality, Balanced and Performance modes seen in other DLSS 2.0 titles.\nAt 1920x1080 and 2560x1440, DLSS 2.0\u2019s Quality mode boosts performance by up to 76% in our testing. And at 4K (3840x2160), Performance mode delivers gains of 2-3X, enabling even GeForce RTX 2060 gamers to run at max settings at a playable framerate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo demonstrate DLSS 2.0\u2019s image quality enhancements, we\u2019ve captured a number of screenshots, comparing DLSS in the original version of Control to DLSS 2.0 in the update launching March 26th. In our first example, below, the level of clarity and sharpness is noticeably improved, especially on the monitor screens, control panels and paperwork.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImages captured at 1440p using DLSS 2.0\u2019s Quality Mode\nElsewhere, text on seals and other detail is similarly improved, enhancing image quality and fidelity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImages captured at 1440p using DLSS 2.0\u2019s Quality Mode\nFlat textured game elements, such as posters and the map below, also see noticeable improvements to clarity and sharpness, as do the monitor screens: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImages captured at 1080p using DLSS 2.0\u2019s Quality Mode\nThough the first implementation of DLSS in Control boosted performance while retaining a comparable level of image quality, there were some specific instances where the image processing algorithm didn\u2019t perform as well, such as areas with a lot of motion. Our deep learning neural network approach in DLSS 2.0 is able to handle these cases much better, as seen in the images below, which demonstrated a significantly improved level of clarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImages captured at 1080p using DLSS 2.0\u2019s Quality Mode\nExpect to see similar improvements to fidelity, clarity, and sharpness throughout the entirety of Control, and its new expansion, when the Control update launches on March 26th. But before it launches, be sure to download and install our new NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 Game Ready Driver for the optimum experience.\nFor news on upcoming integrations of DLSS 2.0, stay tuned to GeForce.com.

This year, the company broke out its in-depth research into \u201cAutomated Vehicle Compute Platforms\u201d and \u201cAutomated Driving Vehicles\u201d leaderboards, ranking the major players in each category.\nIn the 2020 Automated Vehicle Compute Platforms report, NVIDIA led the list of companies developing AV platforms to power the AI that will replace the human driver.\nAutomated Vehicle Compute Platforms Leaderboard\n\u201cNVIDIA is a proven company with a long history of producing really strong hardware and software,\u201d said Sam Abuelsamid, principal research analyst at Navigant and author of both reports. \u201cHaving a platform that produces ever-increasing performance and power efficiency is crucial for the entire industry.\u201d\nWhile NVIDIA provides solutions for developing autonomous vehicles, the Automated Driving Vehicles report covers those who are building such vehicles for production.\u00a0 Manufacturers using these compute platforms include automakers, tier 1 suppliers, robotaxi companies and software startups that are part of the NVIDIA DRIVE ecosystem.\nThese reports are just one piece of the larger autonomous vehicle development picture. While they don\u2019t contain every detail of the current state of self-driving systems, they provide valuable insight into how the industry approaches this transformative technology.\nComputing the Way Forward\nThe Navigant leaderboard uses a detailed methodology in determining both the companies it covers and how they rank.\nThe Automated Vehicle Compute Platforms report looks at those who are developing compute platforms and have silicon designs that are in at least sample production or have plans to be soon. These systems must have fail-operational capability to ensure safety when there\u2019s no human backup at the wheel.\nThe report evaluates companies using factors such as vision, technology, go-to-market strategy and partners. NVIDIA\u2019s top rating is based on leading performance across this wide range of factors.\nNVIDIA Strategy and Execution Scores\nWith the high-performance, energy-efficient DRIVE AGX platform, NVIDIA topped the inaugural leaderboard report for its progress in the space. The platform\u2019s scalable architecture and the open, modular NVIDIA DRIVE software make it easy for autonomous vehicle manufacturers to scale DRIVE solutions to meet their individual production plans.\n\u201cWithout powerful, energy-efficient compute and the reliability and robustness to handle the automotive environment, none of rest would be possible,\u201d Abuelsamid said. \u201cLooking at the current compute platforms, NVIDIA is the clear leader.\u201d\n\nCompute is a critical element to autonomous vehicles. It\u2019s what makes it possible for a vehicle to process in real time the terabytes of data coming in from camera, radar and lidar sensors. It also enables self-driving software to run multiple deep neural networks simultaneously, achieving the diversity and redundancy in operation that is critical for safety. Furthermore, by ensuring a compute platform has enough performance headroom, developers can continuously add features and improve the system over time.\nEmpowering Our Ecosystem\nA second report from Navigant, the Automated Driving Vehicles report, ranks companies developing Level 4 autonomous driving systems \u2014 which don\u2019t require a human backup in defined conditions \u2014 for passenger vehicles.\nThe leaderboard includes announced members of the NVIDIA DRIVE ecosystem such as Baidu, Daimler-Bosch, Ford, Toyota, Volkswagen, Volvo, Voyage and Zoox, as well as many other partners who have yet to be disclosed, all developing autonomous vehicles using NVIDIA end-to-end AI solutions.\nAutomated Driving Vehicles Leaderboard\nThe report notes many of the challenges the industry faces, such as comprehensive validation and production costs. NVIDIA delivers autonomous vehicle development tools from the cloud to the car to help companies address these issues.\nNVIDIA is unique in providing solutions for in the vehicle, as well as the datacenter infrastructure for the AV industry. With NVIDIA DGX systems and advanced AI learning tools, developers can efficiently train the deep neural networks that run in the vehicle on petabytes of data in the data center. These DNNs can then be tested and validated in the virtual world on the same hardware they would run on in the vehicle using the cloud-based, bit-accurate DRIVE Constellation simulation platform.\nThe ability to build a seamless workflow with compatible tools can greatly improve efficiency in development, according to Abuelsamid.\n\u201cAs this technology evolves and matures, developers are going through many iterations of hardware and software,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving an ecosystem that allows you to develop at all different levels, from in-vehicle, to data center, to simulation, and transfer knowledge you\u2019ve gained from one to the other is very important.\u201d\nBy providing our ecosystem with these industry-leading end-to-end solutions, we\u2019re working to bring safer, more efficient transportation to roads around the world, sooner.\nNavigant Research provides syndicated and custom research services across a range of technologies encompassing the energy ecosystem. Mobility reports, including the Automated Driving Leaderboard, the Automated Vehicle Compute Platform leaderboard and the Automated Vehicles Forecast, are available here.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Our teams have been hard at work, hand-in-hand with Mojang, to bring for the first time real-time ray tracing to Minecraft, the world\u2019s best selling game.\nWhen played on a GeForce RTX GPU, you can experience worlds that are fully path-traced, enabling reflections, shadows, caustics, global illumination, and other realistic lighting effects that interact naturally with physically based textures applied to Minecraft\u2019s blocks. These PBR textures enable per-pixel emissives, volumetric effects, and other never-before-seen sights, that together with the path-traced effects usher in the next evolution of Minecraft. Learn more in our GTC Digital talk, available to view here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past few months, we have worked diligently with many talented creators from the Minecraft community to build the first custom ray-traced worlds. Below is a first look at worlds from Razzleberries, BlockWorks and GeminiTay, creators who were selected due to their active imaginations and fantastic track record of making captivating contributions in the Minecraft community.\nThese worlds have been designed to showcase the power of real-time ray tracing and the level of fidelity and immersion that is impossible to otherwise achieve.\nCheck out some examples from the worlds by clicking on the images below to load RTX ON - RTX OFF interactive comparisons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf Temples and Totems RTX. By: Razzleberries - An adventure world focusing players on exploring and completing challenges in mysterious temples. Each temple showcases per-pixel emissivity and real-time shadows, and leverages global illumination to create an immersive experience for players.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrystal Palace RTX. By: GeminiTay. A survival map with a whimsical fantasy theme, that features a masterfully built castle. Ray-traced shadows and beautiful atmospherics create realism in this world built on a 1:1 scale. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImagination Island RTX. By: BlockWorks. A fully explorable theme park, filled with easter eggs, that hosts four distinct lands, each dedicated to an element of real-time ray tracing. In this scene we see the visitor centre of the park, highlighted by god rays cast in real-time through the windows, shining down onto the floor.\nTo take full advantage of Minecraft with RTX\u2019s path traced renderer, we\u2019ve added a physically based materials pipeline that enables the creation of block textures with real-world properties. These can be reflective textures or full mirrors, that work with path tracing to reflect surrounding detail. Or they could be emissive textures that emit light of varying colors and intensities. Or upgraded versions of Minecraft\u2019s default textures, only now with normal maps for added depth and detail, making each texture and material more realistic and immersive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of the new hi-res (1024x1024) and vanilla derivative/low res (16x16) PBR textures applied to Minecraft\u2019s blocks in Minecraft with RTX\nIf you\u2019re a creator, we\u2019ve put together a presentation and how-to guide that dives into the particulars behind Minecraft with RTX\u2019s path tracing and PBR textures. Learn how PBR and path tracing work together to create incredible sights and discover the step-by-step workflow for creating your own PBR textures and texture packs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd if you\u2019re a world builder, or have a favorite Java world you\u2019d like to experience in Minecraft with RTX, we\u2019ve partnered with our Minecraft creators to craft unofficial best-practices to convert your world to Bedrock Windows 10 Edition, which is the basis for the upcoming Minecraft with RTX. It\u2019s all fairly straightforward, but before you convert anything please ensure you backup your worlds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Minecraft Java world converted to Minecraft Bedrock Edition, now ready to be enhanced with PBR textures and ray tracing in Minecraft with RTX.

It\u2019s the story of an impossible fight against a vicious alien race known as the Combine, set after the events of Half-Life, but before Gordon Freeman\u2019s return in Half-Life 2. And it\u2019s only available in Virtual Reality, where Valve can employ new, immersive gameplay, and interactive environmental storytelling where the player is a direct participant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaying as Alyx Vance, you are humanity\u2019s only chance for survival. The Combine\u2019s control of the planet since the Black Mesa incident has only strengthened as they corral the remaining population in cities. Among them are some of Earth\u2019s greatest scientists: you and your father, Dr. Eli Vance.\nAs founders of a fledgling resistance, you\u2019ve continued your clandestine scientific activity\u2014performing critical research, and building invaluable tools for the few humans brave enough to defy the Combine. Take on the Combine in stunning virtual reality: lean to aim around a broken wall and under a Barnacle to make an impossible shot. Immerse yourself in deep environmental interactions, puzzle solving, world exploration, and visceral combat. Rummage through shelves to find a healing syringe and some shotgun shells. Manipulate tools to hack alien interfaces. Toss a bottle through a window to distract an enemy. Rip a Headcrab off your face and throw it out the window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperience the Half-Life universe in an entirely new dimension starting today. For optimum performance, and smooth gameplay in VR, download and install our new Game Ready Driver. And if you want optimized settings for your system, head into GeForce Experience for one-click Optimal Playable Settings, tuned to give you the best possible virtual reality gaming experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 In Control & MechWarrior 5\nToday, we\u2019ve officially released NVIDIA DLSS 2.0, a big leap in AI rendering that uses Tensor Cores on GeForce RTX GPUs to accelerate performance. DLSS 2.0 does this while retaining -and in some cases improving- picture quality and sharpness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlready, DLSS 2.0 is available in Deliver Us The Moon and Wolfenstein: Youngblood, and now it\u2019s in MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries, as part of a new game update.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 2.0 boosts performance significantly in MechWarrior 5, without compromising image quality\nOn March 26th, the award-winning Control follows suit, adding NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 in a new update that launches alongside the game\u2019s much-anticipated story DLC. This upgrade will further improve fidelity in Control, while still offering performance improvements of up to 70% when using DLSS\u2019s highest-quality rendering mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to learn more about NVIDIA DLSS 2.0, we have an in-depth article available to read. In addition, separate articles for both Control and MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries are also available.\nTo get the best experience possible in any supported DLSS 2.0 game, be sure to download and install our newest Game Ready Driver, which includes driver-side tweaks and optimizations for this revolutionary technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Resident Evil 3 & Ghost Recon Breakpoint\nOur new Game Ready Driver also includes support for the Resident Evil 3 remake, launching April 3rd; its demo, which is out now; and its online Resident Evil Resistance multiplayer open beta, launching March 27th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, support is included for Ubisoft\u2019s massive Ghost Recon Breakpoint - Ghost Experience update, which includes a new, optional Vulkan API renderer that may improve your system\u2019s performance.

To help support the many other businesses with GPUs in their servers, we recently made vGPU licenses free for up to 500 users for 90 days to explore their virtualization options.\nBut many still require access to physical Quadro desktop workstations due to specific hardware configurations or data requirements. And we know this situation is hardly unique.\nMany designers, engineers, artists and architects have Quadro RTX mobile workstations that are on par with their desktop counterparts, which helps them stay productive anywhere. However, a vast number of professionals don\u2019t have access to their office-based workstations \u2014 with multiple high-end GPUs, large memory and storage, as well as applications and data.\nThese workstations are critical for keeping\u00a0 everything from family firms to multinational corporations going. And this has forced IT teams to explore different ways to address the challenges of working from home by connecting remotely to an office workstation.\nGetting Started: Tools for Remote Connections\nThe list below shows several publicly available remote-working tools that are helpful to get going quickly. For details on features and licensing, contact the respective providers.\n\nHP ZCentral Remote Boost\nLogMeIn\nMicrosoft Remote Desktop\nNoMachine\nSplashtop\nTeamViewer\nTGX Remote Desktop\nThinLinc\n\nManaging Access, Drivers and Reboots\nOnce you\u2019re up and running, keep these considerations in mind:\nGive yourself a safety net when working on a remote system\u00a0\nThere are times that your tools can stop working, so it\u2019s a good idea to have a safety net. Always install a VNC server on the machine (https://www.tightvnc.com/, https://www.realvnc.com/en/ or others) no matter what remote access tool you use. It\u2019s also a good idea to enable Access to Microsoft Remote Desktop as another option. These run quietly in the background, but are ready if you need them in an emergency\nUpdating your driver remotely\nWe recommend you use a VNC connection to upgrade your drivers. Changing the driver often changes the parts the driver the remote access tools are using, so you often lose the connection. VNC doesn\u2019t connect into the driver at a low level, so keeps working as the old driver is changed out to the new. Once the driver is updated, you can go back to your other remote access tools.\nRebooting your machine remotely\nNormally you can reboot with the windows menus. Give the system a few minutes to restart and then log back in. If your main remote-working tools have stopped functioning, try a VNC connection. You can also restart from a PowerShell Window or command prompt from your local machine with the command: shutdown /r /t 0 /m \\\\[machine-name]\nApp-Specific Resources\nSeveral software makers with applications for professionals working in the manufacturing, architecture, and media and entertainment industries have provided instructions on using their applications from home. Here are links to a few recent articles:\n\nAltair Blog: Combating Global Concerns Through Responsiveness, Support, and Technology Access\nAutodesk News: How Autodesk is helping customers and employees impacted by COVID-19\nDassault Systems: Business Must Go On, Smart Working Safe Working on the Cloud\nHelping You Stay Connected with Autodesk BIM 360 Design\nPTC Blog: PTC\u2019s Commitment to You, Our Customers, During COVID-19\nSiemens Blog: NX Deployment options in a Virtual Working World\nSOLIDWORKS Blog: Office Closed due to coronavirus?

Learn how to create large training clusters and leverage AWS\u2019s new distributed training framework (which was used to achieve the fastest training time for BERT in the cloud).\n\nAditya Bindal, Senior Product Manager, AWS Deep Engine\nIndu Thangakrishnan, Software Development Engineer, AWS Deep Engine\n\nS22493: Improve ML Training Performance with Amazon SageMaker Debugger With Amazon SageMaker Debugger, developers can get complete insights into the training process by automating data capture and analysis from training runs without code changes. We\u2019ll take a closer look at how you can define rules to monitor and analyze tensors and watch for issues in your model.\n\nShashank Prasanna, Senior Advocate, AI/ML\nSatadal Bhattacharjee, Principal Product Manager, AWS Deep Engine\n\nS22483: From Hours to Minutes: The Journey of Optimizing Mask-RCNN and BERT Using MXNet Training large deep learning models like Mask R-CNN and BERT takes lots of time and compute resources. Using MXNet, the Amazon Web Services deep learning framework team has been working with NVIDIA to optimize many different areas to cut the training time from hours to minutes.\n\nHaibin Lin, Applied Scientist, AWS Deep Engine-Engineering\nLin Yuan, Software Development Engineer, Amazon Deep Learning SDK\n\nS21179: Calculating Surface Traversability Using Normal Distribution Transform on NVIDIA TX2 in Amazon Scout Scout is an autonomous robot from Amazon for delivering packages. Mapping its surroundings in real time to identify traversable space is critical for autonomous driving. We\u2019ll discuss how we implemented a technique called \u201c3D Normal Distribution Transform\u201d (3D NDT) on NVIDIA TX2 to calculate surface traversability and help Scout navigate the neighborhood autonomously and safely.\n\nKa Chen, Senior Graphics Engineer, DEX Robotics\n\nS21290: Visuals as a Service (VaaS): How Amazon and Others Create and Use Photoreal On-Demand Product Visuals with RTX Real-Time Raytracing and the Cloud Learn how RTX real-time raytracing, combined with GPU cloud computing, is driving a shift in the way leading retailers like Amazon create visuals for their products. We\u2019ll show how Amazon is using this approach and the migenius RealityServer platform to create and provide product visuals throughout their workflows.\n\nPaul Arden, CEO, migenius\nThomas Dideriksen, Senior Software Developer, Amazon\n\nWe hope you find these sessions educational and we will add new sessions to the GTC Digital session catalog over the next few weeks. You can also apply for a free trial to use NVIDA GPU-based Amazon EC2 P3 and G4 instances.

The report comes from PCGamesN who have found traces of 8 GB variants of the GeForce RTX 2060 graphics cards within listings on EEC (Eurasian Economic Commission). It might seem to indicate that NVIDIA is trying to clear away inventory of its mainstream cards prior to the launch of its next-generation GeForce GPUs.\nNVIDIA Reportedly Prepping An 8 GB Variant of The Turing Based GeForce RTX 2060 Graphics Cards\nNVIDIA's GeForce RTX 2060 has seen a couple of variants with the most recent being the RTX 2060 SUPER which was released officially by NVIDIA and the KO variant which was more of a AIB specific variant from EVGA with toned down costs. Historically, NVIDIA's mainstream 106/116 dies featured slightly lower VRAM compared to the higher-end parts but with the RTX 2060 SUPER, they updated the card with 8 GB GDDR6 VRAM rather than just 6 GB on the standard variant. It looks like NVIDIA AIBs are working on updating the standard variants with 8 GB GDDR6 memory too.\nRelated Story Watch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For UnveilingNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 8 GB Graphics Cards have been listed at EEC. (Image Credits: PCGamesN)\nAccording to the EEC listing, there are at least three variants that have been spotted. The trio of cards are from ASUS and include the following variants:\n\nASUS ROG STRIX GeForce RTX 2060 EVO Gaming 8 GB\nASUS ROG STRIX GeForce RTX 2060 EVO Gaming 8 GB\nASUS ROG STRIX GeForce RTX 2060 EVO Gaming Advanced 8 GB\n\nWhat AIBs are doing here is equipping the GeForce RTX 2060 with 8 GB of memory instead of just 6 GB. The core configuration of the GeForce RTX 2060 8 GB graphics cards lineup is likely to remain untouched with the TU106 GPU core featuring 1920 CUDA cores and 14 Gbps memory dies but the bus interface would get a bump to 256-bit instead of 192-bit. In that case, we are looking at 448 GB per second bandwidth on the RTX 2060 SUPER with 8 GB VRAM.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 20 SUPER Lineup Specifications:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPERNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPERNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPERNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti\n\n\n\n\nGPU ArchitectureTuring GPU (TU106)Turing GPU (TU106)Turing GPU (TU106)Turing GPU (TU104)Turing GPU (TU104)Turing GPU (TU104)Turing GPU (TU102)\n\n\nProcess12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN\n\n\nDie Size445mm2445mm2445mm2545mm2545mm2545mm2754mm2\n\n\nTransistors10.6 Billion10.6 Billion10.6 Billion13.6 Billion13.6 Billion13.6 Billion18.6 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores1920 Cores2176 Cores2304 Cores2560 Cores2944 Cores3072 Cores4352 Cores\n\n\nTMUs/ROPs120/48136/64144/64184/64192/64192/64288/96\n\n\nGigaRays5 Giga Rays/s6 Giga Rays/s6 Giga Rays/s7 Giga Rays/s8 Giga Rays/s8 Giga Rays/s10 Giga Rays/s\n\n\nCache4 MB L2 Cache4 MB L2 Cache4 MB L2 Cache4 MB L2 Cache4 MB L2 Cache4 MB L2 Cache6 MB L2 Cache\n\n\nBase Clock1365 MHz1470 MHz1410 MHz1605 MHz1515 MHz1650 MHz1350 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock1680 MHz1650 MHz1620 MHz\n1710 MHz OC1770 MHz1710 MHz\n1800 MHz OC1815 MHz1545 MHz\n1635 MHz OC\n\n\nCompute6.5 TFLOPs7.5 TFLOPs7.5 TFLOPs9.1 TFLOPs10.1 TFLOPs11.1 TFLOPs13.4 TFLOPs\n\n\nMemoryUp To 6 GB GDDR6Up To 8 GB GDDR6Up To 8 GB GDDR6Up To 8 GB GDDR6Up To 8 GB GDDR6Up To 8 GB GDDR6Up To 11 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Speed14.00 Gbps14.00 Gbps14.00 Gbps14.00 Gbps14.00 Gbps15.50 Gbps14.00 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Interface192-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit352-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth336 GB/s448 GB/s448 GB/s448 GB/s448 GB/s496 GB/s616 GB/s\n\n\nPower Connectors8 Pin8 Pin8 Pin8+6 Pin8+8 Pin8+8 Pin8+8 Pin\n\n\nTDP160W175W185W (Founders)\n175W (Reference)215W225W (Founders)\n215W (Reference)250W260W (Founders)\n250W (Reference)\n\n\nStarting Price$349 US$399 US$499 US$499 US$699 US$699 US$999 US\n\n\nPrice (Founders Edition)$349 US$399 US$599 US$499 US$699 US$699 US$1,199 US\n\n\nLaunchJanuary 2019July 2019October 2018July 2019September 2018July 2019September 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the recent price cut on the RTX 2060 graphics cards, we would be looking at around $330 to $350 US asking price for the 8 GB variants since the SUPER variant start at $400 US. This could be a possible inventory clear up of older TU106 GPUs that are in the hands of AIBs prior to the launch of NVIDIA's next-generation GeForce graphics cards or an AIB specific launch since EVGA released its own KO series with much lower price points than the rest of the 2060's available out in the market.\nThe variant will still be competing against the Radeon RX 5600 XT 6 GB which offers higher GPU/graphics performance than the standard RTX 2060 but an 8 GB memory might give the RTX 2060 a slight edge at higher resolutions, that is if it has the core performance to run those titles at the said resolution. There's no available launch date but we might get to see the new 8 GB RTX 2060 graphics cards in a couple of months.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n77\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n49\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n46\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nTesla Records Its Best Sales Week Of The Year So Far In China As Bulls Flock To Poke Holes In Mark Rober\u2019s FSD-Denigrating Video\n\n\n\n41\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

SwiftStack develops object storage software that is used for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing applications. As a part of NVIDIA, SwiftStack will continue supporting its existing programs and develop new ones, primarily with NVIDIA\u2019s hardware in mind.\nSwiftStack was founded in November 2011 and raised $23.6 million in total. The company is primarily known for its SwiftStack 7, 1space, ProxyFS, Swift, and the Controller products, but market observers do not think that it was a really successful company. Throughout its history, SwiftStack has worked with many companies, including Ebay, Google, NVIDIA, and Valohai. Furthermore, the company has experience with hardware from Cisco, Dell, HPE, and SuperMicro.\n\nAfter it is integrated as a part of NVIDIA, SwiftStack will continue to develop, support, and enhance\u00a0its programs. Meanwhile, the key mission of the team will be to work on NVIDIA\u2019s GPU-powered AI infrastructure and accelerate large scale AI DL pipelines.\n\nIn the recent years, NVIDIA has been meticulously collecting technologies and IP for datacenters,\u00a0with supercomputers in particular being a key aspiration, which emphasizes the focus of the company which has moved beyond just computer graphics in all of its forms. Last year NVIDIA announced a plan to acquire Mellanox, which makes connectivity solutions for servers. The takeover of SwiftStack, an object storage company, is another way to collect assets required for scalable GPU-powered infrastructure for deep learning.\n\nTerms and conditions of the deal were not disclosed, but the two companies expect the transaction to close in the coming weeks.\nRelated Reading:\n\nNVIDIA To Acquire Datacenter Networking Firm Mellanox for $6.9 Billion\nNVIDIA Axes GTC Digital Keynote In Favor Of News Releases; Fate Of Major Announcements Unknown\nNVIDIA's 2020 GTC Becomes Latest Coronavirus Event Casualty: Now Digital-Only\nNVIDIA Releases Q4 FY2020 Earnings: A Strong Quarter Closes Out A Weaker Year\n\nSources: SwiftStack, StorageNewsletter\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n5 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\njeremyshaw - Tuesday, March 10, 2020 - link\nI'm somewhat struggling to figure out what SwiftStack does that is special.It does seem to be a software(?) abstraction layer for massive and varied storage systems?Is/Are their key advantages scalability? Flexability? Performance across distant supercomputing clusters/centers?What is their advantage in Nvidia's portfolio? Is Nvidia doing this as a defensive maneuver, like Mellanox? Is there some sort of special IP involved? Is the real aquisition the talent?Is this a ramp up for GTC news releases and investor call? Is the aquisition cost (not disclosed? not finished?) small enough to not warrent regulator approval?Are their offices close enough to merge, or are we looking at an Icera-like situation, where the other team is still largely doing their own thing?\n\n\n\nolafgarten - Tuesday, March 10, 2020 - link\nFrom what I can tell, they have two products, one named Storage which is an on-prem object storage program, sort of like MinIO, which lets you also access it as an NTFS/SMB store.Their second product is 1space, and seems to be a multi-cloud object storage, in that data can be stored in many different places but accessed centrally. I can't see why anyone would need to use this though.\n\n\n\nPaulHoule - Sunday, March 15, 2020 - link\nStorage companies get acquired for no reason all the time,  probably because they fail and can get picked up cheap.The diagram that shows Swiftstack used for ML training data looks delusional.  If you are tagging images, for instance,  you will probably put the images in an object store.  The tags are really small in comparison and are a better fit for a database,  particularly if you want to spool some subset of them to the trainer in a hurry.\n\n\n\nLakados - Monday, March 16, 2020 - link\nThey own the IP for a couple of file storage systems and file formats that improve throughput speeds related to AI specific tasks that assist in reducing training time on images in particular, but could be expanded on with the right research. \n\n\n\nspaces - Monday, March 16, 2020 - link\nWorth going through this article.

Public Preview at NVIDIA\u2019s GPU Technology Conference (GTC).\t\t\n\n\nWe\u2019re expanding the Microsoft Azure Stack Edge with NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPU preview during the GPU Technology Conference (GTC Digital). Azure Stack Edge is a cloud-managed appliance that brings Azure\u2019s compute, storage, and machine learning capabilities to the edge for fast local analysis and insights. With the included NVIDIA GPU, you can bring hardware acceleration to a diverse set of machine learning (ML) workloads.\nWhat\u2019s new with Azure Stack Edge\nAt Mobile World Congress in November 2019, we announced a preview of the NVIDIA GPU version of Azure Stack Edge and we\u2019ve seen incredible interest in the months that followed. Customers in industries including retail, manufacturing, and public safety are using Azure Stack Edge to bring Azure capabilities into the physical world and unlock scenarios such as the real-time processing of video powered by Azure Machine Learning.\nThese past few months, we\u2019ve taken our customers\u2019 feedback to make key improvements and are excited to make our preview available to even more customers today.\nIf you\u2019re not already familiar with Azure Stack Edge, here are a few of the benefits:\n\nAzure Machine Learning: Build and train your model in the cloud, then deploy it to the edge for FPGA or GPU-accelerated inferencing.\nEdge Compute: Run IoT, AI, and business applications in containers at your location. Use these to interact with your local systems, or to pre-process your data before it transfers to Azure.\nCloud Storage Gateway: Automatically transfer data between the local appliance and your Azure Storage account.\u00a0 Azure Stack Edge caches the hottest data locally and speaks file and object protocols to your on-prem applications.\nAzure-managed appliance: Easily order and manage Azure Stack Edge from the Azure Portal.\u00a0 No initial capex fees; pay as you go, just like any other Azure service.\n\nEnabling our partners to bring you world-class business applications\nEqually important to bringing you a great device is enabling our partners to bring you innovative applications to meet your business needs.\u00a0 We\u2019d love to share some of the continued investment we\u2019re making with partners to bring their exciting developments to you.\nAs self-checkouts grow in prevalence, Malong Technologies is innovating in AI applications for loss prevention.\n\n\u201cFor our customers in the retail industry, artificial intelligence innovation is happening at the edge,\u201d said Matt Scott, co-founder and chief executive officer, Malong Technologies. \u201cAlong with our state-of-the-art solutions, our customers need hardware that is powerful, reliable, and custom-tailored for the cloud. Microsoft\u2019s Azure Stack Edge fits the bill perfectly. We\u2019re proud to be a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner, working with Microsoft to help our retail customers succeed.\u201d\n\nIncreasing your manufacturing organization\u2019s quality inspection accuracy is key to Mariner\u2019s Spyglass Visual Inspection application.\n\n\u201cMariner has standardized on Microsoft\u2019s Azure Stack Edge for our Spyglass Visual Inspection and Spyglass Connected Factory products. These solutions are mission critical to our manufacturing customers. Azure Stack Edge provides the performance, stability and availability they require.\u201d \u2013 Phil Morris, CEO, Mariner \n\nBuilding computer vision solutions to improve performance and safety in manufacturing and other industries is a key area of innovation for XXII.\n\n\u201cXXII is thrilled to be a Microsoft partner and we are working together to provide our clients with real time video analysis software on edge with the Azure Stack Edge box. With this solution, Azure allow us to harvest the full potential of NVIDIA GPUs directly on edge and be able to provide our clients in retail, industry and smart city with smart video analysis that are easily deployable, scalable and easily manageable with Azure stack Edge.\u201d \u2013 Souheil Hanoune, Chief Scientific Officer, XXII\n\nMore to come with Azure Stack Edge\nThere are even more exciting developments with Azure Stack Edge coming. We\u2019re putting the final touches on much-awaited new compute and AI capabilities including virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, and multi-node support. Along with these new features announced at Ignite 2019, Data Box Edge was renamed Azure Stack Edge to align with the Azure Stack portfolio.\nOur Rugged series for sites with harsh or remote environments is also coming this year, including the battery-powered form-factor that can be carried in a backpack. The versatility of these Azure Stack Edge form-factors and cloud-managed capabilities brings cloud intelligence and compute to retail stores, factory floors, hospitals, field operations, disaster zones, and rescue operations.\n\nGet started with the Azure Stack Edge with NVIDIA GPU preview\nThank you for continuing to partner with us as we bring new capabilities to Azure Stack Edge. We\u2019re looking forward to hearing from you.\n\nTo get started with the preview, please email us and we\u2019ll follow up to learn more about your scenarios.\nLearn more about Azure Stack Edge.\n\nLearn more about Azure\u2019s Hybrid Strategy\nRead about more updates from Azure during NVIDIA\u2019s GTC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRelated Posts\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnouncements\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMar 3\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3 min read\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nMicrosoft completes landmark EU Data Boundary, offering enhanced data residency and transparency\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnouncements\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJan 14\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t6 min read\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nAzure Storage\u2014A look back and a look forward\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnouncements\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOct 21, 2024\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t4 min read\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nMicrosoft recognized once again as a Leader for its Ability to execute and Completeness of vision in 2024 Gartner\u00ae Magic Quadrant\u2122 for Distributed Hybrid Infrastructure\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploreAzure AI solutions\n\nThe future of AI starts here.

With Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), NVIDIA set out to redefine real-time rendering through AI-based super resolution - rendering fewer pixels and then using AI to construct sharp, higher resolution images. With our latest 2.0 version of DLSS, we\u2019ve made big advances towards this vision.\nPowered by dedicated AI processors on GeForce RTX GPUs called Tensor Cores, DLSS 2.0 is a new and improved deep learning neural network that boosts frame rates while generating beautiful, crisp game images. It gives gamers the performance headroom to maximize ray tracing settings and increase output resolutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 2.0 offers several key enhancements over the original version:\n\nSuperior Image Quality - DLSS 2.0 offers image quality comparable to native resolution while rendering only one quarter to one half of the pixels. It employs new temporal feedback techniques for sharper image details and improved stability from frame to frame. \nGreat Scaling Across All GeForce RTX GPUs and Resolutions - A new AI network more efficiently uses Tensor Cores to execute 2X faster than the original. This improves frame rates and eliminates previous limitations on which GPUs, settings, and resolutions could be enabled. \nOne Network For All Games - The original DLSS required training the AI network for each new game. DLSS 2.0 trains using non-game-specific content, delivering a generalized network that works across games. This means faster game integrations, and ultimately more DLSS games. \nCustomizable Options - DLSS 2.0 offers users 3 image quality modes - Quality, Balanced, Performance - that control the game\u2019s internal rendering resolution, with Performance mode enabling up to 4X super resolution (i.e. 1080p \u2192 4K). This means more user choice, and even bigger performance boosts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeliver Us the Moon - DLSS 2.0 substantially boosts performance while maintaining --and in some cases improving-- image quality.\nNVIDIA DLSS 2.0 is already available in Deliver Us The Moon and Wolfenstein: Youngblood; launches in MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries today; and comes to Control via a game patch on March 26th. Also, DLSS 2.0 is now available to Unreal Engine 4 developers\u00a0through the DLSS Developer Program that will accelerate deployment in one of the world\u2019s most popular game engines. If you\u2019re a developer, head here to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 2.0 - Under the Hood\nUsing our Neural Graphics Framework, NGX, the DLSS deep neural network is trained on a NVIDIA DGX-powered supercomputer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 2.0 has two primary inputs into the AI network:\n\nLow resolution, aliased images rendered by the game engine\nLow resolution, motion vectors from the same images -- also generated by the game engine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotion vectors tell us which direction objects in the scene are moving from frame to frame. We can apply these vectors to the previous high resolution output to estimate what the next frame will look like. We refer to this process as \u2018temporal feedback,\u2019 as it uses history to inform the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 Architecture\nA special type of AI network, called a convolutional autoencoder, takes the low resolution current frame, and the high resolution previous frame, to determine on a pixel-by-pixel basis how to generate a higher quality current frame.\nDuring the training process, the output image is compared to an offline rendered, ultra-high quality 16K reference image, and the difference is communicated back into the network so that it can continue to learn and improve its results. This process is repeated tens of thousands of times on the supercomputer until the network reliably outputs high quality, high resolution images.\nOnce the network is trained, NGX delivers the AI model to your GeForce RTX PC or laptop via Game Ready Drivers and OTA updates. With Turing\u2019s Tensor Cores delivering up to 110 teraflops of dedicated AI horsepower, the DLSS network can be run in real-time simultaneously with an intensive 3D game. This simply wasn\u2019t possible before Turing and Tensor Cores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew DLSS Announcements And Integrations\nSince the publication of this article, we've been busy working on further improvements to DLSS, new DLSS features, and new integrations of DLSS into popular games:\n\nGeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs were unveiled. Featuring 2nd Generation Ray Tracing Cores, and 3rd Generation Tensor Cores, GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs make RTX and DLSS-enhanced games run even faster. \nDLSS is coming to Cyberpunk 2077, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Fortnite, Watch Dogs: Legion, Boundary, and Bright Memory: Infinite.\nWe are introducing a new DLSS Ultra Performance Mode for 8K gaming on the GeForce RTX 3090. At the time of writing, the new mode will be coming to Boundary, Bright Memory: Infinite, Control, Death Stranding, Justice, Minecraft with RTX Beta for Windows 10, Ready or Not, Scavengers, Watch Dogs Legion, and Wolfenstein: Youngblood.\nDeath Stranding launched with NVIDIA DLSS, helping gamers deliver packages across the ruins of the game's United States at record framerates.\nF1 2020 was updated with NVIDIA DLSS, enabling gamers with GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER graphics cards to play at over 60 FPS at 4K, and giving gamers with faster GPUs even better performance in the fast-paced racer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 2.0 In Action\nLet\u2019s take a look at how DLSS 2.0 improves performance and image quality in each of the first four games to implement the technology: Control, Deliver Us The Moon, MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries, and Wolfenstein: Youngblood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\nRemedy Entertainment\u2019s Control was one of 2019\u2019s best single-player games, and also one of its most advanced, with a suite of ray-traced effects that took its graphical fidelity to new heights. \u00a0\nControl originally launched with a prior version of DLSS that used an image processing algorithm to boost frame rates by over 70%. On March 26th, Remedy is releasing an update that adds new story-based downloadable content along with the latest AI-powered DLSS 2.0.\n\u201cWith Control, we set out to create a visually stunning and immersive world,\u201d said Mika Vehkala, Director of Technology at Remedy Entertainment. \u201cReal-time ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS made Control look amazing at launch, and upgrading to DLSS 2.0 made the game\u2019s image quality better than ever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 1920x1080 and 2560x1440, DLSS 2.0\u2019s Quality mode boosts performance by up to 76% in our testing. And at 4K (3840x2160), Performance mode delivers gains of 2-3X, enabling even GeForce RTX 2060 gamers to run at max settings at a playable framerate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the original implementation of DLSS in Control boosted performance and provided great image quality across most scenes, it tended to struggle in areas with objects in motion. In contrast, DLSS 2.0 is able to handle these cases much more effectively as seen in the image of a spinning fan below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImages captured at 1080p using DLSS 2.0\u2019s Quality Mode\nThe latest version of DLSS also improves image quality where the details are a bit more subtle. The following images show additional examples of improvements from the original version of DLSS to the updated version of DLSS 2.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImages captured at 1440p using DLSS 2.0\u2019s Quality Mode\nElsewhere, text on seals and other detail is similarly improved, enhancing image quality and fidelity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImages captured at 1440p using DLSS 2.0\u2019s Quality Mode\nAnd flat textured game elements, such as posters and the map below, also see noticeable improvements to clarity and sharpness \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImages captured at 1080p using DLSS 2.0\u2019s Quality Mode\nTo get DLSS 2.0 for Control, download and install our newest Game Ready Driver, and on March 26th download a new Control game update. Enable DLSS in-game, select a display resolution, and then a DLSS Rendering Resolution, equivalent to the Quality, Balanced and Performance modes seen in other DLSS 2.0 titles.\nDeliver Us The Moon\nKeokeN Interactive\u2019s space and Moon-based adventure, Deliver Us The Moon, added ray-traced effects and DLSS 2.0 late last year, boosting its beauty and performance. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe never expected the image quality in Deliver Us The Moon to increase when DLSS was enabled, but that is exactly what we experienced,\u201d said Koen Deetman, CEO and Game Director at KeokeN Interactive. \u201cThis coupled with real-time ray tracing, and the huge performance boost from DLSS, gives our players the ultimate Deliver Us The Moon experience without any compromises.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance leaps by 60% in a single bound with NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 enabled in Deliver Us The Moon\nThroughout the game, DLSS 2.0 delivers image quality on par with native resolution gameplay utilizing Deliver Us The Moon\u2019s built-in Temporal Anti-Aliasing technique. Under closer examination, DLSS 2.0 even shows subtle improvements, with better fidelity on railings and other fine detail:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other instances, DLSS 2.0 delivers clear improvements, such as on intricate cyclone fencing, which boasts better image quality and superior temporal stability (clarity while the player\u2019s view is moving).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd on the game\u2019s many computer displays and surfaces with miniscule text, DLSS 2.0 shows more detail at a greater level of clarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMechWarrior 5: Mercenaries\nPiranha Games\u2019 MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries is the latest game to add NVIDIA DLSS 2.0, and as in other DLSS-enhanced titles, performance improves dramatically, with gains of up to 75% recorded when using Quality mode:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNVIDIA DLSS 2.0 basically gives our players a free performance boost, without sacrificing image quality\u201d said Russ Bullock, President at Piranha Games. \u201cIt was also super easy to implement with NVIDIA\u2019s new SDK, so it was a no brainer for us to add it to MechWarrior 5.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage quality is also improved with NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 in a number of cases. In the comparison below, captured at 1440p using Quality mode, DLSS adds sharp detail to the intricate parts of the \u2018mech, showing the wear and tear. In addition, DLSS also stabilizes the cyclone fencing on top of the building, for better fidelity during gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, captured at 1080p with Quality Mode, DLSS maintains sharp, clear image quality while boosting frame rates. Note also the fine line details on the barn and the increased fidelity of the fields of grain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, in this example captured at 1080p using Quality mode, DLSS restores the guard railing at the top of the wall, and sharpens smaller details both on the wall and the areas on either side of the gate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWolfenstein: Youngblood\nBethesda and Machine Games\u2019 Wolfenstein: Youngblood is the first Vulkan-powered title to add ray tracing and DLSS 2.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the gate Wolfenstein: Youngblood performs extremely well, and with DLSS 2.0 it gets even faster:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was critically important to us that our game standout both visually and from a performance perspective,\u201d said Jim Kjellin CTO at MachineGames, developer of Wolfenstein: Youngblood. \u201cAdding NVIDIA DLSS enabled us to get the best of both worlds, maximum performance with incredible image quality.\"\nDLSS maintains detail, while also improving image quality in certain spots. In the example below, grating on the right side of the screen, and the pipes on the building in the center, are more defined and detailed with DLSS 2.0 enabled, compared to Wolfenstein: Youngblood\u2019s highest-quality TAA mode:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear improvements are evident in other locations, too. For example, our second comparison sees detail increase significantly on the building to the right, and the antennas on the roof become clearer and more visible, improving the quality of the scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS Continues to Learn\nWith the Turing architecture, we set out to change gaming with two big leaps in graphics: real-time ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS. Ray tracing brings next-generation realism, while DLSS boosts framerates to help you enjoy those stunning ray-traced visuals.\nWith NVIDIA DLSS 2.0, we\u2019ve made big leaps in image quality and performance, all while paving the way for easier integration so gamers can enjoy the technology in more and more games. And thanks to the power of AI, our DLSS network will continue to grow and improve over time.\nWe hope you get a chance to try out our latest work in MechWarrior 5 and Control this week, and stay tuned to GeForce.com for more news on upcoming DLSS games and advancements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Clara Lim   31 March 2020 13 min read          I love buying and selling stuff on Carousell as much as the next person (actually, probably a lot more), but the one thing that I hate is having to deal by mail or meetup.  It\u2019s such a nightmare. I yearn for the day I no longer need to queue at SingPost to mail my sold items, wait in vain for a parcel that was supposed to arrive 2 months ago, or tell that irritating buyer for the 27th time that no, I will NOT be in the Punggol vicinity anytime soon.  I picture a day when decluttering is as simple as tapping a button, paying a few bucks, and BOOM! unwanted item ejected out of my life. These days, it might actually be possible. Courier and delivery services trying to offer solutions to regular consumers have been popping up everywhere. Let\u2019s find out what\u2019s on the market right now, and which ones are the most value-for-money. \u00a0 Courier services Singapore (2020) \u2013 which delivery service is cheapest? In the absence of a universal pricing structure for the courier services I\u2019m comparing, I used an imaginary scenario to generate consistent price quotes: Bishan Community Centre (pick up) to Bedok Mall (drop off).  I also did price estimates for parcels of 2 different sizes: Small parcel: a toy drone, 20x20x10cm, 2kg Bulky item: an IKEA standing desk, 110x70x50cm, 20kg  Since I don\u2019t care about the time frame, I\u2019ve selected the cheapest option offered by each courier service. This means there\u2019s a huge variation from immediate (e.g. GrabExpress) to a week or more (e.g. SingPost). Tap on each one to jump straight to the section about them.  Courier serviceSmall parcel deliveryBulky item delivery Park N Parcel$3\u2013 SingPost$3.50\u2013 Qxpress$4.50\u2013 Yojee$12\u2013 TaQbin$9\u2013 UParcel$9\u2013 Lalamove$14$36 Gogovan$16$34 Fast Fast Delivery$18$20 Grab Express$18$21 GetVan\u2013$34.20  \u00a0 Park N Parcel  And the winner for cheapest small parcel delivery is\u2026 surprise, surprise! Not SingPost, but Park N Parcel. This is not a door-to-door delivery service, but a platform that tries to provide an alternative to SingPost with the help of retail stores. How it works: You get a delivery label which you then print and paste on your parcel. Drop off your parcel at one of the shops listed as Parker Points (located in shopping malls islandwide). Within 3 working days from the day of drop-off, Park N Parcel will move it to the other Parker Point that the recipient designated as their preferred meeting place. Voila, no more squabbles about which MRT station to meet at.   Story continues Parcel restrictions: Max. weight 8kg, max. size 100cm (length + width + height)Delivery fee: $3, which you can recoup almost immediately with your (and the buyer/seller\u2019s) savings on public transport fare.Back to top\u00a0SingPost / SingPost SmartPac\u201cSingapore is so efficient! I love how everything works so well!\u201d says every newly-arrived expat in Singapore\u2026 until the first time they try to send something by SingPost. I kid, I kid. SingPost is the classic standby, and they do still offer some of the cheapest rates for packages up to 2kg. If you exceed the weight limit, there\u2019s also the SmartPac postage-paid envelopes which accommodate up to 3kg.Lead time is usually 2 to 4 working days for both normal mail and SmartPac, but it can fluctuate depending on the volume of mail SingPost gets. Parcel restrictions: Max. weight 2kg (normal mail) / 3kg (SmartPac). Further size restrictions apply for SmartPac: 19x30x6.5cm.Delivery fees: See SingPost rates here. Postage for a small (non-paper) parcel ranges from $1.80 (500g) to $3.50 (2kg). SmartPac costs $4.70 (up to 3kg).Back to top\u00a0Qxpress Qoo10\u2019s in-house delivery service, Qxpress, used to courier goods mainly for businesses that set up shop on the e-commerce giant, but it\u2019s now open to regular consumers too. It\u2019s now the cheapest door-to-door delivery service on the market. Hurray!How it works: Delivery operates from Mondays to Saturdays, and there are 2 types of courier services: standard delivery (cheaper) and quick delivery.QX standard delivery:Parcels up to 30kg Width + length + height up to 160cm You can only select a pickup date from the next day onwards (no same-day orders) Delivery is done anytime from 10am to 7pm (no specific timeslot) QX quick delivery:Parcels up to 30kg Width + length + height up to 200cm, but max. length for each side is 100cm You can get the item picked up and delivered on the same day if there are slots available You can choose a pickup timeslot Delivery is done in about 1 to 2 hours after pickup Follow the steps here to place an order for a Qxpress delivery. You can also buy coupons on the Qxpress store but currently there are no cost savings.Delivery fees: Qxpress standard delivery charges by weight, while quick delivery charges by size (W + L + H). Here\u2019s a table of their rates. \u00a0 Parcel weightStandard deliveryQuick delivery 5kg$4.50(up to 30kg) $5.99 $0.50 distance shopping charge for every subsequent 1km (after first 10km) 10kg$7.50 15kg$10.50 20kg$13.50 25kg$18.50 30kg$22.50 Notice that for some parcels (heavy but compact, such as electronics) it\u2019s actually more worth it to opt for quick delivery.Back to top\u00a0YojeeSimilar to Qxpress, door-to-door delivery service Yojee recently updated their services to allow deliveries up to 35kg in weight (previously 50kg).How it works: There are several options, with next day delivery being the cheapest. Yojee picks up the item on day 1 and delivers it on day 2. Delivery timeslot is not guaranteed, but if the delivery fails, they offer one free re-delivery on day 3.For same day delivery, Yojee will pick up & drop off the item during their working hours from 10am to 10pm. You can only choose from 2 delivery slots: 10am to 2pm / 2pm to 6pm.3-hour delivery is just what it says on the tin: Delivery picked up and completed within 3 hours, with the cut off time for pickup being 6pm.Parcel restrictions: Max. weight 30kg, max. parcel dimensions 53x53x53cm. Delivery fees: Yojee delivery rates below. For the more expensive options, delivery rates depend on the distance between the pickup and delivery points. For next day deliveries, the rates depend on the number of parcels to be delivered: Parcel size / weightNext day deliverySame day delivery3-hour delivery 29x29x29cm / 5kg$12$10 to $28$14 to $36 36x36x36cm / 10kg$14$12 to $32$16 to $40 46x46x46cm / 20kg$16$16 to $36$20 to $44 53x53x53cm / 30kg$18$20 to $42$24 to $40 Back to top\u00a0TaQbin Japanese logistics company TaQbin has been around for a realllly long time \u2013 I still remember their booths outside the big National Library book sales at the Singapore Expo. While they\u2019re not as shiny or cheap as the newcomers, their reputation is solid.How it works: TaQbin doesn\u2019t do pickups unless you\u2019re a corporate customer and/or have at least 3 packages to deliver. Instead, you\u2019ll need to find a TaQbin dropoff box or office near you. But in return, you get a $1 discount.There\u2019s a paper form you need to fill out to indicate the date of your delivery. The default is next day delivery, but you can choose any date you want (including Sat) within 1 week. You can\u2019t pick a specific timeslot, but they have free re-delivery for missed parcels.Parcel restrictions: Max. weight 25kg, max. parcel dimensions (width + length + height) 160cm.Delivery fees: Fees are totally dependent on parcel size but not weight. Therefore, TaQbin is great if you\u2019re delivering small but heavy items, such as books. Parcel size (W+L+H)TaQbin delivery rates 60cm$9 80cm$11 100cm$13 120cm$17 140cm$25 160cm$30 Back to top\u00a0UParcelCourier service UParcel is not particularly cheap, but the selling point is that they have many, many delivery options available, including express (3-hour) and rush (1-hour) deliveries. Of course, these will cost significantly more than regular delivery.Another perk is that they give discounts for multiple parcels from the same pickup point & destination, ranging from 20% discount (2 parcels) to 60% off (7 parcels). Parcel restrictions: Max. weight 25kg, max. parcel dimensions (width + length + height) 200cm.Delivery fees: Fees vary with the parcel size and weight, as well as speed of delivery. Since there are so many options available, I selected the cheapest (next day delivery) and the common express (3-hour delivery) options to compare: Parcel size / weightNext day delivery3-hour delivery 60cm / 1kg$8$13 80cm / 5kg$9$15 100cm / 8kg$11$17 120cm / 10kg$14$19 140cm / 15kg$17$22 160cm / 20kg$20$25 200cm / 25kg$24$28 Back to top\u00a0LalamoveLalamove is primarily a moving services company with lorries and vans, but they actually also have a full suite of vehicles like motorcycles and cars for moving smaller items.Prices are pretty high, but on the flip side, delivery is immediate. The recipient doesn\u2019t need to hang around all day waiting for a delivery scheduled for \u201c10am to 7pm\u201d.Parcel restrictions: Pretty much no parcel restrictions, because they have big vans and lorries for massive items. So go ahead, buy that second-hand piano on Carousell.Delivery fees: Lalamove rates depend on the transport vehicle, which in turn depends on the size and weight on your parcel. Parcel size / weightVehicleDelivery rates 40x25x25cm / 8kgMotorcycle$10 + $0.30/km 70x50x50cm / 20kgCar$15 + $0.40/km  160x120x100cm / 350kg1.7m van$30 + $0.50/km  230x120x120cm / 500kg2.4m van$38 + $0.50/km  Rates are taxi-style: The base fare covers a certain distance, and beyond that it\u2019s a distance-based fee. You can easily get a quote on the website; when I keyed in Bishan and Bedok, I got $14 for the motorcycle delivery (small parcel) and $36 for the 1.7m van (big parcel).Although rates are high, there\u2019s one advantage to using Lalamove for delivering bulky items. If you get a van, the driver will help you with moving and loading the goods for free.You can also pay for additional stops ($3 for motorbike, $5 for car, $8 or $11 for van). So, it\u2019s possible to save money by doing multiple deliveries in the same run.Back to top\u00a0GogovanA competitor of companies like Lalamove, Gogovan\u2019s delivery services work pretty much the same way \u2013 book a vehicle, get your stuff delivered right away. Rates depend on the distance travelled, and there are different rates depending on vehicle type. One drawback is that you can\u2019t get an exact rate without signing up for an account. In my Bishan-to-Bedok experiment, I was quoted \u201cfrom $15\u201d for delivering a small item (30x20x20cm, max. 10kg). Turns out that the quote is actually $16, but you need to sign up for an account and log in first for the accurate quote.Meanwhile, delivery starts from $34 for a large/bulky item (i.e. anything over 30x20x20cm or over 30kg).Parcel restrictions: None.Delivery fee: Get a quotation from Gogovan.Back to top\u00a0Fast Fast DeliveryLike Lalamove, Fast Fast Delivery also offers instant delivery. However, you can\u2019t pre-order the service: You can only book it when you need it, Grab-style. Not great if you need peace of mind, but if you have flexibility, it offers really low prices for bulky deliveries.How it works: Book a delivery when you need it (the service is available 24/7). When you make a booking, the system matches you with available drivers and assigns the nearest one to you for immediate pickup and delivery. You can expect the delivery to be completed within 90 minutes.Parcel restrictions: Max. weight 50kg. No dimensions stipulated but just make sure you choose the correct vehicle type if you\u2019re transporting a bulky item.Delivery fee: There\u2019s a price guide here but it\u2019s better to just get a quote since fares are distance-based. You get charged a parcel delivery fee (for parcel weight) + distance fare (like Grab).For my imaginary parcels, I got quoted $18 for the small parcel and $20 for the large one. The fare for the large parcel is the cheapest one I found among the providers.Back to top\u00a0Grab Express / Grab DeliveryYou might have noticed a \u201cDelivery\u201d button when you open the Grab app these days. This leads you to Grab\u2019s latest foray, GrabExpress, which is an on-demand instant delivery service along the likes of Lalamove and Fast Fast Delivery.How it works: Same as how you would order a GrabCar \u2013 just key in your pickup location and destination to get a quote. When you tap \u201cBook\u201d, the job will be assigned to someone, who will pick up and deliver the item immediately. The service is available from 8am to 11pm daily for motorbike deliveries, and 10am to 4pm daily for car deliveries..Parcel restrictions: Max. weight 20kg, max. parcel dimensions 70x50x50cm.Delivery fee: The official fee is $6 base fare + $1 per additional km (first 5km) for motorbikes and $9 base fare + $1.20 per additional km (first 5km) for cars. When I entered my route (Bishan to Bedok) it cost $18 (motorbike) / $21 (car). A shorter route, such as Holland Village to Orchard, costs $14 (motorbike) / $22 (car).Back to top\u00a0GetVan Similar to Lalamove, GetVan is primarily a moving service with a range of vans and lorries. But if you\u2019re trying to transport a bulky item, they offer pretty competitive rates for one-off deliveries too.How it works: First pick the van size you want. The smallest van accommodates 140x140x140cm and there\u2019s no weight limit. You can book on the same day (if available) or in advance. If you\u2019re planning to do multiple stops or going long-distance, it might be better to book by the hour.Parcel restrictions: None.Delivery fee: For the smallest van, the fee is $25 base fare + $0.80/km. When I entered my Bishan to Bedok route, they quoted $34.20, which is the 2nd cheapest for bulky deliveries I found. For booking by the hour, it costs $40 for the first hour and $35/hour thereafter. The fee includes 15 minutes each for loading and unloading. For larger vehicles like lorries, they give you a longer period for un/loading time.Back to topHave you tried any of these delivery services personally?

Located within the Cluny Hill Good Class Bungalow (GCB) Area, near the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the bungalow was completed over two decades ago.  The buyer, who is expected to redevelop the property, is understood to be Lobb Heng Group director Han Xiaoli. She co-owns the firm with Guan Zhishan. The two are both Singapore citizens. Founded within the city-state in 1993 to trade base metals, the group is a leading supplier of non-ferrous metals for export to China. The firm established a warehousing and logistics business in 2005 to capture e-commerce\u2019s rapid growth in China. A seasoned market watcher noted that the $1,964 psf price is a bit high for GCB development land within the area. However, the parties may have agreed on the price in the first half of January, prior to the Covid-19 outbreak and when the sentiment was still positive. The option to purchase was granted earlier in the month, with the buyer exercising it about two weeks later. The two-level house comes with a basement, five bedrooms, a gym and a swimming pool. The property is one of 12 bungalows developed in the 1990s by Straits Steamship Land (SSL), now Keppel Land. Earlier media articles showed that SSL sold the 12 bungalows within two weeks of its 1994 private launch for between $8 million and $9.5 million. Bungalows within Singapore\u2019s 39 gazetted GCB Areas are considered the most prestigious form of landed housing in the city-state. These properties come with strict planning conditions by the Urban Redevelopment Authority in a bid to preserve their low-rise character and exclusivity. Looking for a property in Singapore?

(PHOTO: Roslan Rahman/AFP via Getty Images)   By Faris Mokhtar (Bloomberg) -- Singapore is bracing for a harder hit to tourism than initially expected from the coronavirus as the outbreak spreads to more than 100 countries, impacting global travel plans, Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran said. \u201cNow it\u2019s really the fact that there\u2019s a global spread of this virus and therefore we will have to reevaluate certainly the numbers,\u201d Iswaran said in an interview Wednesday.  Just last month, Singapore\u2019s tourism chief forecast that tourist arrivals and spending could drop by 25% to 30% this year because of the outbreak, making it worse than the 2003 SARS pandemic. The city-state is losing about 18,000 to 20,000 tourists a day and that could plummet further if the situation persists, Keith Tan, chief executive officer of Singapore Tourism Board, said in mid-February. With the economic fallout expected to grow, Singapore is already mulling another round of aid for businesses. Unveiling its 2020 budget last month, the government pledged S$6.4 billion ($4.6 billion) in dedicated support, including a S$4 billion stabilisation package. A second support package may be introduced if necessary, local media has reported, citing Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat. Iswaran, who is also Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations, declined to elaborate when asked about the scale of any second support package on Wednesday. \u201cWe are prepared to do more, but it has to be a response to the situation,\u201d he said. \u00a9 2020 Bloomberg L.P.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 2060 (Image credit: Nvidia)If a recent Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) submission (spotted by PCGamesN) is to be trusted, the GeForce RTX 2060 could be going under the knife very soon.The GeForce RTX 2060 originally came with the TU106 silicon, featuring 1,920 CUDA cores and 6GB of GDDR6 memory clocked at 14 Gbps. EVGA would later surgically switch the TU106 silicon for the larger TU104 silicon in its GeForce RTX 2060 KO Gaming graphics card. EVGA's swap out was insignificant as the same specifications transferred over to the new variant. This time around, however, the GeForce RTX 2060 could potentially get a real upgrade.Asus' EEC filing, which was submitted yesterday, mentions three variants of the ROG Strix GeForce RTX 2060 with 8GB of GDDR6 memory instead of the default 6GB configuration.GeForce RTX 2060 8GB (Image credit: PCGamesN)There are a few possible theories before we rush to conclusions. For one, this whole thing could be a human error. Asus uses a pretty similar naming scheme for its graphics card, so it's easy to get mixed up.For example, the ROG Strix GeForce RTX 2060 is identified as ROG-STRIX-RTX2060-6G-GAMING while ROG Strix GeForce RTX 2060 Super is designated as ROG-STRIX-RTX2060S-8G-GAMING.It's possible that the Asus employee mistyped the part numbers when submitting the entry. Perhaps, the employee wanted to register the GeForce RTX 2060 Super but forgot to add the \"S\" to the part number. Then again, why register them now when the GeForce RTX 2060 Super have been out since last year?Another possibility is that Asus is just registering the part numbers in case Nvidia does decide to refresh the GeForce RTX 2060 with more memory in the future. Remember, you can submit as many products as you want to the EEC, and not every one of them will be produced or released to the market.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Swipe to scroll horizontallyModelPart NumberHeader Cell - Column 2 ROG Strix GeForce RTX 2060 EVO OC EditionROG-STRIX-RTX2060-O8G-EVO-GAMINGRow 0 - Cell 2 ROG Strix GeForce RTX 2060 EVO Advanced EditionROG-STRIX-RTX2060-A8G-EVO-GAMINGRow 1 - Cell 2 ROG Strix GeForce RTX 2060ROG-STRIX-RTX2060-8G-EVO-GAMINGRow 2 - Cell 2 If Nvidia does upgrade the GeForce RTX 2060, it would put the graphics card on par with the GeForce RTX 2060 Super in terms of memory. The Super variant wouldn't be affected performance-wise though as it still holds a higher CUDA core count (2,176 as opposed to the GeForce RTX 2060's 1,920).In terms of performance ranking, the GeForce RTX 2060 falls behind AMD's Navi-powered Radeon RX 5700 and Radeon RX 5600 XT. Our tests show that the Radeon RX 5700 on average delivers up to 11% higher frame rates in comparison to the GeForce RTX 2060. Would the GeForce RTX 2060 be able to close this gap with 2GB of additional GDDR6 memory? Probably not.Nonetheless, having 8GB of memory would make the GeForce RTX 2060 look good beside the Radeon RX 5600 XT, which only has 6GB of GDDR6 memory. The Radeon RX 5600 XT has a slight edge on the GeForce RTX 2060 in regards to performance. The extra memory could result very useful in high resolution gaming and might help push the GeForce RTX 2060 ahead, even if it's just by a hair.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce\nrtx\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (11)\n\n\n\nZhiye LiuSocial Links NavigationNews Editor and Memory ReviewerZhiye Liu is a news editor and memory reviewer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

I have a 2060 too, playing at 1440p and I have not encountered any performance issues that could be tied to VRAM (played many AAA games including a couple with Raytracing)\n\nAlso remember that this is a midrange card, if you expect it to run all modern titles at WQHD and Ultra settings at way over 60 FPS, you of course will be disappointed. That's for cards like the 2070 Super.\n\nHow is the rest of your system? Are you running dual channel RAM, modern CPU, running games on SSD? That could be the culprit for your performance issues if not.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njpe1701\n\n\nmr.walcott said:Well think I shot myself in the foot buying the 2060 around launch last year.After upgrading to 1440p having issues with vram.

Not to sound like a broken record but I would wait honestly. You probably wanted at least a little ray tracing if you went with the 2060 and if the rumors are even close to being right then the performance is supposed to be much better.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhannibal\n\n\n50% more speed than 2060... you talk about 2080ti or next gen amd or Nvidia... not worth the cost considering 2080ti IMHO\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKing_V\n\n\njoeblowsmynose said:Ahhh ... the long awaited and rumoured RTX2060 \"Kind-of-Super\".

Often rote and routine, this is a game of \u201cfastest through the cycle wins,\u201d as the faster you can iterate, the easier it is to explore new theories and get good answers. This is one of the reasons practical enterprise use of AI today is dominated by the largest enterprises, which can throw enormous resources at the problem.\nRAPIDS is an umbrella for several open source projects, incubated by Nvidia, that puts the entire processing pipeline on the GPU, eliminating the I/O bound data transfers, while also substantially increasing the speed of each of the individual steps. It also provides a common format for the data, easing the burden of exchanging data between disparate systems. At the user level, RAPIDS mimics the Python API in order to ease the transition for that user base.\n The Tidyverse Cookbook\n\nTypical machine learning workflow\n\n\nRAPIDS ecosystem architecture\nThe RAPIDS project aims to replicate, for the most part, the machine learning and data analytics APIs of Python, but for GPUs rather than CPUs. This means that Python developers already have everything they need to run on the GPU, without having to learn the low-level details of CUDA programming and parallel operations. Pythonistas can develop code on a non-GPU enabled machine, then, with a few tweaks, run it on all the GPUs available to them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nvidia CUDA toolkit provides lower level primitives for math libraries, parallel algorithms, and graph analytics. At the heart of the architecture is the GPU data frame, based on Apache Arrow, that provides a columnar, in-memory data structure that is programming language agnostic. The user interacts with the GPU dataframe via cuDF and a Pandas-like API. Dask, a Python library for parallel computing, mimics the upstream Python APIs and works with CUDA libraries for parallel computation. Think of Dask as Spark for Python.\n\n\n\n RAPIDS\n\nRAPIDS ecosystem architecture\n\n\nThe three main projects, cuDF, cuML and cuGraph, are developed independently, but designed to work seamlessly together. Bridges to the broader Python ecosystem are also being developed as part of the project.\nRAPIDS installation\nInstallation via Anaconda on a Linux machine in AWS was mostly straightforward, barring a few hiccups due to a change in dependencies in version 0.11. Installing the C/C++ libraries to use libcudf\u00a0was not so easy, and I\u2019d recommend sticking to the Python APIs and Conda installation process. RAPIDS includes a Jupyter notebook, also available on Google\u2019s free Colab, that makes getting started simple. I used the Jupyter notebook version 0.10 to run the code on Google Colab, which includes an Nvidia Tesla T4 GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n IDG\nRAPIDS\u2019 GPU dataframe\nAt the heart of any data science workflow is the dataframe. This is where feature engineering happens, and where the majority of time is spent, as data scientists wrangle dirty data. cuDF is the RAPIDS project for a GPU-based, Pandas-like dataframe. Underpinning cuDF is libcudf, a C++ library implementing low-level primitives for importing Apache Arrow data, performing element-wise mathematics on arrays, and executing sort, join, group by, reduction, and other operations on in-GPU memory matrices. The basic data structure of libcudf is the GPU DataFrame (GDF), which in turn is modeled on Apache Arrow\u2019s columnar data store.\n RAPIDS\n\ncuDF technology stack\u00a0\n\n\nThe RAPIDS Python library presents the user with a higher level interface resembling dataframes, like those in Pandas. In many cases, Pandas code runs unchanged on cuDF. Where this is not the case, usually only minor changes are required.\nUser defined functions in cuDF\nOnce you\u2019re past basic data manipulation, it is sometimes necessary to process rows and columns with user defined functions (UDFs). cuDF provides a PyData style API to write code to process more course-grained data structures like arrays, series, and moving windows. Currently only numeric and Boolean types are supported. UDFs are compiled using the Numba JIT compiler, which uses a subset of LLVM to compile numeric functions to CUDA machine code. This results in substantially faster run times on the GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrings in cuDF\nAlthough GPUs are fantastic for rapidly processing float vectors, they haven\u2019t typically been used for processing string data, and the reality is that most data comes to us in the form of strings. cuStrings is a GPU string manipulation library for splitting, applying regexes, concatenating, replacing tokens, etc. in arrays of strings. Like other functions of cuDF, it is implemented as a C/C++ library (libnvStrings) and wrapped by a Python layer designed to mimic Pandas. Although the string data type is not optimized for execution on GPUs, parallel execution of the code should provide a speedup over CPU-based string manipulation.\nGetting data in or out of cuDF\nDataframe I/O is handled by a dedicated library, cuIO. All of the most commonly encountered formats are supported, including Arrow, ORC, Parquet, HDF5, and CSV. If you are lucky enough to be running on DGX-2 hardware, you can use GPU Direct Storage integration to move data directly from high-speed storage to the GPU without involving the CPU. Mortal users will still appreciate the speedup the GPU gives when decompressing large data sets, and the tight integration with the Python ecosystem.\nGPU Direct Storage is currently in alpha, and when released will be available on most Tesla GPUs. You can create a GPU dataframe from NumPy arrays, Pandas DataFrames, and PyArrow tables with just a single line of code. Other projects can exchange data via the __cuda_array_interface__ for libraries that fall within the Numba ecosystem. DLPack for neural network libraries is also a supported interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbably the biggest drawback in using cuDF is the lack of interoperability outside of Python. I think a focus on a strong foundation of C/C++ APIs, as Arrow has done, would enable a broader ecosystem and benefit the project as a whole.\nRAPIDS\u2019 cuML\ncuML\u2019s stated goals are to be \u201cPython\u2019s Scikit-learn powered by GPUs.\u201d In theory this means you should only have to change your import statement and perhaps tune a few of the parameters to account for the differences in running on a CPU, where sometimes a brute force approach is better. The benefit of having a GPU-based Scikit-learn is hard to understate. The speedups are substantial, and data analysts can be many times more productive. The C++ API isn\u2019t quite ready for broad consumption outside of its Python bindings, but this is expected to improve.\ncuML also includes APIs for helping with hyperparameter tuning via Dask, a library for scaling Python across multiple nodes. Many machine learning algorithms can be effectively made parallel, and cuML is actively developing both multi-GPU and multi-node, multi-GPU algorithms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n RAPIDS\n\ncuML algorithms\n\n\nRAPIDS\u2019 cuGraph\ncuGraph is the third member of the RAPIDS ecosystem, and like the others, cuGraph is fully integrated with cuDF and cuML. It offers a good selection of graph algorithms, primitives, and utilities, all with GPU-accelerated performance. The selection of APIs in cuGraph is somewhat more extensive than in other parts of RAPIDS, with NetworkX, Pregel, GraphBLAS, and GQL (Graph Query Language) all available.\n RAPIDS\n\ncuGraph stack\n\n\ncuGraph is more like a toolkit in spirit than cuML. Graph technology is a fast-moving space both in academia and industry. Thus, by design, cuGraph gives developers access to the C++ layer and graph primitives, encouraging third parties to develop products using cuGraph. Several universities have contributed, and projects from Texas A&M (GraphBLAS), Georgia Tech (Hornet), and UC Davis (Gunrock) have been \u201cproductized\u201d and included under the cuGraph umbrella. Each project provides a different set of capabilities, all GPU-accelerated, and all backed by the same cuDF dataframe.\nNetworkX is the Python API targeted by the RAPIDS team for its native interface. There are a number of algorithms available via that interface. While only page rank is multi-GPU, the team is actively working on multi-GPU versions of the others, where applicable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n RAPIDS\n\ncuGraph algorithms\n\n\nOne of the cuGraph sub-projects I found interesting is cugraphBLAS, an effort to standardize building blocks for graph algorithms in the language of linear algebra. Based on GraphBLAS (graphblas.org), a custom data structure designed for sparse dynamic graphs processing.\nAnother cuGraph sub-project, Hornet provides a system independent format for containing graph data, analogous to the way Apache arrow provides a system independent way to process dataframes. Hornet supports most of the popular graph formats including SNAP, mtx, metis, and edges.\nIn keeping with the spirit of being close to the Python community, Python\u2019s native NetworkX package can be used for the study of complex networks. This includes data structures for graphs and multi-graphs, reimplemented using CUDA primitives, allowing you to reuse many of the standard graph algorithms and perform network structure and analysis measures. The majority of algorithms are single-GPU, like NetworkX. Nevertheless, running them on the GPU alone offers significant speedup, while work continues to move to multi-GPU implementations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the RAPIDS roadmap\u00a0\nGiven the tremendous speed up that GPU-based analytics provides, there are a few new projects coming into the mix in future versions.\nDLPack and array_interface for deep learning\nMulti-layer neural networks were one of the first workloads moved to GPUs, and a sizable body of code exists for this machine learning use case. Previously DLPack was the de-facto standard for data interchange among deep learning libraries. Nowadays the array_interface is commonly supported. RAPIDS supports both.\ncuSignal\nLike most other projects at RAPIDS, cuSignal is a GPU-accelerated version of an existing Python library, in this case the SciPy Signal library. The original SciPy Signal library is based on NumPy, which is replaced with its GPU-accelerated equivalent, CuPy in cuSignal. This is a good example of the RAPIDS design philosophy at work. With the exception of a few custom CUDA kernels, the port to the GPU mostly involves replacing the import statement and tweaking a few function parameters.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBringing signal processing into the RAPIDS fold is a smart move. Signal processing is everywhere and has many immediately useful commercial applications in industry and defense.\ncuSpatial\nSpatial and spatiotemporal operations are great candidates for GPU acceleration, and they solve many real-world problems we face in everyday life, such as analyzing traffic patterns, soil health/quality, and flood risk. Much of the data collected by mobile devices, including drones, has a geospatial component, and spatial analysis is at the heart of the Smart City.\u00a0\nArchitected like the other components, cuSpatial is a C++ library built on CUDA primitives and the Thrust vector processing library, using cuDF for data interchange. Consumers of the C++ library can read point, polyline, and polygon data using a C++ reader. Python users are better off using existing Python packages like Shapely or Fiona to fill a NumPy array, then using\u00a0the cuSpatial Python API or converting to cuDF dataframes.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncuxfilter for data visualization\nVisualizing data is fundamental, both within the analytics workflow and for presenting or reporting results. Yet for all the magic that GPUs can work on the data itself, getting that data out to a browser is not a trivial task. cuxfilter, inspired by the Crossfilter JavaScript library, aims to bridge that gap by providing a stack to enable third-party visualization libraries to display data in cuDF dataframes.\nThere have been a few iterations of cuxfilter as the team sorts out the best architecture and connector patterns. The latest iteration leverages Jupyter notebooks, Bokeh server, and PyViz panels, while integration experiments include projects from Uber, Falcon, and PyDeck. This component isn\u2019t quite yet ready for prime time, but is slated for release in RAPIDS 0.13. There are a lot of moving parts, and I did not get to experiment with it first hand, but if it lives up to its promise this will be a great addition to the RAPIDS toolkit.\nScaling up and out with Dask\nDask is distributed task scheduler for Python, playing a similar role for Python that Apache Spark plays for Scala. Dask-cuDF is a library that provides partitioned, GPU-backed dataframes. Dask-cuDF works well when you plan to use cuML or when you are loading a data set that is larger than GPU memory or is spread across multiple files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike a Spark RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset), the Dask-cuDF distributed dataframe mostly behaves just like a local one, so you can experiment with your local machine and move to a distributed model when you need to scale up. Dask-cuML gives cuML multi-node capabilities, making it a good option when you do not have the budget for a DGX workstation.\nThe Dask project is independent of RAPIDS, and includes several features that a practicing data scientist will find useful, such as low-latency, high-throughput messaging via OpenUCX (normally found in High Performance Computing applications). Dask was made for accessing high-speed block data stores through InfiniBand or large data sets in cloud storage. Dask integration really extends the reach of RAPIDS.\nRAPIDS at a glance\nRAPIDS addresses one of the biggest challenges of machine learning with Python \u2014 slow execution \u2014 and does so in an elegant way, by making existing code run on the GPU nearly unchanged. It\u2019s hard to fault the vision or enthusiasm of Nvidia or the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this project has a great deal of momentum, I can\u2019t recommend it for enterprise work at the moment. There are simply too many changes going on under the hood as it evolves. My recommendation for enterprises is \u201cwatch this space,\u201d wait for things to settle down, and, if possible, get a few developers involved in contributing. Especially needed are work on making the underlying C++ libraries, especially cuDF, useful for other languages, like R, Java, and Go.\n\u2014\nCost: Free open source licensed under Apache 2.0.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform: Requires Nvidia Pascal or better GPU with compute capability 6.0 or better and recent CUDA and Nvidia drivers.

So you are correct.\u201dThe blower design \u2013 which is used on current Navi graphics cards, and indeed all models in recent times, save for the Radeon VII \u2013 means that the hot air generated by the GPU is expelled out of the back of the card, through the expansion slot, and outside of the case. But it has been roundly criticized by many for being a noisy and generally inefficient cooling system, which many enthusiasts are glad see to the back of.(Image credit: AMD / PC Gamer)Fan favoriteA dual (or triple \u2013 potentially, although the image glimpse shows a two-fan card) axial fan design means the heat is vented inside the actual PC case, and AMD previously said it went with blower models because of concerns that less tech-savvy users might end up with overheating problems due to badly designed case airflow. The argument boiled down to the insistence that a blower design produced a more consistent and reliable performance across AMD\u2019s reference GPUs.Clearly AMD\u2019s engineers have changed their minds on that line of thought.Remember that this pertains to AMD\u2019s own reference boards \u2013 third-party Radeon products already offer dual or triple axial fan designs, and AMD\u2019s other previous argument was that enthusiasts who can ably manage their PC\u2019s airflow can simply purchase one of those models.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.At any rate, despite AMD\u2019s previous reasoning, it\u2019s clear that complaints around the blower design have been heard (above the noise), and at least with next-gen Navi graphics cards, it won\u2019t be an option any longer.Here are the\u00a0best processors of 2020Via PC Gamer\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nAMD\nNvidia\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

Opening up ray tracing support for Vulkan API allows it to become the industry's first open, cross-vendor, cross-platform standard for ray tracing acceleration.\nKhronos Groups Opens Up Ray Tracing For Vulkan API With The Latest Extensions - Open-Source, Cross-Vendor & Cross-Platform Ray Tracing Acceleration\nAccording to Khronos Group, Vulkan Ray Tracing is built upon NVIDIA's own ray tracing extensions but adds upon it in a relatively smaller way. In its presentation, Khronos Group stated that a set of provisional extension specifications are publicly available today for industry feedback and the first Beta developer drivers are shipping today. In fact, NVIDIA is fully supporting the new Vulkan API & will be shipping its Beta Linux drivers today, too.\nRelated Story NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\u201cThere has been strong developer demand for a truly cross-platform ray tracing acceleration API and now Vulkan Ray Tracing is here to meet that industry need,\u201d.\n\u201cThe overall architecture of Vulkan Ray Tracing will be familiar to users of existing proprietary ray tracing APIs, which enables straightforward porting of existing ray-traced content, but this framework also introduces new functionality and implementation flexibility.\u201d\n\nDaniel Koch, senior graphics system software engineer at NVIDIA and Vulkan Ray Tracing task sub group chair at Khronos\n\n\nVulkan API is titled as the industry's first open, cross-vendor and cross-platform standard for ray tracing acceleration. It is also to note that this move brings the Vulkan API on par with Microsoft's DXR (DirectX Ray-Tracing) API. Some features of Vulkan API would include:\n\nCoherent Ray Tracing Framework - Seamlessly integrated into existing Vulkan functionality - a flexible merging of rasterization and ray-tracing.\nFamiliar to users of existing proprietary ray-tracing APIs but also introduces new implementation flexibility\nPrimary focus on meeting desktop market demand for both real-time and offline rendering\n\n\nVulkan RT consists of a number of Vulkan, SPIR-V, and GLSL extensions, some of which are optional. The primary VK_KHR_ray_tracing extension provides support for acceleration structure building and management, RT shader stages and pipelines, and ray query intrinsics for all shader stages. VK_KHR_pipeline_library provides the ability to provide a set of shaders that can be efficiently linked into ray tracing pipelines.\nVK_KHR_deferred_host_operations enables intensive driver operations, including RT pipeline compilation or CPU-based acceleration structure construction to be offloaded to application-managed CPU thread pools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nVulkan RT shaders are SPIR-V binaries that use two new extensions. The SPV_KHR_ray_tracing SPIR-V extension adds support for RT shader stages and instructions. Engineers at Khronos member companies, including NVIDIA, have also added support for the SPIR-V extensions to DXC, Microsoft's open-source HLSL compiler, enabling Vulkan RT SPIR-V shaders to be authored in HLSL using the syntax defined by Microsoft, with minimal modifications.\nFollowing is what the industry has to say about Khronos Group's newly added support for Ray-Tracing in its Vulkan API:\nNVIDIA - \u201cNVIDIA ships beta drivers today with support for the provisional standardized ray tracing functionality in Vulkan,\u201d said Morgan McGuire, research director at NVIDIA.\u00a0\u201cBringing accelerated ray tracing to the Vulkan cross-platform, open standard API is another significant step towards enabling the highest quality of visual realism for real-time games and applications everywhere.\u201d\nAMD - \"Standardizing ray tracing in Vulkan is an important step towards making ray tracing available across a wide range of devices, as well as enabling developers to use this technology to its full advantage. AMD intends to provide support for all of the major features in this extension, including ray shading, ray queries, and CPU acceleration structure management. We will be working with developers to ensure great performance from our Vulkan Ray Tracing implementation; these efforts will help us to provide end-users with even more visually stunning graphics on AMD Radeon\u2122 GPUs,\u201d said Andrej Zdravkovic, senior vice president, software development, AMD.\nIntel - \"The Intel Xe architecture roadmap includes support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing, and we're excited to work with Khronos to implement full support into Vulkan,\" said Joshua Barczak, graphics software architect at Intel.\n\n\nKhronos Group also showcased an example of Vulkan Ray Tracing in Wolfenstein: Youngblood. The title used a typical hybrid combination of a rasterized scene with some ray-traced aspects included in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nWhile the changes aren't as significant and more trivial of sorts, there's still a lot of good reason to be excited about this move by Khronos Group. The Vulkan (VK_KHR_ray_tracing) is hardware agnostic and supports ray-tracing in both explicit and implicit modes. While it is primarily designed to utilize hardware that is purpose-built for ray-tracing (e.g. NVIDIA RTX & AMD RDNA2 GPUs), it is also able to use the compute capabilities of a GPU for ray-tracing. But with decent ray-tracing cores available on next-generation GPUs, that option may not be widely supported.\nIt's probably that MS would support its own DXR standard for the next-generation Xbox Series X console but Sony may go the Vulkan route as it offers more flexibility to developers. With that said, we can also see some good performance impact with Vulkan API on PC titles and with all three giants, AMD, Intel, NVIDIA landing in this year with its next-generation GPUs, interesting times definitely await us!\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPU Packs 11% More Cores Than RTX 5090: 24,064 In Total With 96 GB GDDR7 Memory & 600W TBP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX \u201cPRO\u201d 6000 X Blackwell GPU Spotted In Shipping Log: GB202 Die, 96 GB VRAM, & TBP of 600W\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n159\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n95\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n69\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n54\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)Nvidia's GeForce Now has been subject to heaps of setbacks through developers pulling out of the service. Nevertheless, it appears that Nvidia's game streaming service is still quite the success, as the Founder's Edition slots in Europe are all sold out with the company expecting the U.S. to follow soon.\"As you can imagine, we\u2019re experiencing a substantial increase in the number of GeForce Now players and their amount of playtime.\" an Nvidia spokesperson said this week. \"As a result, our Founders memberships are currently sold out in Europe, and we anticipate North America won\u2019t be far behind.\"(Image credit: Nvidia)We suspect that the increase in activity is due to the COVID-19 outbreak, as much of Europe is in lockdown, with people unable to go to work, cafes, clubs, group meetings shut down and general recommendations or obligations to stay home.\u00a0With all the uncertainty on the market and people's incomes, a service such as GeForce Now came at the right time. With GeForce Now, you still have to purchase your games through a service like Steam but can run the game off of Nvidia's servers instead of having to buy a gaming laptop or desktop. With a low monthly fee of just $4.99 per month, it's a great alternative to spending big bucks on a gaming laptop or gaming desktop-- especially since the first 90 days are free.Nvidia is currently working to increase server capacity so it can re-open Founders memberships to GeForce Now and keep up with the spike in demand.\u00a0The question this leaves us with is the sustainability of this in the long term. Nvidia isn't making any money off the surge of subscribers yet and has no way of knowing how many will opt to keep the service after the three-month trial period ends. Consequently, we hope that the investments in added server capacity don't go to waste when the world goes back to normal.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce\nGaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (1)\n\n\n\nNiels BroekhuijsenSocial Links NavigationNiels Broekhuijsen is a Contributing Writer for Tom's Hardware US.

Following Activision Blizzard and Bethesda Softworks' lead, 2K Games has requested that their games be removed from Nvidia's fancy new cloud gaming platform. Bye-bye, Bioshock and Borderlands. Seeya later, Sid Meier's Civilisation. It's the third time in less than a month a major publisher has pulled out of the service, leaving Nvidia's streaming offerings thinner by the week.\n\nNvidia announced yesterday that, at the publishers' request, all 20 of 2K's Games previously available on GeForce Now have been removed from the service. That includes some notable removals, too - withdrawing all of the mainline Borderlands shooters, all three Bioshock games, Civilisation V and VI, and Mafia 3, among others listed in a more recent post from Nvidia.\nBut 2K are only the latest in a growing line of publishers retreating from GeForce Now. Things kicked off with Activision Blizzard's withdrawal shortly after the service's launch. A week or so later, Bethesda Softworks followed suit by removing their entire catalogue from Geforce Now, save for Wolfenstein: Youngblood. Even before launch, big players like Capcom, Konami, Rockstar, and Square Enix chose to give the streaming platform a miss.\nIt's not just the big dogs Nvidia have riled up, either. This week, the devs behind wintry survive 'em up The Long Dark asked to have their game removed. But game director Raphael van Lierop also noted that Nvidia failed to get permission before adding the game in the first place. \n\"Nvidia didn't ask for our permission to put the game on the platform so we asked them to remove it,\" said van Lierop in a Tweet at the time. \"Please take your complaints to them, not us. Devs should control where their games exist.\"\nThat may be the most telling part of this month-long debacle. Rather than selling games through their own service and offering publishers a cut, Nvidia have made themselves middle-men between players and their games. It's a wholly different situation to similar services like Google Stadia, which operate more like traditional platforms. \nMany publishers and developers may be none too happy at a third-party making bank from streaming their games - especially if, as van Lierop suggests, they're doing so without asking first.\nAs with previous withdrawals, Nvidia note that they're working with 2K to re-enable their games in future.

The latter usually costs $150, but it has already gone on sale for $130 once. If you missed out on that deal, here's another chance to get the new stick at a lower price.Amazon currently has the Nvidia Shield TV 2019 model for $129.99, a discount of $20 from the usual price. The stick has a Tegra X1+ processor, 2GB of RAM, and 8GB of internal storage. There's also a microSD card slot for adding more storage, and an Ethernet jack for a wired network connection. The main differences compared to the larger Shield box is that this unit has less RAM (2GB vs 3GB) and uses 32-bit Android TV to reduce memory usage. \n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more details, check out our review of the Shield TV stick.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Hinterland Studio)\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Now, Nvidia's new streaming service, has shed another game. Last month, it lost Activision's games because of a \"misunderstanding,\" followed soon after by most of Bethesda's, and now it's down The Long Dark, Hinterland Studio's chilly survival sandbox.\u00a0Rather than a miscommunication, this time there seems to have been no communication at all. According to creative director Raphael van Lierop, Nvidia added The Long Dark to its service without asking the developer for permission.\u00a0On Twitter, Lierop explained that Hinterland asked Nvidia to remove it and apologised to players who have to put their excursion into the Canadian wilderness on hold, at least on GeForce Now. \"Devs should control where their games exist,\" he added.\u00a0Sorry to those who are disappointed you can no longer play #thelongdark on GeForce Now. Nvidia didn't ask for our permission to put the game on the platform so we asked them to remove it. Please take your complaints to them, not us. Devs should control where their games exist.March 1, 2020Apparently Nvidia offered the developer a graphics card as an apology, which seems more like something you'd give a disgruntled customer, not a business partner. \"Maybe they'll offer you the same thing,\" Lierop joked in a follow-up tweet.\u00a0Unlike Stadia, GeForce Now doesn't have a game store; it's a service that lets you stream PC games you already own to other devices. It also supports a substantially larger number of them, though it's already lost quite a few since it launched, including Diablo 3, Overwatch and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. \u00a0Activision asked for its games to be removed until a commercial agreement had been made. It had partnered with Nvidia for the beta, but there was apparently a misunderstanding about whether or not that extended to the 90-day trial period that kicked off with the service's launch.In response to the suggestion that developers and publishers shouldn't get to decide where their games get installed, Van Lierop pointed out that Hinterland's distribution agreement is with Valve, not Nvidia, and the developer has a choice about who can sell access to its games.\u00a0The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\u00a0Because they sell this service based on access to a library of content. We have the choice whether to be in that library or not. Our distribution agreement is with Valve, not with Nvidia.March 1, 2020Another concern for developers might be the impact it has on potential ports. Van Lierop agreed with digital entertainment lawyer Pete Lewin, who noted that it \"kills the ability to commercialise ports for new platforms (partic mobile) or to negotiate exclusivity deals.\"In both Hinterland and Activision's cases, the main issue seems to be that Nvidia just didn't bother to ask. Even if it's not selling the games, it's using them in its library to promote GeForce Now. Hinterland might have agreed, if that had happened.\u00a0GeForce Now made a great first impression, with Joanna and Jarred calling it the \"cloud gaming service Stadia should be,\" but once the trial period is over, one of its biggest draws might not be quite as attractive. The game library, even with these losses, is still pretty robust, but any of these games could vanish after the trial.\u00a0\"As we approach a paid service, some publishers may choose to remove games before the trial period ends,\" reads the blog post from Nvidia. \"Ultimately, they maintain control over their content and decide whether the game you purchase includes streaming on GeForce Now. Meanwhile, others will bring games back as they continue to realize GeForce Now's value.\"It's not clear if or when any of the games that have recently left GeForce Now will be returning.\u00a0I've reached out to Nvidia and will update the article if I get a response.\u00a0\n\n\nFraser BrownSocial Links NavigationOnline EditorFraser is the UK online editor and has actually met The Internet in person.

I was a DIRECTV subscriber for nearly 16 years but with the constant price increases I had to move on, which I did. With the exception of a year of AT&T TV Now, my main source of streaming television was via Sling TV, as well as streaming through Netflix, Hulu, Pluto TV, and unfortunately, ESPN Plus, if only to watch the return of the glorious XFL!\nAs I\u2019ve now taken the cord cutting route, I have tried several different streaming boxes, the most of them being Roku boxes. I have become a huge fan of Roku over the year because of its large variety of channels, simple to use interface, and with the current Streaming Stick Plus, amazing Wi-Fi reception. The other major streaming box I\u2019ve used over the years is of course the Xbox One X, which much to my surprise, has become my main Sling source, especially since the streaming quality has greatly improved over the years.\nI haven\u2019t really had a chance to try out the NVIDIA Shield line before, but a few months ago I was given an NVIDIA Shield TV to try out, as well as a beta code to GeForce Now, NVIDIA\u2019s game streaming service. After all the time I spent playing around with it, I will say that while I will stick with my Roku and Xbox for Sling streaming, there is still a lot on this device for me to keep coming back to.\nLet\u2019s start off with the internal specs. For a small cylinder shaped device 6 \u00bd inches long, it is packing the latest NVIDIA Tegra X1+ 256 core processor and 2GB of RAM. While this memory is small compared to the more recent cell phones, it is more than adequate for a streaming device. And 8 GB of storage is also available for game downloads, with an additional MicroSD card to add more. Internet connectivity is available as both wired Ethernet and 802.11ac wireless in both 2.4 and 5GHz ranges. For this review I am testing it on a 5GHz wireless. As this is an Android TV box, it comes bundled with Android 9.0 Pie in addition to NVIDIA\u2019s Shield Experience.\nOf course my main test involved what I would use on other devices: media streaming. For stream testing, I tried out the usual sources: Netflix, Sling TV, Hulu, and Pluto TV. However, at the start of my testing, I also was subscribed to AT&T TV Now, which at the time of my subscription, was not available as a Shield TV app. While Netflix, Pluto, and Hulu all ran rather flawlessly, I had issues with Sling. Now to be fair to NVIDIA, Sling has always had issues with streaming players, resulting in what I call the \u201corange circle of death,\u201d followed by a brief black screen. However with the Shield it was much worse, the stream would just cut to black and not respond. Even with force quitting the Sling app restoring it kept the black screen. Only a full device reboot was able to fix the problem.\nI will say one thing about the interface though. It is lightning fast. Where I\u2019ve noticed some sort of lag when switching channels on Sling, on the Shield TV it is instantaneous, and the included remote does a good job in responding to controls. I will however say it might be a bit TOO responsive, as there were times that it execute commands that I did not want. The worst offender is the large Netflix button at the bottom. Granted other remotes, even the one on my TV itself, have a dedicated Netflix button and they haven\u2019t been much to worry about, but with the Shield TV the slightest touch of the button switched over to Netflix. It got so annoying to the point that I ended up just syncing up a Sony PlayStation 4 controller as my main Shield interface.\nBut the Shield TV is not just a streaming device, it also plays games from Google Play and when using the previously mentioned PS4 controller, or any other Bluetooth controller for that matter, they play quite well. However, the Shield TV is also capable of running NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce Now streaming service. We at GiN were provided a beta code to try out GeForce Now and, saying this as someone who has been burned with other streaming services in the past, I have to admit my impressions were quite positive. Keep in mind I\u2019m running a 5GHz wireless connection via Verizon FIOS, and with the exception of some resolution/video quality reductions, control was very responsive. My main test using GeForce Now was with Bioshock Remastered which is based on the PC version. There were no visible signs of input lag at all, and the game felt more snappy than I\u2019m used to in a streaming service.\nWill it replace my PS4 Bioshock Collection? Not even close, but for those who prefer streaming, it might be a good choice for you.\nAnd that\u2019s the best way to describe the NVIDIA Shield TV. It\u2019s a very good streaming device for both media and games. And at $149 for the standard Shield TV, it won\u2019t break your bank either. However for power users, there is also the $199 Shield TV Pro which doubles the storage to 16GB and offers an additional two USB 3.0 ports. Either way, you can\u2019t go wrong.\nPros: Very fast user interface, perhaps one of the fastest I\u2019ve seen in a streaming device. MicroSD card support. Works with both Xbox and PS4 controllers for gaming. GeForce Now (Beta tested) runs surprisingly well with minimal input lag compared to PS Now. Chromecast, 4K, HDR10/Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos included.\nCons: The remote, particularly the Netflix button, is a hair trigger. Some apps, such as Sling TV, resulted in a black screen that required a system reboot.\nNote: This review is based on the NVIDIA Shield TV provided to us by NVIDIA for review, as well as access to the GeForce Now Beta. GiN was not provided with a membership to the official GeForce Now service. Controls were tested via the included remote and a DualShock 4.\n\nPublishers: NVIDIA\nDevelopers: NVIDIA\n\n\nRelated\nShare this GiN Article on your favorite social media network: \n\n\n\n\t\t\tPost navigation\t\t\n\nPrevious PostGame Over Podcast: Sonic in RehabNext PostAward Winning RPG Author Chris Spivey Creating Haunted West Game \n\n\n\n\nGiN's Most Popular PostsNews and Industry HappeningsThrills and Chills at Blerdcon Thrilla 2025Relaxing Walking Simulators Go Aquatic in Peaceful Naiad AdventureThe Podcast\u2019s Branding ProblemMichael Blaker\u2019s Anime Sunday: Most Anticipated Spring 2025 AnimeReal Time Tactics Commandos: Origins to Launch SoonUpcoming Action Adventure RPG Kromlech AnnouncedRailroads Online Announces Retail Release of Pioneer DLCPath of Exile 2: How to Farm An Audience with the King and Maximize Your ProfitsDifferent Types of Online Gambling LicensesThe Intersection of Video Games and Gambling: A Growing TrendSave State Continues His Mega Man Series Marathon With Mega Man ThreeGlobetrotting Greatness With New Carmen Sandiego AdventureHome Safety Hotline Creators Working on Dungeon Horror Forbidden SolitaireThe 6 Best Games You Can Play on TelegramMORE...\n\n\n\n\nYour Free Daily News Source Of The Video Game Industry\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch for:\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 Noble Order Press Enterprises Inc.\n                No part of this site may be used without the express written permission of the publisher.

We have seen some impressive configurations earlier such as the flagship Core i9-10980HK which was equipped with the GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER Max-Q but the latest configuration includes the standard and more powerful RTX 2080 SUPER variant.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPSIntel Core i9-10880H 8 Core Comet Lake-H CPU & NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER Notebook GPU laptop. (Image Credits: Rogame)\nThe notebook which is from ASUS is coupled with two high-end mobility chips, the Intel Core i9-10880H CPU and the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER Notebook GPU. At launch, these will be one of the fastest gaming notebook configurations that you can purchase but you'll have to pay top dollar for it too. The specifications of both the CPU and the GPU are mentioned below.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER Notebook GPU Specs\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER Notebook will be the fastest notebook discrete graphics chip ever built. Featured only in the most expensive and enthusiast-grade notebooks, the GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER notebook would carry the TU104 GPU core based on the 12nm FinFET process. NVIDIA is pushing out the full 48 SM part with 3072 CUDA cores, 8 GB of GDDR6 memory and a 256-bit bus on this chip. The memory would be clocked at 14 Gbps which is the same as the desktop RTX 2080 although not the RTX 2080 SUPER which has its GDDR6 memory clocking in at 15.5 Gbps speeds.\n\nThe graphics card will deliver 448 GB/s of bandwidth on a mobility platform but with top-notch performance, you'd also expect huge power consumption which is made apparent from its 150 Watt TGP. The graphics chip would feature a 1365 MHz base clock and some performance figures of the RTX 2080 SUPER standard and Max-Q variant have been reported by Rogame too which you can see below:\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER Notebook:\n\n3DMark Time Spy: 8337\n3DMark Fire Strike: 20760\n3Dmark 11 Performance: 27765\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER Max-Q Notebook:\n\n3DMark Time Spy: 7938\n3DMark Fire Strike: 18871\n3Dmark 11 Performance: 25712\n\nYou are looking at up to 10% and an average 7.5% difference between the 150W standard and the 80W Max-Q variant. It is really impressive to see that you get around the same performance from the Max-Q variant with almost half the TGP.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX SUPER Mobility GPU Lineup Specs:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti NotebookNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 RefreshNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 RefreshNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPERNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER\n\n\n\n\nCodenameN18P-G62N18E-G1-BN18E-G1RN18E-G2RN18E-G3R\n\n\nArchitectureTuring TU116Turing TU106Turing TU104Turing TU104Turing TU104\n\n\nProcess Node12nm FinFET NVIDIA12nm FinFET NVIDIA12nm FinFET NVIDIA12nm FinFET NVIDIA12nm FinFET NVIDIA\n\n\nSMs1630364048\n\n\nCUDA Cores10241920230425603072\n\n\nStandard Max Boost Clock1485 MHz1285 MHz1485 MHz1380 MHz1560 MHz\n\n\nMax-Q Max Boost Clock1200 MHzTBCTBC1155 MHz1080 MHz\n\n\nVRAM4 GB GDDR66 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus128-bit192-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit\n\n\nMemory Clock12 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Bandwdith192 GB/s336 GB/s448 GB/s448 GB/s448 GB/s\n\n\nTGP (Total Graphics Power)35W (Standard)\n55W (Max-Q)115W (Standard)115W (Standard)115W (Standard)\n80 (Max-Q)150W+ (Standard)\n80 (Max-Q)\n\n\n\nIntel Core i9-10880H Comet Lake-H Mobility CPU Specs\nMoving on to the CPU side, the Intel Core i9-10880H will boast 8 cores and 16 threads and sit right underneath the flagship Core i9-10980HK which has the same core specs but operates at higher clocks. The Core i9-10880H comes with a 45W TDP and features a base clock of 2.30 GHz which is the same base frequency as the Core i9-9980H. The boost clock, however, gets a 200 MHz bump & ends up at 5.00 GHz. The chip will feature 16 MB of L3 cache, a UHD 630 graphics chip and will support DDR4 memory.\n\nIntel 10th Gen Comet Lake-H Mobility CPU Family:\n\n\n\nCPU NameCores/ThreadsBase ClockBoost ClockCacheTDP\n\n\n\n\nIntel Core i9-10980HK8/162.3 5.3 GHz16 MB45W\n\n\nIntel Core i9-10880H (TBA)8/162.3 GHz5.0 GHz?16 MB45W\n\n\nIntel Core i7-10875H8/162.3 GHz5.1 GHz16 MB45W\n\n\nIntel Core i7-10850H6/122.7 GHz5.1 GHz12 MB45W\n\n\nIntel Core i7-10750H6/122.6 GHz5.0 GHz12 MB45W\n\n\nIntel Core i5-10550H (TBA)6/122.5 GHz4.5 GHz12 MB45W\n\n\nIntel Core i5-10500H (TBA)6/122.5 GHz4.2 GHz12 MB45W\n\n\nIntel Core i5-10400H4/82.6 GHz4.6 GHz8 MB45W\n\n\nIntel Core i5-10300H4/82.5 GHz4.5 GHz8 MB45W\n\n\nIntel Xeon W-10885M8/162.4 GHz5.3 GHz16 MB45W\n\n\nIntel Xeon W-10855M6/122.7 GHz5.1 GHz12 MB45W\n\n\n\n\nAs you can tell by the specifications, this is as high-end as gaming notebooks can get in 2020. The Intel & NVIDIA combo reigns supreme until either AMD gets more powerful GPUs down the line in its own notebook segment or Intel's discrete GPUs start tackling NVIDIA on the high-end which doesn't seem likely, at least within this year. With that said, AMD's answer to the Comet Lake-H is already out in the form of Ryzen 4000 H-series which are available in some fantastic options so it's up to Intel now to showcase whether they can retain its notebook segment lead in the mainstream and performance segment versus AMD's 7nm lineup.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n513\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n127\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n84\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n81\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n51\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The company started offering its SwiftStack Data Platform for artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing in 2019, including the SwiftStack 1space that enables data acceleration at the core, edge and in the cloud.\nNvidia and SwiftStack worked together for more than a year on solving data challenges to enable\u00a0AI at scale, leading to the acquisition announced today.\nExisting SwiftStack customers will continue to be supported, notable among them PayPay Holdings Inc., Rogers Communications Inc., DC Blox Inc., Snapfish and Verizon Communications Inc., Nvidia plans on merging the technology into its existing AI stacks.\nThe acquisition is part of a broader strategy by Nvidia to provide a full stack of software to applications without becoming a storage provider itself.\n\u201cWe are not a storage vendor. We do not intend to be a storage vendor. We\u2019re not in the business of selling storage in any form,\u201d Manuvir Das, Nvidia\u2019s head of enterprise computing,\u00a0told TechTarget. \u201cWe work very closely with our storage partners. This acquisition is designed to further the integration between different storage technologies and the work we do for AI.\u201d\nDas added that Nvidia recognized many years ago that it needed to provide customer more than simply a graphics processing unit or a software library, instead helping them create the entire stack, all the way from the GPU up to the applications themselves. \u201cIf you look at Nvidia now, we spend most of our energy on the software for different kinds of AI applications,\u201d he said.\nSwiftStack had raised $23.6 million in funding,\u00a0according to Crunchbase. Investors included OpenView, Storm Ventures, Mayfield Fund and UMC Capital. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the coming weeks subject to customary closing conditions.\nThe news comes as Nvidia continues to work on its $6.9 billion acquisition of\u00a0network equipment supplier Mellanox Technologies Ltd. announced in March 2019.\u00a0 The deal received approval to proceed from the European Union in\u00a0December after also receiving the nod from U.S. regulators.\nThe deal is currently waiting for approval from China.\u00a0As of Feb. 19,\u00a0the deal had been refiled with Chinese authorities with an outside approval date of March 10 and a possible extension to June 10.\nImage: SwiftStack\n\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content. \u00a0\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\n\n\n\u201cTheCUBE\u00a0is an important partner to the industry.

A leaked slide purported to show comparative performance of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Super and RTX 2070 Super for laptops shows some very worthwhile gains vs the currently available roster of laptop graphics from the green team.\nPCGamesN shared the slide (embedded below) which it observes misses out laptops featuring the RTX 2080 (non-Super) - perhaps that result would have made the presentation slide less impactful. Peeking closer at the leaked slide, we can see the X-axis features a 'relative performance' scale. Nvidia appears to assert that 1x is equivalent to the performance of the iGPU on a 10th gen Intel Core-H Series chip. Coincidentally 1x is the performance of the GTX 1050 too.\n\nThe relative performance results were distilled by benchmark runs in Control, Wolfenstein: Youngblood, and Deliver us to the Moon at max settings. All the test systems ran the games at 1080p max settings and had 16GB of system RAM and Windows 10.\nAnother feature highlighted by the slide is the performance benefit of DLSS. Only RTX20 GPUs are capable of using this image smoothing feature which makes use of deep learning tech. The top performing RTX 2080 Super for laptops is nearly 7x faster than the baseline with DLSS applied in the modern games selection.\n\nHEXUS has reviewed multiple samples of the desktop Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Super and RTX 2070 Super GPUs. Most recently we looked at Inno3D's GeForce RTX 2080 Super iChiLL Black, and the Inno3D GeForce RTX 2070 Super Twin X2 OC. We can't say for certain whether the laptop GPUs will be using the same silicon, or what other changes might be made for the mobile parts.\nRumours point to a launch of the new RTX Super laptops later this month. Perhaps they will break cover at what is now the online-only GTC 2020 show (22nd to 26th March).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 2 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

Very interesting, indeed.I'm really hopeful for Big Navi but it has to be remembered that even when AMD has produced superior cards to Nvidia, they have never won market share as a result of that. They need a good product but they then need to back it up with decent marketing.Since Nvidia's latest anti-consumer tactics, they are ultimately off my shopping list for a good couple of generations.\n            \n            \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMY HEXUS\n\n\nSign in for the best HEXUS experience\nLOG IN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALL EVENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINDUSTRY PRESS RELEASES\n\n\n\n1\nIntroducing CORSAIR\u00ae DDR5 Memory\n\n\n\n2\nCORSAIR Announces Full Range of Components\n\n\n\n3\nTwo AOC GAMING mice and a wireless headset.\n\n\n\n4\nAGON by AOC presents three displays aimed at competitive gamers \n\n\n\n5\nPhilips monitors launch the new M3000 and M5000 PC gaming monitor series\n\n\n\n6\nASUSTOR is authorized by the CVE Program as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINFORMATION\n\nAbout us \nAdvertise \nContact us \nHow Competitions work \nHow we test \nAbout Cookies \nWhat our awards mean \nTerms of use\nPrivacy\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\n\nRSS / Alerts / Twitter \nFacebook / Newsletter \nUnsubscribe \n\n\n\nHEXUS Community\n\n\nMembers: 4\nForum posts: 353,396\nForum threads: 39,617\nCurrently active users: 99\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Copyright \u00a9 1998 - 2025, HEXUS.net.

Since its initial release, PUBG has topped Steam\u2019s concurrent player charts and has become one of the most played competitive games on the market.\nIn such a highly competitive title, it\u2019s important to take advantage of every edge you can get - finding the right weapon and tier 3 armor early on can give you a great in-game advantage, but you can also leverage your PC\u2019s hardware to get 144+ FPS and unlock your aiming potential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving a high-refresh monitor and a GPU capable of pushing 144+ FPS grants a number of benefits to any player. The first of these is lower system latency. System latency is the time that passes between a mouse movement or a keypress and when the screen updates with this new information. As you can imagine, having lower latency means you can see and react to targets sooner.\nAnother benefit of high FPS gaming is smoother animations. When you increase the number of frames being displayed per second, there are smaller gaps between each movement on the screen. When you move up from 60 to 144 or 240 FPS, enemy movements will appear more fluid, allowing you to more easily stay on target. For more info, check out our deep-dive into exactly how high FPS improves your gameplay, along with WackyJacky\u2019s video, below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n144 FPS For Competitive Play\nAs you might imagine, PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds is a resource-intensive game that can be very demanding on even the best hardware available. This is due to a number of factors, such as the sheer size of the map and the number of trees, buildings, and other objects that are realistically rendered throughout. You also have to take into account the fact that there are as many as 99 other players in the zone, all of whom you\u2019re trying to spot, regardless of how far away they might be. In order to enjoy the benefits of high FPS, you will need a powerful GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of these considerations, PUBG Corp. recommends players use a GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER for a great competitive experience with a solid, consistent 144 FPS at all times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimising PUBG\u2019s Settings For 240 FPS\nFor those competitive gamers who wish to get maximum FPS, we have carefully researched the effect that each graphics setting has on both gameplay and performance to find the optimal configuration for competitive play. PUBG tournaments, like the PGS, as well as professional esports players, use GeForce RTX 2080 and 2080 Tis to reach max frame rates.\nAt home, if you have a top tier GeForce RTX GPU, such as the GeForce RTX 2070 or better, and a top tier CPU like the i9-9900K, you can make the push to 240 FPS by using our tuned esports settings.\nAchieving 240 FPS can depend on your in game situation, the map you\u2019re on, and any game changes in recent updates. Furthermore, using max FPS settings does come with a few trade offs: effects like explosions will have reduced image quality, shadows and edges will be a bit blockier, and overall terrain quality will be reduced. If you still want to push for 240 FPS gameplay, follow the steps below:\n1.\u00a0 Set your resolution to 1920x1080 and make sure your display is running at the maximum refresh rate. 2.\u00a0 Next, set your Render Scale to 90, and use the in-game graphics settings below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. After exiting the game, you\u2019ll want to add some sharpening in the NVIDIA Control panel. This will help cancel out some of the visual quality loss from where we changed the Render Scale. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a.

Apply and close the NVIDIA Control Panel\nIf you use the settings outlined above, you should notice a significant increase in your FPS the next time you go after that coveted chicken dinner. The framerates you achieve will vary depending on the components in your machine, so be sure to tune your hardware for maximum performance by killing unnecessary services, closing perf-sapping programs, and overclocking your CPU, RAM and GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh FPS Results\nAfter digging into the benefits that we\u2019ve outlined above, we spent time studying K/D ratios in both Fortnite and PUBG to see their correlation to high-FPS gaming. If you want a deep dive into what we found, you can read our full study on playing battle royale titles at high FPS.\nOver the past six months, we have spent time pouring over this data and found some other interesting trends related to the amount of time a player spends in a game. As you can see in the chart below, whether you are a weekend warrior or an aspiring professional, there is a correlation between better performance and higher FPS regardless of how much time is spent playing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen all of the available information is looked at as a whole, we can conclude that there is a strong correlation for higher FPS helping maximise your potential in battle royale games like PUBG.\nFor more on High FPS gaming, check out our FramesWinGames page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\n#SHOTWITHGEFORCE\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United Kingdom\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  The developers behind MixPose, a yoga posture-recognizing application, aim to improve your downward dog and tree pose positions with a little nudge from AI.\nMixPose enables yoga teachers to broadcast live-streaming instructional videos that include skeletal lines to help students better understand the angles of postures. It also enables students to capture their skeletal outlines and share them in live class settings for virtual feedback.\n\u201cOur goal is to create and enhance the connections between yoga instructors and students, and we believe using a Twitch-like streaming class is an innovative way to accomplish that,\u201d\u00a0 said Peter Ma, 36, a co-founder at the MixPose team.\nMixPose\u2019s streaming video platform can be broadcasted with Jetson Nano. The live stream content can then be viewed on Android TV and mobile phones.\nOn Tuesday, the group was among 10 teams awarded top honors at the AI at the Edge Challenge, launched in October, on Hackster.io. Winners competed for a share of NVIDIA supercomputing prizes, as well as a trip to our Silicon Valley headquarters.\nHackster.io is an online community of developers, engineers and hobbyists who work on hardware projects. To date, it\u2019s seen more than 1.3 million members across 150 countries working on more than 21,000 open source projects and 240 company platforms.\nMixPose, based in San Francisco, taps PoseNet pose estimation networks powered by Jetson Nano to do inference on yoga positions for yoga instructors, allowing the teachers and students to engage remotely based on the AI pose estimation. It is developing networks for different yoga poses, utilizing JetPack SDK, CUDA ToolKit and cuDNN.\nFour Prized Categories\nMixPose took first place in the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) category, one of four project areas in the competition that drew 2,542 registrants from 35 countries and 79 submissions completed with code and shared with the community.\n\nMixPose demos its streaming app\nThe team also landed third place in AIoT for its Jetson Clean Water AI entry, using object detection for water contamination.\n\u201cIt can determine whether the water is clean for drinking or not,\u201d said 27-year-old MixPose co-founder Sarah Han.\nContest categories also included Autonomous Machines and Robotics, Intelligent Video Analytics and Smart Cities. First, second and third place winners in each took home awards.\nRNNs for Reading\nNVIDIA gave a\u00a0 single award in the category AI for Social Good, which Palo Alto High School junior Andrew Bernas took home for his Reading Eye for the Blind with NVIDIA Jetson Nano. It\u2019s a text-to-voice device for the visually impaired that uses CNNs and RNNs to recognize both handwritten and printed text and then synthesize it into human-like speech.\n\u201cPart of the inspiration was creating a solution for my grandmother and other people with vision loss to be able to read,\u201d said Bernas.\n\nAndrew Bernas\u2019 text-to-speech device for the visually impaired\nAI Whacks Weeds\nFirst-place winners also included a team from India behind the weed removal robot Nindamani, in the Autonomous Machines and Robotics category.\n\n Nindamani\u2019s AI-driven wee removal robot\u00a0\nTraffic Gets Moving\nAnd a duo working on adaptive traffic controls took a top award for their networks used to help improve traffic flows, in the Intelligent Video Analytics and Smart Cities category.\n\nChathuranga Liyanage and Sandali Jayaweera do AI for visual traffic aids for drivers.\n\u00a0\nNVIDIA Jetson Nano makes adding AI easier and more accessible to makers, self-taught developers and embedded tech enthusiasts.

Most crucially, with many major console and PC component manufacturers setting their sites on game streaming, most are left wondering if it's time to opt-in to services like Google Stadia and Project xCloud, or if that kind of tech still isn't quite ready for the primetime. \nRELATED: 10 Best Google Stadia Games, Ranked (According To Metacritic)\nThe recently launched GeForce Now, helmed by longtime PC parts and peripherals manufacturer Nvidia, boasts some interesting innovations when compared to the competition, but could a fragmenting market and a relatively high barrier to entry keep if from succeeding? Let's find out! \n10 \n\n                            Succeed: It's Inexpensive\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Google Stadia's premium edition first launched in late 2019, it was more or less declared dead on arrival, and a major reason for that was its numerous, bizarre paywalls. Alongside paying for the service, users are also charged full price for every game they purchase, and there's no guarantee that they'll be refunded should the service be shut down.\nWhen it comes to entry fees, Nvidia is cheap at five dollars per month for the premium edition, with a totally free edition\u2014which is limited to one hour per session\u2014also available. As of early 2020, it's one of the most cost-effective game streaming options out there, though there are still caveats. \n9 \n\n                            Fail: Publishers Pulling Games\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough Nvidia claims to boast a suite of compatible titles across Steam, Uplay, and the Epic Games Store, it's no secret that several high-profile titles have recently disappeared from the service.\nThat's because companies like Activision Blizzard and Bethesda are presumably looking to either partner with another game streaming platform or launch their own. This means that exceedingly popular titles like Overwatch, Doom Eternal, or any of the Call of Duty games won't appear on the service. This could definitely negatively impact Geforce Now's future, as a platform that primarily advertises access to your personal games library shouldn't be riddled with exceptions. \n8 \n\n                            Succeed: Nvidia Shield Support\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally launched in 2015, Nvidia Shield was a suite of game streaming devices intended to make PC gaming more accessible to casual players. Shield made it possible to stream games from a PC to a TV via a wifi connection without sacrificing visual fidelity or playability. It could also work with apps like Netflix and Hulu and was billed as an all-in-one entertainment device.\nRELATED: Google Play Points Explained\nGeForce Now ensures that players no longer need a powerful gaming rig to stream new titles, and, with various handheld offerings, the service could provide the game streaming on the go experience we've all been waiting for. \n7 \n\n                            Fail: Serious Competition\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVia: Microsoft\n\n\n\nGeForce Now would seem like a successful\u2014albeit niche\u2014service were it totally unique, but, given the competition against which it must contend, breaking the mold and attracting gamers will be tough.\nAt the moment, Google Stadia seems to have captivated the attention of many, and, though most of the press is negative, the fact that it's being talked about at all distracts from Nvidia's efforts. Additionally, with Microsoft's Project xCloud, PlayStation Now, and smaller-scale endeavors like Apple Arcade and Shadow vying for visibility, Nvidia may not be able to pull ahead of the pack, even if they offer a superior service. \n6 \n\n                            Succeed: Works With You Game Library\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, one of the most notable failings of Google Stadia was the fact that premium users still had to purchase their own games. It was far from the Netflix for games situation it was billed to be, and it's a far worse of a value than services like Xbox Game Pass or even PlayStation Plus.\nIn contrast, Nvidia GeForce Now is designed to integrate the gaming libraries you likely already have on platforms like Steam, Uplay, and the Epic Games Store. Plus, should GeForce Now eventually fold, users won't lose all of their games, which is another major worry for Stadia players. \n5 \n\n                            Fail: Internet Speed Issues\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe don't mean to keep ragging on Google Stadia, but it happens to serve as a great example of how not to launch a game streaming service. When the servers went live in November of 2019, gameplay was slow and laggy for most, with some users outright unable to play a few of the platform's marquee titles.\nGeForce Now may face similar issues, as it requires a 15mb download speed to play at 720p, and a 25mb download speed to play in 1080p at 60 FPS. Those aren't benchmarks all consumers will be able to meet, and it will remain a major issue for game streaming for years to come. \n4 \n\n                            Succeed: The Future Of Gaming\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may seem silly to champion game streaming as \"the future\" right after panning it for requiring fairly exclusive minimum internet speeds, but, the truth is that, as network infrastructures improve across the world and faster internet speeds become available to more people, this method of game delivery may, in fact, become more popular.\nRELATED: No Nvidia, Gaming Laptops Won't Be More Popular Than PlayStation 5 & Xbox Series X\nWhile those who already have gigabit internet speeds and beefy gaming PCs aren't likely to see the appeal of such methods, gaming newcomers with recently-upgraded internet may see GeForce Now as a more approachable, affordable alternative, and this could well lead to the service's widespread success. \n3 \n\n                            Fail: Doesn't Support All Games\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia may boast that GeForce Now is compatible with hundreds of games, but the fact remains that some consumers will be turned away because the service doesn't support absolutely everything. From extremely niche indie titles to AAA titles removed from the service by competing publishers, fear of missing out may play a factor in some gamers' decision to forgo a GeForce now subscription.\nof course, this will always be an issue for Cloud Streaming platforms, and limiting gamers' digital libraries is a definite problem. Still, Nvidia's offerings far exceed most of the competition, and only time will tell how impactful these problems will be. \n2 \n\n                            Succeed: Name Recognition\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough they aren't known for games so much as they are for gaming hardware, the fact remains that Nvidia is a recognizable brand name, and that could mean the difference between success and failure in GeForce Now's early stages. With big-name competitors like Microsoft and Google in the mix, it would be tough for a brand-new startup to get off the ground.\nThat's not to say that some smaller companies like Shadow and Rainway haven't been making waves in the game streaming space, but, to best out some of the gaming scene's heaviest hitters, it would be best for a streaming service to be tied to an established brand. \n1 \n\n                            Fail: Target Audience\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother major hurdle for game streaming stems from the fact that many gamers aren't likely to give up their consoles or dedicated gaming rigs any time soon. Those who've already invested hundreds or thousands of dollars in the hobby aren't likely to ditch it all in favor of a new streaming service, and it seems that GeForce Now should do better were it targeted toward a more casual audience.\nIt may not seem like an issue for newcomers, but it's difficult to envision hardcore PC gamers paying a monthly fee for the privilege of playing some of their games on a TV or tablet in the living room.\nNEXT: Activision Blizzard Just Pulled All Its Games From Nvidia GeForce Now \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLists\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tKingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Player Drops Hundreds Of Jester Outfits To Turn Kuttenberg Into A Circus\n\t\t\n\n\nKingdom Come: Deliverance 2\n\nThere's clown fever going on across Kuttenberg.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSilent Hill Isn't Just A Town, It's A State Of Mind\n\t\t\n\n\nSilent Hill f\n\nKonami is bringing back the survival horror icon with a distinctly Japanese twist. \n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 day ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tFinal Fantasy 14 Is Getting A Black Mage Rework, And Fans Already Hate It\n\t\t\n\n\nFinal Fantasy 14\n\nA black mage rework is on the way, and Final Fantasy 14 fans are already bracing themselves.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThe Sims 1: All Deaths, Ranked\n\t\t\n\n\nTriple-A Games\n\nRest in peace, no matter how you've gone.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSplit Fiction Works Because Nobody Actually Thinks Like The Main Characters\n\t\t\n\n\nSplit Fiction\n\nFortunately for Hazelight, people can like both sci-fi AND fantasy.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPokemon's Paw Pod Collection Includes A Reasonably Priced Life Size Pawmi Plush\n\t\t\n\nOr Pokedex-Size since that's the term Pokemon appears to be using now.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tShao Kahn's Design In Mortal Kombat 2 Revealed, Fans Divided\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMonster Hunter Wilds' Success Has Nothing To Do With Storytelling\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSteam Gets Second Game In As Many Months That Adds Malware To Your PC\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin Our Team\nOur Audience\nAbout Us\nPress & Events\nContact Us\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertising\nCareers\nTerms\nPrivacy\nPolicies\n\n\nTheGamer is part of the\n                            Valnet Publishing Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Copyright \u00a9 2025 Valnet Inc.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

After removing all its Activision-Blizzard titles, the Nvidia streaming platform has shrunk even further. While GeForce Now's most recent loss is not its worst, the situation surrounding this latest game's departure has raised questions over how Nvidia built the platform's original library of over a thousand games. \nThe Long Dark\u00a0was added to the GeForce Now streaming service for customer use. However, this inclusion was not done with the developer's consent. Between this incident and Bethesda's\u00a0withdrawal announcement from the platform, several questions should be raised regarding Nvidia's ability to secure rights for certain video game titles.\nRELATED:\u00a0The Last of Us 2: Is Joel a Villain?\nAccording to a Twitter thread by developer Raphael van Lierop, he and Hinterland Studio both\u00a0discovered that\u00a0The Long Dark was being used without permission, and immediately asked for its removal from the platform. Van Lierop apologized to disappointed fans, while explaining that Nvidia had already apologized for its error and asked to keep\u00a0The Long Dark\u00a0on GeForce Now. The developer had declined, stating that it had a right to control where its\u00a0titles existed, and that any complaints should be brought to Nvidia, and not itself. \n\n\n\n\nFrom the developer's account, Nvidia's use of the game does seem like an honest mistake. However, this mistake has led to severe fan backlash. In the thread's replies, Twitter users lashed out at van Lierop, claiming that the license they had purchased on GeForce entitled them to the game. To make matters worse,\u00a0The Long Dark is only the latest in a string of removals that have continued despite promises that there would be \"fewer\" game removals going forward.\nUltimately, GeForce Now's survival depends on player willingness to stick with the program as it develops further and gains more legitimate titles. However, despite the latest setbacks, Nvidia appears to have some hope. Cyberpunk 2077 will launch on GeForce Now simultaneously with other platforms. If it performs well, this game might help revitalize the service. Until it arrives, GeForce Now will be searching for another way to stand out from the growing competition.\nMORE:\u00a0The Origins of Resident Evil 3's Hunter Gamma\nSource: Raphael van Lierop \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming News\n\n\n\n\nPC Gaming\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tKingdom Come: Deliverance 2\u2019s Commitment to Authenticity Helps its Narrative Beats Stick the Landing\n\t\t\n\n\nKingdom Come: Deliverance II\n\nSince Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 relies so heavily on realism and authenticity, it ultimately means players are forced to sit with their choices.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nJosh Cotts\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAssassin's Creed Shadows: Best Early Game Weapons for Naoe\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nChristopher Norman Worcester\n\n\n50 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tOne Piece: The Traitor In The Blackbeard Pirates, Explained\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nHaider Haroon Rasheed\n\n\n5 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHow to Unlock More Resolve Upgrades and Slots in Reignbreaker\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nMuhit Rahman\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHow to Get A Ranged Weapon for Yasuke in Assassin's Creed Shadows\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nChristopher Norman Worcester\n\n\n1 hour ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSave $300 on Samsung's 55-inch QLED 4K TV, Hitting Record-Low Price of Under $500 on Amazon\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nMatti Robinson\n\n\n40 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAssassin's Creed Shadows: Where to Find All Eight Kabukimono \n\t\t\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Shadows\n\nA complete guide to locating all eight Kabukimono in Assassin's Creed Shadows. \n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tReignbreaker: All Status Effects, Explained (Bleed, Stun, Root, and Coat)\n\t\t\n\n\nReignbreaker\n\nStatus effects in Reignbreaker will give you an edge against your enemies if you learn to use them.

This time, they've failed to ask Hinterland Studio to include their game The Long Dark in the library. In return, Hinterland have asked for it to be removed from the service. This follows several other games being removed from GeForce Now, with some publishers pulling their entire catalog.\n\nAccording to The Long Dark's director\u00a0Raphael van Lierop, Nvidia apologized for the lack of communication and asked if Hinterland would like to keep The Long Dark on the streaming platform. Hinterland declined.Previously, Bethesda removed nearly all their games from GeForce Now. Activision Blizzard removed theirs due to a \"misunderstanding\" between them and Nvidia. They aren't the only ones either. After the beta period of Nvidia's service ended,\u00a0Capcom, Konami, Rockstar, and Square Enix all declined to make their games available in the full release of the streaming library.\nIf nothing else, it seems Nvidia have a handful of business wrinkles to smooth out with their service. You do need to already own a game before you can stream it, but developers and publishers may have any number of reasons to not want their games played on hardware it wasn't intended for, planned ports to other devices being just one possibility.\nFrom Nvidia's blog post when Bethesda withdrew their games, they feel they've got something to offer that developers will return to the service for. \"Ultimately, they maintain control over their content and decide whether the game you purchase includes streaming on GeForce Now. Meanwhile, others will bring games back as they continue to realize GeForce Now\u2019s value,\" Nvidia say. Hinterland's complaint seems largely to be with not being asked. As Nvidia say, perhaps they'll reconsider in the future, though the failure to communicate isn't a great look if developers are supposed to be opting in by choice.\nKatharine recently rounded up what you need to know about all the latest streaming services out there and found GeForce Now to have some potential but a fussy interface. They've got a bit more than that to sort out if they're to be charging players for priority access to their cloud service.\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            The Long Dark is getting a Cheat Death system, but don't worry, it's also getting a Misery Mode and cougars\n          \n\n\n\n            April's Game Pass leavers include Life Is Strange: True Colors and The Long Dark\n          \n\n\n\n            The Long Dark's expansion pass trailer shows its mysterious new region\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLauren Morton: Lauren was a freelance news writer for RPS between 2019 and 2021, writing news during evening hours.

Since its release many new cards have seen the light of day. A new iteration of Turing-based cards for gaming laptops appear to be around the corner, namely the RTX 2070 Super and the RTX 2080 Super. A leaked internal slide from Nvidia now shows the performance of the newcomers compared to the last generation GPUs.\nAccording to the leaked slide, via PCGamesN, the new Super GPUs appear to be about 50% faster than their non-Super counterparts. The leaked slide compares the RTX 2070 Super and the\u00a0RTX\u00a02080\u00a0Super against the previous generations GPUs \u2013 all except the RTX 2080. The speculation is that RTX 2080 likely performs similarly to the RTX 2070 Super and is therefore removed from the comparison.\n\nIf Nvidia is following form\u00a0with its desktop\u00a0cards, the RTX 2070 Super will use the same\u00a0TU104 chip\u00a0as the RTX 2080. This would also suggest that the RTX 2070 Super performs in line with the RTX 2080. According to the leaked slide the RTX 2080 Super is about 50% faster than the RTX 2070 Super. PCGamesN also suggested that previous leaks indicated that the 2080 Super has a TGP of more than 150W, which would explain how the improved performance.\n\n\n\nAccording to PCGamesN, the leaked information seems to be a part of a kit going out to laptop manufacturers. This could mean that the new cards will be released very soon, which is in line with previous speculations that the cards will reach the market this Spring.\n\nThe performance test aggregates data from the games Control,\u00a0Wolfenstein: Youngblood and Deliver Us The Moon. The games were run with max settings at 1080p, using a system with a 10th generation Intel Core H-series CPU and 16GB RAM. Windows 10 was used as the operating system.\nDiscuss on our Facebook page HERE.\n\nKitGuru says: Are you already using a Nvidia RTX mobile GPU?

In a post on the company's forum, a staff member has revealed that NVIDIA will start removing 2K games from the streaming service today. 2K's most popular franchises include Borderlands, Civilization, BioShock and XCOM. The staff members didn't elaborate on the situation, only telling forum posters that the games' removal was \"per publisher request\" and that the company is working with 2K to \"re-enable [its] games in the future.\"GeForce Now's library suffered one tremendous blow after another almost as soon as the service came out of beta. Activision Blizzard pulled its games just a few days after it went public, because it apparently wanted a commercial agreement with NVIDIA. Shortly after that, Skyrim developer Bethesda followed suit.NVIDIA didn't release an official statement this time around, but when Bethesda exited, GeForce Now general manager Phil Eisler said:\"As we approach a paid service, some publishers may choose to remove games before the trial period ends. Ultimately, they maintain control over their content and decide whether the game you purchase includes streaming on GeForce NOW. Meanwhile, others will bring games back as they continue to realize GeForce NOW's value (stay tuned for more on that).As the transition period comes to completion, game removals should be few and far between, with new games added to GeForce NOW each week.\"If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

Could this be a simple misprint (seemingly unlikely from an EEC listing), or will there be yet another variant of the RTX 2060 on the market soon?\n\n\u201cThe new versions of the RTX 2060 8GB have popped up in a new EEC listing posted to the database by Asus yesterday. It lists three different cards, all variations on the same ROG Strix RTX 2060 EVO theme. One is the standard EVO 8GB card, the next is a slightly overclocked EVO 8GB Advanced Edition, and the last one the full-fat EVO 8GB OC edition.\u201d\n\n \n\n\nImage via PCGamesN\nNVIDIA\u2019s Year of Aggressive GPU Moves\nThe only constant in the video card arena is change, and in the last year NVIDIA has been changing things about as much as possible. Just when the Turing lineup seemed complete after the RTX 2060\u2019s introduction (on 1/7/19), the company introduced the GTX 16 Series (beginning with the GTX 1660 Ti on 2/22/19) and then the RTX SUPER series arrived (on 7/2/19) just in time throw a wrench (and higher performance) into the mix as AMD\u2019s Navi launched last July.\nSince then we have seen the SUPER series extend from the RTX 2060, 2070, and 2080 to the GTX 1660 as well, and watched as the RTX 2060 dropped as low as $279 to compete with AMD\u2019s newest Navi GPU (RX 5600 XT). Competition has been much better in the last year, and GPU price/performance has been improving as a result.\nWhile unofficial (it\u2019s not even on VideoCardz!) the report of a new 8GB variant of the RTX 2060 is both logical and puzzling. Logical because the RTX 2060 is based on the same TU106 GPU as the original RTX 2070, which features 8GB of GDDR6 memory. This could be a simple re-branding or a slightly different configuration. But wait! Didn\u2019t we already have this with the RTX 2060 SUPER?\n \n\n\nIf an 8GB variant of the RTX 2060 comes out, does this render the 2060 SUPER irrelevant? Would that GPU reach EOL, or would it continue to exist in an 8GB RTX 2060 future alongside the original 6GB RTX 2060 \u2013 which is still being sold along with the faster 8GB RTX 2060 SUPER at a more competitive price point?\nThis gets confusing pretty fast, but then again the existence of the GTX 1660 SUPER at $229 when the $279 GTX 1660 Ti is only marginally faster is confusing already. I\u2019m confused just writing that sentence.\n \n \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVideo News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviousCooler Master MasterMouse MM711, A Trypophobes Nightmare \n\nNextAMD Introduces Ryzen 9 4900H Mobile Gaming Processor \n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\n\n\n \n\nSebastian Peak\nEditor-in-Chief at PC Perspective.

Let's check what it's all about in detail.\n\nRelated Story NVIDIA Releases New Game Ready Driver for RTX 5070 and Fragpunk (Which Has DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation)\nDLSS 2.0 Features\n\u25cf Superior Image Quality - DLSS 2.0 offers native resolution image quality using half the pixels. It employs new temporal accumulation techniques for sharper image details and improved stability from frame to frame.\n\u25cf Customizable Options - DLSS 2.0 offers users 3 image quality modes (Quality, Balanced, Performance) that control render resolution, with Performance mode now enabling up to a 4X super resolution.\n\u25cf Great Scaling Across All RTX GPUs and Resolutions - a new, faster AI model more efficiently uses Tensor Cores to execute 2X faster than the original, improving frame rates and removing restrictions on supported GPUs, settings, and resolutions.\n\u25cf One Network for All Games - While the original DLSS required per-game training, DLSS 2.0 offers a generalized AI network that removes the need to train for each specific game. This means faster game integrations and more DLSS titles.\nDeveloper Quotes\nRuss Bullock, President at Piranha Games:\nNVIDIA DLSS 2.0 basically gives our players a free performance boost, without sacrificing image quality. It was also super easy to implement with NVIDIA\u2019s new SDK, so it was a no brainer for us to add it to MechWarrior 5.\nMika Vehkala, Director of Technology at Remedy Entertainment:\nWith Control, we set out to create a visually stunning and immersive world. Real-time ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS made Control look amazing at launch, and upgrading to DLSS 2.0 made the game\u2019s image quality better than ever.\nKoen Deetman, CEO and Game Director at KeokeN Interactive:\nWe never expected the image quality in Deliver Us The Moon to increase when DLSS was enabled, but that is exactly what we experienced. This coupled with real-time ray tracing, and the huge performance boost from DLSS, gives our players the ultimate Deliver Us The Moon experience without any compromises.\nJim Kjellin, CTO at MachineGames:\nIt was critically important to us that our game standout both visually and from a performance perspective. Adding NVIDIA DLSS enabled us to get the best of both worlds, maximum performance with incredible image quality.\nFirst of all, the improved AI network is now using Tensor Cores in a more efficient way, which makes it much faster - about twice as fast, in fact. The performance tradeoff of DLSS 1.0 at low resolutions wasn't good, but the DLSS 2.0 network makes it a lot more viable across a wide range of GPUs and resolutions.\nSecondly, while first-generation DLSS targeted a 2x boost in pixels, DLSS 2.0 can go up to 4x, effectively delivering a reconstructed 4K image from a base 1080p image. It also benefits from temporal feedback, accumulating data over time and using multiple frames and motion vectors to generate the output frame. This results in higher quality, as the network itself has more data that is temporally processed, and it also allows higher scaling.\n\nArguably the most interesting feature is the latter, though, as the new 'fully synthetic training set' won't require to be trained specifically for each game implementing Deep Learning Super Sampling. Not only is this going to translate in much faster adoption among developers, but it is also important because a lot of games are not 'deterministic', meaning that two runs of an identical scene aren't exactly the same. This meant some of those generated frames weren't actually valid for training purposes, making it harder to get valid training data for DLSS.\nAlongside the DLSS 2.0 architectural improvements, NVIDIA also confirmed two new games that are getting the feature (in addition to Wolfenstein Youngblood and Deliver Us The Moon, who already used the latest DLSS version): Control, where Remedy is updating the entire game from DLSS 1.0 to 2.0, and MechWarrior 5 which is getting DLSS for the first time. MechWarrior 5 is an Unreal Engine 4 game and NVIDIA revealed there's now a DLSS 2.0 UE4 branch available for game developers, which should make it even easier for integration.\nLet's check one example of Remedy's game first. While Control's original DLSS implementation was widely praised as possibly the best when the game launched last August, the newest version of Deep Learning Super Sampling can greatly improve quality in certain cases, such as objects in motion as you can see with the fan below.\n\nNow, you might be wondering why Control is running slightly slower in this DLSS 2.0 example (69 FPS against 71). The reason is that the previous DLSS version featured in Remedy's game wasn't actually using a neural network, it was running on shaders in a way that's more akin to a clever use of temporal anti-aliasing upscaling (TAAU), as revealed by NVIDIA's Tony Tomasi during the presentation.\nKeep in mind, though, that DLSS 2.0 comes with three different presets (Quality, Balanced, and Performance). The Performance mode, according to Tamasi, will now provide higher performance than the previous DLSS implementation featured in Control while yielding equal or slightly better image quality. As we've reported some time ago, Control is getting an expansion called The Foundation on Thursday, March 26th, and that's when DLSS 2.0 is coming to the game.\nMechWarrior 5: Mercenaries, on the other hand, didn't have Deep Learning Super Sampling at all at launch, which means RTX owners can now enjoy a substantial performance boost once the update goes live (later today) in this game. In the image below, activating DLSS yields a 33% performance increase at 1440P resolution while using an RTX 2060 graphics card.\n\nEven more impressive is the zoomed version of the same image, though. DLSS 2.0, at least in its Quality Mode, provides a sharper image than that of the native resolution particularly if you look at the railings. According to Tamasi, that makes sense as the image reconstructed via DLSS 2.0 actually has more data than the native one, after accumulating data over time before the reconstruction and having fixed the temporal stability issues of the first version of DLSS.\nThat is not to say Deep Learning Super Sampling will always offer better image quality than native, but it does happen in certain cases.\n\nOnce the presentation was over, we asked Tamasi whether NVIDIA considered using Microsoft's DirectML API for Deep Learning Super Sampling or if it would be simply redundant. Here's what he had to say about that:\nWe did consider that. It is redundant since have essentially a direct path to the Tensor Cores in the GPU, so there'd be no advantage to us to making use of DirectML. That's not to say we might never do that, but at least right now the plan is to handle this natively through the Tensor Cores and our own API.\nNVIDIA DLSS 2.0 wasn't all that the briefing was about, anyway. We also learned that beyond the official Vulkan ray tracing extension, based on the extension originally developed by NVIDIA, a new scalable RTX Global Illumination SDK is now available for developers. This was actually a highly requested feature among studios and it will allow them to use their existing light baking/light probes approach to Global Illumination to then scale it with the same workflow and integration up to raytracing.\nLast but not least, Epic's Unreal Engine 4.25 update is also coming soon with fully integrated support for Microsoft's DirectX Raytracing API. Developers could use pre-release branches with DXR before, of course, but this will be the full mainline integration of DXR in UE4.\nOf course, this is all in addition to the previous DirectX 12 Ultimate news where NVIDIA confirmed all RTX graphics cards (of which 15 million units have been sold to date) to fully support the features of the updated API, such as DXR 1.1, VRS, Mesh Shaders and Sampler Feedback. Exciting times indeed, as developers will have more and better tools to deliver high-end optimized graphics in their games.\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation Can Be Enabled for The First Berserker: Khazan Demo\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS Swapper Gets A Huge Update: FSR 3.1 & XeSS Added Along With Tons of New Options\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA May Aim For Up To 16 Generated Frames With Multi-Frame Generation Tech In Future DLSS Technology\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS Boss Doesn\u2019t Rule Out Possible Frame Generation Support for RTX 30 Series\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n159\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n95\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n69\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n54\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

In the U.K. alone, about 300,000 tests are carried out daily by pathologists.\nBut there\u2019s an acute personnel shortage, globally. In the U.S., there are only 5.7 pathologists for every 100,000 people. By 2030, this number is expected to drop to 3.7. In the U.K., a survey by the Royal College of Pathology showed that only 3 percent of histopathology departments had enough staff to meet demand. In some parts of Africa, there is only one pathologist for every 1.5 million people.\nWhile pathologists are under increasing pressure to analyze as many samples as possible, patients are having to endure lengthy wait times to get their results.\nAiforia, a member of the NVIDIA Inception startup accelerator program, has created a set of AI-based tools to speed and improve pathology workflows \u2014 and a lot more.\nThe company, which has offices in Helsinki and Cambridge, Mass., enables tedious tasks to be automated and for complex challenges to be solved by unveiling quantitative data from tissue samples.\nThis helps pathologists overcome common obstacles to the development of versatile, scalable processes for medical research, drug development and diagnostics.\n\u201cToday we can already support pathologists with AI-assisted analysis, but AI can do so much more than that,\u201d said Kaisa Helminen, CEO of Aiforia. \u201cWith deep learning AI, we are able to extract more information from a patient tissue sample than what\u2019s been previously possible due to limitations of the human eye.\n\u201cThis way, we are able to promote new discoveries from morphological patterns and facilitate more accurate and more personalized treatment for the patient,\u201d she said.\nHidden Figures\nAI has made it possible to automate medical imaging tasks that have traditionally proved nearly impossible for the human eye to handle. And it can reveal information that was previously hidden in image data.\nWith Aiforia\u2019s AI tool assisting the diagnostic process, pathologists can improve the efficiency, accuracy and reproducibility of their results.\nIts cloud-based deep learning image analysis platform, Aiforia Create, allows for the rapid development of AI-powered image analysis algorithms, initially optimized for digital pathology applications.\nAiforia initially developed its platform with a focus on cancer, as well as neurological, infectious and lifestyle diseases, but is now expanding it to other medical imaging domains.\nFor those who want to develop algorithms for a specific task, Aiforia Create provides domain experts with unique self-service AI development tools.\nAiforia trains its image analysis AI models using convolutional neural networks on NVIDIA GPUs. These networks are able to learn, detect and quantify specific features of interest in medical images generated by microscope scanners, X-rays, MRI or CT scans.\nIts users can upload a handful of medical images at a time to the platform, which uses active learning techniques to increase the efficiency of annotating images for AI training.\nUsers don\u2019t need to invest in local hardware or software \u2014 instead they can access the software services via an online platform, hosted on Microsoft Azure. The platform can be deployed instantly and scales up easily.\nUnpacking Parkinson\u2019s\nAiforia\u2019s tools are also being used to improve the diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease, a debilitating neurological condition affecting around one in 500 people.\nThe disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in a part of the brain called the substantia nigra. This loss causes a reduction in dopamine, a chemical that helps regulate the movement of the body.\nResearchers are working to uncover what causes the loss of nerve cells in the first place. Doing this requires collecting unbiased estimates of brain cell (neuron) numbers, but this process is extremely labor-intensive, time-consuming and prone to human error.\nhttps://vimeo.com/291054606\nUniversity of Helsinki researchers collaborated with Aiforia to mitigate the challenges of traditional methods to count neurons. Brain histology images were uploaded to Aiforia Hub, then they deployed the Aiforia Create tool to quantify the number of dopamine neurons in the samples.\nIntroducing the computerized counting of neurons improves the reproducibility of results, reduces the impact of human error and makes analysis more efficient.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been studied so many times that if you send the same microscope slide to five different pathologists, you get different results,\u201d Helminen said. \u201cUsing AI can help bring consistency and reproducibility, where AI is acting as a tireless assistant or like a \u2018second opinion\u2019 for the expert.\u201d\nThe study carried out at the University of Helsinki would typically have taken weeks or even months without AI. Using Aiforia\u2019s tools, the research team was able to achieve a 99 percent speed increase, freeing up their time to further their work into finding a cure for Parkinson\u2019s.\nAiforia Create is sold with a research use status and is not intended for diagnostic procedures. \n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | NVIDIA in Europe | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"
